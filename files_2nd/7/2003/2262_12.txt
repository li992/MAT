Operating review Introduction The Groups results are prepared under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP and comply with UK Companies Act requirements.
While the UK GAAP reporting basis provides the core information for users of this report and accounts to understand the financial performance of the Group, management believes that users will be assisted in understanding the performance relative to previous periods by presenting the results in an alternative manner.
This presentation isolates the impact of currency movements from year to year and eliminates the impact of exceptional or non-recurring items.
It is also the basis used by management to review performance of the business and is a component of variable compensation plans.
The elements of this alternative presentation are described in more detail below.
Impact of currency movements The Group has operations in some 50 countries around the world and the majority of its profit is generated outside the UK.
Results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange against sterling for the year.
Changes in such rates from year to year can significantly affect the Groups results when these are presented in pounds sterling.
In some cases, such changes may make it difficult to understand underlying business performance trends without providing additional information.
For example, the average value of the South African rand to pounds sterling changed by 15 per cent in 2003 compared with 2002.
When looking at the financial performance of the Afrox hospitals business segment in 2003, it is therefore important to highlight this currency impact to users of the information.
Consequently, management has for many years monitored business performance on a constant currencybasis.
This basis eliminates the impact of changes in the rates of exchange used to translate the results of overseas businesses into sterling by retranslating the results of the comparative year at the rates of exchange used in the current year.
This is the basis for all internal management reporting throughout the year.
In this operating review, the comparison of financial performance between years may in places be referred to as on this constant currencybasis.
Comments on all segmental performance are on a constant currency basis.
The impact of changes in the rates of exchange used to translate the results of overseas businesses into sterling is shown in the table below.
This enables users of the information to have a better understanding of underlying business performance.
Examples of such items in 2003 include a litigation settlement expense, the costs of the business initiative programme announced in August 2001, other restructuring programmes and charges relating to the integration of OSK BOCs gases business in Japan and part of the Air Liquide business in Japan to form Japan Air Gases.
Additionally in 2002 there were charges in connection with the formation of the Linde BOC Process Plants business and a write-down in the value of the net assets of OSK ahead of the merger with part of Air Liquide Japan.
Exceptional items include those items classified as both operating and non-operating under UK GAAP.
31 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 Operating review continued The review of results excluding exceptional items is part of the normal internal management reporting process.
The growth in operating profit excluding exceptional items is also one of the measures used in the variable element of the senior management compensation scheme.
Further information regarding the business initiative programme, which is now largely complete, as well as the other exceptional items is given in the financial review on page 46.
An analysis of all operating and non-operating exceptional items is given in note 2 b to the financial statements on page 83.
In this review, the adjustments to eliminate exceptional items have been made to operating profit both Group and by segment, profit before tax and earnings per share.
Exceptional items are commented on in the Group results section as well as in the individual business segments to which they relate.
A reconciliation of these adjusted items to the equivalent UK GAAP measure is shown in the profit and loss account on page 72.
When any results or measures used in this review have been adjusted to exclude exceptional items, they are referred to as adjusted.
Within the individual business segments of the operating review, operating exceptional items are commented on separately.
Comments on other aspects of financial trends and performance are based on adjusted operating profit.
This provides more meaningful comment on underlying business performance.
A reconciliation of adjusted operating profit to operating profit is given in the table below.

Adjusted return on capital employed removes exceptional items from the measure of operating profit used in the calculation.
Adjusted return on capital employed is used by management for reasons similar to those described above.
A reconciliation of these two measures is shown below.
2003 2002 2001 Average Average Average Operating capital Operating capital Operating capital profit employed ROCE profit employed ROCE profit employed ROCE million million % million million % million million % Adjusted ROCE 505.6 4,053.4 12.5 500.1 4,053.8 12.3 530.6 4,108.2 12.9 Operating exceptional items 67.0 74.5 108.3 ROCE 438.6 4,053.4 10.8 425.6 4,053.8 10.5 422.3 4,108.2 10.3 1.
ROCE is operating profit as a percentage of the average capital employed excluding net pension liabilities.
The Group commentary in this review also comments on free cash flow.
Free cash flow is a measure often referred to by BOC management and other users of financial information to highlight the cash flow available from underlying ongoing business operations before acquisition and disposal activity.
Whether or not this remains positive over time is an indicator that dividends to shareholders are being paid out of cash generated by existing Group businesses.
As such it is a useful additional measure of financial performance.
A reconciliation of this measure to the nearest equivalent UK GAAP measure, net cash flow, is shown below.
2003 2002 2001 million million million Free cash flow 141.8 166.5 192.3 Exceptional cash items 28.3 67.3 51.8 Acquisitions and disposals 118.3 215.5 133.6 Other items within capital expenditure and financial investment: Purchases of intangible fixed assets 1.2 0.1 0.3 Net sales purchases of current asset investments 16.6 4.3 6.5 Purchases of trade and other investments 10.8 19.7 10.2 Sales of trade and other investments 6.5 11.5 7.8 Net cash inflow outflow before use of liquid resources and financing 6.3 120.3 2.3 32 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 Operating review comparing 2003 with 2002 Turnover Group Turnover including the Group share of joint ventures and associates was 4,323.2 million in 2003, up eight per cent million compared with 4,017.9 million in 2002.
Operating profit was 438.6 million, up three per cent compared with 425.6 million in 2002.
After charging operating and non-operating exceptional items totalling 67.0 million and net 5,000 interest and other financing items of 86.7 million, profit before tax was 351.9 million, up five per cent compared with 4,000 335.3 million in 2002.
Earnings per share were 44.5p, up seven per cent compared with 41.4p in 2002.
Excluding the 3,000 exceptional items, adjusted operating profit for the year was 505.6 million, adjusted profit before tax was 418.9 million and adjusted earnings per share were 52.9p.
2,000 Comparisons with 2002 are affected by exchange rate movements.
For the currencies that principally affect the 1,000 Groups results, movements in the Australian dollar and the South African rand were favourable and movements in the US dollar and Japanese yen were adverse.
If the results of a year ago had been translated at the rates applied to 0 01 02 03 this year, turnover would have been reduced by 39.0 million.
There would have been an increase in operating profit of 0.8 million and adjusted operating profit would have been unchanged.
Adjusted profit before tax would have been 5.3 million higher and adjusted earnings per share would have been increased by 0.3p.
Profit before tax The table set out below summarises results reported both under UK GAAP and as adjusted.
Results for 2002 million are shown both as reported in that year and on a constant currency basis.
A reconciliation of turnover, operating profit and adjusted operating profit for 2002 at 2002 and at 2003 rates of exchange is shown on page 31.
A reconciliation of adjusted results with UK GAAP results is shown on page 32 and in the profit and loss account on page 72.
Exceptional items in 2003 amounted to a charge of 67.0 million.
The charge comprises 43.2 million for a litigation settlement, costs of 15.5 million for completion of restructuring programmes and 8.3 million relating to the integration of the BOC and Air Liquide businesses in Japan.
Exceptional items in 2002 included restructuring charges of 47.2 million and a 21.3 million charge relating to the closure of facilities in connection with the combination of BOC Process Plants with Linde Engineering in the US.
An exceptional charge of 21.2 million was made to write down the value of OSK, BOCs gases business in Japan, in advance of the then proposed merger of OSK with part of Air Liquide Japan.
Adjusted return on capital employed for the year to 30 September 2003 was 12.5 per cent.
Return on capital employed for the year to 30 September 2003 was 10.8 per cent.
Free cash flow as defined on page 32 remained positive and was 141.8 million in 2003.
Net cash flow, after acquisitions, disposals and other investing activities, and including exceptional cash items, was 6.3 million in 2003.
A reconciliation of these measures is shown on page 32.
A first interim dividend for 2003 of 15.5p per share was paid in February 2003 and a second interim dividend of 23.5p per share was paid in August 2003.
In aggregate this was a 2.6 per cent increase over the annual dividend of the previous year.
A first interim dividend for 2004 of 15.5 p per share has been declared for payment in February 2004.
Capital expenditure by subsidiaries including interest capitalised was 281.2 million in 2003, compared with 354.3 million in 2002.
Capital expenditure by joint ventures and associates was 81.4 million in 2003, of which the BOC share was 36.1 million.
Equivalent expenditure in 2002 was 74.2 million, of which the BOC share was 34.5 million.
The Group also made acquisitions of businesses of 135.5 million in 2003 and proceeds from disposals were 3.9 million.
Equivalent items in 2002 were 207.3 million and 10.6 million respectively.

All comments below are on a constant currency basis.
Increased turnover resulted from generally firm price trends as well as revenues from acquisitions and new plants serving chemical industry customers.
The additional revenues came principally from BOCs joint venture with Yangtze Petrochemical Corporation YPC at Nanjing, China, from a new hydrogen and carbon monoxide HyCO plant at Map Ta Phut, Thailand and from the acquisitions of a partial oxydation syngas plant at Clear Lake, Texas, and the US water services company, Environmental Management Corporation.
Improved adjusted operating profit was also a result of operational efficiency gains.
The closure of facilities in connection with the combination of BOCs Process Plants business with Linde Engineering in the US led to lower costs towards the end of 2002 and there was a full year of savings in 2003.
There were also further cost reductions arising from continued progress in delivery scheduling and remote plant operation.
33 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 Operating review comparing 2003 with 2002 continued As in 2002, economic uncertainties constrained the authorisation of investment projects by customers during the year.
A new hydrogen and carbon monoxide HyCO plant serving Citgos oil refinery at Lemont in Illinois came into production in October 2003 and a new air separation plant is under construction in Nanjing.
When completed in 2004 this will supply industrial gases to nearby chemical facilities being completed by a joint venture company established between BASF of Germany and the Chinese chemical company YPC.
Operating exceptional items in 2003 were for the completion of restructuring programmes, including those that were part of the programme announced in August 2001.
Additionally, there were charges relating to the integration of the BOC and Air Liquide businesses in Japan to form Japan Air Gases.
Europe Turnover and adjusted operating profit increased in the UK and in Poland but declined slightly in Ireland.
A full year of revenues from the plant commissioned in January 2002 to supply hydrogen to Huntsman on Teesside and from the Teesside pipeline system acquired in July 2002 were contributors to increased turnover in the UK.
Despite continued weakness in UK manufacturing, sales volumes increased in the merchant market for liquefied gases and prices were also slightly firmer.
The key factors behind the increase in adjusted operating profit were lower costs in 2003 as a result of restructuring and a charge of 3.6 million in 2002 for an asset write down and debt provision after a steel customer went into receivership.
The relocation of some customers and a general decline in manufacturing activity led to lower sales volumes and adjusted operating profit in Ireland.
As in the UK, the trend of selling prices remained positive and marginally ahead of inflation.
Business in Poland benefited from stable economic conditions in anticipation of joining the European Union in 2004.
The acquisition of the business of Praxair Polska took effect in February 2003 and added additional air separation capacity as well as BOCs first source of carbon dioxide in the region.
Cryostar is BOCs engineering company based in France, manufacturing cryogenic pumps, expansion turbines and compressors for a variety of industrial gas applications and for marine liquefied natural gas LNG tankers.
Turnover and adjusted operating profit increased in 2003 as a result of strong demand for industrial gas applications in China and for shipboard expansion units on LNG tankers.
North America Despite a small increase in turnover, adjusted operating profit in 2003 was at a similar level to 2002.
Selling price trends were favourable particularly in the second half of the year and were sufficient to offset cost inflation.
Sales volumes were lower as a result of general weakness in manufacturing industries and some business was lost early in 2003 as customers changed to alternative supplies.
At the same time, a significant volume of new liquefied gas business was obtained, mainly in the closing months of the year.
Steel industry customers that had benefited from US tariff protection in the previous year faced renewed competitive pressure in 2003.
Some customers are operating under chapter 11 creditor protection.
Carbon dioxide for beverage applications continued to be in strong demand.
During 2003 BOC improved analytical capabilities to upgrade product quality assurance for its Premier Beverage carbon dioxide service to the soft drinks industry.
At the end of January 2003, BOC acquired the partial oxidation syngas plant at Clear Lake, Texas, from Celanese.
Under the agreement BOC fulfils a significant proportion of the industrial gas requirements for the Celanese chemical facility at Clear Lake.
The Celanese facility is located on the Houston ship canal, and includes a world scale vinyl acetate monomer plant and the worlds largest acetic acid plant.
These require large quantities of oxygen and nitrogen as well as carbon monoxide.
A new HyCO plant serving Citgos oil refinery at Lemont in Illinois began production in October 2003.
This further expands BOCs hydrogen business with a variety of petroleum and chemical industry customers around the world.
Latin America Turnover increased significantly, although growth was held back by a general strike in Venezuela in the period December 2002 to February 2003.
This inevitably affected  for industrial gases.
Adjusted operating profit also increased because of better sales volumes especially in Chile and Brazil and because of selling price increases that generally exceeded local rates of inflation.
BOCs joint venture company in Mexico supplying high-pressure pure nitrogen to Pemex for pressurising its Cantarell oilfield in the Gulf of Mexico performed steadily throughout the year.
In September 2003, a new 200 tonnes-a-day air separation unit was commissioned in Santiago to supply oxygen for leaching copper ores.
Another plant is due to begin production in 2004 and will supply oxygen for CST, a steel producer in Brazil.
Africa Both turnover and adjusted operating profit increased in 2003.
Sales volumes were broadly similar but selling prices were higher and cost controls also contributed to better margins.
The focus of business development was on the use of gases in mineral processes in the extraction of precious metals.
JapanThe combination of BOCs and Air Liquides industrial and medical gases businesses in Japan took effect from January 2003.
Until then the results of OSK, BOCs gases business in Japan, were consolidated as a subsidiary.
Subsequently BOC has accounted for its share of turnover and profit of the merged company, Japan Air Gases, on an equity basis.
This distorts the comparison of turnover and profit between 2003 and earlier years for BOCs three lines of business.
On the respective bases used in each year, there was an increase in both turnover and adjusted operating profit for PGS in Japan for 2003.
The integration process that began in 2003 made good progress.
The two organisations have been successfully integrated in the key areas and the number of branch offices has been reduced.
Cryogenic equipment manufacturing has also been integrated into a single location.
As a result of the merger, management remains confident of achieving cost savings at the annual rate of some Japanese yen 5 billion by the end of 2004.
34 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 North Asia Turnover and adjusted operating profit were up significantly in 2003.
Margins improved as a result of better operational efficiency coupled with some price increases.
Turnover gains were largely as a result of growth in north China but there was also growth in mainland south China, Korea and Taiwan.
Turnover was down in Hong Kong as some customers relocated production to mainland China.
Underlying growth of adjusted operating profit in south China was further boosted by additional profit arising from the renegotiation of a power supply contract.
Results in north China benefited from the addition for a full year of the joint venture begun in May 2002 serving the petrochemical industry in Nanjing.
Further liquefaction capacity was added to its existing air separation plant during 2003 to serve the local merchant market.
Results also benefited from strong growth in the steel industry as a result of increasing local demand.
In October 2003 BOC announced that its joint venture with the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Corporation TISCO, was to build two new air separation units ASUs to supply a total of 2,700 tonnes a day of oxygen to TISCOs plant in Shanxi province in north-central China.
The new ASUs are expected to come on stream at the end of 2005.
TISCO is the largest stainless steel producer in China and has been selected by the central government as one of two stainless steel development centres.
Further investments at BOCs subsidiaries at Suzhou near Shanghai and plans to add some 400 tonnes a day of capacity at its associated company Pearl River Gases in southern China were also announced.
A new air separation plant is already under construction for BOCs joint venture in Nanjing.
When completed in 2004 this plant will supply gases to the BASF and Yangtze Petrochemical Company YPC joint venture chemical facility under construction nearby.
South East Asia Economic growth was generally buoyant across the region but Singapore continued to be affected by the migration of electronics and other industries to lower cost countries in Asia.
The outbreak of the SARS infection also curtailed travel and affected business activity.
Economic trends in Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia were favourable.
In aggregate, both turnover and adjusted operating profit increased across the region.
Margins improved as a result of operational efficiency gains.
Prices were held down by competitive pressures in Malaysia and Thailand but improved in Indonesia and the Philippines.
Tonnage volumes increased in Malaysia as a result of sales to the steel industry and growing demand from the electronics assembly and food-freezing industries.
Turnover was also boosted by a full year contribution from Nissan Industrial Oxygen Inc NIOI which became fully owned by BOCs associated company in Malaysia during September 2002.
Increased turnover in Thailand was based on better underlying demand as well as increased production.
A new hydrogen and carbon monoxide HyCO plant began production at Map Ta Phut during 2003 and carbon dioxide capacity was doubled with the addition of a new 300 tonnes-a-day plant at Rayong to serve food and beverage customers.
Underlying trends were favourable in both Indonesia and the Philippines but results in the Philippines were adversely affected by the closure of a customers plant.
South Asia Economic growth in India led to better sales of liquefied gases in the merchant market and sustained demand from the steel industry.
A new 225 tonnes-a-day oxygen plant was commissioned in the last quarter of the year for the Tata Iron and Steel Company, BOCs principal tonnage customer in the region.
During the early part of 2004, a new plant should begin to supply beverage industry customers in Pakistan with carbon dioxide.
South Pacific Turnover and adjusted operating profit were slightly higher than a year ago despite adverse business trends in some Australian industries.
The strengthening of the Australian dollar in 2003 had a negative impact on the important minerals sector, which responded by restructuring.
There was also an adverse effect on the food industry.
Volumes of liquefied gas sales in the merchant market were therefore lower.
The Australian steel industry was somewhat less affected and a low cost base enabled it to remain globally competitive.
New business has been obtained with BHP in New South Wales.
In January 2003 BOC commenced supplying additional oxygen and nitrogen, following a process upgrade to BOCs Port Kembla facility.
Improved operational efficiencies helped to improve margins in the merchant market.
Centralised plant operation was further extended during 2003 to the control of plants in New Zealand from an operations centre in Australia.
Prices were raised in the merchant market and further increases will be required in 2004 to offset increased electricity costs that have resulted from the further rationalisation of generating capacity ownership.
Process systems During 2003 BOC continued to benefit from lower costs arising from the combination of its Process Plants business with Linde Engineering in the US to form the new company, Linde BOC Process Plants LLC, based in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
This transaction was completed at the end of September 2002, making Linde Engineering the principal supplier of BOCs industrial gas plants worldwide with access to Lindes global technical capabilities in air separation, hydrogen production and other gas technologies.
2003 was another year of low demand for new industrial gas facilities.
This was particularly so in the developed western economies and business opportunities were principally in the developing economies of the Far East.
The rapid pace of expansion in the Chinese steel and chemical industries is expected to offer further opportunities to BOC next year.
Water services In October 2002, BOC acquired Environmental Management Corporation EMC, a US water services company with the intention of using a similar business model to that of PGS in developing additional business with industrial customers.
EMC is a management company providing services for steam systems, cold and chilled water systems and wastewater treatment.
Customers include small to medium sized municipalities and industrial customers, many of which are in the food manufacturing sector.
Turnover was on an increasing trend in 2003.
Integration of the business was achieved smoothly but initial integration costs made the business unprofitable in this first period under BOC ownership.
35 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 Operating review comparing 2003 with 2002 continued Industrial and Special Products ISP Change 1 on 2002 2003 Change constant million on 2002 currency Turnover 1,751.2 9% 9% Operating profit 238.2 4% 3% 2 Adjusted operating profit 242.7 -2% -3% 1.
Good business performances in most markets were offset by a disappointing result in the US.
Market conditions remained depressed in the US and in the UK but there was an overall improvement elsewhere.
Trends were particularly favourable in South Africa and in the south Pacific region during the first half of 2003 but the pace of growth slowed later in the year as a result of exchange rate movements, which affected exporting industries.
BOCs helium business continued to grow globally and so did the packaged chemicals business and the sales of medical gases.
Margins improved in the liquefied petroleum gas LPG markets as a result of more rapid selling price adjustments to reflect changing input costs.
In June 2003, BOC announced an agreement to obtain half the output from a new helium extraction facility to be constructed in Qatar.
Deliveries from this new source are expected to begin in July 2005 and the location will assist in satisfying fast-growing demand in Asian markets.
EuropeTurnover and adjusted operating profit increased in 2003 despite weak manufacturing activity in the key markets.
BOC has a strong market position in the mature UK manufacturing sector and achieved turnover growth by extending the range of products and services offered to its customers.
Growth of adjusted operating profit was also assisted by productivity improvements, control of costs and favourable price trends.
Sales to the medical sector increased because of service improvements and the introduction of new products notably lightweight portable cylinders for emergency applications.
Sales of special gases including helium also increased and a new contract to supply the needs of Oxford Magnet Technology for medical imaging devices was announced during 2003.
Sales of Sureflow hospitality gases and equipment improved, as did sales of refrigerant gases.
Economic growth in Ireland slowed during 2003.
Despite improved hospitality product sales, turnover was almost unchanged and adjusted operating profit was marginally lower.
Increased turnover and adjusted operating profit in Poland were principally because of the addition of the business of Praxair Polska that took effect from February 2003.
The integration with BOCs existing business in Poland and the introduction of common business systems has proceeded smoothly.
Price increases in Poland were adequate to recover cost inflation during 2003.
North America In total, sales of gases in 2003 were similar to the previous year but sales of welding products were depressed.
Weak conditions in the manufacturing economy across north America coupled with costs related to the implementation of a new business system in the US led to a sharp decline in adjusted operating profit.
Increased volumes of LPG and of special gases, including helium, together with modest price increases for most products were sufficient to offset lower volumes of industrial gases leading to a marginal improvement in gases turnover in the US.
Market conditions were also difficult in Canada but the acquisition of business from Air Products in Canada led to a higher turnover and adjusted operating profit.
Latin America There was an improvement in both turnover and adjusted operating profit across the region.
This was generally based on trends that were favourable in terms of both volumes and selling prices.
Despite extended unrest and political uncertainly, there was a particularly strong performance in Venezuela.
BOCs associated company based in Chile also achieved good growth.
Business in Colombia was expanded during 2003 with the acquisition of an LPG business.
Turnover from respiratory homecare products grew in Colombia, where a local homecare company was acquired during the year, as well as in Chile, where an acquisition was made in the previous year.
Africa Turnover and adjusted operating profit again increased significantly in 2003, as manufacturing activity was strong in South Africa.
Although economic growth moderated later in the year as the rand strengthened, the increased international investment in manufacturing in South Africa continued to provide a firm base for sales of gases and welding products.
The mining industry also provided good business opportunities.
There was a significant expansion of platinum mining and ferro-chrome was also in strong demand.
Production of the Afrox Res-Q-Pak was further increased in 2003 as demand for the product continued to accelerate.
Several of the major mining companies are issuing this device to their workforce to provide an emergency oxygen supply for those working underground.
Exports of Afrox welding products started the year well but growth was later curtailed by the strengthening of the rand, which began to reduce the competitive advantage.
LPG sales increased and margins improved as a result of lower input costs.
Results from other countries in Africa were somewhat mixed with good performances in Namibia and Kenya offset by weakness in the Zambian copper industry.
Overall, results were not significantly different in 2003.
36 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 JapanThe basis of accounting for BOCs business in Japan changed during 2003 as a result of a merger.
Full details can be seen in the PGS section on page 34.
On the respective bases used in each year, turnover and adjusted operating profit for ISP in Japan were lower in 2003.
East Asia Turnover increased but adjusted operating profit was marginally lower in 2003, with the full year benefit of acquisitions being reduced by the effect of industrial decline in the key market of Hong Kong and also by the increase in business overheads to support the future development of business in the region.
Two acquisitions affected business performance comparisons in 2003.
Unique Gas and Petrochemicals Public Company Limited UGP was acquired by BOCs subsidiary in Thailand in May 2002 and BOCs associated company in Malaysia took full control of Nissan Industrial Oxygen Inc NIOI in September 2002.
The integration of NIOI proceeded smoothly during 2003 and the business performed well.
Although up on the previous year, results from UGP were adversely affected by sharply competitive conditions in the ammonia business but LPG, which is the other main product line for UGP, improved due to partial deregulation of end consumer prices.
While competition remained strong in industrial products, especially in Thailand and Malaysia, investments in special products facilities enabled this more profitable business to be expanded.
Facilities for breaking bulk and repackaging refrigerant gases have already been installed in Hong Kong, the Philippines and Malaysia and a further facility will be built in Thailand during 2004.
South Pacific Although economic growth was less rapid in 2003 than it was in 2002, both turnover and adjusted operating profit improved.
Increased turnover was largely a result of better prices rather than increased sales volume and firm prices were coupled with effective cost controls.
Good progress was made in developing the safety products business in 2003 with significant new business from major customers.
The medical gas business also benefited from the introduction of new products.
A web-based customer portal was launched enabling customers to carry out transactions as well as to track and pay their accounts over the Internet.
BOCs joint venture company, Elgas, a leading supplier of LPG in the eastern part of Australia, enjoyed a record year.
Sharp increases in costs before the Iraq war were successfully recovered by rapid adjustments to selling prices.
Although automobile gas is a minor part of the companys turnover, sales may be affected in the longer term by the Australian governments decision to remove the excise tax exemption for this application in the period 2008 to 2012.
After difficult conditions in 2002, better results were obtained from Papua New Guinea and the other Pacific islands during 2003.

Compares with a loss of 2.2 million in 2002 Operating exceptional items in 2003 were for the completion of restructuring programmes, including those that were part of the programme announced in August 2001.
The semiconductor equipment downturn that affected most of 2002 continued throughout 2003.
The second half of 2002 had benefited from some improvement in activity but this proved transient and no such upturn was repeated in 2003. Business was concentrated with those manufacturers with a specific investment strategy.
This was predominantly for upgrades and expansions of existing facilities rather than new plants.
Demand for general vacuum products from key customers in the chemicals, aerospace and automotive industries was also weaker in 2003.
Turnover and adjusted operating profit were therefore lower.
The impact of these adverse business conditions was lessened by rationalising manufacturing facilities and by careful control of costs.
Industrial vacuum and pressure products manufacturing in Philadelphia, Bolton and the Czech Republic was rationalised.
Also in 2003, the size of a facility in Massachusetts was reduced to suit the lower volume of business available.
The pharmaceutical freeze-drying and packaging business suffered from delayed investment by pharmaceutical manufacturers during 2003 but order intake has since improved.
Semiconductor gases turnover was essentially unchanged in 2003 as a whole, despite an improving trend in the second half.
Additional volumes from new business were offset by pressure on prices as competition became more severe during the second year of the downturn.
The focus was therefore on retaining market share, winning new business in Asia and on product development.
Management believes that a major share of the bulk gas business has been secured for the new semiconductor fabrication plants being built in China.
Production of nitrogen trifluoride has been increased and fluorine generators remain under evaluation by leading semiconductor manufacturers.
The basis of accounting for BOCs business in Japan changed during 2003 as a result of a merger.
On the respective bases used in each year, turnover and adjusted operating profit for BOC Edwards in Japan increased in 2003.
37 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 Operating review comparing 2003 with 2002 continued Vacuum equipment volumes worldwide were slightly better in 2003 and much of the increase was derived from products for flat panel display manufacture.
Management believes that BOC Edwards has achieved a leading share of this fast-growing market particularly in Taiwan and Korea.
However, these pumps currently earn lower margins than semiconductor pumping systems.
Although semiconductor equipment demand was weak in 2003, improved products were developed to strengthen BOC Edwardsposition in vacuum technology.
These included single axis on-tool semiconductor pumps and a range of small dry pumps for the growing scientific equipment market.
The Kachina process tool component cleaning service grew in 2003 but the chemical management business suffered from the small number of new semiconductor plants being built.
Cost levels were reduced to improve financial performance.
Contracts were won in Asia and Europe furthering a strategy to expand the range of value-added services to electronic manufacturers.
These include gases management, chemicals supply, support services and materials logistics.
Other developments included an improved offering of gases and vacuum systems for lithography and supercritical carbon dioxide cleaning technology.
Afrox hospitals Change 1 on 2002 2003 Change constant million on 2002 currency Turnover 353.4 36% 16% Operating profit 46.1 55% 31% 2 Adjusted operating profit 46.1 55% 31% 1.
Although hospital occupancy rates increased only marginally, turnover and adjusted operating profit both increased significantly.
This resulted from some minor acquisitions, positive price trends and a reduction in overhead costs.
New facilities continued to be added to existing hospitals in order to widen the range of available services.
There was a significant change in the reimbursement system during 2003 and the trend is expected to continue in 2004.
Insurance companies had previously paid private health care providers such as Afrox hospitals a fee for their services but this is changing to a risk reimbursement system.
A fixed payment is made for each kind of procedure thus transferring some financial risk to the provider if complications arise.
Although acute care hospitals continued to make up the great majority of both turnover and adjusted operating profit, there were better results from the Lifecare chronic care business, from occupational health services and from the Direct Medicines pharmacy services business following restructuring to address more competitive market conditions.
In July 2003 African Oxygen Limited Afrox announced that it was in the process of considering its strategic options with regard to its shareholding in Afrox Healthcare Limited.
On 17 November 2003, Afrox announced that it had agreed to sell its entire holding in Afrox Healthcare Limited to a consortium of Black Economic Empowerment investors.
The sale remains subject to certain conditions including clearance from the relevant competition and other regulatory authorities.
Gist Change 1 on 2002 2003 Change constant million on 2002 currency Turnover 291.8 10% 10% Operating profit 29.2 15% 13% 2 Adjusted operating profit 29.2 15% 13% 1.
Improved turnover reflects both new contracts and increased volumes with existing customers.
The increase in adjusted operating profit is not only as a result of higher turnover but also because of a gain of some 4.1 million arising principally from the termination of operations for the Marks & Spencer General Merchandise business.
Gist continues to operate all of Marks & Spencers chilled and ambient food distribution and services and remains its largest supply chain provider.
In 2003, a contract with Carlsberg-Tetley, a leading brewer, was expanded to manage the entire primary transport distribution business.
A contract to manage the international inbound supply chain was also secured with New Look, the UK high street fashion retailer.
38 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 Operating review comparing 2002 with 2001 Group Turnover including the Group share of joint ventures and associates was 4,017.9 million in 2002, down three per cent compared with 4,159.2 million in 2001.
Operating profit was 425.6 million, up one per cent compared with 422.3 million in 2001.
After charging operating and non-operating exceptional items totalling 94.7 million and net interest and other financing items of 70.1 million, profit before tax was 335.3 million, down seven per cent compared with 362.2 million in 2001.
Earnings per share were 41.4p, down ten per cent compared with 46.0p in 2001.
Excluding the exceptional items, adjusted operating profit for the year was 500.1 million, adjusted profit before tax was 430.0 million and adjusted earnings per share were 55.9p.
Year ago comparisons are adversely affected by exchange rate movements, mainly for the South African rand and, in the closing months of the year, for the US dollar.
If the results of a year ago had been translated at the rates applied to this year, turnover would have been reduced by 214.1 million.
The corresponding reductions in operating profit and adjusted operating profit would have been 25.1 million and 27.6 million respectively.
Adjusted profit before tax would have been 22.7 million less and adjusted earnings per share would have been reduced by 1.7p.
The table set out below summarises results reported both under UK GAAP and as adjusted.
Comparisons with the previous year are shown both as reported in that year and on a constant currency basis.
2001 at 2002 1 2002 2001 exchange rates Turnover including share of joint ventures and associates million 4,017.9 4,159.2 3,945.1 Operating profit million 425.6 422.3 397.2 2 Adjusted operating profit million 500.1 530.6 503.0 Profit before tax million 335.3 362.2 340.7 2 Adjusted profit before tax million 430.0 466.9 444.2 Earnings per share 41.4p 46.0p 44.4p 2 Adjusted earnings per share 55.9p 57.5p 55.8p 1.
A reconciliation of turnover, operating profit and adjusted operating profit for 2001 at 2001 and at 2002 rates of exchange is shown on page 31.
Exceptional items in 2001 included restructuring charges of 35.8 million, a charge of 24.5 million for the write-down and impairment of assets, a charge of 21.0 million for the write-down of unproductive assets identified for disposal and a charge of 16.7 million for a prior period amendment to pension plan benefits.
Adjusted return on capital employed for the year to 30 September 2002 was 12.3 per cent, after six successive quarters of improvement.
Return on capital employed for the year to 30 September 2002 was 10.5 per cent.
Free cash flow after interest, tax, dividends and capital spending but before acquisitions remained positive and was 166.5 million in 2002.
Net cash outflow, after acquisitions, disposals and other investing activities, and including exceptional cash items, was 120.3 million in 2002.
A first interim dividend for 2002 of 15.5p per share was paid in February 2002 and a second interim dividend of 22.5p per share was paid in August 2002.
In aggregate this was a 2.7 per cent increase over the annual dividend of the previous year.
Capital expenditure by subsidiaries including interest capitalised was 354.3 million in 2002, compared with 352.6 million in 2001.
Capital expenditure by joint ventures and associates was 74.2 million in 2002, of which the BOC share was 34.5 million.
Equivalent expenditure in 2001 was 109.7 million, of which the BOC share was 53.3 million.
The Group also made acquisitions of businesses of 207.3 million in 2002 and proceeds from disposals were 10.6 million.
Equivalent items in 2001 were 145.9 million and 2.7 million respectively.

A reconciliation of results for 2001 at 2001 and at 2002 rates of exchange is shown on page 31.
In addition to the revenues added by new plants coming into production and firm pricing trends, operational efficiency gains were a key factor behind the adjusted operating profit increase.
Towards the end of 2002, cost savings were realised from the closure of facilities in connection with the combination of BOCs Process Plants business with Linde Engineering in the US.
Costs were also reduced as a result of better delivery scheduling and remote plant operation.
Operational service centres were already established in the UK, the US and Australia.
Management then believed that a further 70 plants could benefit from remote operation during the next 18 months and new links were being established to bring Asian plants into the network.
39 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 Operating review comparing 2002 with 2001 continued New plants were commissioned for OneSteel at Whyalla in South Australia in November 2001, a hydrogen plant for Huntsman on Teesside in the UK during January 2002, an air separation unit for WCI Steel in Ohio in May 2002 and another at Midland, North Carolina in June 2002.
These further strengthened BOCs established base in the metals sector and highlighted a growing commitment to the chemicals and oil sectors.
Economic uncertainties reduced the number of investment projects receiving authorisation from customers in 2002.
However, despite the somewhat dull market conditions BOC Process Systems was able to win new business by offering integrated solutions that added value for process industry customers.
Operating exceptional items in 2002 were mainly for the write-down of assets in the OSK business in Japan based on valuations ahead of the merger with Air Liquide and further restructuring costs as part of the programme announced in August 2001.
Operating exceptional items in 2001 related to the business initiative programme announced in August 2001 with the objective of releasing cash tied up in unproductive assets and improving cash generation.
Europe Turnover increased in the UK but adjusted operating profit was marginally lower despite success in reducing overhead costs.
The increase in turnover was due to additional sales from the plant commissioned in January 2002 to supply hydrogen to Huntsmans chemical plant on Teesside but this was offset by the effect of weak manufacturing output in the UK.
This affected sales volumes and prices in most sectors as some customers closed plants in the UK and moved production to lower cost areas.
Adjusted operating profit was also depressed by a temporary shutdown of a customers steel furnace, leading to less efficient operation of BOCs air separation plant in south Wales.
Another steel customer went into receivership towards the end of 2002 and a provision of 3.6 million was made for a bad debt and to write down the value of BOCs plant supplying a facility that has closed.
In July BOC acquired pipeline assets serving customers on the Teesside chemical complex.
This gave BOC more direct contact with its customers in this important area.
Although turnover in Ireland was similar to the previous year, adjusted operating profit increased as a result of success in reducing costs.
Adjusted operating profit also increased in Poland for the same reason and because a bad debt provision depressed adjusted operating profit in 2001.
North America Overall turnover increased slightly but growth was restrained by generally weak economic conditions in the US and by lower power and fuel costs leading to the reduction or elimination of surcharges.
Some increases in tonnage volumes arising from the recovery of steel output in the US and increased sales of carbon dioxide to the food and beverage sector were offset by generally lower demand for liquefied gases in the merchant market.
Adjusted operating profit grew faster than sales as a result of firmer prices and cost savings, which more than made up for some bad debt provisions for customers in liquidation.
New plant and acquisitions that affected the comparison with a year ago included a replacement plant commissioned in May 2002 to supply WCI Steel in Ohio, a plant commissioned in September 2002 at Midland, North Carolina, and a plant supplying Vitrotex in Texas that started up in July 2002.
Assets purchased from Messer increased BOCs capacity to supply the growing market for carbon dioxide in the US.
Latin America Despite continuing political uncertainty, BOCs business in Venezuela achieved significantly better adjusted operating profit in 2002.
Demand from the glass industry was strong and sales of both nitrogen and carbon dioxide to the food and beverage sector also increased.
More efficient plant operation coupled with control of overhead costs made an important contribution to adjusted operating profit growth in 2002.
Adjusted operating profit in Colombia was also better as a result of improved operating efficiency coupled with better activity in the steel industry.
Indura, BOCs associate based in Chile, also achieved a better adjusted operating profit as a result of new business in both Chile and in Argentina.
Selling price increases that exceeded inflation also made an important contribution to adjusted operating profit growth in Chile.
BOCs associated company in Mexico supplying a Pemex company with high-pressure nitrogen continued to demonstrate the value of re-pressurisation to enhance oil recovery.
A number of equipment problems that emerged after commissioning were investigated and corrective action was taken in 2002.
This had no significant impact on the adjusted operating profit for the year.
BOC increased its share of the company from 30 per cent to 35 per cent in early 2002.
Africa Buoyant conditions in the South African manufacturing economy made it possible to achieve a significant increase in turnover.
Together with strict cost controls, this drove a still greater increase in adjusted operating profit.
Demand from steel industry customers was high and sales to other sectors were expanded.
New business was obtained in the pulp and paper sector and an oxygen plant was commissioned to satisfy a supply scheme contract.
Price increases were sufficient to offset inflation in 2002.
Japan Turnover and adjusted operating profit were lower in 2002, reflecting continued weakness in the Japanese economy, which affected both gas equipment sales and demand for liquefied gases.
The impact on adjusted operating profit was limited by operational cost savings.
During 2002 BOCs under-utilised air separation unit at Himeji was closed and BOC began to supply its customers by purchasing products from another gas producer.
Despite the weak economic conditions, three new on-site generators were commissioned in 2002 and a further one is due to be completed in 2003.
40 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 North Asia Growth of sales revenues in Korea was limited by weak economic conditions but adjusted operating profit was significantly better as a result of operational and overhead cost savings and improved plant efficiency.
Rapid economic growth attracted exceptionally high levels of foreign direct investment into China during 2002.
A number of manufacturers began to expand in China at the expense of existing production in other parts of the world.
This was accompanied by heavy expenditure on local infrastructure and these factors combined to create a particularly favourable environment for BOCs business in China.
Turnover increased significantly and adjusted operating profit nearly doubled.
Existing joint ventures performed strongly partly in response to rising steel production, which boosted the performance of BOCs venture supplying the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company in north China.
At the same time BOC took the opportunity to withdraw from underperforming joint ventures and succeeded in improving the performance of others.
New liquefaction capacity was added to supply the growing merchant market in south China.
In April 2002, BOC established a joint venture in Nanjing with Yangtze Petrochemical Corporation YPC, which is a subsidiary of Sinopec, Chinas leading petrochemical company.
BOC purchased existing air separation assets with effect from May 2002 and committed to installing a new air separation plant.
This gave BOC a strategic position as a key supplier in the Nanjing area, which is being developed through foreign investment as a leading centre for chemical production in China.
BOCs joint venture is to supply industrial gases to a new BASF and YPC joint venture plant now under construction and scheduled to begin production in 2004.
In order to take advantage of the new business opportunities presented by the rapid growth of investment in China, BOC Process Systems designated China as a new and separate marketing zone during 2002.
Taiwan was one of the main regions to be affected by the diversion of investment into mainland China during 2002.
Manufacturing growth was weak, leading to a more competitive environment in the gases business and some pressure on prices.
In response to these structural changes in the Taiwanese economy, a cost reduction programme was initiated during 2002.
Activity related to the electronics industry increased somewhat during the second half of 2002. Business conditions in Hong Kong remained weak in 2002 as some customers also prepared to relocate production to lower cost areas.
South East Asia Economic growth in the region was led by Thailand, supported by somewhat slower growth in Malaysia.
Singapore suffered from the slowdown in the electronics sector during 2002.
Economic conditions in the Philippines and Indonesia remained difficult.
There was some improvement in demand from the steel sector and petrochemical activity remained stable.
Direct foreign investment, which had supported growth previously, was diminished as more new investment was directed towards north Asia.
Improved turnover and adjusted operating profit were driven mainly by increased merchant sales in Thailand particularly in the food sector.
During 2002 BOC was able to supply its customers with food freezing equipment constructed to BOC standards by a manufacturer in Thailand.
A new hydrogen and carbon monoxide HyCO plant was under construction at Map Ta Phut in Thailand.
BOCs associated company in Malaysia acquired Nissan Industrial Oxygen Inc NIOI during 2002.
The acquisition began with the purchase of 35.6 per cent of the company in March 2002.
Following a tender offer, 100 per cent ownership was achieved in September 2002.
NIOI has significant business in the glass sector.
BOCs associated company in Singapore acquired part of Messers merchant industrial gases business there in late September 2002.
South Asia BOCs line of business structure was not then fully implemented in this region.
The following commentary therefore applies to both the Process Gas Solutions business and to the smaller element of Industrial and Special Products business in the region.
During 2002, concerns about security and political stability continued to limit foreign direct investment.
Business opportunities were therefore limited to those generated by the local economies.
In India, asset disposals contributed towards a sharp increase in adjusted operating profit but there was also a significant improvement in underlying sales and adjusted operating profit.
A new supply scheme to provide industrial gases to Tata Iron and Steel was won and the new plant was constructed in 2003.
Sales and adjusted operating profits also increased in Bangladesh and Pakistan.
New carbon dioxide capacity was added in 2003 to satisfy growing demand from the beverage industry in Pakistan.
South Pacific Recent investments in new plants were reflected in higher sales.
The plant commissioned to supply BP at Brisbane came into production during 2001 and contributed for a full year in 2002.
A plant to supply OneSteel at Whyalla in South Australia began production early in 2002.
Increased customer demand following a process change resulted in increased sales from the plant at Port Kembla that came into production during 1999.
Demand for carbon dioxide used in the food and beverage industries grew and increased awareness of food safety issues placed additional emphasis on product quality.
Plant investments made during 2001 provided additional product supply security in 2002.
Adjusted operating profit increased significantly faster than sales as a result of improved operating efficiency and control of overhead costs.
Plant reliability was increased and 12 of the key production plants in Australia became controlled from a central operations centre.
In South Australia, production from the new plant at Whyalla commissioned in November 2001 allowed savings to be achieved through the closure of an older and less efficient plant at Adelaide.
Price increases in the merchant markets for liquefied gases were generally slightly below inflation but the shortfall was more than offset by operational efficiencies and overhead cost reductions.
41 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 Operating review comparing 2002 with 2001 continued Process Plants In March 2002, BOC reached a master agreement to combine its Process Plants business with Linde Engineering in the US to form a new company, Linde BOC Process Plants LLC, based in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
The transaction was completed at the end of September 2002 and makes Linde Engineering the principal supplier of BOCs industrial gas plants worldwide with access to Lindes global technical capabilities in air separation, hydrogen production and other gas technologies.
Spending on new air separation plants remained generally depressed in 2002 but the new arrangement with Linde allowed a significant reduction of unrecovered costs in the second half of the year as the agreement was implemented.
Costs were also reduced by the closure of BOC Process PlantsUK manufacturing facility at Edmonton in north London.
BOCs Cryostar turbine and compressor business based in France produced significantly better adjusted operating profit in 2002 following diversification to reduce its former dependence on investments in new air separation projects.
Sales of equipment to process liquefied natural gas LNG on board tankers were significantly increased.
Industrial and Special Products ISP Change 1 on 2001 2002 Change constant million on 2001 currency Turnover 1,605.3 2% 7% Operating profit 229.3 1% 6% 2 Adjusted operating profit 248.0 Nil 5% 1.
Weak manufacturing activity in the key markets of the US and the UK affected sales of industrial products but there was growth in both South Africa and in the south Pacific region.
Sales of special products, medical gases as well as hospitality products and services increased in all markets.
Margins improved mainly as a result of increased productivity following restructuring.
Europe A modest improvement in UK turnover was matched by a similar increase in adjusted operating profit.
Sales of industrial products declined in line with falling manufacturing output but this was offset by increased sales of special and medical gases and the growth of BOCs Sureflow hospitality gases and cellar service business.
A lightweight medical oxygen cylinder with integral regulator has proved popular for portable applications such as in the emergency services.
A new arrangement has been made with an equipment wholesaler to improve sales of refrigerant gases to the contractor market and a refrigerant filling plant in the UK is being extended to include additional production and storage capacity.
Sales and adjusted operating profit also increased in Ireland and BOCs commercial systems accommodated the change to the new euro currency without problems.
Although ISP was a minor part of BOCs business in Poland during 2002, there was a significant improvement in sales and adjusted operating profit.
In September BOC announced that it had agreed to acquire Praxairs industrial gases business in Poland.
This transaction then remained subject to approval by the competition authority in Poland.
This approval was subsequently granted in 2003.
North America Turnover increased only slightly as the trend in overall sales volumes was essentially flat and price increases for most products were modest.
Weakness in the manufacturing sector was reflected in lower sales of welding and cutting equipment and consumable products in particular.
In such conditions and with the initial financial impact of installing a new enterprise resource and planning system during the year, adjusted operating profit in north America decreased despite successful cost reduction programmes.
Helium prices were an exception to the generally slow trend and continued to rise more rapidly as higher input costs were recovered in selling prices.
BOC invested in new purification and liquefaction capacity in the US during 2002 to support its worldwide helium business.
During the year a new plant was opened to supply special gases to customers on the Gulf coast and a range of gas apparatus was launched under the Airco brand name.
These products were sold through distributors during 2003.
During 2002, BOC continued its roll-out of a medical gas cylinder with an integrated regulator.
Although economic conditions in Canada were similar to those in the US, there was a greater increase in sales.
Two acquisitions, Technogas and Matheson Gas Products Canada Inc, were successfully integrated with the existing business in Canada in 2002.
The Matheson acquisition added important special products capability to BOCs product range in Canada.
42 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 Latin America Turnover and adjusted operating profit increased significantly in each of the key markets.
While exportrelated heavy industry prospered, general manufacturing remained weak in Venezuela but growth was driven by increased sales of special products and carbon dioxide.
While sales of special products, including refrigerants and ammonia, also increased in Colombia, the main source of growth was the medical gas and home health care markets in an otherwise difficult industrial economy.
Indura, BOCs associated company based in Chile, benefited from a stable political environment that served to insulate the Chilean economy from heavy devaluations in neighbouring Argentina and Brazil.
This led to a firm pricing environment that allowed the benefits of cost controls to be realised.
Africa Turnover and adjusted operating profit increased significantly in 2002 as a result of a sustained resurgence in South African manufacturing.
This was reflected in the growth of sales volumes in the core cutting and welding business for the first time in five years.
New business in packaged chemicals and other special gases further increased the growth of turnover as new propellants and refrigerants were added to the product range.
Adjusted operating profit also increased significantly despite making additional provisions for bad debts.
Sales volumes of liquefied petroleum gas grew slowly but higher input costs were successfully recovered in selling prices.
Hospitality products and services, and medical gases were also less important sources of sales growth in 2002.
However, a recently introduced rescue pack providing a portable oxygen supply for mineworkers continued to generate strong demand, which exceeded production capacity.
Exports of cutting and welding equipment from South Africa principally to other African countries increased strongly in 2002.
Japan During 2002 difficult economic conditions were reflected in essentially unchanged turnover and a decline in adjusted operating profit.
This was despite good growth in gases for applications in lasers, medical gases and measurement equipment.
East Asia Turnover and adjusted operating profit both increased but mainly as a result of acquisitions.
Economic growth in Taiwan and Singapore was curtailed by their dependence on various aspects of electronics manufacturing, which remained depressed in 2002, particularly during the first half.
Weak demand also restrained price increases, which were generally below the level of inflation.
The chief source of turnover and adjusted operating profit growth in the region during 2002 was the acquisition of Unique Gas and Petrochemicals Public Company Limited UGP in Thailand in May.
UGP is a leading supplier of liquefied petroleum gas and packaged ammonia.
BOCs associated company in Malaysia acquired 35.6 per cent of the gases company Nissan Industrial Oxygen Inc in March 2002 and, following a tender offer, the holding was increased to 100 per cent in September 2002 providing a wider platform for growth in 2003.
South Pacific Strong economic and manufacturing growth supported increased sales and adjusted operating profit in the key markets of Australia and New Zealand.
The underlying growth of adjusted operating profit was ahead of the sales increase.
Civil turmoil and political uncertainty curtailed growth in the Pacific islands.
Increased manufacturing activity particularly in Australia but also in New Zealand supported growth in every part of BOCs business.
Mining, manufacturing for export and infrastructure projects were particularly strong sectors.
Prices remained firm and overhead cost reduction, coupled with rationalisation of the supply chain for welding and safety products, helped to widen margins.
The sales and adjusted operating profit of BOCs associated company, Elgas, which supplies liquefied petroleum gas LPG in south-eastern Australia, increased sharply.
Imported LPG prices remained stable and a relatively cold winter encouraged sales in the home energy sector.
The use of LPG as a vehicle fuel declined.
BOC Edwards Change 1 on 2001 2002 Change constant million on 2001 currency Turnover 688.2 -21% -19% Operating profit 1.4 -102% -102% 2 Adjusted operating profit 26.1 -67% -66% 1.
Despite the reduction in adjusted operating profit for the year, BOC Edwards remained profitable in each quarter and was strongly cash generative during 2002.
The severe reduction in capital expenditure by semiconductor manufacturers that began in the second half of 2001 continued into 2002.
Although there was some revival of demand for semiconductor equipment in the second half of 2002, the rate of order intake declined at the end of the year.
43 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 Operating review comparing 2002 with 2001 continued Those Asian markets that were the basis of the mid-year revival did not sustain the earlier investment trends but opportunities were presented by a number of customers investing in China.
In August 2002 BOC formed a joint venture with Lienhwa Corporation of Taiwan to help to take advantage of new business opportunities presented by Taiwanese electronics companies investing in China.
The venture combined the marketing capabilities of Lienhwa with BOCs existing resources in China.
It delivered three new gas supply contracts to supply semiconductor fabrication plants, including those under construction by Belling and HJT in the Shanghai area.
BOC Edwards also won an order to supply a new plant in Singapore.
Apart from the semiconductor industry, some other vacuum equipment markets such as aerospace and chemicals also became more difficult in 2002.
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets remained buoyant and BOC Edwards was notably successful in increasing sales of pharmaceutical drying and packaging systems.
Gases sales were also affected by weak conditions in the semiconductor industry worldwide, which led to reduced plant utilisation and closures by some customers.
The overall profit impact of lost revenue on adjusted operating profit was offset by increased productivity.
In 2002 a programme to rationalise production facilities for electronic materials was completed.
This involved the closure of electronic gases facilities at some sites, including Immingham in the UK and part of the facility at Research Triangle Park in North Carolina, in order to concentrate global production into fewer locations.
The capacity to produce nitrogen trifluoride at BOCs plant in South Africa was increased during 2002 to reach 50 tonnes a year.
This product, which is used for cleaning semiconductor process tool chambers, is undergoing qualification trials with major customers.
It will be possible to raise output further if it is justified by demand.
The pause in semiconductor capacity expansion did not prevent a drive by manufacturers to invest in projects designed to reduce unit costs.
Typically this included outsourcing of major sub-systems, materials and services.
BOC Edwards participated in this movement through the development of several important new products, through its close relationships with original equipment manufacturers and by acquisitions in new business areas.
During 2002 the Kachina process tool component cleaning business was expanded by opening new facilities to service customers in the US Oregon, France and China.
In 2002 BOC Edwards acquired the industrial vacuum and pressure businesses of the Smiths Group.
This acquisition expanded BOC Edwardsexisting general vacuum product range into new markets and added new high volume pumping technology to the portfolio.
Typical customers are in the metallurgy, water treatment, food, power and chemical industries.
The integration of the business was completed smoothly and it was operating profitably by the end of the year.
The most significant acquisition was of Seiko  pumps business based in Japan, which was completed in March 2002.
Management believes that the addition of Seiko turbomolecular pumps to the BOC Edwards range of products should enhance the opportunity to develop vacuum sub-systems to satisfy the growing trend towards on-tool pumping.
The acquisitions of Hydromatix and Semco were also completed in January and April 2002 respectively with the intention of positioning BOC Edwards in those market segments that are expected to grow most rapidly.
These companies now form part of BOC EdwardsChemical Management Division.
Hydromatix is based in the US and helps companies in the surface finishing industry to recycle rinse waters with a minimum amount of waste, allowing them to cut discharges.
Customers are involved in plating, printed circuit boards and galvanising, as well as higher-technology fields such as disc and semiconductor production.
Semco designs and manufactures high efficiency, process-critical, liquid chemical blend, delivery and collection systems used in rapidly growing wet deposition processes, such as copper plating, a common application in the semiconductor manufacturing industry.
44 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 Afrox hospitals Change 1 on 2001 2002 Change constant million on 2001 currency Turnover 259.0 -10% 23% Operating profit 29.7 -8% 25% 2 Adjusted operating profit 29.7 -8% 25% 1.
The acquisitions of the Amahosp and Wilgers hospital groups in the first half of 2002 added to turnover and more significantly to adjusted operating profit as integration benefits were realised.
The acquisitions added approximately 1,000 acute care beds to Afrox hospitalsexisting capacity.
Existing hospital facilities were also enhanced during 2002 through investment in new services such as renal dialysis, physical and mental rehabilitation, pathology and radiography.
Acute care hospitals accounted for the majority of both turnover and adjusted operating profit.
The remainder was made up of health care services including chronic care, occupational health and pharmacy services.
During 2002 there was a downturn in the Afrox direct medicines business that facilitates the supply of chronic medication to patients by post.
This followed increased competition as health care funding organisations set up their own supply mechanisms at the same time as limiting reimbursement for patients.
Turnover of nursing staff continued to be a problem in South Africa as trained nurses were lured overseas by higher pay.
Afrox responded by increasing spending on training activities to ensure that sufficient well-qualified staff were available.

Despite competitive conditions in the logistics market, Gist achieved strong results with improved margins and some notable business wins.
Turnover increased by 14 per cent to 264.8 million and adjusted operating profit rose 20 per cent to 25.5 million.
Operating supply chains for customers remained at the core of the business and improved adjusted operating profit reflects both new contracts and increased volume with existing customers.
Gist now handles all of Marks & Spencers chilled and ambient food distribution and services as well as the entire warehouse and distribution operations for Budgens, another major UK retailer.
