As previously reported, proceeds of US$56.5m from the insurance claim have been received in respect of the capital and business interruption claims.
The insurance company has taken legal action to seek clarification on certain aspects of the policy.
The Board has taken legal advice and, based on this and its own information, considers that the Groups interpretation of the policy is correct.
However, the Board has decided that until the dispute is settled it would be prudent not to recognise any further business interruption income from 1 January 2003.
In the event that the dispute is settled and further insurance proceeds are forthcoming, we will book them on a received basis.
