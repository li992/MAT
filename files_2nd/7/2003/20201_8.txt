The length of the default period depends on the nature of the advance and is generally no more than three months.
Once a loan is considered to be impaired an assessment of the likelihood of collecting the principal of this loan is made.
This assessment is generally made using statistical techniques developed on previous experience and on management judgment of economic conditions.
These techniques estimate the propensity of loans to result in losses net of any recovery where applicable.
For advances secured on residential property the propensity of loans to become repossessed is also calculated.

The Wholesale Bank previously purchased credit derivatives, as in-substance guarantees, within what is now Abbeys Portfolio Business Unit, with the purpose of accepting credit risk when the returns from taking on such risk on an unfunded basis produced more attractive returns than on a funded basis through the granting of loans or purchase of securities.
This activity has now been discontinued.
This would have been included in the Wholesale Banks provisioning review.
The Financial Products area of the Personal Financial Services Wholesale Bank continues to purchase credit derivatives on a trading basis, and these are treated as trading derivatives under both UK and US GAAP.
Standby letters of credit also represent the taking on of credit on behalf of customers when actual funding is not required, normally because a third party is not prepared to accept the credit risk of Abbeys customer.
These are also included in the normal credit provisioning assessment alongside other forms of credit exposure.

72 Abbey Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Operating and Financial Review Balance Sheet Operating Review continued Interest rate sensitivity Interest rate sensitivity refers to the relationship between interest rates and net interest income resulting from the periodic repricing of assets and liabilities.
The largest single administered rate items in the Abbey balance sheet are residential mortgages and retail deposits, the majority of which bear interest at variable rates.
The contractual maturity of mortgage loans is generally more than five years, but the maturity of the majority of retail deposits is primarily within three months.
This apparent mismatch gives rise to issues which are addressed by Abbey in its liquidity management.
However, their effect on interest rate management is less significant.
Abbey has the ability to reprice both its retail variable rate liabilities and variable rate mortgage assets, subject to the constraints imposed by the competitive situation in the market place.
Management believes this ability enables Abbey to mitigate the impact of interest rate movements on net interest income in UK Banking and Savings.
Abbey also offers xed-rate mortgages and savings products on which the interest rate paid by or to the customer is xed for an agreed period of time at the start of the contract.
Abbey manages the margin on xed-rate products by the use of derivatives matching the xed-rate maturity proles.
The risk of prepayment is reduced by imposing penalty charges if the customers terminate their contracts early.
Wherever possible, Abbey seeks to minimise the risks associated with movements in market prices such as interest rates or exchange rates.
However, given the nature of financial activities, a level of market risk is inevitable.
Abbey has developed and implemented structures and systems to manage this market risk exposure.
For additional information, see Risk management elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Changes in net interest income volume and rate analysis The following table allocates changes in interest income, interest expense and net interest income between changes in volume and changes in rate for the years ended 31 December 2003 and 2002.
Volume and rate variances have been calculated on the movement in the average balances and the change in the interest rates on average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities.
The variance caused by changes in both volume and rate has been allocated to rate changes.
