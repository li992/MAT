The principal factors determining market on year growth rates in individual countries continue to be regulatory actions and demographics.
Generic prescribing continues to increase, reducing wholesale market growth as more expensive brands come off patent and are replaced by cheaper generic medicines which typically offer higher trading margins to us.
The growth of parallel trade slowed during the year as a result of efforts to curtail it through the restriction of product supply in certain markets, patent expiry of some high volume products, the implementation by manufacturers of quota systems on products and the strengthening of the Euro against Sterling.
Alliance UniChem Plc 11 Operating review continued Warehousing best practice Best practice, our Group-wide benchmarking initiative for warehouse layout, operating procedures and warehouse technology, brings together the knowledge and experience of logistic specialists across the Group to create an optimised operational model for our wholesale businesses.
Re-laid warehouses are showing substantial improvements in customer service, productivity and operational efficiency, realising significant cost savings, avoiding the need to relocate to larger premises.
For example, by the end of 2003 our customers at Hinckley in the UK, the first of the re-lay projects, were enjoying a 1.7% higher service level, and costs per line handled had reduced by 15.7%.
Capacity increased by around 25% at the same time.
Over the last two years, four UK warehouses have been re-laid in compliance with best practice and two built in the Netherlands, one of which is shown here.
We continue to roll out the best practice model across our network.

Almuss innovative colour-coded packaging helps pharmacists avoid dispensing errors.
Patients also appreciate Almuss easily recognisable packaging with clear, concise instructions for use.
Those patients who are on repeat prescriptions benefit from greater continuity in dispensing, as our competitive prices encourage pharmacists to choose Almus, time and again, over other generics.
For manufacturers, Almus represents an attractive additional sales route to sell their products.
Almus has quickly become a great success: in 2003 we launched 70 products, making it already an important generics brand in the UK.
The range received an industry accolade, with generic Almus Metformin, winning Pharmacy Business Generic Product of the Year 2003 at the UK Pharmacy Business Awards.

18 Alliance UniChem Plc Moss Pharmacy The cornerstone of the Groups retail strategy is our belief that the pharmacy is a key part of the primary care network.
Our pharmacies are typically located in communities, usually close to doctors surgeries and health centres, which is convenient for patients obtaining prescriptions and facilitates the development of close working relationships with general practitioners and other local healthcare professionals.
In the UK, over half our pharmacies are within 100 metres of a main doctors surgery or health centre with over 75% within 250 metres.
Here in Send, the Moss Pharmacy is actually attached to the local health centre.
The pharmacy benefits from a significant share of the centres prescriptions and repeat prescriptions, and works closely with the practice nurses as part of the local Primary Care Trusts bulk dressing supply service.
Other services provided include weight management, advice to care homes and lifestyle checks related to a wider cardiac risk assessment programme.
Alliance UniChem Plc 19 Operating review continued Kring Pharmacists from Kring, our virtual chain in The Netherlands, recently undertook a study to identify the frequency, nature and causes of potential drug related problems in elderly patients who frequently take more than one medication at a time.
Over the course of a year, Kring pharmacists screened 196 patients, each taking on average 8.7 prescriptions.
The study concluded that elderly patients are vulnerable to frequent drug-related problems.
Through pharmacist screening the number of medications taken can be reduced, alternative medications substituted, compliance monitored and side-effects better managed.
For pharmacists involved in the study, the screening also resulted in enhanced relationships with elderly patients and their doctors and new service related revenues were gained for each patient screened, pharmacists were paid a fee by a Dutch insurer.
