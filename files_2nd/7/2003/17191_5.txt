The outcome of all this has been a year of record unit sales and of record sales growth, a further improvement in margins, record operating profits, and significant improvements in our land holdings.
Results for 2003 Sales volumes 2003 saw a slow start to sales in January, a slight recovery, and then a slowdown due to the impact of the conflict in Iraq.

This market includes the investment and buy-to-let markets and at present we see no sign of weakening of demand, although there are undoubtedly limits on pricing and unit size imposed by the economics of this sector, together with construction cost increases imposed by government led design changes waiting round the corner.
Accordingly we plan to be able to deliver a substantial increase in turnover and a similar rise in operating profits if trading conditions remain favourable.
Looking further into the future while we would anticipate further growth in City Homes volumes and profitability, the rate at which this is achieved will be dependent on the timing of delivery of the sizeable mixed use schemes which are the source of our sites and a significant proportion of our volumes.
