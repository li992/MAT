Work began at the Newlands complex on the development of the new Northern underground mine, which will replace the existing Southern underground operations in 2005.
The new mine will access longwall coal from an existing highwall, with a wider face to further improve productivity and lower costs.
This is similar to Xstrata Coals Beltana highwall longwall underground operation in New South Wales.
Under MIM management, work continued on the development of the Rolleston Project with the completion of agreements for rail early works, power and various land holding issues.
Following the acquisition of MIM, the Project was suspended until Xstrata could complete a full internal review.
During the review process, Project expenditure was suspended as far as practically possible, with the exception of some existing financial commitments, such as the purchase of a dragline, which resulted in expenditure of US$12.9 million during the year.
In addition a 50,000 tonne sample pit was established at a cost of US$6.2 million to assess the projects technical and commercial feasibility.
Capital expenditure in 2004 in Australia is expected to be higher than 2003 at around US$180 million, US$48 million of which relates to the initial development of the Rolleston Project in Queensland.
The majority of spend relates to sustaining capital expenditure that will realise immediate as well as long-term benets to Xstrata Coal.
In New South Wales, some of the projects to be undertaken include final equipment purchases at Beltana and United, as well as the completion of the replacement of the Bulga Open Cut truck eet.
Also at Bulga, it is planned to upgrade the fines circuit at the coal handling and preparation plant to increase yield and lower unit costs.
Capital is to be spent on infrastructure upgrades at Mt Owen to realise synergies with contiguous operations.
At Ulan, the main conveyor that transports coal from the underground mine to surface stockpiles is listed for replacement.
The existing system is old and the replacement will bring immediate benets in the form of reduced operating costs and lower operational risk.
In Queensland, capital expenditure will continue on the projects that commenced in 2003.
The development of the Rolleston Project will assume a significant portion of capital expenditure.
Expenditures have been allowed for the development of this Project that will provide the basis of production expansion for Queensland thermal coal from early 2005.
In addition, development will continue on the Suttor Creek deposit at Newlands to replace Main Deposit production, which will cease in May 2004.
The Suttor Creek deposit will be a lower strip ratio than the existing Main Deposit resulting in increased productivities and lower operating costs.

The three main projects undertaken in 2003 were: The 50% capacity expansion at WitCons Colliery at a total cost of US$5.3 million of which US$4.6 million was spent in 2003.
The expansion includes the addition of a continuous miner section, an upgrade to the conveyor system and a processing plant expansion.
The completion of the expansion of Tavistock Colliery from 1.1 to 1.8 million tonnes per year.
The total expenditure on the project was US$10 million, with US$1.7 million spent in 2002 and US$8.3 million in 2003.
The expenditure covered the conversion of a conventional cut, drill and blast section to a continuous miner section, the addition of a continuous miner section, an upgrade to the conveyor system and the expansion of the processing plant capacity.
Work commenced in 2003 at the new Goedgevonden Colliery.
This mine will initially be operated as a small contractor open-cut operation and will utilise beneficiation capacity at the South Witbank mine.
The cost to establish the operation in 2003 was US$4.7 million.
The feasibility study for the full-scale operation at Goedgevonden is currently being undertaken.
Planned capital expenditure in 2004 will increase slightly above the 2003 levels to US$70 million.
The major projects included are: The first year of expenditure in the three-year Richards Bay Coal Terminal Phase V expansion project, which will expand Xstrata Coals South African export production capacity by over two million tonnes per annum.
Accessing and developing additional reserves for WitCons Colliery.
The replacement at Boschmans Colliery of a conventional cut, drill and blast section with a continuous miner section, and the acquisition of a higher capacity continuous miner to replace an existing machine which has reached the end of its useful life.
These equipment replacements will result in increased productivity and reduced operating costs.
The purchase of two new higher capacity continuous miners at South Witbank Colliery.
These units replace two existing continuous miners, which have reached the end of their useful lives.

As a consequence, copper inventories at LME warehouses fell from 856,000 tonnes at the start of the year, closing the year at 431,000 tonnes, their lowest level since the second quarter of 2001.
Average LME prices for the period were USc80.7 lb, a rise of 14% versus the previous year.
Since the end of 2003, these trends have continued, with falling LME stocks supporting an improving outlook for copper prices.
It is particularly encouraging that capacity reactivations and the reduction in stockpiles have occurred without a negative impact on metal prices.
The historical trend of robust growth rates in SX-EW copper production slowed in 2003, as several years of weak metal prices led to lower investment in new capacity.
Production of rened copper from secondary materials also decreased as a result of lower availability of high-grade scrap from the OECD and FSU regions.
As a consequence, shortfalls in mined concentrate had a pronounced impact on primary smelting and electrolytic capacity utilisation.
Rising copper intensity and infrastructure spending in emerging markets, particularly Asia, is expected to support growth in metal demand.
Chinas rising net copper import requirements have been a critical factor in the improvement of market fundamentals.
Any continued weakness of the US dollar is also expected to be positive for demand, particularly outside the Americas.
Supply side improvement in the copper markets was driven by a combination of continued producer restraint and production interruptions at third party operations in South East Asia and the Americas.
This led to a significant shortage of copper concentrates globally, estimated at more than 300,000 tonnes of contained metal, that in turn pushed treatment and rening charges TC RCs to record lows, ending the year at or below US$12 per dmt and 1.2USc lb respectively.
Since the end of 2003, further indications of a concentrate bottleneck have become evident, with increasingly aggressive terms being offered, particularly by the expanding Chinese and Indian smelting industries.
Copper concentrate sales from the Australian copper operations were 60,136 tonnes of contained metal 241,500 tonnes of concentrate, up 25% on 2002, at an average TC RC of US$28.50 2.85 USc lb.
Copper concentrate spot treatment and rening charges remained at levels that were below smelting costs.
Mine curtailments in recent years, production problems at key competitors and high levels of demand for raw materials in Asia are driving this trend.
Gold contained in copper product sales amounted to 131,600 troy ounces and silver 23,400 kilograms.
Domestic copper cathode sales excluding traded product from Xstratas Australian operations were 24,000 tonnes or 10% lower than in 2002 reecting the impact of the Mount Isa Mines copper smelter rebrick in July 2003.
Market sales were split: Australia 32%, South East Asia 22%, North East Asia 35% and Europe 12%.

Frame contracts comprised 91% of total sales.
Continued emphasis was placed on increasing spot sales and securing additional tonnages to European customers, to take advantage of the favourable overall economics resulting from sea freight differentials.
Improving demand from OECD economies, coupled with accelerated Asian growth and demand for raw materials, is expected to push the copper concentrate market into deficit by approximately 400,000 tonnes of contained copper in concentrate in 2004.
As demand fundamentals rm and prices remain at higher levels, the market is anticipated to readily absorb recommissioned capacity.
Given the relative absence of greeneld mines and the inadequate idled concentrate capacity to satisfy smelting demand, particularly in the Pacic and Indian Ocean regions, both term and spot TC RC quotations are expected to remain in favour of concentrate producers in the short to medium term.
Whilst TC RCs remain at historically low levels, there is a trend for concentrate producers to reduce long-term copper contracts to the Far East in order to increase their exposure to the spot market.
As a result of recent supply disruptions it is expected that copper metal supply will also remain in deficit by approximately 400,000 to 500,000 tonnes in 2004, falling to 200,000 to 300,000 tonnes the following year.
This market dynamic is expected to be supportive of pricing for Xstratas copper production in the year ahead.
Although it is likely that 2004 will see the re-commissioning of idle capacity, growth forecasts in both the OECD and China are expected to be sufficient to absorb this additional supply.
The outlook for the gold market will depend upon implementation and or renewal of central bank agreements, the impact of the relatively strong US dollar gold price on supply side growth both from a project and recycling perspective together with the broader outlook for the US dollar, and global economic and political environment.

This largely negated the impact on contained metal production due to ore grades reducing towards their long-term averages.
Volumes of total material mined from the Alumbrera pit remained consistent throughout the year, with 110 million tonnes mined during 2003.
Xstratas share of copper in concentrate and total gold production levels for 2003, at 99,268 tonnes and 334,882 ounces respectively, exceeded planned levels, although remained lower than the corresponding period last year primarily due to lower head grades.
Total concentrate sales volumes were slightly lower than the corresponding period, but maintained a consistent delivery prole.
The impact of lower volumes against the corresponding period was more than offset by further cost efficiency initiatives and metal price improvements.
On revenue of US$506 million up 10%, improved performances were achieved in both EBITDA US$332.3 million, up 28% and EBIT US$191.9 million, up 24%.
Low operating costs continued to be a highlight of the Alumbrera business, with C1 cash operating costs averaging 3.1USc lb of copper produced net of gold credits.
The Alumbrera Labour Agreement was successfully re-negotiated during the year, resulting in a revised four-year agreement covering all the companys non-staff employees.
This has assisted in sustaining the characteristic stability in the work environment at Alumbrera.
Production volumes for both copper and gold are expected to reduce in 2004 due to a reduction in head grades.
However this will be partially compensated for by the full benefit of the pebble and third grinding circuits projects and concentrator expansions, enabling higher tonnes of ore to be milled.
Concentrator throughput is expected to average slightly more than 3 million tonnes per month.
Although lower ore grades, increased mining volumes and inationary pressures will impact on unit cash costs, this will be partially offset by the higher mill throughputs.
In addition, the beneficial impact of the gold credits on unit operating costs at Alumbrera has been partially secured in future periods due to Xstratas gold hedgebook.
