Southeast Asia continued to dominate growth in stainless steel production, with output up 18% to 5.9 million tonnes for China, Taiwan, India, Korea combined.
Europe also showed growth with output rising to 8.4 million tonnes, an increase of 3.9% on 2002.
Additional growth came from Japan, up 5.5% to 4 million tonnes, and South Africa where melt increased to 655,000 tonnes up 12.2%.
America remained unchanged year-on-year, with production of 2.7 million tonnes.
Underpinned by strong demand and the continued appreciation of the SA rand against the US dollar, ferrochrome prices increased substantially during the year.
European base prices for ferrochrome moved from approximately 34 US lb in Q1 2003 to 50 US lb in Q4 2003, an increase of 47%, with a further 7 US lb increase already agreed with most major consumers from 1 January 2004.
The outlook for 2004 remains strong.
Stainless steel melt is expected to grow by approximately 6% to 23 million tonnes in the year ahead, supported by improving economic conditions in the worlds major economies and Chinas continued strong growth.
This is expected to push ferrochrome demand to over 5.1 million tonnes, an increase of some 6% year-on-year.
With no meaningful increase in ferrochrome production capacity in 2004, the supply and demand balance should remain tight and prices rm.
However, the continuing high nickel price could dampen demand for austenitic grade stainless steel, if such prices were to prevail in the longer-term.
The price of nickel has risen substantially, reducing conversion margins at stainless producers to their lowest levels since the late 1990s.
Operations Turnover for the year, at US$472.2 million, was up 63% on 2002, due to the sharp increase in ferrochrome selling prices, which on a spot basis moved by 47% or 16Usc lb over the reporting period, and to record saleable production volumes, which were up 15.3% year-on-year.
The positive impact of the higher selling prices and sales volumes was reduced by the significant strengthening of the South African rand, which appreciated over 28% against the US dollar, and higher ination in South Africa.
As a consequence, EBIT for the year was up only US$5.8 million 10.4% year-on-year.
Unit costs increased in real terms by US$5.7 million in comparison to 2002 mainly due to the impact on mine production of the difficult geological conditions highlighted in the half-year report, and the consequent increased cost of chrome ore Xstrata plc Annual Report 2003 35 ALLOYS Financial and Operational Data: Chrome Xstrata Xstrata Year ended Year ended US$m 31.12.03 31.12.02 Turnover 472.2 290.2 EBITDA 78.9 62.8 Depreciation & Amortisation 17.3 7.0 EBIT 61.6 55.8 Attributable net assets 313.6 245.3 Capital Employed 428.7 334.9 % Share Group EBIT 14.3% 7.0% % Share Group Net Assets 4.8% 4.9% % Return on Capital Employed 16.2% 20.4% Capital Expenditure 29.5 7.3 Sustaining 2.3 0.8 Expansionary 27.2 6.5 Attributable Saleable Production kt 1,104.1 957.5 Indicative Average Published Price USc lb Metal Bulletin 46.0 30.0 Excludes Ravenswood and discontinued operations Avonmouth, Duisburg and Magnesium ROCE % based on average exchange rates for the period purchased to compensate for the reduced feed.
This lower quality ore also resulted in reduced metallurgical efficiencies, which further impacted negatively on cost performance.
Mining conditions have improved as the geological fault has been traversed and unit operating costs across Xstrata Chrome are expected to reduce, in line with performance in previous years.
In addition, the strategy to reduce reliance on imported coke, which has increased in price by some 95% US$100 tonne year-on-year, is progressing successfully and will reduce the impact of continuing price increases in imported coke in 2004.
Saleable production, at 1.1 million tonnes in 2003, represented 86% of name plate capacity.
This reects the planned lowering of production levels in the South African winter, a period of high-energy costs, when five furnaces were taken offline for complete refurbishment in anticipation of higher demand from Q4 2003.
A tightening market led to Xstrata restarting its idled capacity, with all furnaces recommissioned during the second half.
The 500,000 tonne Rustenburg pelletising plant was commissioned from the fourth quarter and is expected to be operating at full capacity by the end of March 2004.
This will greatly assist in enhancing the quality of the ore mix at Rustenburg, improving furnace efficiencies and further improving Xstrata Chromes low cost position.

Developments The full benefit of Xstrata Chromes 720,000 tonne expansion of its agglomerated ore capacity is expected in 2004, with a significant improvement in the current ore blend available to the operating units.
As a result, metallurgical efficiencies should improve substantially, further reducing production costs and enhancing competitiveness.
Given the strong ferrochrome production volumes anticipated in 2004, production of chrome ore is expected to be maintained at record levels this year.
This strong production prole means that management of reductant inputs remains the top technical and commercial priority.
In addition to progress in respect of substitution initiatives, a major positive development was the acquisition in January 2003 of Char Technology Pty Ltd, a South African producer of char.
Production output at the Thorncliffe Mine increased from 92,000 tpm to 110,000 tpm from the second half, with the open cast operation at Thorncliffe producing an average of 13,000 tpm.
During the year underground production capacity at the Kroondal Mine increased by 45.5% to 160,000 tpm, with production of some 30,000 tpm sourced from an open cast operation to ensure adequate ore supply to the furnaces during the build-up phase.
Upgrading of the Kroondal plant to accommodate the increased ore supply was completed at the end of January 2004, approximately three months ahead of schedule.
Production from underground at the Waterval Mine will also be further increased in 2004 and is expected to reach 60,000 tonnes per month during the latter part of 2004.

Lion will be constructed in three phases, each comprising 330,000 tonnes of annual smelting capacity.
The Lion Plant will utilise Xstratas exclusive Premus Technology, which has been developed and successfully implemented by Xstrata Alloys at its Lydenburg facility.
The Premus process, which is a substantial modication of the highly efficient closed furnace and pelletising technology, is expected to deliver operating costs around 20% below alternative technologies due to significant substitution of anthracite for coke and power costs that are between 25% and 45% lower per tonne of ferrochrome produced than the industrys prevailing Conventional, Outokumpu or DC Arc processes.
Phase One, which has a capital cost of ZAR1.25 billion, comprises two 63MVA closed submerged arc furnaces and will raise Xstrata Alloys annual production capacity to some 1.63 million tonnes of ferrochrome, representing about one-third of current global capacity.
Phase Ones low operating costs and its browneld, low-capital cost expansion capability provide a solid growth platform from which Xstrata will be able to meet the growth in global demand for ferrochrome going forward.
The Project is progressing on schedule, with design work on track for completion by mid 2004 and production expected early in 2006.
