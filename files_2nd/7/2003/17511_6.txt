Australia Xstratas Australian copper operations experienced a difficult year, posting a reduced EBIT of US$82.2 million from US$136.4 million in the corresponding period.
Performance was impacted by a stronger Australian dollar, difficult underground mining conditions and a rebrick of the copper smelter at Mount Isa, partially offset by a solid contribution from Ernest Henry.
Xstrata Coppers Australian turnover was up 10% on 2002 to US$550.5 million, reecting stronger US dollar prices for copper and gold.
Toward the latter part of 2003, the underground water issues that negatively affected the first half production from Mount Isa had been resolved, and underground ore production recovered to previous levels.
Production from the copper concentrator was in line with 2002 levels reecting the milling of stockpiled smelter slag during periods of underground ore shortfalls during the first half of 2003.
However, in line with expectations, rened copper production was around 8% lower in the second half due to a scheduled rebrick and maintenance shutdown at the Mount Isa copper smelter in July.
The successful rebrick marked the completion of a 36-month Isasmelt vessel campaign, the longest achieved to date, with the next rebrick scheduled for 2006.
Mount Isa unit costs for 2003 on a C1 basis increased from 44.1USc lb in 2002 to 56.2USc lb in 2003, largely as a result of the underground water issues experienced during the first half and the stronger Australian dollar throughout the year.
Performance during the year from the Ernest Henry copper-gold mine was in line with expectations.
Copper production from the mine for the first half was up on the same period in 2002 due to higher mill throughput and recoveries which, combined with higher commodity prices, largely offset the effects of a strengthening Australian dollar.
Although second half performance was adversely affected by scheduled lower copper and gold grades, unit costs for the full year at Ernest Henry on a C1 basis were lower at 40.5USc lb.
The challenge going forward at Mount Isa is to address the anticipated reduction in grade by increasing ore output.
A significant increase in underground development and stope lling is therefore underway at both X41 and Enterprise.
This is expected to improve production of underground ore, compensating for the falling grade, from the second half of 2004.
At Ernest Henry, head grades are scheduled to recover from the levels experienced in the second half of 2003 although, due to the deepening pit and increased haulage distances, unit costs are expected to remain stable.
Despite the current strength of the Australian dollar, Xstratas foreign exchange hedging will partially negate the impact on operating costs, particularly in the first half.

Xstratas share of sustaining capital for 2004, estimated at around US$14 million, includes additional haul trucks, and the completion of the project to increase concentrator otation capacity.
A near-mine district exploration programme around Alumbrera was launched during 2003.
This intensive programme will be continued in 2004 and 2005, focused on drill-testing a number of geological targets identied in last years programme.
Australia Sustaining capital expenditure of US$36 million during 2003 consisted principally of underground mine development, equipment replacement, and environmental management of water and tailings.
The increase over 2002 expenditure reects the implementation of a capital programme to expand developed ore inventories to support an increase in Mount Isa underground copper ore production and to replace mining equipment and ageing infrastructure.
The programme is expected to lower costs and reduce production risk.
The level of expenditure is planned to increase to US$50 million in 2004 as this programme continues.
Expansionary capital expenditure of US$26 million was directed towards completion of the Enterprise mine expansion and continued evaluation of undeveloped resources at Mount Isa and the Ernest Henry copper-gold mine.
Work at Ernest Henry focused on known extensions of the orebody at depth and nearby satellite deposits.
The 2004 expansionary capital expenditure programme will focus on continuing the Mount Isa open cut pre-feasibility study and evaluation of the potential extensions to mineralisation at Ernest Henry.
Exploration activity is focused on leveraging value from Xstrata Copper Australias strong regional asset and infrastructure base, targeting mineralisation within a 100-kilometre radius of the Mount Isa and Ernest Henry operations.
World zinc metal consumption increased 2% in 2003 to 9.6 million tonnes.
Demand in China remained very strong and the rest of Asian countries continued to benefit from the growth of the Chinese economy.
The European zinc metal market remained tight with temporary shut-downs of third party production in Italy and Macedonia and the permanent closure of the Avonmouth smelter in the UK and the Noyelles Godault smelter in France.
Together with the closure of Pasmincos Cockle Creek smelter in Australia, these production cuts more than compensated for the opening of new smelters in Namibia and Kazakhstan and minor capacity increases elsewhere.
As a consequence, global zinc metal output in 2003 declined 0.6% to 9.7 million tonnes.
Following a decrease in 2002, zinc mine production recovered in 2003, growing 3.6% to 9.3 million tonnes.
The opening of new mines in Namibia and Australia, together with increased production in Latin America, Australia and Ireland, offset the closures of Reocn in Spain, Lennard Shelf in Australia and Gordonsville in the USA.
In spite of the increased mine production, the concentrates market remained tight in 2003, contributing to a further decline in negotiated treatment charges TCs, which fell from an average US$169 tonne in 2002 to US$148 tonne in 2003.
Zinc stocks at LME warehouses increased by 89,000 tonnes during the year reecting a similar zinc metal supply surplus in the market, which kept LME zinc prices low most of the year.
Improved demand in the fourth quarter led to a significant recovery in the LME zinc price, which closed the year at US$1,008 tonne.
As a consequence, the average LME zinc settlement price in 2003 increased 6% to US$828 tonne, compared to 2002s average of US$779 tonne.
Lead Lead metal availability declined during 2003 as Western lead output fell by over 150,000 tonnes, while Western lead demand reduced by only around 80,000 tonnes.
Indications of rising demand could see this deficit grow in 2004.
LME stocks of lead fell throughout 2003, as supply tightened and producers and traders drew down stocks, particularly from LME warehouses in Europe and Singapore.
Available LME lead stocks fell below 100,000 tonnes at end 2003, with the bulk of stocks in North American warehouses.
Consumer demand, both in Europe and North America, improved during the fourth quarter, although the impact was mitigated by a rise in exported batteries, mainly from South Korea and China.
Continuing growth in domestic demand in China is expected to limit the growth of these imports going forward.

This lifted the average LME lead settlement price for 2003 to US$515 tonne, up 14% from 2002 and above US$500 tonne for the first time since 1999.
Operations Zinc Lead Australia Turnover for the Australian zinc lead operations was up 25% compared to 2002 to US$165.6 million, reecting stronger US dollar prices for zinc and lead in the period.
The operations reported a negative EBIT of US$ 27.4 million against a negative EBIT of US$ 22.8 million in 2002 with the adverse strengthening of the Australian dollar offsetting the positive impact of prices, although currency hedging partially provided some protection.
Production volumes at the zinc lead operations at Mount Isa Mines were below 2002 levels, due to the slower than expected ramp-up of the George Fisher orebody and low productivity from the Mount Isa lead mine.
Mining conditions at George Fisher are proving difficult and the benets of the improved design and sequencing have been delayed due to the development lead-time in implementing new stope sizes.
The operation is approximately half way through an estimated 18-month programme to change the mining front.
significant technical resources and expertise are focused on this challenge, with encouraging evidence of improving performance.
Current operations in the Mount Isa lead mine are centred on high grade remnant sections of the orebody at a low ore production rate of between 600,000 to 800,000 tpa.
This strategy will maximise the value of the remaining reserves.
Lead bullion lead and silver from the Mount Isa Mines lead smelter was below 2002 levels.
McArthur River Mine MRM production was in line with 2002 with slight falls in grade and recovery offset by improved productivity from the selective use of bulk stoping methodologies.
These efficiencies also impacted positively on unit cash costs, which reduced in real terms by 8%.
The market for zinc bulk concentrates has reduced over recent years due to the closure or conversion to alternate raw materials of five of the worlds 12 Imperial Smelting Furnace ISF technology smelters.
As a consequence, treatment charges have risen for product from McArthur River Mine, representing a significant challenge to the long-term viability of the operation.
A number of options are under consideration to address this issue, including a feasibility study into a potential large open pit operation, utilising Xstratas Albion technology.
Xstrata plc Annual Report 2003 65 ZINC LEAD The outlook for the Australian zinc lead operations is positive against the performance in 2003, due to higher US dollar zinc and lead prices and higher production from Mount Isa.
Zinc Europe The San Juan fide Nieva smelter in Spain achieved a production record for the fifth consecutive year in 2003.
The successful completion, on time and under budget, of the 25,000 tonne expansion in July 2003, increased melted zinc production at San Juan to 480,000 tonnes, some 4,100 tonnes above planned capacity.
Saleable zinc production at over 461,000 tonnes was even higher over budget, at 5,216 tonnes, due to a 0.3% reduction in zinc dust consumption as a result of improvements in the leaching and purication circuits.
3 Following the start-up of the new 850m tanks in the leaching stage and the commissioning of new horizontal belt lters for jarosite, San Juan further improved its zinc recovery rates by 0.7% to 97%.
The integration and restructuring of the Nordenham operations have been completed successfully.
On-going synergies and debottlenecking projects delivered record levels of production, with production of zinc metal in Nordenham reaching 147,636 tonnes 138,504 tonnes of saleable zinc, signicantly above nameplate capacity.
The on-going efficiency programme that began in 2002, and the production increases at San Juan and Nordenham, delivered a reduction in operating costs in real terms of nearly US$26 million.
However, this could not fully offset the negative impacts of the weaker US dollar and lower TCs in 2003.
As a consequence, EBIT in 2003, at US$36.3 million, was 33% lower compared to 2002.
Combined zinc sales reached 599,680 tonnes in 2003, an increase of 13,000 tonnes compared to the previous year.
During 2003 Xstrata zinc smelters also produced 1,003,687 tonnes of sulphuric acid and 7,509kg of germanium as germanium dioxide.
The Arnao plant produced 14,966 tonnes of zinc oxide and the Hinojedo roaster produced 29,422 tonnes of liquid sulphur dioxide, with the increase of 4,922 tonnes above budget taking advantage of favourable market conditions.
The new Oleum Plant at San Juan, with a capacity of 52,000 tonnes per year, began operations in April 2003.
This product will allow Xstrata Zinc to benefit from new markets for its sulphuric acid production.

Excludes discontinued operations Avonmouth and Duisburg The project to change the incoming voltage at San Juan from 132kVolts to 220kV completed successfully in December 2003.
This will allow the smelter to benefit from the capacity to access alternative suppliers after the liberalisation of the energy market.
After an operational life of 147 years, the Reocin mine in Spain ceased operations on 31 March 2003.
As the exhaustion of its reserves had been foreseen, Xstrata Zinc had already in place alternative sources of concentrates to substitute Reocins production.
Lead Europe Northeet Renery announced the closure of the No 2 line in March 2003, following a decision to close the Avonmouth ISF zinc smelter.
Crude lead supply from Duisburg also ceased in 2003, with a small quantity of rened lead and silver Dore produced from in-process stocks during January 2004.
The closure of the Northeet recycling operation was announced in September 2003.
A major project to clean up the recycling plant area has commenced and is expected to be completed in the first quarter 2004.
As a consequence of these closures some 160 employees have been retrenched and lead sales decreased by 26% against 2002.
The closure of the non-profitable operations has positioned Northeet to benefit from the higher prices prevailing at the start of 2004.
EBIT in 2003, excluding exceptional items, reects the costs savings associated with the closure of lossmaking operations and the improvement in the price of lead.
Lead production at the Northeet Renery was down 22% on the corresponding period, with No 1 Renery 5% down due to lower crude deliveries from Mount Isa and remaining lead production down 47% as a result of the closure of the Avonmouth Smelter and lower production from the now closed recycling operations.
Silver production decreased 25%, reecting lower silver delivery from Mount Isa and the closure of Avonmouth.
ISA lead sales premiums achieved in 2003 were 10% higher than 2002 in pound sterling terms.
Contracted sales for 2004 will show a further increase of 12% over 2003 levels.
