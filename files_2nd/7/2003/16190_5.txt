12550 Tullow R&A03 Front aw 5 27 04 12:44 PM Page 12 Northwest Europe Review UNITED KINGDOM The Southern Gas Basin in the North Sea is Tullows main area of production.
The Company has interests in three gas producing areas in this basin: Hewett, Thames, and the Caister Murdoch System CMS.
During 2003 combined gas sales from these areas averaged 120 mmscfd, a 20% increase over 2002.
The first full years contribution from the CMS III development was responsible for much of the increase.
Tullow reached a number of milestones in 2003 under its strategy of consolidating and expanding the Companys acreage portfolio around its production infrastructure.
Most notable was the purchase of ConocoPhillips equity in the Hewett gas fields and the Bacton gas terminal situated on the Norfolk coast.
Tullow assumed operatorship of these strategic assets and contracted day-to-day management to Petrofac, a major service company.
Further consolidation took place with the purchase of additional interests in the Thames fields, the Horne discovery and adjacent exploration acreage.
The Horne acquisition enabled Tullow, as operator, to plan a fast-track combined development of the Horne and Wren discoveries.
Five exploration blocks were awarded to the Company under the 21st Licensing Round in July, three of these lie in the more oil prone Central North Sea and are operated by Tullow.
Following detailed analysis, the Company decided to dispose of its interest in the sub-commercial Islay discovery well and adjacent SNS acreage.
Hewett & Thames Areas On 1st October Tullow completed the acquisition of ConocoPhillips equity in the Hewett and Bacton assets, increasing its interest to 38.82%.
The assets comprise the offshore Hewett fields and pipelines and the onshore Bacton gas terminal, which processes gas from Tullows Hewett and Thames area fields.
In conjunction with this deal, Tullow assumed operatorship of these assets and has already instigated a number of initiatives, including the implementation of extensive cost saving measures, both offshore and onshore, and the optimisation of production from the existing wells.
2003 production from the Hewett fields was boosted by particularly strong performance during the winter months.
The Company believes there is a major business opportunity in extending the life of the Hewett and Bacton facilities by attracting third party business and, in the longer term, by offering gas storage.
A number of suitable 12 Tullow Oil plc Review of Operations 12550 Tullow R&A03 Front aw 5 27 04 12:44 PM Page 13 depleted reservoirs with proximity to shore and a direct link to the national transmission system have been identified and studies are under way to determine the commercial viability of gas storage.
In March 2004 Tullow purchased ExxonMobils equity in blocks 48 23a and 48 22a encompassing the Blythe field, bringing the Companys interest to 100% in both blocks.
The field, to the northwest of Hewett, is currently undergoing further specialist seismic analysis, to establish development potential.
Other discoveries in the area may provide synergies for a joint development tied back to Hewett.
The Thames and Deben fields performed well during the year.
Tullows share of production was enhanced by the contribution from its purchase of Enis 23.33% equity in the fields.
The deal was completed in late November with an economic effective date of 1st January 2002.
Production from the Gawain field was markedly reduced by an increasing water cut affecting all three production wells.
One of the wells ceased production in mid-year.
The Gawain South East exploration well, drilled in mid 2003, was plugged and abandoned as a dry hole.
Orwell field production exceeded expectations during 2003 due to strong summer demand for gas and the ending of the gas sales agreement, allowing the field to produce at optimum capacity from 1st October.
In March 2004 Tullow announced that it had agreed to purchase ChevronTexacos 50% interest in Orwell, thereby increasing its stake to 100%.
Tullow completed two further significant deals in the Thames area involving the Horne & Wren and Fizzy discoveries.
In June the Company purchased an additional equity interest in the Horne discovery and adjacent 13 12550 Tullow R&A03 Front aw 5 27 04 4:15 PM Page 14 MORAY FIRTH CENTRAL NORTH SEA AREA Aberdeen NORWEGIAN WATERS acreage from BP.
A field development plan for the Horne & Wren discoveries, was submitted to the DTI in March 2004.
Tullow, as operator, is targeting production start-up for the first half of 2005.
The two fields are estimated to contain combined gross recoverable reserves of approximately 60 bcf gas.
The Fizzy discovery, which contains over 100 bcf of methane but with a similar amount of non-combustible gases, straddles blocks 50 26b and 49 30b.
In March 2004 Tullow acquired ExxonMobils equity in, and the operatorship of, block 50 26b, increasing its equity to 100%.
Tullow was awarded a 50% interest in adjacent block 49 30b in the 21st Licensing Round.

The termination of the gas sales agreements for Murdoch and Boulton enabled production from these fields to be actively managed to benefit from periods of favourable pricing.
CMS III development continued throughout the year on the McAdam, Watt and Boulton H fields, and drilling was completed in February 2004.
Production from the fifth and last field, Boulton H, commenced in early March 2004.
Three of the producing fields, Hawksley, McAdam and Murdoch K, performed above expectations.
However, Watt field pressures declined rapidly during its first month of production and the option to re-enter this well is under review.
The new CMS offshore compression train, which was inaugurated in late 2003, doubles the CMS compression capacity and resulted in a marked improvement in flow rates from all CMS area fields.
Tullow was awarded an interest in block 44 19b under the 21st Licensing Round.
This block, and the seven awarded or acquired in 2002, are currently being evaluated using the latest 3D seismic data with a view to drilling a number of exploration wells in 2004 and 2005.
The initial well, the Monroe exploration well, was spudded in block 44 17b during February 2004 and was suspended as a gas discovery in April 2004.
New exploratory drilling in the area combined with the Monroe and other existing discoveries are anticipated to provide for a future CMS IV project.
Moray Firth and Central North Sea In early 2003 Tullow participated in the Squirrel exploration well, in Moray Firth block 20 7a, which lies close to the giant Buzzard field.
The well was not successful.
In July the Company was awarded operating interests in three Central North Sea blocks, in Quadrants 38 and 39, located close to existing oil production.
The work programme includes the acquisition of new seismic data and the reprocessing of existing data.
The new data was acquired in the autumn and is currently being processed.
The company will continue to review opportunities to expand its North Sea portfolio through participation in licensing rounds and further asset acquisitions.

Licence CI-26 Tullow 24% is a key asset for Tullow, combining valuable oil and gas production with exciting exploration opportunities.
The Espoir field is Tullows principal source of international production.
It is located on the edge of the African continental shelf, 60km southwest of Abidjan and 19km from shore.
Espoir, in which Tullow holds 21.33%, consists of two accumulations, East and West.
The East reservoir produces through a wellhead tower connected to a turret-moored FPSO, with oil being exported via offtake tankers.
Gas is exported by pipeline to shore and used in local power stations.
During 2003, increased oil and gas production from the Espoir field and the success of the Acajou -1X oil discovery further enhanced the value of this acreage.
2004 promises to be another active year with the commencement of West Espoir development and a further exploration well planned, for the Acajou North prospect.
Production Two production wells and two water injectors were drilled on East Espoir during 2003.
In addition, three existing East Espoir production wells were perforated in the upper reservoir.
This work marked the completion of development drilling activities on East Espoir.
With all five of the Espoir producer wells on stream, production reached a peak of 26,000 boepd in the second half of 2003.
There were 12 cargo liftings from the Espoir field during 2003 and revenue benefited from strong oil prices, averaging more than $27.50 per barrel.
Development In October, the joint venture partners agreed development plans for the West Espoir accumulation and sanctioned a budget for the fabrication of a second 12 slot tripod wellhead tower.
Plans for West Espoir include the drilling of five new production wells and two water injection wells.
Invitations to tender for this work were issued towards the end of 2003 and contracts will be awarded shortly.
16 Tullow Oil plc Review of Operations 12550 Tullow R&A03 Front aw 5 27 04 12:51 PM Page 17 When developed, West Espoir will increase field production by 10,000 bopd and gas sales will reach 35 mmscfd.
The FPSO process capacity will be upgraded to cater for the increased levels of oil production when West Espoir comes on stream.
Exploration In addition to strong production performance, Cte dIvoire also provided a significant oil discovery for Tullow in May.
The Acajou-1X exploration well, located about 9 km south east of Espoir, was drilled in 3,050 ft water and tested at an average rate of 3,500 bopd.
The oil is good quality at 33 API, similar to that found in the Espoir field, and its location would facilitate a subsea pipeline tieback arrangement of the existing discovery.
The success of the Acajou well underlines the considerable potential for further successful exploration in the area.
Preparations are being made to drill the Acajou North exploration prospect in the second half of 2004.
Should this well be successful in proving up substantial additional reserves, standalone development options will be investigated.
Tullow is also in advanced negotiations with the authorities in Cte dIvoire in relation to two new exploration licences.

The award expanded the Companys exploration portfolio in an area of significant hydrocarbon potential and complements its other West African assets in Cte dIvoire and Cameroon.
Tullow operates the licence with a 47.5% interest, following completion of farm-in agreements in early 2004.
As a result of these agreements, Addax Petroleum has acquired a 42.5% interest.
Sonangol P&P, a subsidiary of the Angolan state company, has also taken a 10% interest in the licence in its first commercial exploration venture outside Angola.
The Kiarsseny Marin licence covers 5,442 sq km.
Both shallow post-salt Tertiary and Cretaceous targets and deeper pre-salt plays are present on the acreage.
Extensive 2D and 3D seismic data are available for the block and three discoveries have been made in the block: Equata by Texaco in 1974: GLK now called Topaze by Gulf in 1977: and Iguega by Shell in 1997.
These discoveries were considered marginal by previous operators under earlier, less favourable PSC terms.
All three are being re-evaluated in light of the improved terms and advancements in shallow water development technology.
Some 25 wells have been drilled on the licence to date, many of which encountered oil and gas.
Tullow moved rapidly to evaluate this large volume of data, and spudded the first of two commitment exploration wells, on the Topaze South prospect in February 2004.
Exploration & Appraisal Tullow commenced an exploration and appraisal programme to assess the commerciality of the existing oil accumulations and other prospects on the block.
Evaluation has focused on re-interpreting existing seismic and well data, revising geological models and investigating alternative development and production schemes.
The initial phase of evaluation has confirmed the presence of at least four viable play types.
An inventory has been compiled of leads and prospects and these are being systematically studied.
Further drilling targets are expected to emerge from the analysis of this portfolio in the coming months.
In early 2004 Tullow drilled the Topaze South-1 well, but no significant quantity of recoverable oil was found and the well was plugged and abandoned.
The information from this well will be further evaluated to better understand the geology of the Topaze discovery.
Studies are also ongoing over the Iguega and Equata accumulations, and possible development options are under consideration.

The 474 sq km Bata concession lies in shallow water close to the border with Nigeria in the north-central part of EQUATORIAL the Rio del Rey basin.
Current production from the basin is approximately 100,000 bopd.
GUINEA The Ngosso permit contains three existing, unappraised oil discoveries - Narendi, Odiong and Oongue - and numerous exploration opportunities.
One of the objectives of the initial programme will be to appraise the existing KIARSSENY Libreville discoveries with a view to establishing their commerciality and putting MARIN them on early production.
The shallow water depths within the Ngosso block facilitate cost-effective drilling and accelerated field development.
Both shallow deltaic Miocene Port Gentil targets and deeper Miocene and Eocene turbidite plays are present.
The GABON Miocene reservoirs are part of a well-established play which has been exploited in Cameroon since the 1970s.
Detailed technical studies during the year have enhanced the understanding of the acreage.
A 200 sq km programme of 3D seismic acquisition is planned for late 2004 as the next stage of a work programme to establish the extent of various discoveries and prospects on the block.
This data will provide information for selecting optimal well locations.
Two wells will be drilled in the initial three-year period of this licence.
CONGO Pointe Noire Cabinda 19 12550 Tullow R&A03 Front aw 5 27 04 12:52 PM Page 20 South Asia Review PAKISTAN Tullow has been involved in exploration and production in Pakistan since 1990 and now holds three exploration licences and four development leases.
Most of Tullows acreage lies in the Middle Indus basin, where the Sara and Suri fields have been supplying gas to the Guddu power station for over four years.
A third field, Chachar, is currently the subject of discussions with the Government of Pakistan on the unitisation of the field with an adjacent field.
Development possibilities are also being considered for a fourth field, Sara West.
Tullow further expanded its portfolio in March 2003, with the signing of the New Block B exploration licence, which covers acreage surrounding Tullows existing production leases in the Sara and Suri areas.
During the year the Company carried out geological and geophysical work on the Nawabshah and New Block B exploration licences.
Development The Sara and Suri fields have produced gas since December 1999, averaging nearly 30 mmscfd, with facilities capable of 40 mmscfd throughput.
Following water influx to the main producing zone in the Sara-1 well, the Sara and Suri wells were worked over, restoring production to an average of 20 mmscfd.
A 3D seismic survey was conducted in October and November in order to identify locations for additional development wells and further exploration targets.
In early 2002 Tullow signed a gas sales agreement to produce up to 30 mmscfd from the Chachar field for the Guddu power station.
Chachar lies adjacent to the Kandhkot gas field and in mid-2003 the licensing authorities commenced a unitisation process to establish reserve and production splits between the two lease areas.
Development of the field is now awaiting the outcome of this process.
Tullow is currently reviewing potential development options for the Sara West field, which tested low calorific value gas in 1996.
A 20-year Development and Production Licence D&PL was granted over the field in 2001.
The discovery of further gas reserves in New Block B would broaden the range of such development options for Sara West, by opening up the possibilities for a blended gas of increased calorific value.
20 Tullow Oil plc Review of Operations 12550 Tullow R&A03 Front aw 5 27 04 12:52 PM Page 21 Exploration The Nawabshah licence was awarded in October 2002.
Tullow reduced its equity in the block by farming out part of its interest to two new partners, Marigas and Pakistan Oilfields Limited POL.
Following extensive reprocessing of seismic data for the block in 2003, Tullow expects to complete the acquisition of a further 300 km of 2D seismic by mid 2004.
The focus of exploration in the block is on the stratigraphic play potential of the Lower Cretaceous.
This has proven successful in the nearby multi-tcf Sawan and Miano fields.
The discovery of several new gas and oil fields adjacent to the Nawabshah block during 2003 greatly enhanced the prospectivity of the block and an exploration well is planned.
The New Block B exploration licence was awarded to Tullow in March 2003 and covers acreage in the Sara and Suri areas.
Tullow operates this 771 sq km licence with a 48.18% interest and conducted a 150 km 2D seismic survey over the block in December 2003.
Interpretation is under way in advance of well planning.
A 200 sq km 3D seismic survey was conducted over the Sara and Suri leases and a prospective part of the New Block B exploration licence in late 2003.
This survey is expected to define drilling locations on deeper level prospects in the Sara and Suri area and may highlight additional reserves at shallow levels and deeper Cretaceous levels.
Force Majeure has been in place over Block 28 for several years.
This large block has similar anticlinal features to those producing gas in nearby fields.
The acreage also has oil potential.

The Petroleum Exploration Licence PEL for the onshore Block CB-ON-1 was granted in September 2003 and work has now commenced on the block.
This very large block of 5,875 sq km is situated within the prolific Cambay basin.
CB-ON-1 is regarded as having good potential for commercial discoveries of both oil and gas, as it lies south of recently discovered sizeable fields in the Sanchor Basin.
The joint venture partners plan an aggressive work programme on the block.
A 2D seismic survey on block KG-ON-1, on the eastern coast, was completed in March 2003.
Following processing and interpretation of the new data, the licence partners decided to relinquish the block in August.
Well GK-22C-3 was drilled in the offshore GK-OSJ-1 block at the beginning of 2003 and was plugged and abandoned, as no moveable hydrocarbons were encountered.
Tullows costs in respect of this well were carried by its partners.
Following a thorough review of the prospectivity of the block, the licence was relinquished in December.
Work continues on offshore block GK-OS-5, where a well is planned.
The operator of onshore block GK-ON-90 2 has requested an extension to Exploration Phase I of the licence.

It operates two licences, onshore Block 9 and Blocks 17 & 18, lying mainly offshore.
Block 9 is located in a region containing significant gas fields and covers the main area of gas Rangoon infrastructure and demand around Dhaka.
During the first quarter of 2003 Tullow explored extensively in Block 9, acquiring 1,000km of 2D and 455 sq km of 3D seismic data.
Following interpretation of the newly acquired data, three prospects were selected for drilling.
The Rasulpur well was spudded in mid December 2003.
Although good quality reservoirs were present, no moveable hydrocarbons were encountered and the well was plugged and abandoned in mid February 2004.
The second well in the programme, on the Lalmai structure, was spudded in March 2004 and reached total depth in late April.
The well encountered a number of potentially gas-bearing sands and a production test process is now under way.
The final well in the programme, on the Bangora prospect, is expected to spud in late May.
No material additional work was carried out on Blocks 17 & 18 during 2003.
Negotiations with the Government of Bangladesh for a two year extension of this PSC are nearing completion.
The work programme for this extension will involve geological regional studies, including integration of the implications of recent discoveries in offshore Myanmar, immediately to the south of Block 18.
