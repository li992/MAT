GROUP BOOKED 2P RESERVES The table opposite shows reserves information at 31 December 2010 on an entitlement interest basis for the Group including 100% of both CILs and Capricorns reserves.
For accounting and reserves purposes, the Group has used an oil price assumption of $75 bbl for 2011 real 2009: $65 bbl for 2010 real.
On a direct working interest basis, proven plus probable 2P reserves as at 31 December 2010 have decreased by 27.1 million barrels of oil equivalent mmboe to 315.7 mmboe 31 December 2009: 342.8 mmboe.
The net entitlement reserves position has also decreased by 28.9 mmboe from 253.9 mmboe to 225.0 mmboe.
The Groups reserves are now all in India following the sale of its interests in Bangladesh in December 2010.
The Groups net entitlement interest to reserves is significantly geared to the oil price assumption used and the potential movement in reserves at different long-term oil prices is shown opposite.
Figures include 100% of CILs and Capricorns production and reserves.
