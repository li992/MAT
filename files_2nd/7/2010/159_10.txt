Operating performance Bulyanhulu delivered solid results in 2010, hitting key production targets for the year.
Gold production for the year was 259,873 ounces, 4% higher than the prior year periods total of 248,991 ounces mainly due to the highergrade ore mined in 2010.
Gold ounces sold for the year were 262,442 ounces, which was 1% higher than the production figure and also 3% higher than 2009.
The difference in sales was due to selling all unsold gold concentrate from the previous year, bringing the year-end finished gold inventories back to normalised levels, combined with an increase in the production base of 10,882 ounces.

The Buzwagi mine is Tanzanias second-largest mining operation and the largest single open pit mine in the country.
Accessibility to Buzwagi is good, with the location of the site immediately beside a paved highway and a 1,580-metre airstrip.
The site is also 40 kilometres from Isaka, a railway hub with links to the port of Dar es Salaam, located on the Indian Ocean.
The annual average temperature ranges between 16 and29C.
The Buzwagi mine consists of an open pit mine, ore-processing facilities, a waste-rock storage facility, a tailings storage facility, water management and other ancillary facilities.
As at 31 December 2010, atotal of 1,992 individuals were employed at Buzwagi, consisting of 802Group employees and 1,190 contracted personnel.

production by 7% and representing a 29% increase over the previous year 153,682.
The increase in gold ounces sold versus the prior year Operating performance as well as versus 2010 production was due to a combination of the gold concentrate and gold in circuit inventories that built up in the process Buzwagis gold production for the year was 186,019 ounces, compared throughout 2009 and which were subsequently sold in 2010. to189,031 ounces for the previous year, which only reflected eight months of production.
This production level was lower than Cash costs for the year were US$685 per ounce sold, compared to managements expectations for the year and was primarily due to two US$422 in 2009.
Key factors which negatively impacted cash costs reasons: firstly, the longer-than-expected time taken to process the included: i the lower-than-expected production levels: ii higher low-grade transitional ore, which adversely impacted throughput and energy costs resulting from the fuel theft: and iii higher maintenance plant recoveries, and, secondly, the short-term impact of measures and contracted services costs incurred in addressing mill downtime taken to address the systematic onsite fuel theft discovered during the and processing issues.
In addition, a number of measures were taken to third quarter.

Operating performance North Mara performed in line with expectations and showed stable production results.
The mines gold production for the year was 212,947 ounces, remaining flat when compared to the prior year figure of 212,358 ounces, where lower mine production was offset by strong mill performance.
The decrease in ore tonnes mined was a result of our continued focus on stripping at Gokona, which was offset by increased ore tonnes mined from Nyabirama.
The 2010 grade of 2.8 g t compared negatively to the 2009 grade of 3.2 g t. This was the result of processing a higher proportion of lower-grade stockpiled ore in the second half of 2010 to supplement lower production from the Nyabirama and Nyabigena open pits.
The processing plants throughput of 2,860 Kt was 10% higher than the previous year owing to high mill uptime and a favourable ore blend.
