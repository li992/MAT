10 Grainger plc Annual report and accounts 2010 Chief executive and operating review Grainger offers a geared exposure to residential property in the UK and Germany.
The UK business accounts for 80% of our total asset base and produces a range of sources of income rents, trading and development profits and returns from fund management and residential investments.
The German business is primarily focused on rental income.
Market overview The UK residential market has been characterised by strong capital growth over the last 50 years with occasional periods of price correction.
House price growth is driven by the complex relationship between supply and demand.
In the short term, as we are currently seeing, factors such as the lack of available credit and low levels of consumer confidence can depress demand.
In the longer term, however, the UK suffers from a significant imbalance between supply and demand which helps support price levels.
This imbalance is driven by a combination of the increasing number of households and the Andrew Cunningham difficulties in providing new product, primarily because of planning Chief executive restrictions and the lack of available land, and by the attraction to many home owners of investing in a long-term, tax friendly asset.
These imbalances are generally more pronounced at a local and We will continue to concentrate property type level.
For example, the central London residential on the returns from long-term market has out performed the rest of the country because of reversionary residential assets economic strength, its cosmopolitan nature and the attractiveness supplemented by other regular of sterling denominated property prices to overseas purchasers.
In contrast, other parts of the UK residential market have suffered sources of income such as through the oversupply of new build one and two bedroom management fees and apartments and through lack of confidence in the general rental yield.

It is Executive team from left to right Nick Jopling executive director characterised by price stability, by higher rental yields and by significantly for property and real estate matters lower levels of home ownership.
Returns are therefore principally driven Andrew Cunningham chief executive by rental income.
As in the UK however there are regional variations with Mark Greenwood finance director the more affluent South and South-West of the country experiencing Peter Couch executive director more rapid economic growth and greater levels of demand for housing.
for retirement solutions This in turn has led to increased investor demand for properties in areas with strong demographic profiles, such as Frankfurt and Munich.
Our operating businesses reflect these different environments and have been structured so that good levels of cash return can be achieved even when underlying general house price growth is at lower levels than we have previously experienced.

GRA03 001 | GraingerAR2010 | 17 12 2010 | Final GRA03 001 | GraingerAR2010 | 17 12 2010 | Final 12 Grainger plc Annual report and accounts 2010 Chief executive and operating review continued AVERAGE VACANT POSSESSION VALUE UK residential 2010 199,000 The UK residential business primarily consists of properties subject to a regulated 2009 189,000 tenancy, producing a gross rental yield of 3.7% and valued at 72.5% of vacant 2008 190,000 possession value.
The portfolio is geographically widespread but with a strong 2007 205,000 concentration in London and the South East, where 67% by value of these 2006 188,000 properties are situated.
Returns from this portfolio are derived from a combination of rental income and REGULATED UNITS OWNED number trading profits on the sale of property, generally when the property falls vacant 2010 5,969 a normal sale and the crystallisation of the reversionary gain.
A key aspect of 2009 6,327 this portfolio is its strong cash flow, both from rents and asset sales.
Rent arrears 2008 7,316 2007 7,655 are low at approximately 2% of the rent roll and the predictable vacancy rate 2006 7,715 in our portfolio produces a consistent stream of properties available for sale.
The properties are generally unrefurbished and of low average value average vacant possession value per unit at 30 September 2010 was 199,000 despite the high London South East weighting.
They therefore do not compete directly with the new build sector and attract demand from a range of potential purchasers including first time buyers, small scale developers and cash-led local investors.
These characteristics also provide our asset managers with the opportunity to add value through active management by, for example, refurbishing certain properties prior to their sale.
This is reflected in the results achieved in the year: completed normal sales were at values, on average, 6.6% above September 2009 valuations, the time taken for sale, measured from the date of vacancy to receipt of cash, was just 99 days and the margins that we achieved on normal sales were up to 46.2% from the 2009 figure of 37.6%.
Year-end valuations were up 4.8% from the previous September compared to the average movement in the Halifax and Nationwide housing indices of 2.9%.
This is evidence that with a carefully selected and managed portfolio, outperformance can be achieved.
During the year we sold 81m of properties from this portfolio on vacancy 2009: 46.2% 83m producing a profit of 38m 2009: 32m.
In addition to these normal sales margins achieved the portfolio provides a good opportunity for cash generation from other asset on UK residential sales.
This year we deliberately reduced the level of investment sales those with normal sales a tenant in place but we saw significant benefits from sales from our agricultural portfolio including land and agricultural related residential properties.
In total we made 40m of investment, agricultural and other sales in the year, and produced a profit of 10m 2009: 60m sales, 8m profit.
This demonstrates our ability to recognise, invest in and realise value from residential related sectors alongside the regulated portfolio.
We have recommenced a cautious buying programme in the UK residential business in 2010, acquiring some 308 units for 55.7m 2009: 7 units for 0.9m.
Given current economic conditions we have set out key criteria for purchases which include: Good prospects for long-term capital appreciation.
This is reflected by the geographic spread of our purchases this year, with some 63% by value being in London and the South East: GRA03 001 | GraingerAR2010 | 17 12 2010 | Final GRA03 001 | GraingerAR2010 | 17 12 2010 | Final Grainger plc Annual report and accounts 2010 13 Good levels of discounts and or high yields.
For example, in the year we acquired 99 days a portfolio of some 161 units in South-West England which, despite half of them average time taken being subject to regulated tenancies, delivers a cash yield of 5.8%: and from vacancy to Opportunities for redevelopment or refurbishment potential.
As an example, early cash receipt this year we acquired a portfolio of 16 units in South-West London at an average cost of 246,000, with the intention of phased development as properties fell vacant.
We have sold our first unit at a profit margin of 17% achieved within a six-month period and interest in other units has been such that we have started to sell vacant units off plan.
We believe that by applying these criteria to new acquisitions and by assiduous management of our existing portfolio we will remain in position to produce levels of return that consistently exceed the long-term return of the UK market.
INTEREST IN RETIREMENT SOLUTIONS Retirement solutions RESIDENTIAL UNITS number The retirement solutions business consists mostly of home reversion assets assets 2010 6,981 bought at a significant discount to vacant possession value with the home owner 2009 6,101 retaining a right to occupation.
This is a highly reversionary business and depends 2008 6,227 on scale to produce consistent levels of vacancy and therefore sales income.
With 2007 5,952 nearly 7,000 units, Graingers portfolio is the largest in the UK and produces a 2006 3,003 predictable level of cash flow in 2010 sales proceeds amounted to 29m, generating a profit of 10m 2009: sales 27m: profit 7m.
Certain assets in the portfolio also produce a rental income or equivalent and this amounted to 6m in the year 2009: 6m.
The assets in this portfolio are more geographically widespread than the UK residential portfolio and do not benefit from the same geographical bias towards London and the South East.
This is reflected in the valuation results for the year, which showed a smaller uplift of 2.2% at investment value level.
As with the UK residential portfolio we recommenced purchasing activity this year Sovereign Reversions plc buying some 8m of home reversion assets as well as acquiring Sovereign acquired with a Reversions plc, Sovereign an AIM listed business with a portfolio valued at portfolio valued 68m.
Shortly after our year end we announced that we had sold 50% of our at 68m equity in Sovereign to MREF II Equity Release Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Moorfield Real Estate Fund II Moorfield, and entered into a 50:50 joint venture agreement under which Moorfield will pay 50% of the acquisition and certain integration costs and Grainger will receive management fees.
The total purchase price for the company was 34.2m representing 202p per share, compared with the net asset value on acquisition of 229p per share.
As well as portfolio size and an efficient operating platform, the keys to the retirement solutions business are reputation, product innovation and distribution.
We are delighted therefore to have won the Equity Release award for Best Home Reversion provider for the fifth consecutive year and the ILP Moneyfacts Award for Best Home Reversion Provider 2010.
Both the joint venture with Moorfield and our existing directly owned holdings provide us with an extremely strong platform for growth.

The major investments are in Grainger GenInvest a 50:50 joint venture with Genesis Housing Group which owns a total of 1,443 residential units of which 56% are subject to regulated tenancies and G:res1 G:res which is a market rented fund 10.5% of 2,006 units and in which we hold a 21.6% stake.
increase in G:res Residential values in Grainger GenInvest increased by 5% in the year to the end new let rental values of September.
G:res is subject to a full valuation in December and June of each in quarter ended year and showed an increase in market values of 7.3% for the 12 months ended 30 September 2010 in June 2010, producing an increase in net asset value in the fund of 17%.
External funding arrangements in both Grainger GenInvest LLPs are due for renewal within the next 12 months.
Discussions with potential funders are progressing and we expect all external loans to be successfully refinanced.
Recent operational results at G:res provide an insight into the current UK residential rental market.
Rental increases on renewals amounted to 3.2% for the quarter ended September 2010 and increases on new lets for the same period were 10.5%.
Both results show an improvement on the previous four quarters and, together with a decrease in the level of voids, indicate a strengthening rental market.
The controlled liquidation of the Schroders Residential Property Unit Trust has been successful and is virtually complete: cash realisations were 6.3% in excess of the property value at the time of the decision of the unit holders taken to liquidate the fund in January 2009.
UK RESIDENTIAL UNITS MANAGED number Property services 2010 19,263 All of the above divisions are supported by our property services division which, in 2009 17,470 the UK, manages a total of 19,263 residential units and a gross rent roll of 76m 2008 19,433 from five regional offices.
We believe this in-house capability is a distinguishing 2007 19,312 feature of our residential business and the owner-manager mentality that it 2006 15,221 produces is one of the factors that facilitates its outperformance and secures our reputation for exceptional service.
Development The development division focuses on value creation by assembling residential development opportunities, obtaining or amending planning permissions, installing infrastructure and then either selling or self-developing plots.
As anticipated, sales in this division at 19m were lower than last years figure of 48m which included the sale of the bulk of the successful Hornsey Road development in North London.
The major focus in 2010 has been on preparing and submitting planning applications on a number of sites, in particular at Newlands near West Waterlooville in Hampshire, where we would anticipate commencing infrastructure work in June 2011, with the first land sales due GRA03 001 | GraingerAR2010 | 17 12 2010 | Final GRA03 001 | GraingerAR2010 | 17 12 2010 | Final Grainger plc Annual report and accounts 2010 15 in the first quarter of 2012.

The German business complements this by delivering gross rents 2007 4,520 of 35.1m 2009: 34.6m at gross yields of 6.9% in a largely stable price 2006 2,739 environment: year-end write downs amounted to 0.6% and related primarily to a small number of specific properties with an above average proportion of commercial space.
Our portfolio comprises 6,776 residential units and 372 commercial units located predominantly in the South and South-West of the country.
With the exception of Berlin and Potsdam, we have no exposure to markets in Eastern Germany where rental growth in most areas has been much lower due to economic weakness and poorer asset quality.
Our strategy is to improve the returns in our German business by: Undertaking a high level of active asset management aimed at improving 6.9% operational efficiency and maximising net rental returns by reducing voids and gross yield on property expenses: German residential Attracting third-party investors by placing parts of the existing portfolio into portfolio new structures which will be managed long-term by Graingers German asset management platform.
We are in discussions with a number of potential partners: and Continuing a programme of capital recycling to improve the overall quality of the asset base and enhance cash flow.
As part of this ongoing process we sold some 5m of investment assets in 2010 and have identified further assets totalling 25m to be sold in the first half of 2011.
We have also selected an initial portfolio of 10m suitable for potential tenant privatisation.
We also anticipate growth in our property manager joint venture, Gebau Vermogen, following a strengthening of senior management there during the year.
Future prospects The near-term outlook for the general economy and the UK residential market is challenging.
Nevertheless the new financial year has started well and our UK residential and development sales pipeline completed sales, contracts exchanged and properties in solicitors hands amounted to 65.3m at 3 December 2010 with residential sales values at or slightly above September 2010 vacant possession levels.
Grainger has repeatedly shown that it can outperform the general market through active management of its distinctive portfolio and by taking advantage of the broad spread of returns that it generates.
By careful application of the purchasing criteria noted above, cash generated from operations can be recycled into assets that will deliver long-term returns.
Over the last few years the proportion of private rented accommodation has increased and we believe that the changes proposed in the Comprehensive Spending Review to the social and affordable housing systems will provide opportunities for large scale, well established residential landlords such as Grainger.

UK sales pipeline at Lack of liquidity in the banking markets will necessitate changes in our balance 3 December 2010 is 65.3m sheet structure with reduced dependency on pooled bank debt sources of finance and increased emphasis on recycling capital rather than asset accumulation.
This is also likely to produce an increase in the proportion of assets funded by third party capital, either in joint ventures, as with the Sovereign Moorfield transaction or in fund structures, such as G:res1 or as planned for part of the German portfolio.
With a strengthened senior management team and the benefit of market-leading positions in the residential and home reversion market, we will continue to concentrate on the returns from long-term reversionary residential assets supplemented by other regular sources of income such as management fees and rental yield.
In addition, we have seen the benefit of opportunistic acquisitions for example our agricultural portfolio in related residential asset classes and will continue to pursue these if appropriate returns can be achieved on behalf of our shareholders.
Going forward our focus will be on: Rebalancing our residential portfolios to selective areas of value or growth, through the application of careful acquisition criteria: Reducing capital employed in non-core assets and underperforming locations: Introducing third party capital into selected business units to improve diversified returns: and Early consideration and implementation of debt financing options.
We remain confident in our ability to deliver good levels of long-term return in the residential property sector.
