Consequently, bus operating profit margin fell to 10.1%, 1.3 ppts below last year 2009: 11.4%.
As expected, this years operating profit included additional likefor-like costs for fuel of 4.0m, additional duty of around 1.0m and further pension costs of 1.9m.
This has been partly offset by a reduction in accident claim costs of 1.8m and benefits from cost saving initiatives of approximately 4.3m.
Acquisitions This was a successful year for acquisitions in the regulated and deregulated businesses, and the acquired businesses have made significant contributions to both turnover and operating profit.
Most of the increased revenue and operating profit was from East Thames Buses, a regulated business operating in the East of London, which was acquired fromTransport for London by our Go-Ahead London operation on 3 October 2009 for cash consideration of 5.0m and has now been successfully integrated into our existing depots.

joint venture with Cook Illinois Corporation to operate in the yellow school bus market.
To date, the joint venture has won its first contract in St Louis, Missouri to run approximately 120 buses and these successfully commenced operation in August 2010.
Our share of the joint venture investment at the balance sheet date was US$1.0m approximately 0.7m and at commencement of operations was approximately US$6m.
We have secured a US$10m revolving credit facility to fund our share of the operations and to provide a hedge for the US$ foreign exchange exposure on the investment.
OUTLOOK Overall, at this stage, we expect the underlying performance of our bus operations to remain robust for the next financial year.
We are assuming that the broad operating trends experienced in the second half of our 2010 financial year continue throughout the next financial year.
In London, we therefore expect a full year effect of reduced margins from January 2010, primarily through lower QIC revenue given the end of the QIC2 regime and the more difficult QIC1 targets.
We expect demand for our deregulated operations to remain robust.
Full year contribution from acquisitions is expected to add a further 1.0m to operating profit.
