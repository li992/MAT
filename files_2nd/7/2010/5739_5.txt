Operational Review OPERATIONAL REVIEW Exillon TP Exillon TP had a successful year, producing consists of three main structures with possible 1,050,997 bbl and generating revenue of US$58.3 reserves estimated at 1.2 mmbbl, and unrisked net million, thus exceeding its revenue target of US$50 prospective resources estimated at 25.6 mmbbl.
The crude oil extracted from the Exillon The new licence represents a significant addition TP fields is of high quality, with an average density to the Companys portfolio, and development of of 35 to 38 API, low sulphur content of less than the field is expected to commence in 2012.
The 0.4% and low paraffin content.
main focus at Exillon TP has been on production optimisation through the well workover In 2009 Exillon TP owned four licences three programme which commenced in early 2010, and for production and one for production and on construction of a Gas Power Generating Unit exploration.
On 25 February 2010, the Group with 1MW capacity which brought a considerable acquired an additional licence in a state auction, reduction in diesel costs.
During 2010, workover which covers 119 sq km, most of which is of 7 wells in Timan Pechora was successfully covered by 2D and 3D seismic and borders completed leading to an increase in production the west margin of the ETP V field.
The licence from 2,050 bbd to 3,350 bbd.
Exillon WS Uninterrupted production at Exillon WS started in first stage of an infield oil processing facility was June 2010, upon completion of the pipeline, infield completed, allowing production of commodity oil.
A permanent oil filling station next to the interstate road was also completed in 2010, shortening the In February 2010, Exillon WS started construction transportation distance and permitting the use of a 39km pipeline from the EWS I oil field of higher capacity trucks.
Commencement of oil to a year-round state road.
The pipeline was processing at Exillon WS in October 2010 provided successfully completed in Q2 2010, and enabled the Company with more options to sell its oil and the Group to unlock the potential of Exillon WS by to reduce transportation and processing costs making possible year-round production.
The Group has now signed an agreement and started trucking oil from Exillon WS to the oil To reduce dependence on third parties and to filling station owned by Ritek, which is about 70km improve the economics of oil production, the closer than the previous alternative.
Drilling Exillon WS drilled seven wells during the period, In addition in 2010, two legacy wells were achieving a 100% drilling success rate.
The wells successfully re-entered and tested with results were drilled with an average drilling time of 30 supporting the possibility that the EWS II and III days per well, and at an average cost of US$1.2 fields could form a single large accumulation.
Five wells drilled on EWS I fields were tested and achieved an average test flow rate of 524 bbl day of water-free oil.
8 Exillon Energy Exillon Energy Operational Review Reserves Based on the updated reserves report effective 31 December 2010 prepared by Miller & Lents, the Groups 1P reserves increased by 72% to 112 million barrels, 2P reserves increased by 82% to 239 million barrels and its 3P reserves increased 19% to 439 million barrels.
Exillon WS: The estimate of the total proved 1P recoverable 302 million barrels.
This increase in reserves is oil reserves within the Exillon WS license area attributable to the seven wells drilled in West has increased 112% from 25 million barrels to 52 Siberia since September 2009, and improvement million barrels.
The estimate of the total proved in recovery factors due to the start of year round plus probable 2P recoverable oil reserves within production and oil field development optimization.
Exillon WS has increased 89% from 74 million This increase does not take into account successful barrels to 139 million barrels, and the estimate wells drilled in 2011, and does not reflect the of the total proved plus probable plus possible Groups assertion that the boundaries of the EWS 3P recoverable oil reserves within Exillon WS III field are likely to extend further to the north and has increased 11% from 272 million barrels to connect with the EWS II field.
