This was lower than that achieved in 2009 due to unplanned maintenance requirements on UK North Sea fields in the Balmoral, Scott and Wytch Farm areas and due to some flooding-related downtime at the Zamzama field in Pakistan.
Production in other areas remained steady, with strong gas demand and good production performance in both Pakistan and Indonesia.
