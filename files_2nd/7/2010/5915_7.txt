The FPM mine is approximately 330 metres deep and 6 kilometres long.
The Mine Life Extension programme see Growth Projects below will extend the life of the mine to 2038.
In 2010, FPM mined approximately 28.9 million tonnes 2009: 28.5 million tonnes of ore producing 11.2 million tonnes of concentrate 2009: 10.6 million tonnes and 9.0 million tonnes of 62% Fe and 65% Fe pellets 2009: 8.6 million tonnes.
FPMs nominal processing capacity is 12 million tonnes of pellets per annum.
During 2010, FPM produced 998 thousand tonnes of pellets from purchased third party concentrate.
FPM plans to continue to purchase third party concentrate, provided acceptable margins can be realised, in order to utilise its surplus pelletising capacity and to extend Ferrexpos brand through increased sales.
In total during 2010, the Group produced 10 million tonnes of pellets of which 5.2 million tonnes were 62% Fe pellets 2009: 4.5 million tonnes and 4.9 million tonnes were 65% Fe pellets 2009: 4.3 million tonnes.

During the financial crisis in late 2008 and 2009, iron ore spot prices fell well below the annual benchmark price.
During this period steel mills increasingly opted to buy iron ore from the spot market.
Since then, a variety of pricing mechanisms have been introduced which Ferrexpo plc 22 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Operating Review continued Production operating statistics table The table below highlights FPMs production statistics in 2010 and 2009.

Growth projects Mine life extension project at FPM Ferrexpos capital expenditure projects are aimed at the The Board has approved expenditure of US$168 million expansion and upgrade of the existing mine and over a period of eight years to extend the life of the existing processing facilities and to unlock the considerable value FPM mine to 2038.
The project will involve additional in the Groups under-exploited reserves and resources, stripping works in 2011 of around 15 million cubic metres starting with FYM.
to allow access to additional ore from 2014.
As a result, the ore output from the existing mine will peak at 35 million As part of this strategy, in November 2010, the Board tonnes per annum by 2014 compared to the current output approved US$647 million of capital expenditure projects of 28 million tonnes per annum.
Ferrexpo Yeristovskoye Mine FYM The Board authorised expenditure of US$267 million to achieve first ore from the Yeristovskoye deposit which will deliver circa 5.5 million tonnes of primary crushed ore to the FPM processing facilities for conversion into approximately 1.9 million tonnes of pellets.
This is expected to be completed by the first half of 2013 and will increase total Group pellet output to 12 million tonnes per annum of own ore.
The next phases of FYMs capital investment programme will involve the construction of concentrating and pelletising facilities in order to process the remaining circa 21.5 million tonnes of annual ore capacity at FYM.
These stages are Ferrexpos capital expenditure subject to the Groups continuing technical review and analysis, availability of funds and Board approval.
projects are aimed at the Quality upgrade project at FPM expansion and upgrade of the The Board has approved expenditure of US$212 million for existing mine and processing the upgrade of the existing concentrator facilities at the FPM processing facilities to increase the proportion of 65% facilities and to unlock the Fe pellets to 100%.
This will allow access to new markets considerable value in the Groups and increase the average price that Ferrexpo receives for its pellets.
Currently approximately half of the Groups under-exploited reserves and production is 65% Fe pellets and the other half is 62% Fe pellets.
The project is scheduled for completion by the end resources, starting with FYM.
