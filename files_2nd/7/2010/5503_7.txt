EnQuest has well developed policies and processes, monitored at Board level that set continuously improving targets compared with acknowledged industry benchmarks.
EnQuest has established a series of both leading and lagging indicators which are monitored at each Board meeting.
A long established lagging indicator which EnQuest measures is the number of lost time accidents.
EnQuest is committed to working towards not having any such accidents, whilst the 0.21 LTA rate recorded by EnQuest and its leading contractors in 2010 is in the upper quartile of HSE performance in the industry.
