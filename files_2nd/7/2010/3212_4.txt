Business Review British Gas British Gas Leading the way towards a low carbon future Customer service adviser in Cardiff Downstream UK British Gas had a strong year, both operationally and financially.
In residential energy supply, our focus on customer service, innovation, and a competitive pricing position resulted in a higher number of accounts.
In a year of exceptionally cold weather, average gas consumption rose by 11%, more than offsetting the underlying savings in consumption made by customers as a result of energy efficiency improvements.
In business energy supply we focus the business on three customer segments small enterprise, medium enterprise and multi-site customers.
This has allowed us to deliver high and differentiated levels of customer service and to pursue a volume-to-value strategy which focuses on retaining and acquiring high value customers in each segment.
With the Phil Bentley on growing the business in a low Connaught transaction, we also took a material step forward in our carbon world ambition to build a larger scale business energy services presence.
In residential services, we achieved a further increase in the A low carbon future is a world in number of customer account holdings, reflecting our commitment to continually improve the responsiveness and quality of service which we all use less energy.

As Britains leading energy supplier, we are growing our Overall, the number of British Gas accounts increased by 529,000 business by insulating homes, installing energy efficient during 2010, while the number of joint product households, those boilers, fitting solar panels and other microgeneration in the which take both an energy and a services product from us, increased home, and leading the revolution in smart metering.

continued sales of services products to energy customers.
Despite the challenging economic climate, sales of central heating service contracts towards the end of the year were strong.
Over six million of our services contracts are now insurance based, meaning we are able to offer most customers a more flexible product range.
We also reached agreement with our service and repair engineers regarding new contract terms and conditions, enabling us to offer greater flexibility to meet increased customer demand for evening and weekend appointments and during peak winter periods.
During the sustained period of cold weather in December we received record levels of breakdown call-outs, 25% OUR STRATEGY IN ACTION: higher than the corresponding period in December 2009.
Following improved preparation for peak periods of demand our growing British Gas engineers were able to visit up to 35,000 customers a day around double the amount normally visited on a typical winters delivering value from upstream day despite facing difficult driving conditions.
We prioritised work to reach vulnerable customers first.

This reflects the investment made in the asset since its acquisition in 2002, and came in a year of record levels of injection and withdrawal.
The exceptionally cold weather in January and February resulted in a record low Net Reservoir Volume NRV in March, followed by injection during the summer months of more than 100 billion cubic feet bcf.
More cold weather late in the year led to 47 days of consecutive withdrawals between the middle of November and the end of December, resulting in the lowest ever NRV at the end of a year.

Rough, which provides over 70% of UK storage capacity, is an important asset for both Centrica and the UK.
The UK has significantly less storage capacity than other European countries, and gas storage can play an important role in ensuring UK security of supply into the future.
When Centrica bought Rough the acquisition was the subject of a Competition Commission inquiry which was cleared in August 2003 subject to certain undertakings.
Broadly, the original undertakings included conditions that Centrica would keep no more than 15% of Roughs OUR STRATEGY IN ACTION: capacity for its own use, and would maintain Centrica Storage legally, financially and physically separate from the rest of the growing British Gas Group to make sure Centrica does not benefit from a competitive advantage in the retail market from owning the UKs primary delivering value from upstream storage facility.
