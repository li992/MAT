A significant advantage is that the cobalt production is independent of copper production and manufacture.
The cobalt grades and impurity loadings in the ore enable high quality cathode to be produced using a cost-effective heap leach to SX EW process.
Over time this will facilitate a bottom-quartile cost position and greater protection against price volatility.
