The MOPU is a former jack-up drilling rig that has been converted to a production facility by removing the drilling package and replacing it with a processing unit.
The facility has the initial capacity to handle oil production of 50,000 bopd, and has been designed to allow for onsite expansion and upgrade to accommodate production from future additional development phases.
The advantages of utilising a converted jack-up were many: the installation of the unit did not require a derrick barge, and it could be installed whilst drilling operations were in progress, allowing for simultaneous installation and drilling with minimal interruptions to work.
The FSO provides a storage volume in excess of 1.2 mmbbls, which allows for the sale of million-barrel cargoes that in turn provide us with maximum flexibility to optimise shipping and crude marketing economics.

Afren is the sole owner of the Lion Gas Plant, which processes gas from the CI-11 and adjacent CI-26 and CI-40 blocks operated by Canadian Natural Resources.
The plant has an inlet capacity of 75 mmcfd and strips gasoline and butane from the rich gas stream it receives.
The butane is sold into the local market meeting approximately 35% of the domestic butane demand and gasoline is spiked into the CI-11 crude stream and sold on the international market.
The plant benefits from tax-exempt status and the average NGL production at the LGP in 2010 was 721 boepd.
