low grade mineralisation was extended to the east of the ore body and included in the preliminary mine plan.
Construction of the mine was approved in 2H 2010, following the results obtained from the pre-feasibility study.
The mine will be an open pit heap leach operation similar to the existing Herradura and Soledad-Dipolos mines with a Merrill-Crowe plant and will require estimated pre-operative capex of US$63.0 million.
Fresnillo plc 2010 Annual Report 50 REVIEW OF OPERATIONS continued Exploration Exploration is the key driver of growth for the Group, and we maintain a policy of continuous investment across price cycles.
Our exploration portfolio includes projects that extend across the multiple stages of exploration detection, discovery and definition, resulting in a strong pipeline of growth.
EXPLORE The Groups exploration programme is carefully fidesigned and executed with continued focus on consolidating our presence in the principal silver and gold districts of Mexico, and in selected properties acquired in Peru where work has been initiated.
In 2010 our team of exploration geologists and engineers was increased from 55 to 70 professionals, and the land position increased from 1.7 to 1.9 million hectares, including the Candamea Chihuahua, and Cebadillas and la Yesca Nayarit properties optioned from third parties.
The Group has four Exploration Offices in Zacatecas, Toluca, Chihuahua and Hermosillo.
Each has an HSECR programme focused on health, safety, environmental management systems and community engagement initiatives that allow us to build positive relationships from the earliest interactions.
In 2010, the Groups exploration programme comprised 341,265 metres of drilling, mapping, geochemical sampling, and geophysical surveys.
Approximately half of the budget was invested in drilling which resulted in a substantial increase to the resource base.
