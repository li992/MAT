Our skills can be used across our different divisions, bringing them together and creating a group where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.
By sharing our experiences and ideas, we can maximise the value from our assets and of our people.
Our operating divisions are supported by our property management division which has over 140 staff in our seven UK and one German office.
Our main operating divisions and the market value of each as a percentage of our total property and investment assets are: operating divisions Core portfolio Primarily our portfolio of properties subject to regulated tenancies Retirement solutions Our interest in home reversion and retirement related assets Fund management and Investments in managed funds G:res1 and Schroders investments in residential and in Grainger GenInvest joint ventures Development Focused on relatively large scale residential or residential led mixed use developments Continental Europe Principally investment in German residential portfolios I V I S I O C l o a N r t e e % 5 n p p e o 0 A 7 o n r i r u t t S 1 % n f E o o l C i A o P E R t n C e m E p % N o l e 5 T v e A D t G n s e % E e m d r t e n u n 6 g u i t F a o n j n e a v m Chief executives review 13 Core portfolio 2008 2007 Regulated units owned Regulated units owned 7,316 7,655 Market value 1,000m 1,221m 08 7,316 Vacant possession value 1,399m 1,571m 07 7,655 Other assets vacants, assured etc 803 882 06 7,715 Market value 190m 196m 05 8,161 Vacant possession value 216m 220m Despite the difficult market conditions, the liquidity of our core portfolio remained strong and sales proceeds have increased by 10.3% to 141m from 128m.
This has been achieved through a concerted effort to maintain volumes and by careful selection of suitable properties for investment sales these occur when a property is sold with a tenant in place, as opposed to normal sales which occur on vacancy.
The number of units sold was 817 of which 302 were investment sales 2007: 86 investment sales out of a total of 661. core portfolio The average value achieved on normal sales has remained static at 193,000 and over the course of the whole year those sales achieved a slight fall of 0.7% from September 2007 vacant possession values, an indicator of the prudence of our valuation process and the resilience of the portfolio.
Margins on normal sales have fallen from 50.7% to 45.9%.
Proceeds and profit from investment sales amounted to 41m and 17m respectively 2007: 17m and 10m.
In line with our stated intentions in our interim statement in May we significantly reduced acquisitions in this portfolio in the latter part of the year.
In total we acquired 403 units for 80m 2007: 863 units for 151m of which only 72 units costing 9.5m were purchased in the second half of the year.
Operating contribution from this division comprising profits on sale of trading and investment assets together with net rents and other income, after deducting divisional overheads amounted to 83m 2007: 81m.

We have sold interests in 185 assets in the retirement solutions portfolio including CHARM for 27.2m and recorded a profit on sale of 10.9m 2007: 146 assets, 18.5m proceeds, 7.7m profit.
As with the core portfolio, we have taken steps to reduce acquisitions although the long home lead time in the home reversion process means that the results of this will not be seen fully reversion until the financial year ending September 2009.
During the year ended 30 September 2008, plans we acquired 460 assets for 43m, compared to 2,889 assets for 252m in 2007.
The performance of the two major acquisitions made in 2007 has been in line with expectations: CHARM, where realisations have been as expected and The Capital Appreciation Trust Isle of Man plc CAT where we have reduced vacancy rates from 25% to 6% since acquisition.
Operating contribution from this division on the same basis as the core portfolio but excluding the CHARM revaluation amounted to 16m 2007: 9m.
For the third consecutive year, our Bridgewater business has been named as Home Reversion Provider of the Year by Mortgage Solutions.

This lifted our German portfolio to a critical mass of some 7,289 units including 395 commercial.
Our current focus is to integrate FRM with our existing business and to improve returns through rent reviews, void reductions and cost savings.
In addition, in europe August we appointed Peter Brock formerly Head of Asset Management of listed German real estate company Vivacon AG, as managing director of Grainger Deutschland GmbH, our German advisory business.
The operating contribution from our German portfolio comprising profits on sale of investment assets together with net rents and other income after deducting divisional overheads in the year was 11.4m.
The revaluation movement on the portfolio, however, resulted in asset writedowns of 8.6m.
The net rental yield is running at 5.1% 2007: 4.5%.
External debt amounts to 285m and is non-recourse to Grainger plc.
Our other European interest relates to a joint venture company in which we have a 50% stake and which owns a development site in Zizkov, Prague.
Our original stake was 81.6% and we have sold this down to realise a profit in the year of 3.5m.
Our investment in this joint venture, with land at market value, amounts to 10.6m and the development is going through the planning process.
Prospects Since the year end we have continued to sell properties.
As at 30 November, we had completed, exchanged contracts on or had put in solicitors hands normal sales amounting to 32.0m, 0.1% above September 2008 vacant possession values.
As well as our ongoing programme of selling properties on vacancy we have identified circa.
100m of additional properties for sale from our core and development portfolios although this is obviously dependent upon both market conditions and availability of funding.
We continue to examine opportunities to bring in third-party equity through the establishment of joint ventures or other structures.
Also, since the year end we have taken action to reduce our overhead running rate by a further 10%.
Our commitment is to continue to manage the business in a prudent way through these turbulent market conditions.
Our portfolio is uniquely resilient, with its mix of property types, tenures and excellent liquidity.
It is held for the long term and this will help us through the short and medium-term corrections that are taking place.
Real estate is a cyclical activity and we are confident that we have in place the assets, people and management platform that will ensure we are strongly positioned to take advantage of the opportunities that will undoubtedly arise.
