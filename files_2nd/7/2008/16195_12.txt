Both regions have contributed to substantial reserves and resources growth and are now being commercialised on a fast-track basis.
2008 Highlights In Africa, Tullow has 47 licences in 14 countries, 17 producing fields, approximately 745 mmboe booked 41,150 boepd reserves and resources and majority interests in two world-class basins in Ghana and Uganda.
Average working interest production Ghana 100% success In 2008, the Group focused on the Phase 1 development Achieved from 15 exploration and appraisal wells of the Jubilee field, an appraisal campaign to determine in Ghana and Uganda the ultimate field size and exploration work to establish the upside potential of the remainder of the basin.
296 mmboe Reserves and resources added to the African portfolio Outstanding exploration success In February 2008, the Odum field was discovered in the West 1.8 billion barrels Cape Three Points block, some 13 km east of Jubilee.
This discovery opened up a new Campanian geological play in Significant upside potential identified through exploratory a previously unexplored reservoir interval.
In November 2008, appraisal drilling in 2008 Tullow drilled the Ebony-1 commitment well in the Shallow Water Tano block which encountered normal pressured oil sand and an over-pressured gas-condensate sand Sales revenue million up-dip from Tweneboa.

qxp:Layout 1 27 3 09 22:12 Page 23 Group overview Directors report: Business review Directors report: Corporate governance Financial statements Highly successful Jubilee appraisal programme Three exploratory appraisal wells, Mahogany-2, Hyedua-2 and Mahogany-3, were drilled on the Jubilee structure during the year.
Each of the wells were approximately 5 km away from the original discovery well and each intersected considerable hydrocarbon columns in the Upper and Lower Mahogany sands which are both in lateral pressure communication.
The Mahogany-3 well also discovered oil in a third and potentially extensive underlying sand, Mahogany Deep, which is being considered for appraisal drilling in 2009.
These results led to a significant upgrade in the gross resource base for the field with the most-likely P50 case being upgraded to 1.2 billion barrels with an upside potential case of 1.8 billion barrels.
It is anticipated that the initial development area has gross reserves of 490 million barrels resulting in Tullow booking its net share of 170 million barrels at year-end.
Further extension of the eastern part of the Jubilee field may be targeted through an additional Mahogany exploratory appraisal well before the end of 2009.
Flow tests performed on both Mahogany-2 and Hyedua-2 confirmed that Jubilee is a highly productive and well connected reservoir and that once the wells have been configured for long-term production, they should be Blackford Dolphin rig drilling Hyedua-2 appraisal well offshore Ghana.

In January 2008, the Doris prospect was drilled but was unsuccessful and was plugged and abandoned.
The CMS Area fields continue to produce strongly.
Technical work has identified the potential to access undepleted reservoir compartments in the Ketch field by drilling further infill wells.
These wells will most likely be drilled in 2010.
Two infill wells are currently drilling on the Murdoch and Boulton fields and these are expected to start producing in the second and third quarters of 2009.
Detailed design work has also been carried out for the Harrison development.
Sanction of the project is expected in the first half of 2009 and tendering for the platform and pipeline materials is CGG Venturer vessel prior to the start of a 2D seismic survey, offshore Portugal.
In June 2008, Tullow completed the sale of non-core CMS exploration and development assets to Venture Production for a consideration of 35 million.
Netherlands Recognising the maturity and future limits in materiality to Tullow of the CMS Area, but leveraging our highly successful exploration campaigns in this region, Tullow has extended its exploration portfolio into the adjacent, relatively unexplored area of the Dutch sector.
In 2008, Tullow added five blocks to its portfolio, taking the total to seven.
In 2009, Tullow will focus on seismic reprocessing and interpretation to refine the prospect portfolio in preparation for a drilling Lorna Greig, geologist in the Europe asset team on a geological field trip in campaign in 2010.

If the evaluation proves encouraging, the forward work programme could India include additional 3D seismic acquisition and an exploration well by 2011.
2008 was a disappointing year for Tullow in relation to its Indian operations.
Three exploration wells were drilled on South Asia Block CB-ON 1 with no hydrocarbons being encountered.
All three wells were plugged and abandoned.

In November 2008, Tullow enhanced its South American portfolio through the acquisition of a 30% interest in the Georgetown Block offshore Guyana, from the YPF Group.
The block covers 11,100 sq km, in water depths of 50 to 200 metres, with geological characteristics similar to French Guiana and the proven basins on the other side of the Atlantic.
A 1,880 sq km 3D seismic survey was acquired during the fourth quarter of 2008 and the focus for 2009 will be the interpretation and integration of this new data with the objective of identifying exploration targets for drilling in 2010.
Suriname In Suriname, Tullow has interests in the onshore Uitkijk and Coronie blocks which lie adjacent to the Tambaredjo field, the countrys main producing heavy oil field.
The 2008 drilling programme commenced in December with five shallow wells drilled in the Uitkijk licence.
The results are currently being reviewed and integrated into the regional database.
The Uitkijk drilling programme will be followed by a five-well exploration programme on the Coronie block in early 2009.
