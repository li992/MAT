From the record highs reached earlier in the year, platinum and rhodium prices decreased by 61% and 88% respectively, ending the year at $899 and $1,250 per ounce respectively.
Weaker demand is leading a number of PGM producers to scale back production and to defer planned expansions.
Outlook Despite the current economic situation, the medium to long-term outlook for PGMs remains positive.
Recent deferrals of capital projects are likely to lead to more severe supply-side constraints, while demand is expected to improve in line with economic conditions and in response to the stimulus packages introduced by major countries, the tightening of emissions legislation globally and increased penetration of dieselpowered vehicles in Europe and, in particular, the US.

Production from the underground operations is scheduled to replace opencast tonnage, maintaining current milling throughput.
The Western Decline System should reach steady state production by 2011 and the Eastern Decline System by 2012, doubling current production levels.
Elandsfontein has an estimated mine life of approximately 50 years.
The acquisition of the fide Wildt property for $12 million has enhanced the Elandsfontein resource and will result in an extension of the open pit mineable area as well as provide access to the Madibeng lease area.
An extensive exploration programme at the Madibeng and fide Wildt properties commenced during August 2008.
Exploration drilling is also under way at the Beestkraal property, where the first five boreholes have intersected both the Merensky and UG2 reef horizons.
A binding Heads of Agreement was concluded with Nkwe Platinum Ltd and Genorah Resources Ltd in August, giving Xstrata the exclusive option to acquire a 50% interest in the project located on the Eastern Limb of the Bushveld Igneous Complex.
Pre-feasibility work is progressing well with a total of 53,000 metres of exploration drilling completed to date.
The pre-feasibility drilling programme is scheduled to be completed in the third quarter of 2009.
