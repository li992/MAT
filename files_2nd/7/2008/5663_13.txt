The Groups production assets are largely located in the Republic of Kazakhstan.
The Groups entities, in the period, United States.
employed approximately 67,000 people 2007: 64,000 people, including about 3,000 added in H1 2008 with the acquisition of Serov and a further 600 from Tuoli in H2 2008.
In 2008, the Group accounted for approximately 5% of the Republic of Kazakhstans GDP.
The Group currently sells its products around the world, with the majority of sales being to Russia, China, Japan, Western Europe and the United States.
For the year ended 31 December 2008, the Group had revenue of US$6,823 million 2007: US$4,106 million and profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Group of US$2,642 million 2007: US$798 million.
In 2008 production in the Groups ongoing operations saw steady growth in the first nine months against the comparable period in 2007.
Group revenue For the full year, production was reduced in the Ferroalloys and Iron Ore Divisions following the production cutbacks in Q4 2008.
Ore grades 2008 US$6,823 million 4.2 billion remained broadly consistent.
Total Ferroalloys Division production benefited from the inclusion of Serov from Q2 2008.
Production in both 2007 US$4,106 million the Energy and in the Alumina and Aluminium Division increased, with the additional benefit of the new aluminium smelter.
Logistics Division Profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Group total shipments fell for the year following the downturn in Q4.
Description of ENRCs business 20 08 US$2,642 million 4.2 billion The Group has five operating Divisions: 2 007 US$798 million Ferroalloys Division The Ferroalloys Division primarily produces and sells ferrochrome, as well as other ferroalloys for use as alloying products in the production of steel, whilst manganese and chrome ore are sold to third party producers of ferroalloys as well as the chemical industry.
The Ferroalloys Divisions chrome ore reserves are believed to be the largest in the CIS 183 million tonnes as at 31 December 2008 and are believed to have a higher grade of chrome content 41.4% than those of other large scale producers.
In 2008, the Ferroalloys Division produced 3,629 thousand tonnes of saleable chrome ore 2007: 3,687 thousand tonnes, 1,024 thousand tonnes of saleable manganese ore concentrate 2007: 935 thousand tonnes and 1,551 thousand tonnes of ferroalloys 2007: 1,469 thousand tonnes, including 1,054 thousand tonnes of its primary product, high-carbon ferrochrome 2007: 1,070 thousand tonnes.

ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 27 the Ferroalloys Division had revenue of US$4,151 million 2007: US$2,178 million, which represented 60.8% 2007: 53.0% of the Groups consolidated revenue.
As reported in the Chief Executives Statement, in early April 2008 the Group announced the completion of the acquisition of a controlling interest in Serov, a ferroalloy producer in Russia.
The acquisition demonstrated a number of important aspects of our strategy.
This transaction was ENRCs first acquisition outside of the Republic of Kazakhstan and, longer term, reinforced our position in low-carbon and medium-carbon ferrochrome, with potential incremental annual sales, including high-carbon ferrochrome, of approximately 200 thousand tonnes of ferroalloys.
In addition, the transaction will allow the Group to benefit from further scale within its ferroalloys business and provides an important asset base in Russia, supporting the Groups strategy of regional expansion.
In mid October 2008 the Group announced the completion of the acquisition of 50% of Tuoli.
Tuoli is one of Chinas largest ferrochrome plants with a potential annual capacity of 120 thousand tonnes of high-carbon ferrochrome.
The acquisition gave the Group the advantage of a direct presence in the Chinese market.
Ferroalloys Division third party revenue The Ferroalloys Division is vertically integrated, having its own chrome ore and manganese ore mines feeding its ferroalloy production in the 2008 US$4,151 million 4.2 billion Republic of Kazakhstan, Russia and China.
As well as having its own ore, the Division also benefits from competitively priced electricity 2007 US$2,178 million supplied by the Energy Division, as well as having a gas-fired power station at its Aktobe plant.
Percentage of the Groups consolidated revenue Competitive position The Ferroalloys Division has several significant advantages over those 2008 60.8% 4.2 billion of its major competitors.
First, the Republic of Kazakhstans geographic 2007 53.0% location is close to the key economies of China and Russia, which over the medium term are expected to achieve higher than average GDP growth.
Benefiting from secure and relatively low cost transportation ENRC is well placed to take advantage of the eventual upturn in demand.
Secondly, based on 2008 production data, the Ferroalloy Division is believed to be the largest producer of ferrochrome on a chrome unit basis in the world and this position has been further strengthened by the acquisitions in 2008.
Thirdly, on a chrome content basis, the Group is located at the bottom of the ferrochrome production cost curve.
This cost advantage is driven, largely, by the relatively low cost of electricity consumed by the Groups ferroalloys plants, with a significant proportion of this electricity being derived from the Groups low cost coal reserves and its generating capacity.
In addition the higher chrome content of the Groups ore reserves renders its ferrochrome more attractive to steel producers as they prefer to limit trace elements, reduce the generation of slag and control carbon DO NOT USE TRACKING ON ANY PART OF THIS JOB!

28 ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Business Review continued content.
The Division also has the capability to produce a range of Operating Review continued chromium products.
These products include high-, mediumand low-carbon ferrochrome, including speciality grades such as lowphosphorus, titanium and vanadium bearing material.
This allows it to supply a diverse customer base with applications in the production of steel used in the automotives sector, white goods, construction and power generation industries.
Production summary The table to the left sets out the production volumes for each of the Ferroalloys Divisions principal saleable products including Serov from Q2 2008 and Tuoli from Q4 2008 for the years ended 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007.
Production of saleable chrome ore remained broadly steady, a 1.6% decrease, with growth in the saleable concentrates production of manganese ore, 9.5%, and iron-manganese ore, 28.1%.
Total ferroalloys production increased 5.6%, including ferrochrome, 4.3%.
The greatest increase was achieved in lowand medium-carbon ferrochrome production, as well as in ferrosilicon and ferrosilicochrome production.
This was mainly as a result of the inclusion of Serov.
Supply and demand Production summary Years ended 31 December The largest geographic source of ferrochrome supplied to the stainless 2008 steel industry is South Africa, comprising 45% of 2008 global 2008 2007 vs 2007 production, with the Republic of Kazakhstan as the second largest 1 Chrome ore supplier at 14%.

As a result of the over-supply a number of producers announced production cutbacks in Q4 2008 in order to balance inventory and control working capital.
The net effect of the downturn in demand is that production of stainless steel will show a year-on-year drop to about 26.6 million tonnes, a level last seen in 2006.
With a weak outlook for the global economy in 2009 we expect that stainless steel volumes in 2009 potentially may see some further weakness on the levels of 2008.
It is anticipated that growth in global stainless steel production and demand for ferrochrome are likely to recover in the medium term and DO NOT USE TRACKING ON ANY PART OF THIS JOB!
ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 29 regain a growth rate of around 6% per annum with a return to capacity utilisation of around 90%.
ENRC believes that the future supply demand balance for chrome ore will depend on three key factors.
First, India may continue to reduce chrome ore exports to secure supply for its domestic ferrochrome producers through increasing existing export duties on chromite.
Secondly, the scale of South African chrome ore exports remains uncertain.
Increased production of ferroalloys in South Africa will only occur once electricity generating capacity is available and markets have recovered sufficiently to justify investment.
Finally, whilst the production of platinum group metals PGM continues in South Africa, cheap by-products will continue to enter the market whilst margins allow sales to remain profitable.
Sales and pricing Prices for ferrochrome are typically negotiated on a quarterly basis in the European and Japanese markets with volumes covered by long-term supply contracts with terms ranging from one to five years.
In the US prices are adjusted according to published indices for ferrochrome.
Demand for high-carbon ferrochrome was extremely strong in H1 2008 as stainless steel production reached record levels.
Demand was further enhanced by the announcement by ESKOM, the South African electricity generator, of generation constraints in South Africa, leading Sales volumes Years ended 31 December to increased security stocking of ferrochrome.
The resulting market 2008 squeeze fuelled the largest ever single quarterly move of the 2008 2007 vs 2007 benchmark price, rising US$0.72 per pound of chrome in Q2 2008 to Ferroalloys: US$1.92 per pound of chrome.
Strong, although waning, demand High-carbon ferrochrome 000 t 859 1,033 16.8 % continued into early Q3 2008, despite the effects of a slowing US Medium-carbon ferrochrome 000 t 55 35 57.1% economy, with the benchmark price rising a further 13 US cents.
For Q4 Low-carbon ferrochrome 000 t 69 35 97.1% 2008 the price fell back 20 US cents to US$1.85 per pound of chrome Ferrosilicochrome 000 t 59 59 0.0% and demand for ferrochrome dropped by around 1 million tonnes, or Ferrosilicomanganese 000 t 141 173 18.5 % 50%.
Although the industry initiated production cutbacks these were Ferrosilicon 000 t 48 33 45.5% not enough to prevent stock increases and it is estimated that around Total ferroalloys 000 t 1,231 1,368 10.0 % 0.5 million tonnes of stock was added during Q4 2008.
2008 stainless Chrome ore 000 t 702 1,177 40.4 % steel production was estimated at 26.6 million tonnes, down 7% on Manganese ore 000 t 753 615 22.4% 2007.
Stainless steel has enjoyed annualised growth of 5% per annum Ferromanganese ore 000 t 529 265 99.6% over the last 10 years.
Production of stainless steel, hence demand for ferrochrome, is likely to remain limited by continued destocking at least in the short term.
Longer-term growth in production of stainless steel will likely recover in line with the recovery in the global economy.
Prices for lowand medium-carbon ferrochrome performed well through much of 2008 as a result of increased demand, particularly from the alloy and engineering steel sectors, with prices more than doubling on the back of a tightening supply.
Chrome ore also traded at historic levels, reflecting the industrys high level of capacity utilisation and the need for high quality ore. Prices softened towards the end of 2008 in response to the economic downturn and its effect on alloy and stainless steel production.
Manganese alloys also saw record demand as a result of high production levels of carbon steel.
This fuelled prices as material supply demand balance tightened leading to greater demand for ore as the alloy industry tried to optimise its capacity utilisation and take advantage of market conditions.
As with ferrochrome the demand for manganese suffered in Q4 2008.
In 2008, the Ferroalloys Divisions top five customers accounted for 26.8% 2007: 30.3% of the Divisions sales revenue to third parties and included Taiyuan Iron and Steel Group Co. Ltd in China, Pohang Iron and Steel Company, JFE Steel Corporation, ChEMK and Nippon Steel.
Sales volumes The table to the left sets out the Ferroalloys Divisions volume of third party sales by product for the years ended 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007.

Key initiatives The key objectives for the Ferroalloys Division are: to expand operations with substantial margins and returns on capital based on the low-cost, large scale and high-grade ore resources available to the Group: reduce production costs by replacing outdated equipment: further strengthen the Groups leading market position in ferroalloys worldwide: and to improve the environmental and safety performance of the Division.
Following revisions to the Groups capital expenditure programme the main projects and schedule for the Division are: Construction of a second pelletising plant at Donskoy GOK, of 700 thousand tonnes per annum, is on schedule and its completion is expected in mid 2009.
The pelletising plant will also produce saleable products from the output of an enrichment plant.
The total estimated cost of the project is US$110 million.
Construction of a second enrichment plant at Donskoy GOK, for completion in mid 2009, will enable a further expansion of pellet production, and allow greater control over mining volumes and operational costs Iron Ore Division third party revenue while increasing the utilisation of the mined ore. Building new DC furnaces at the Aktobe processing plant and 2008 US$1,498 million 4.2 billion a mine expansion at a cost of approximately US$590 million, and with completion planned for 2012.
This project is expected 2007 US$991 million to enhance productivity, give incremental production of approximately 170 thousand tonnes and generate substantial Percentage of the Groups consolidated revenue cost savings, particularly for key input materials such as reductants, including coke.
Furthermore, the installation of modern smelting furnaces is expected to result in significant environmental and 2008 22.0% 4.2 billion safety improvements.
2007 24.1% Iron Ore Division The Iron Ore Division operates the largest iron ore mining and processing enterprise in the Republic of Kazakhstan and produces and sells iron ore concentrate and pellets primarily to steel producers.
On the basis of 2008 data it is believed to be one of the worlds significant exporters of iron ore and to be in the lowest third of the industry cost curve for global iron ore pellet production.
The Iron Ore Divisions operations include iron ore mines, crushing, beneficiation and pelletising plants and a thermal power station.
In 2008, the Iron Ore Division mined 37.8 million tonnes of iron ore 2007: 40.2 million tonnes.
This was processed into 15.5 million tonnes of iron ore concentrate 2007: 16.8 million tonnes, of which 7.5 million tonnes was sold 2007: 7.4 million tonnes and the balance was used to produce 7.0 million tonnes of iron ore pellets 2007: 8.6 million Below Second right Chrome ore pelletiser, Donskoy Mining of manganese and iron, GOK, Kazchrome, Khromtau Ushkatyn III Mine, Zhairem GOK, Zhairem, Karaganda region Right Aktobe Ferroalloy Plant Far right Kazchrome, Aktobe Magnetite iron ore, Kazmarganets, Kazchrome, Karaganda DO NOT USE TRACKING ON ANY PART OF THIS JOB!
ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 31 tonnes.
For the year ended 31 December 2008, the Iron Ore Division had revenue of US$1,498 million 2007: US$991 million, which represented 22.0% 2007: 24.1% of the Groups consolidated revenue.
Competitive position The Iron Ore Division has some significant strategic advantages over its major competitors.
First, the location of the Groups large scale iron ore reserves in Northern Kazakhstan provides access to an important customer base, being the steel production plants in Russia, China and the Republic of Kazakhstan, with relatively low transportation costs.
In particular, the Groups facilities are located within 340 kilometres of its key customer, the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works JSC MMK, and this proximity provides significant logistical advantages.
Second, the Division operates large-scale iron ore mines and processing plants with relatively low production costs.
Based on 2008 data, the Group is located in the lower-third of the industry cost curve for global iron ore pellet production.
This cost advantage is largely driven by the relatively low cost of electricity, benefiting from the Groups own power generation capacity.
Production summary The table to the left sets out the production volumes for the Iron Ore Divisions principal saleable products for the years ended 31 December Production summary Years ended 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007.
2008 2008 2007 vs 2007 Annual production decreased 7.1% for total saleable products, Run-of-mine ore extraction 000 t 37,751 40,222 6.1 % although within this saleable concentrate production increased Primary concentrate 000 t 15,487 16,791 7.8 % 6.6%.
The reduction in saleable pellets in part reflected the planned Saleable concentrate 000 t 7,835 7,351 6.6% reconstruction of one pelletiser unit in 2008, which was completed at Saleable pellets 000 t 6,952 8,572 18.9 % the end of Q3 2008.
Production in the Division was cut back in Q4 2008 in response to a significant reduction in customer demand for mined ore and saleable products.
Supply and demand The market for iron ore is primarily regional, as iron ore is a bulk commodity and, relative to its value, is expensive to transport.
China, Australia and Brazil are the largest producers of iron ore, accounting for respectively, 37%, 17% and 14% of global output in 2008 based on iron content.
Other significant producers include the CIS and India.
Global production of iron ore was 1,985 million tonnes in 2008 as compared to 972 million tonnes in 1998: compound annual growth of about 7%.
Typically, steel production and, as a result, demand for iron ore, follows overall growth in industrial production.
Global demand for iron ore has slowed recently, primarily as a result of the economic downturn.
Although demand is expected to stay relatively stable in the BRIC countries and the Middle East, steel exports from these regions would be affected by the reduced demand from developed countries.
Iron ore DO NOT USE TRACKING ON ANY PART OF THIS JOB!
32 ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Business Review continued producers were optimistic and had initiated numerous expansion Operating Review continued projects with a risk that, despite recent cancellations, there could still be a material surplus supply of iron ore in the short term.
Sales and pricing In April 2007, the Group entered into a long-term contract with MMK, the Divisions largest single customer, accounting for 64.1% 2007: 67.4% of the Iron Ore Divisions sales revenue.
The contract extends until 2017 and requires MMK to purchase specified quantities at prices determined by reference to the published world price benchmarks for iron ore concentrate and pellets.
Prices are revised annually on 1 April by reference to the world price benchmarks.
In light of the current economic downturn and the impact on our customer MMK, in Q4 2008 the Group agreed to temporarily waive the minimum contractual sales volume.
Contractual sales volumes will continue to be reviewed on a regular basis, taking into account developing market conditions.
The current structure of industry pricing benchmarks have historically been set between the three major iron ore producers BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, and Vale and the major steel producers in China, Europe and Japan, for fines and pellets, and take effect from 1 April annually.
Third party sales by product Years ended 31 December 2008 Tightness in the iron ore market abated in H2 2008, with spot prices Product 2008 2007 vs 2007 falling below contract prices, and markedly so in Q4 2008.
As global Iron ore concentrate 000 t 7,464 7,422 0.6% steelmakers started to reduce production dramatically and defer Iron ore pellets 000 t 6,797 8,534 20.4 % expansions, iron ore producers restrained production and delayed new projects.
Market expectations anticipate reduced benchmark prices from Q2 2009.
The table to the left sets out the Iron Ore Divisions volume of third party sales by product for the years ended 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007.
Key initiatives The Iron Ore Divisions strategic objectives are: to maintain production capacities: utilise the Groups access to low cost, large-scale deposits of iron ore and low cost energy: and to diversify sales geography, product and customer mix.
The Division is also focusing on finalising the feasibility study in BML, the Brazilian iron ore joint venture.
The Alumina and Aluminium Division The Alumina and Aluminium Division produces and sells alumina to aluminium producers and, from the end of 2007, aluminium.
ENRC believes, based on 2008 data, that the Alumina and Aluminium Division is the worlds ninth largest supplier of traded alumina by Alumina and Aluminium Division third party revenue volume and is at the lower end of the global industry cost curve for both alumina and aluminium.
2008 US$864 million 4.2 billion The Alumina and Aluminium Divisions vertically integrated operations 2007 US$607 million include two bauxite mines, a limestone mine, an alumina refinery, an aluminium smelter, and a power station.
The new aluminium smelter Percentage of the Groups consolidated revenue allows the Alumina and Aluminium Division to process its alumina into aluminium.
The smelter presently has an annual capacity of 125 thousand tonnes achieved in Q2 2008.
The Group will complete 2008 12.7% 4.2 billion construction of Phase 2 of the smelter which will increase the 2007 production capacity of aluminium to 250 thousand tonnes per annum 14.8% in 2010.
In 2008, the Alumina and Aluminium Division mined 5.2 million tonnes of bauxite 2007: 5.0 million tonnes and produced 1.6 million tonnes of alumina 2007: 1.5 million tonnes and 106 thousand tonnes 2007: 12 thousand tonnes of aluminium.
For the year ended 31 December 2008, the Alumina and Aluminium Division had revenue of US$864 million 2007: US$607 million representing 12.7% 2007: 14.8% of the Groups consolidated revenue.

ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 33 Competitive position 2008 was the first full year of operation of ENRCs new primary smelter the Kazakhstan Aluminium Smelter KAS, in Pavlodar which reached its run rate capacity of 125 thousand tonnes per annum in Q2 2008.
Construction of a further 125 thousand tonnes capacity, bringing the total capacity to 250 thousand tonnes, is well under way.
The Divisions focus on cost control, with the implementation of several cost-reduction programmes in 2008, enabled ENRC to retain its competitive cost position.
The Groups bauxite reserves guarantee an ongoing low-cost supply of raw material for alumina production.
Alumina and aluminium production benefit from the ability to buy low-cost energy from internal Group sources.
As a result ENRCs alumina and aluminium are both at the lower end of the industry cost curves which enables us to be one of RUSALs preferred suppliers.
Production summary The table to the left sets out the production volumes for each of the Alumina and Aluminium Divisions principal saleable products for the years ended 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007.
Alumina production grew in line with the approved capacity expansion plan with growth of about 4% in bauxite mining and alumina Production summary Years ended 31 December production.
The new aluminium smelter achieved its Phase 1 capacity 2008 run rate of 125 thousand tonnes in Q2 2008, well ahead of schedule.

Total aluminium production was 40.0 million tonnes of which the largest part, 13.2 million tonnes, or 33%, originated from China.
After a promising start to the year demand weakened significantly in H2 2008.
Demand is anticipated to have grown only 2%, outpaced by supply which is estimated to have risen by as much as 5%.
As a result worldwide aluminium stocks London Metal Exchange LME stood at 2.3 million tonnes at the end of 2008, rising 1.6 million tonnes over the year.
Total inventories at the year end were equivalent to around six weeks of estimated current worldwide demand.
Significant reductions in planned capacity expansions have been announced by the aluminium producers ENRC believes that in 2009, an even larger production surplus, potentially 2 million tonnes, is possible, driven by a decline in worldwide demand of about 4%.
Since aluminium has a heavy Sales volumes exposure to both the construction and transportation sectors, Years ended 31 December 2008 with approximately 50% of end use, demand looks set to slow in Product 2008 2007 vs 2007 the coming year.

Sales and pricing In 2008 the Group shipped 1.4 million tonnes of alumina to United Company RUSAL UC RUSAL under a long-term supply contract expiring in 2016.
The pricing under this contract is linked to the LME price of primary aluminium.
As a result ENRC is not exposed to the alumina spot price.
In 2008 UC RUSAL, the Divisions largest single customer, accounted for 60.2% 2007: 79.5% of the Divisions sales revenue.
Sales of aluminium via Glencore International represented 30.3% of the Divisions revenue in 2008.
The Group shipped approximately 104 thousand tonnes of primary aluminium, almost all of which was distributed by Glencore International which acts as our agent.
The LME cash price is the basis for the pricing of all aluminium contracts.
The table to the left sets out the Alumina and Aluminium Divisions volume of third party sales by product for the years ended 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007.

The average sales price was US$2,571 per tonne 2007: US$2,639 per tonne : the LME aluminium price reached a record high in early July 2008 at US$3,292 per tonne with the lowest closing level in the year of US$1,430 per tonne in mid-December.
Prices fell with falling demand in key sectors, commodity fund deleveraging and increasing LME inventory.
The demand outlook remains weak and prices can be expected to remain under pressure in the short term.
Key initiatives The Alumina and Aluminium Divisions principal strategic objectives are: to increase the capacity of aluminium production in the Republic of Kazakhstan: to exploit the surplus of low-cost electricity, bauxite and alumina: and to provide internally produced anodes.
Following revisions to the Groups capital expenditure programme the main projects and schedule for the Division are: Increasing the annual capacity of the aluminium smelter by an additional 125 thousand tonnes to start-up 2010 Phase 2 at a cost of US$305 million.
As part of the smelter expansion we are Energy Division total revenue constructing an anode plant at an additional cost of US$200 million, which will allow the Group to be independent of third-party 2008 US$436 million 4.2 billion suppliers and, from 2011, to provide enough anodes for the increased aluminium production.

ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 35 In February 2009, the Group announced the acquisition of a 25% interest in Shubarkol Komir JSC Shubarkol, a major semi coke and thermal coal producer based in the Republic of Kazakhstan, for a cash consideration of US$200 million less 25% of net debt.
Shubarkol is one of the Republic of Kazakhstans largest thermal coal producers, producing some 6.1 million tonnes of coal in 2007 and with 1,419 million tonnes of measured and indicated coal resources within its coal lease, of which there were 365 million tonnes of probable coal reserves.
The Group has a right of first refusal and a call option to purchase the remaining 75% of Shubarkol.
Shubarkol products are used for gasification in alumina production and could potentially be used to produce synthetic gas in the event we were to build DRI production facilities.
Production summary The table on the left sets out the production volumes for each of the Energy Divisions principal saleable products for the years ended 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007.
The Energy Division is focused on both supplying other ENRC Divisions with coal and electricity and sales of coal and electricity to third parties.
Annual coal production and sales increased 7.3% due to strong demand for coal, both in the Republic of Kazakhstan and in export Production summary Years ended 31 December markets.
Power generation capacity was limited in 2008 with one 2008 turbine down for planned maintenance until Q4 2008.

36 ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Business Review continued securing a larger increase from the industrial sector.
The average sales Operating Review continued price to third parties increased 27.2% to KZT2.65 2.20 US cents per kWh 2007: KZT2.12 1.73 US cents per kWh.
The economic downturn forced domestic power producers to cut output and electricity consumption in Q4 2008, moving the domestic electricity market back into surplus.
Despite a moderate decline in electricity consumption in the Republic of Kazakhstan in Q4 2008, over the year the market grew approximately 4.4% to 80.0 billion kWh.
Due to the economic climate, a surplus of electricity is likely to persist in the Republic of Kazakhstan in 2009 creating more competition in the sale of excess electricity to third parties.
Coal In the Republic of Kazakhstan, ENRC sold 3.1 million tonnes of coal to third parties 2007: 2.5 million tonnes at an average sales price of KZT721 US$5.99 per tonne 2007: KZT688 US$5.61 per tonne, an increase of 4.8%.
Prices for the sale of coal in the domestic market are subject to government regulation.
In Russia, as a result of gas prices rising 27% in early 2008, the cost efficiency of coal-fired power generation improved compared to gas powered generation, eventually leading to stronger coal demand from heat and power stations.
Growth of consumption in Russia resulted in the Group selling additional coal.
The Energy Division sold 5.0 million tonnes of coal to Russia 2007: 3.9 Logistics Division total revenue million tonnes.
In 2008 Omskenergy, the Divisions largest single customer, accounted for 25.7% 2007: 25.5% of the Divisions 2008 US$229 million 4.2 billion revenue.
The average annual selling price for Russian customers increased 18.8% to US$24.6 per tonne 2007: US$20.7 per tonne.
With 2007 US$232 million gas prices still forecast to grow in Russia, it is expected that further increases in domestic prices will be experienced in 2009.
However, Logistics Division third party revenue coal consumption could be constrained due to warmer than expected weather in Russia and in the Republic of Kazakhstan during the 2008 09 winter and prolonged economic slowdown with production 2008 US$107 million 4.2 billion cuts and a consequent fall in electricity consumption.
2007 US$149 million Key initiatives The Energy Divisions principal objectives are: to provide low-cost Percentage of the Groups consolidated revenue power and coal for the Groups existing operations, utilising its large scale coal reserves: and a progressive expansion of production in the 20 08 1.6% 4.2 billion Republic of Kazakhstan.
Additional energy capacity will ensure power supply to Groups Divisions and allow it to maintain its presence on the 2007 3.6% Republic of Kazakhstan power market where it sells electric energy into the wholesale market.
Following revision to the Groups capital expenditure programme the main projects and schedule for the Division are: Install overburden stripping equipment at a cost of US$85 million, to increase efficiency, by 2010.
Invest approximately US$200 million to construct a new turbine and generator by 2011.
It is expected that this will increase total installed electricity generating capacity by 325MW.
Logistics Division The Logistics Division provides transportation and logistics services to the Groups operating Divisions and to third parties.
The Divisions operations include freight forwarding, wagon repair services and railway construction and repair services.
The availability of these services within the Group mitigates many of the risks associated with the supply of raw materials and delivery of products to customers.
In addition, the Division operates a railway transfer and reloading terminal on the Republic of Kazakhstan China border, facilitating the Groups access to the Chinese market.
For the year ended 31 December 2008, the Logistics Division transported 58.5 million tonnes of goods 2007: 60.9 million tonnes, of which 80.7% 2007: 87.7% was intra-Group.
Reduced transportation volumes for the year reflected a slowdown in Q4 2008 in the key commodities: iron ore, chrome ore and ferroalloys.
For the year ended 31 December 2008, the Logistics Division had revenue of US$229 million 2007: US$232 million, of which US$107 million 2007: US$149 million, derived from third party sales representing 1.6% 2007: 3.6% of the Groups consolidated revenue.

ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 37 customer, the Kazakhstani State railway company, used its own material for some railroad repair works.
In addition there were delays in the tendering process for some contracts.
Key initiatives On 21 March 2008, ENRC Logistics won the Republic of Kazakhstan open tender for the concession for the construction and running of about 300 kilometres of a new railway line in South-East Kazakhstan the China Gateway Project, connecting the Republic of Kazakhstan with China.
The new railway will facilitate an increased cargo capacity, by up to 30 million tonnes per annum, and will provide ENRCs operations with a secure transportation route for products to be sold into the Chinese market.
The construction period is estimated to be approximately four years with a required investment of approximately US$910 million.
The operational period of the concession is 24 years from the completion of construction.
The design review and financial and technical report are expected to be completed in Q2 2009.
Sales and Marketing The Groups Sales and Marketing function provides ENRCs operating divisions with a fully integrated and centrally organised sales and marketing resource.
This facilitates the efficient coordination of the Groups external sales, monitoring of key markets and general production strategy.
The sales and marketing function performs the following key functions: strategy and planning: commercial contract terms and customer relations: market research: and coordinating logistics.
The centralisation of this function provides significant operational advantages to the Group including the identification and exploitation of market synergies and improved operational efficiencies.
In addition, as the markets in which the Group operates are geographically diverse and complex, the size, scope and expertise of the sales and marketing function enables it to gather significant market information that is not otherwise generally available.
38 ENRC Annual Report And Accounts 2008 Capital expenditure Our businesses are capital intensive.
Managing projects efficiently and effectively is a key skill for our industry.
The successful implementation and commissioning of assets is very important to our success and our delivery of shareholder value.
Our capital expenditure projects are designed to address our strategic aims which include maintenance and improvement of low cost operations, expansion and development of existing reserves and capacity, and expanding our product portfolio.
As mentioned in the Chief Executive Officers Statement page 13 two of the highlights achieved in 2008 were the aluminium smelter covered in the 2007 Annual Report achieving its phase 1 run-rate capacity well ahead of schedule and secondly the refurbishment of a power generating unit.
Reconstruction of Power Generating Unit 1 at Aksu Power Station of JSC EEC During 2008, we completed the refurbishment of one of the Energy Divisions power generating units ahead of the planned completion date.
The refurbishment included the installation of new turbines and two Alstom electrical filters with 99.6% end-gas purification efficiency as well as replacement of a generator, transformers and other key elements.
In addition to the refurbishment of the power generating unit, a new automated turbine control system was installed.
As a result of the refurbishment, we managed to increase the power generating units capacity in line with international efficiency levels.
Despite the significant cost pressures for key equipment, labour and materials, management successfully managed to complete the refurbishment in line with the original budget of US$100 million.
The successful refurbishment of the power generating unit is part of a long-term refurbishment programme designed to ensure that we increase the Groups electricity generating capacity and maintain our competitive advantage by being self sufficient in electricity for the Groups power intensive ferroalloys and aluminium smelting operations.
Also it will allow us to maintain our strong presence in the Republic of Kazakhstans wholesale power market.
