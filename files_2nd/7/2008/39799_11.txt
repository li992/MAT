United Kingdom Financial and Operating Performance Against this backdrop of tough market conditions, our UK business Key points demonstrated resilience in our core activities with rental income excluding the impact of acquisitions and disposals growing by 2.4 per cent to 173 million Difficult market conditions in 2008.
Even after excluding the impact of the letting of new developments and take backs for re-development, the underlying portfolio showed a growth Investment property portfolio decline in line in rental income of 2.2 per cent to 164 million in 2008.

Trading profits, by their nature, tend to follow the economic cycle closely, and we should not forget that during the run up to the peak in 2007, the UK division consistently delivered on trading profits.
During 2008, 179,000 sq m were let 248,000 sq m including joint ventures and licences, producing 16.9 million of annualised new income.
This was below our record 2007 performance but was still ahead of the 167,000 sq m let in 2006 when market conditions were benign and competition was not as fierce.
After taking account of space returned, the net absorption in the UK was 12,000 sq m with additional 5.0 million of annualised rental income.
The successful letting in November of Waterside House, a 1,900 sq m office building in Uxbridge, to Xerox Property Services Ltd and Cleanevent UK was achieved in the face of strong competition in the West London Market.
In line with our stay close to our customers principles, high levels of customer retention enabled the UK business to retain, in spite of the economic climate, a high proportion of income streams coming up to lease expiry or lease break.
Approximately 65 per cent of leases were renewed and a similar proportion of customers who had a break clause decided not to exercise the break.
This was consistent with the retention rate in 2007 and compared very favourably with the industry average of 24 per cent in 2007 for lease renewal rates source: Strutt & Parker IPD studies: 2008 study not yet published.

To mitigate this, we are increasing the focus on our credit control processes and it has been encouraging to see cash collections in December 2008, with 95.7 per cent rent due collected within 10 days in line with December 2007 levels.
2009 will clearly be a challenging year for all operators in our sector.
The basic disciplines we have put in place such as credit control, cost containment and performance management, will help us to steer through these times.
The breadth of our customer base our top 20 customers only account for 24 per cent of our secured rental income also prevents over reliance on any particular customer.
We are determined as a business to continue to demonstrate the resilience we have shown in 2008, which was driven by the effectiveness and customer focused culture of our operational teams.
And when the markets do start to recover, we will be positioned to take careful advantage of the medium term value creating opportunities that will materialise.
