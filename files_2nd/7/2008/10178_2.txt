As recruitment activity is dependent upon economic cycles, our strategy to counter the impact of economic downturns is to diversify our business by industry sectors, professional disciplines and by geographic markets.
By being more diverse the dependency on individual businesses or markets is reduced, making the overall Group more resilient.
This strategy is pursued entirely through the organic growth of existing and new teams, offices, disciplines and countries with a consistent team and meritocratic culture.
This growth is achieved by drawing upon the skills and experiences of proven Michael page management ensuring we have the best, most experienced, home grown talent in each key role.
When we invest in a new business we do so only with a long term objective and in the knowledge that at some point there will be periods when economic activity slows.
While it is difficult to predict accurately when these slowdowns will occur and how severe they will be, it has been our practice in the past and our intention in the future to maintain our presence in our chosen markets, but with close control over our cost base.
