BUSINeSS revIeW Operating and Exploration Review Dr Mike Watts, Deputy Chief Executive Phil Tracy, Engineering & Operations Director We are pleased that the resource base in Rajasthan continues to grow and show the potential for further value optimisation.
The phased plateau production rate of 175,000 bopd may be enhanced or extended should the encouraging tests of enhanced oil recovery be confirmed.
We are also delighted to have built an exciting early entry position in Greenland where exploration is at an embryonic stage.
Dr Mike Watts Deputy Chief Executive 18 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 Group Production Cairns average gross production during 2008 was 76,298 barrels of oil equivalent per day boepd 2007: 87,031 boepd.
The Groups average entitlement production for 2008 was 12,801 boepd net to Cairn 2007:19,809 boepd.
The figures in the table below show group production for 2008 on a gross, working interest and entitlement interest basis including 100% of both CILs and Capricorns production.

Cairns current entitlement interest production is 46% gas: 54% oil.
On commencement of production from Rajasthan the vast majority of the Groups production will be oil.
Group Booked 2P reserves The table below shows reserves information at 31 December 2008 on an entitlement interest basis for the Group including 100% of both CILs and Capricorns reserves.
For accounting and reserves purposes, the Group has used an oil price assumption of $50 bbl for 2009 and $65 for 2010 onwards real 2007: $60 bbl real.

The net entitlement reserves position has also increased by 84.3 mmboe from 170.2 to 254.5 mmboe.
This increase is largely due to the booking of Bhagyam and Aishwariya 2P reserves.
It also includes an increase in the entitlement to Mangala oil as a result of the increase of plateau offtake rate and the inclusion of pipeline costs following the GoI approval to the moving of the delivery point to the coast.
There is also a reduction as a consequence of a change in the Groups oil price assumption.
The Groups net entitlement interest to reserves is significantly geared to the oil price assumption used and the potential movement in reserves at different long-term oil prices is shown below.
