Operating profit growth was lower at 22% reecting a change in product mix with growth of higher volume products that generate a lower margin, for example hand controls for US armoured vehicles and equipment tted to Airbus aircraft.
The operating margin was also suppressed by the increased charge against profit relating to investment in new aircraft systems.
Highlights of the divisions performance in the year that will underpin continuing growth included: a contract extension awarded by Pratt & Whitney, US, to develop key elements of the lift fan ice protection system for the vertical lift fan tted to the STOVL versions of the Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighter a contract to develop a secure communications network on Revenue in Aircraft & Vehicle Systems behalf of the UK government to be used for civil contingency response planning increased by 30% to 130.1m compared selection by Boeing to provide an innovative cable harness to 100.0m in 2007 and operating profit protection system for its new 747-800 aircraft increased 22% to 19.7m 2007: 16.1m.
These results include full-year contributions from Atkins and BCF Designs, both acquired late in 2007, together with a one month contribution from Dascam.
The divisions order book increased during the year by 18% to close at 214.9m 2007: 181.6m.

The other acquisitions in this division occurred later in the year and so did not have a material impact.
Revenue and operating profit growth reected increased sales in the second half of the year of specialist power equipment for naval vessels and for mass transit systems.
There was also an increase in demand for security and surveillance systems to protect UK bases for current operations in Afghanistan.
Features of the divisions performance in the year that will support continuing growth included: further demand for ADSI, Ultras real-time command and control system, including applications outside the US, notably Asia, and derivatives for airborne use the award in the second half of the year of additional contracts for transit system trackside power equipment Revenue in Information & Power Systems supporting the improvement of Londons transport infrastructure grew by 28% to 161.5m compared to winning contracts to supply control systems and sensors for 126.6m in the previous year.
Operating military and civil nuclear reactors profit increased by 13% to 22.2m 2007: 19.6m.
The order book at the end of the period had increased by 30% to 173.3m 2007: 133.6m.

Deliveries of Ultras traditional anti-submarine warfare sonobuoys and sonobuoy receivers to domestic and international customers also made a good contribution to growth.
Growth in future years will be underpinned as a result of the following developments in 2008: excellent order intake for the Groups enhanced line-of-sight tactical radios a contract to supply an integrated sonar suite for new Australian navy destroyers the increasing application of Ultras specialist underwater acoustic expertise for use in advanced networks of long-life, distributed sensors Revenue in Tactical & Sonar Systems increased by 20% to 223.7m 2007: 186.3m and operating profit rose 29% to 35.2m 2007: 27.2m.
These results include a full-year contribution from Criticom which was acquired during 2007.
The costs of moving both MISL and Harris to nearby Ultra sites meant that these acquisitions were earnings-neutral in 2008.
The closing order book was 395.3m 2007: 305.8m, an increase of 29% in the year.
