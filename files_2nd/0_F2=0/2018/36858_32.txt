Other Receivables 2018 2017 $m $m Non-current: Loan receivable from a subsidiary interest-bearing 285.9 275.2 Prepayments 0.1 0.1 286.0 275.3 Current: Receivables from subsidiaries 0.8 0.8 Prepayments 0.2 0.4 Other receivables 0.1 0.1 1.1 1.3 The loan receivable from a subsidiary and current receivables from subsidiaries are financial assets measured at amortised cost.
Other receivables relate to VAT balances, which are not financial assets.
None of the Companys receivables 2017 none were overdue at the year-end and the Company does not consider it necessary to provide for any impairments as there is no recent history of default or any indications that the contractual payments will not be made.
The Companys maximum exposure to credit risk is the fair value of each class of receivable, as described in note C8.
The Company does not hold any collateral as security and no assets have been acquired through the exercise of any collateral previously held.
The interest-bearing loan receivable from a subsidiary is unsecured and interest is charged based on a margin over bank lending rates.
Current receivables due from subsidiaries are current accounts and are unsecured, interest free and repayable on demand.
Other Payables 2018 2017 $m $m Current: Payables to subsidiaries 0.2 0.3 Accruals 0.6 0.8 Other payables 0.5 0.7 1.3 1.8 Payables to subsidiaries, accruals and other payables are financial liabilities carried at amortised cost.
Current payables due to subsidiaries are unsecured, interest free and repayable on demand.
Derivatives and Hedging The Company has used forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to exchange rate movements during the year.
At 31 December 2018, the Company had no outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts 2017 $nil.
Gains and losses on contracts that are not designated in a hedge relationship are taken directly to the income statement.
Changes in the fair value of currency derivatives not designated in a hedge relationship amounting to a $0.4m loss 2017 $nil were recognised in the income statement during the year.
Financial Instruments: Fair Values Due to their short-term nature, the carrying value of current receivables from subsidiaries, other receivables, payables to subsidiaries, accruals, other payables, provisions, borrowings and bank overdrafts approximates their fair value.
The carrying value of the loan receivable from subsidiaries approximates its fair value as interest is charged based on a margin over current bank lending rates.
Financial Risk Management The Companys activities expose it to certain financial risks, namely market risk including currency risk, cash flow interest rate risk and fair value interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
From the perspective of the Company, these financial risks are integrated with the financial risks of the Hunting PLC Group and are not managed separately.
a Foreign Exchange Risk The Company is mainly exposed to foreign exchange risk from its financing and operating activities in respect of Sterling.
Foreign exchange risks arise from future transactions and cash flows and from recognised monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in US dollars and, where appropriate, forward foreign exchange contracts are used to manage the exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates.
The Company has Sterling denominated financial assets and financial liabilities.
The carrying amount of the Companys financial assets included in current receivables from subsidiaries at 31 December on which exchange differences would be recognised in the income statement in the following year, is $0.7m 2017 $0.4m for Sterling denominated financial assets.
The carrying amount of the Companys financial liabilities included in accruals, other payables and provisions at 31 December, on which exchange differences would be recognised in the income statement in the following year, is $3.2m 2017 $2.6m for Sterling denominated financial liabilities.
156 Hunting PLC | 2018 Annual Report and Accounts Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information C9.
Financial Risk Management continued b Interest Rate Risk The Company is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk from its loan receivable from a subsidiary and borrowings payable to a subsidiary, which are at variable interest rates.
c Credit Risk The Companys credit risk arises from its outstanding current receivables and loan receivable from a subsidiary.
The Company is exposed to credit risk to the extent of non-receipt of its financial assets, however, it has no significant concentrations of credit risk other than from related parties.
Credit risk is continually monitored and no individual exposure is considered to be significant in the ordinary course of the Companys activities.
The interest-bearing loan receivable due from a subsidiary has not been impaired as no losses are expected from non-performance of this counterparty.
The credit risk at the time the loan was taken out was deemed to be low and there has not been an increase in the credit risk since the time the loan was initially recognised.
Therefore, management does not believe that there is a significant increase in credit risk such that the loan moves from stage 1 to stage 2 of the IFRS 9 general impairment model.
There is no history of default and previously all payments under the original terms of the loan have been made.
The loan is with the Groups central treasury company, which has sufficient cash, short-term deposits and credit facilities, in the form of the RCF, to repay the loan.
Management does not have any reason to believe that any future payments will not be made in accordance with the terms of the loan.
Therefore no provision for 12-month expected credit losses has been made under IFRS 9.
The Companys outstanding receivables due from subsidiaries are current accounts and no losses are expected from non-performance of these counterparties.
d Liquidity Risk The Company has sufficient facilities available to satisfy its requirements.
During March 2017, the Groups treasury function put in place a sweeping arrangement with the Company, such that at the end of each day any balances in its bank accounts are swept to the treasury function, with a corresponding increase in the loan receivable balance with fellow group companies.
As a result, at the end of the year, cash at bank is $nil.
The Company is party to a cross-guarantee and set-off arrangement with Lloyds Bank Plc and Barclays Bank Plc.
There is no set-off in the presentation of cash balances held by the Company in the financial statements.
Under this arrangement the Company is jointly and severally liable for any gross liability position held by any of the companies party to the aforementioned arrangements in the event of default.
Any gross liability limit cannot exceed a combined facility limit of 2.6m $3.4m.
The table below analyses the Companys non-derivative financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date of the financial liabilities.
The amounts presented in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows, whereas the carrying amounts in the balance sheet are the discounted amounts.
2018 2017 On demand On demand or within or within one year one year $m $m Non-derivative financial liabilities: Payables to subsidiaries 0.2 0.3 Borrowings payable due to subsidiary 0.6 0.3 Accruals 0.6 0.8 Other payables 0.5 0.7 1.9 2.1 The Company did not have any derivative financial liabilities at the end of 2017 or 2018. e Capital Risk Management The Companys capital consists of equity and net cash.
Net cash comprises the loan receivable from a subsidiary and borrowings.
It is managed with the aim of maintaining an appropriate level of financing available for the Companys activities, having due regard to interest rate risks and the availability of borrowing facilities.
Changes in equity arise from the retention of earnings and from issues of share capital.
Net cash is monitored on a periodic basis.
At the year-end, capital comprised: Restated 2018 2017 $m $m Total equity 720.2 712.3 Net cash: Borrowings payable due to subsidiary 0.6 0.3 Loan receivable from subsidiary note C5 285.9 275.2 Capital employed 434.9 437.4 The 2017 capital employed amount has been restated to include the Companys borrowings.
Hunting PLC | 2018 Annual Report and Accounts 157 Notes to the Company financial statements continued C9.
Financial Risk Management continued e Capital Risk Management continued The increase in total equity during the year is mainly attributable to the retained profit for the year of $7.3m.
The increase in the share-based payments reserve of $13.1m is offset by the payment of a dividend of $6.6m and the purchase of treasury shares of $5.7m.
The loan receivable from a subsidiary increased by $10.7m largely due to royalty income received during the year.
There have been no significant changes in the Companys funding policy during the year.
Financial Instruments: Sensitivity Analysis The following sensitivity analysis is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables on the Companys financial instruments and show the impact on profit or loss and shareholders equity.
Financial instruments affected by market risk include non-current receivables from subsidiaries and borrowings.
The sensitivity analysis relates to the position as at 31 December 2018.
The analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of provisions and on non-financial assets and liabilities.
The following assumptions have been made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: Foreign exchange rate and interest rate sensitivities have an asymmetric impact on the Companys results, that is, an increase in rates does not result in the same amount of movement as a decrease in rates.
For floating rate assets and liabilities, the amount of asset or liability outstanding at the balance sheet date is assumed to be outstanding for the whole year.
The carrying values of financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost do not change as interest rates change.
a Interest Rate Sensitivity The post-tax impact on the income statement, with all other variables held constant, at 31 December 2018, for an increase of 0.5% 2017 0.75% in US interest rates, is to increase profits by $1.2m 2017 $1.7m.
If the US interest rates were to decrease by 0.5% 2017 0.75%, then the post-tax impact would be to reduce profits by $1.2m 2017 $1.7m.
The movements arise on US dollar denominated intra-Group loans.
There is no impact on OCI for a change in interest rates.
b Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitivity The post-tax impact on the income statement, with all other variables held constant, at 31 December 2018, for an increase or decrease of 10% 2017 10% in the Sterling foreign exchange rate, is not material.
The movement in the income statement arises from Sterling denominated accruals, other payables and borrowings, offset by Sterling loans receivable from subsidiaries.
There is no impact on OCI for a change in foreign exchange rates.
Post-Employment Benefits The Company has no employees and therefore does not participate in any of the post-employment benefit schemes shown in note 29 of the Groups financial statements, although it does guarantee the contributions due by the participating employers.
