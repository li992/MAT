116 MARKS AND SPENCER GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS C1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Companys accounting policies are the same as those set out in note 1 of the Group financial statements, except as noted below.
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment.
The Company grants share-based payments to the employees of subsidiary companies.
Each period the fair value of the employee services received by the subsidiary as a capital contribution from the Company is reflected as an addition to investments in subsidiaries.
Loans from other Group undertakings and all other payables are initially recorded at fair value, which is generally the proceeds received.
They are then subsequently carried at amortised cost.
The loans are non-interest bearing and repayable on demand.
Sources of estimation uncertainty Impairment of investments in subsidiary undertakings The carrying value of the investment in subsidiary undertakings is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis.
The recoverable amount is determined based on value in use which requires the determination of appropriate assumptions which are sources of estimation uncertainty in relation to the cash flows over the three-year strategic plan period, the long-term growth rate to be applied beyond this three-year period and the risk-adjusted pre-tax discount rate used to discount the assumed cash flows to present value.
Estimation uncertainty arises due to changing economic and market factors, the channel shift from stores to online, increasing technological advancement and the Groups ongoing strategic transformation programmes.
The Companys financial risk is managed as part of the Groups strategy and policies as discussed in note 21 of the Group financial statements.
In accordance with the exemption allowed by Section 408 3 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own income statement or statement of comprehensive income.

117 ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2018 NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED C6 INVESTMENTS CONTINUED A.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings continued Sensitivity analysis has been performed on the impairment testing of the carrying value of investments.
The following key assumptions would have to change as follows in order to eliminate the headroom within the impairment test: the cash flow forecasts in each of the years covered by the three-year forecast would have to be 28% below forecast: the long-term growth rate of cash flows would have to decline to -9% per annum: or the pre-tax discount rate would have to increase to 17.9%.
The directors do not consider that any of these scenarios are reasonably likely.
