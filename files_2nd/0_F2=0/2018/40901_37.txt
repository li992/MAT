Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information The Weir Group PLC 185 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Notes to the Company Financial Statements 1.
Accounting policies Authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance The company financial statements of The Weir Group PLC the Company for the year ended 31 December 2018 2018 were approved and authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 27 February 2019.
The comparative information is presented for the year ended 31 December2017 2017.
The Weir Group PLC is a public limited company incorporated in Scotland and is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The company financial statements of The Weir Group PLC have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historic cost convention and inaccordance with FRS 101 and applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The following disclosure exemptions from therequirements of IFRS have been consistently applied in the preparation of these financial statements, in accordance with FRS 101: i Disclosures required by paragraphs 45 b and 46-52 of IFRS 2 Share-based payment can be found in note 28 to the Group financial statements: ii IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures exemption has been taken as a result of the disclosures in note 30 to the Group financial statements: iii IAS 7 Statement of cash flows: iv Disclosure of key management compensation as required by paragraph 17 of IAS 24 Related party disclosures: v Disclosure of related party transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries as required by IAS 24 Related party disclosures: and vi Paragraph 10 d, paragraph 10 f, and paragraphs 134-136, of IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements.
The Company is the parent of The Weir Group PLC.
Its principal activity is to act as a holding company for the Group and perform the head office function.
The accounting policies which follow are consistent with those of the previous period with the exception of the following new standards which apply for thefirst time in 2018: IFRS 9: Financial instruments IFRS 9 replaces the provisions of IAS 39 that relate to the recognition, classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, derecognition of financial instruments, impairment of financial assets and hedge accounting.
The impact of adopting IFRS 9 on the Companys retained earnings and individual financial statement line items as at 1 January 2018 was determined tobeimmaterial and as such no adjustments have been recorded and comparative figures have not been restated.
The considerations relevant to this assessment are outlined below.
i Classification and measurement No changes were necessary to the classification or re-measurement of the Companys financial instruments, as disclosed in the notes to the accounts, with derivative instruments remaining as measured at fair value through the profit and loss FVTPL, or subject to the accounting provisions for hedge relationships under IFRS 9 where designated in effective hedge accounting relationships, and all other financial instruments remaining classified as measured at amortised cost under IFRS 9. ii Impairment of financial assets The Company has two types of financial assets that are subject to IFRS 9s new expected credit loss model: loans to subsidiaries, and other short-term receivables from subsidiaries.
The Company applies the IFRS 9 general model for measuring expected credit losses on loans to subsidiaries, and the simplified approach for all other shortterm receivables from subsidiaries, which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance.
This did not result in a material change to the loss allowance on 1 January 2018 for either loans to subsidiaries or other short-term receivables from subsidiaries, and as such no adjustment has been recorded and comparative figures have not been restated.
Note 7 provides details about the calculation of the allowance.
While cash and cash equivalents are also subject to the impairment requirements of IFRS 9, no impairment loss was identified.
IFRS 15: Revenue from contracts with customers including associated amendments The Company has adopted IFRS 15, applying the full retrospective method in line with the Group.
There has been no impact on the financial results of the Company due to the adoption of the standard.
There are no other new standards or interpretations effective for the year ended 31 December 2018, in addition to the above, which are considered to have amaterial impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company.
Use of estimates & judgements The Companys significant accounting policies are set out below.
The preparation of the Company financial statements, in conformity with FRS 101, requires management to make judgements that affect the application of accounting policies and estimates that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expense.
Management bases these judgements and estimates on a combination of past experience, professional expert advice and other evidence that is relevant to each individual circumstance.
Actual results may differ from these judgements and estimates, which are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The area where management considers the more complex estimates are required is in respect of retirement benefits.
The assumptions underlying the valuation of retirement benefit assets and liabilities include discount rates, inflation rates and mortality assumptions which are based on actuarial advice.
Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of the Companys retirement benefit obligations.
Sensitivities to changes in key assumptions are provided in note 8.
The Weir Group PLC 186 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Notes to the Company Financial Statements continued Foreign currency translation The presentational and functional currency of the Company is Sterling.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the Companys functional currency at the exchange rate ruling on the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling on the balance sheet date.
Currency translation differences are recognised in the income statement.
Revenue recognition Revenue is the consideration received or receivable which reflects the amount expected to be received, mainly the transaction price.
Revenue will only be recognised when the fulfilment of performance obligations is achieved.
Revenue mainly relates to transactions with other entities within the Group, primarily in relation to management recharges.
Property, plant & equipment Property, plant & equipment is presented at historical cost.
Depreciation of property, plant & equipment is provided on a straight-line basis so as to charge the cost less residual value to the income statement over the expected useful life of the asset concerned, and is in the following ranges: Long leasehold land & buildings 20 years Office & computer equipment 3 10 years Intangible assets Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any recognised impairment losses.
The expected useful lives of acquired intangible assets are as follows: Purchased software 4 8 years Investments Investments in subsidiaries are held at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Loans are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Post-employment benefits Post-employment benefits comprise pension benefits provided to certain current and former employees in the UK.
For defined benefit pension plans, the annual service cost is calculated using the projected unit credit method and is recognised over the future service lives of participating employees, in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries.
Current service cost and administration expenses are recognised inoperating costs and net interest on net pension liability is recognised in finance costs.
The finance cost recognised in the income statement in the period reflects the net interest on the net pension liability.
This represents the change in the net pension liability resulting from the passage of time, and is determined by applying the discount rate to the opening net liability, taking into account employer contributions paid into the plan, and hence reducing the net liability, during the period.
Past service costs resulting from enhanced benefits are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Actuarial gains and losses, which represent differences between interest on the plan assets, experience on the benefit obligation and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised infull in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
The defined benefit liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet comprises the net total for each plan of the present value of the benefit obligation, using a discount rate based on yields at the balance sheet date on appropriate high quality corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Companys obligations and are denominated in the currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid, minus the fair value of the plan assets, if any, at the balance sheet date.
The balance sheet amount recognised is limited to the present value of economic benefits which the Company expects to recover by way of refunds or a reduction in future contributions.
In order to calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is also given to any minimum funding requirements.
For defined contribution plans, the cost represents the Companys contributions to the plans and these are charged to the income statement in the period inwhich they fall due.
Share-based payments Equity settled share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Groups Share Reward Plan, formerly the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, and as a consequence of occasional one-off conditional awards made to employees.
The fair value of the awards at the date of the grant is calculated using appropriate option pricing models and the cost is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Adjustments are made to reflect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to failure to satisfy service or performance conditions.
The conditions of the Share Reward Plan which took effect in 2018 are summarised in the Directors Remuneration Policy which can be found on the Companys website, www.
Financial assets & liabilities The Companys principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise bank overdrafts, short-term borrowings, loans and fixed-rate notes, commercial paper, cash and short-term deposits.
The Company also has other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly from its operations.
A financial asset is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information The Weir Group PLC 187 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a fide-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss.
In the current year under IFRS 9, where the modification is not substantial, the modified cash flows are discounted at the original effective interest rate to determine a revised carrying amount of the liability, with any difference in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss.
In the prior year under IAS 39, such a modification would instead have resulted in an adjustment to the effective interest rate of the liability.
Derivative financial instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign currency contracts, to reduce its exposure to exchange rate movements.
The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets or liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on spot and forward foreign exchange rates.
The fair value of interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on interest rate curves, spot foreign exchange rates and counterparty and own credit risk.
Changes in their fair values have been recognised in the income statement.
Treasury shares The Weir Group PLC shares held by the Company are classified in shareholders equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken directly to revenue reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in the total comprehensive income on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Taxation Current tax is the amount of tax payable or recoverable in respect of the taxable profit or loss for the period.
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet and its tax base with the following exceptions: i D eferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future: and ii A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities represent tax payable in future periods in respect of taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets represent tax recoverable in future periods in respect of deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unutilised tax losses and the carry forward of unused tax credits.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Current and deferred tax is recognised in the income statement except if it relates to an item recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised directly in equity.
Profit loss attributable to the Company The profit dealt with in the accounts of the Company was 22.8m 2017: profit of 85.0m.
The corporate tax credit dealt with in the accounts of the Company was 14.5m 2017: 11.0m.

On 12 July 2018, as part of the steps taken to facilitate the acquisition of ESCO, the Company received a dividend of 325.3m from its subsidiary Ranger UK 2 Ltd and subsequently impaired its investment in the subsidiary by the same amount.
Over the term of the loans, the Company accounts for its credit risk by appropriately providing for expected credit losses on a timely basis.
The majority of the Companys loans are repayable on demand by the Company.
In calculating the expected credit loss allowance of repayable on demand loans, the Company considers the financial position and internal forecasts of each subsidiary and their ability to repay on request, or over time.
For those loans repayable on maturity, expected credit losses are calculated using market-implied probabilities of default and loss-given-default estimations.
The Company considers the probability of default upon initial recognition of an asset and subsequently whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis throughout each reporting period.
To assess whether there is a significant increase in credit risk, the Company compares the risk of a default occurring on the asset as at the reporting date with the risk of default as at the date of initial recognition.
The primary indicators considered are actual or expected significant adverse changes in business and financial conditions that are expected to cause a significant change to the borrowers ability to meet its obligations.
The Weir Group PLC 190 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Notes to the Company Financial Statements continued 5.
Investments in subsidiaries continued Independent of the primary indicators above, a significant increase in credit risk is presumed if a debtor is more than 30 days past due in making a contractual payment.
A default on a financial asset is considered to occur when the counterparty fails to make contractual payments within 90 days of when they fall due.
A write off is considered to be required when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, or when a debtor fails to make contractual payments greater than 120 days past due.
Where loans or receivables have been written off, the Company continues to engage in enforcement activity to attempt to recover the receivable due.
Where recoveries are made, these are recognised in the income statement.
As at 31 December 2018 and 1 January 2018, the loss allowances for all loans to subsidiaries were measured at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses.
This did not result in a material change to the loss allowance on 1 January 2018 for the loans, and as such no adjustment has been recorded and comparative figures have not been restated.
The closing loss allowances for loans due from subsidiaries as at 31 December 2018 reconcile to the opening loss allowances as follows: m 31 December 2017 calculated under IAS 39 5.4 Amounts restated through opening retained earnings Opening loss allowance as at 1 January 2018 calculated under IFRS 9 2018 IAS 39 2017 5.4 At 31 December 2018 5.4 6.

Trade & other receivables Trade & other receivables presented as non-current on the face of the Company balance sheet of 41.6m 2017: 42.6m are in respect of a prepayment recognised as a result of the pension funding partnership structure.
Further information pertaining to this arrangement can be found in note 8.
2018 2017 m m Amounts recoverable within one year Amounts owed by subsidiaries 204.4 158.8 Tax receivable 18.8 15.3 Other debtors 5.6 3.6 Prepayments & accrued income 0.9 0.3 229.7 178.0 Amounts owed by subsidiaries relate to management recharges in respect of support services provided.
Intercompany balances are typically managed on a Group basis, and the Companys credit risk management practices reflect this.
The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses, which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all such trade receivables.
The amounts owed by subsidiaries do not carry an interest charge, and it is the Companys expectation that materially all the amounts owed by subsidiaries are fully recoverable over time.
Expected credit losses at both 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2018 are therefore immaterial, and there has been no material change to the expected loss allowance during the year.
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information The Weir Group PLC 191 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 8.
Retirement benefits The Company has two funded defined benefit plans the Main Plan and the Executive Plan and an unfunded retirement benefit plan for retired directors.
The Company also operates a defined contribution plan.
Contributions to the defined contribution arrangement are in addition to those set out below and are charged directly to the income statement.
For the defined benefit plans, benefits are related to service and final salary.
The Main Plan closed to future accrual of benefits effective from 30 June 2015.
The weighted average duration of the expected benefit payments from the Main Plan is around 17 years and from the Executive Plan it is around 14 years.
The current funding target for the UK plans is to maintain assets equal to the value of the accrued benefits.
The Main Plan holds insurance policies in respect of a significant proportion of deferred and retired pensioners.
The Executive Plan entered into an insurance contract in 2017 which will match the liabilities of the plan in full.
The regulatory framework in the UK requires the Trustees and Company to agree upon the assumptions underlying the funding target, and then to agree upon the necessary contributions required to recover any deficit at the valuation date.
There is a risk to the Company that adverse experience could lead to a requirement for the Company to make considerable contributions to recover any deficit.
This risk is significantly reduced through the insurance policies held.
Assumptions The significant actuarial assumptions used for accounting purposes reflect prevailing market conditions and are as follows: 2018 2017 Significant actuarial assumptions: Discount rate % pa 2.9 2.4 Retail Prices inflation assumption % pa 3.2 3.2 Post-retirement mortality life expectancies in years : Current pensioners at 65 male 21.6 22.1 Current pensioners at 65 female 23.5 24.0 Future pensioners at 65 male 23.0 23.5 Future pensioners at 65 female 25.1 25.5 Other related actuarial assumptions: Rate of increases for pensions in payment % pa Pre 6 April 2006 service 3.1 3.1 Post 5 April 2006 service 2.1 2.1 Consumer Prices inflation assumption % pa 2.1 2.1 The assumptions used to determine end-of-year benefit obligations are also used to calculate the following periods cost.
The post-retirement mortality assumptions allow for expected increases in longevity.
The current disclosures above relate to assumptions based on longevity in years following retirement at the balance sheet date, with future being that relating to a member retiring in 2039 in 20 years time.
The assets and liabilities of the plans are as follows.
2018 2017 m m Plan assets at fair value Equities quoted 177.5 190.3 Diversified Growth Funds primarily quoted 55.5 56.8 Corporate bonds quoted 37.3 75.4 Government bonds quoted 109.2 74.7 Insurance policies unquoted 360.9 414.1 Cash quoted 8.7 0.4 Fair value of plan assets 749.1 811.7 Present value of funded obligations 819.8 935.3 Net funded obligations 70.7 123.6 Present value of unfunded obligations 1.4 1.5 Net liability 72.1 125.1 Plan in deficit 72.1 125.1 The government bonds held in 2018 are all index-linked.
The pension plans have not directly invested in any of the Companys own financial instruments, or in properties or other assets used by the Company.
The Weir Group PLC 192 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Notes to the Company Financial Statements continued 8.
Retirement benefits continued The investment strategy for the UK is to hold equities and other return-seeking assets such as diversified growth funds and a mixture of bonds to meet the assessed value of the benefits promised for the non-insured deferred pensioners.
For the remaining deferred pensioners and the bulk of pensioners currently receiving their benefit, the liabilities are backed by insurance policies and suitable bonds.
The change in net liabilities recognised in the balance sheet is comprised as follows.
2018 2017 m m Opening net liabilities 125.1 121.3 Expense charged to profit & loss 9.3 3.3 Amount recognised in Statement of Comprehensive Income 59.2 2.6 Employer contributions 3.1 2.1 Closing net liabilities 72.1 125.1 The amounts recognised in the income statement and in the Statement of Comprehensive Income for the period are analysed as follows.
2018 2017 m m Recognised in the Income Statement Past service cost 6.3 Administrative expenses 0.1 0.1 Included in operating loss 6.4 0.1 Interest on net pension liability 2.9 3.2 Total expense charged to profit & loss 9.3 3.3 Recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income Actual return on plan assets 22.7 33.8 Less: interest on plan assets 19.1 20.7 41.8 13.1 Other actuarial losses gains due to: Changes in financial assumptions 70.2 32.9 Changes in demographic assumptions 18.0 17.2 Experience on benefit obligations 12.8 Actuarial gains losses recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income 59.2 2.6 Current service cost and administration expenses are recognised in operating costs and interest on net pension liability is recognised in other finance costs.
In October 2018, following a High Court ruling in the UK, a 6.3m allowance in relation to expected future costs of equalising guaranteed minimum pensions has been included in the obligations on the balance sheet at 31 December 2018 and recognised in profit & loss as a past service cost.
Pension contributions are determined with the advice of independent qualified actuaries on the basis of regular valuations using the projected unit method.
The Company made special contributions of 3.0m in 2018 2017: 2.0m in addition to the Companys regular contributions.
The actuarial funding valuation of the Main Plan as at 31 December 2017 is ongoing, and it is due to be completed in early 2019.
Under the previous recovery plan agreed with the Trustees for the 31 December 2014 valuation, the Company entered into a pension funding partnership structure under which it will contribute interests in a Scottish Limited Partnership SLP for the Main Plan.
The Main Plans interests in the SLP will reduce the deficit on a funding basis, although the agreement will not affect the position directly on an FRS 101 accounting basis as the investments held do not qualify as assets for FRS101 purposes.
As a partner in the SLP, the Main Plan is entitled to receive a share of the profits of the SLP once a year for 15 years, subject to conditions being met.
The profits to be shared with the Plan will be reflected in the Companys financial statements as a pension contribution.
The Trustees of the UK Executive Scheme entered into a full buy-in transaction with Scottish Widows in Q3 2017, meaning all of the benefit payments due from the Executive Scheme are now covered by an insurance policy.
There remains an outstanding premium payment expected to be 1.1m due from the Trustees to Scottish Widows, which is expected to be paid in 2019 following a data cleanse process to finalise the insurance policy data.
The FRS101 balance sheet at the 2018 year-end therefore shows a deficit reflecting this payment due.
The Company has taken legal advice regarding its UK arrangements to confirm the accounting treatment under IFRIC 14 with regard to recognition of a current surplus and also recognition of a minimum funding requirement.
This confirmed that there is no requirement to adjust the balance sheet and that recognition of a current surplus is appropriate on the basis that the Company has an unconditional right to a refund of a current or projected future surplus at some point in the future.
For the same reason, there is no requirement for the Company to adjust the balance sheet to recognise the future agreed deficit recovery contributions.
Having considered the position, taking account of the legal input received and noting that the Trustees of the UK arrangements do not have discretionary powers to unilaterally wind up the schemes without cause, the Directors of the Company have concluded that the Company has an unconditional right to a refund of any surplus.
Amendments to the current version of IFRIC 14 are currently being considered.
The legal advice received by the Company has confirmed that the above accounting treatment will not be affected by the current exposure draft of the revised IFRIC 14.
The total Company contributions for 2019 including those expected from the SLP are expected to be 5.1m.
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information The Weir Group PLC 193 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Sensitivity analysis Changes in key assumptions can have a significant effect on the reported net retirement benefit obligation and the income statement expense for 2019.
The effects of changes in those assumptions are set out in the table below.
Increase Decrease Increase Decrease 2018 2018 2017 2017 m m m m Discount rate Effect on defined benefit obligation of a 1.0% change 120.4 144.8 144.5 176.2 Effect on net liability of a 1.0% change 83.9 103.7 103.0 129.5 RPI inflation and associated assumptions Effect on defined benefit obligation of a 1.0% change 91.0 82.5 95.8 87.3 Effect on net liability of a 1.0% change 57.9 51.9 62.2 56.0 Life expectancy Effect on defined benefit obligation of a 1 year change 28.8 28.8 28.0 28.0 Effect on net liability of a 1 year change 13.0 13.0 12.8 12.8 The impact on the net liability is significantly reduced as a result of the insurance policies held.
In the absence of such policies, the impact on the net liability would be much closer to the significantly higher impact on the defined benefit obligation shown in the table.
These sensitivities have been calculated to show the movement in the defined benefit obligation and net liability in isolation and assume no other changes in market conditions at the accounting date.
In practice, for example, a change in discount rate is unlikely to occur without any movement in the value of the invested non-insurance policy assets held by the plans.
Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligations are analysed as follows.
