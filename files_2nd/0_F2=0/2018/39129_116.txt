Entering the computer age Prudential has a long history of innovation.
Between 1964 and 1966, Prudential installed two Ferranti Orion computers at its head office in London, forming one of the UKs most powerful commercial computing resources at the time.
The success of the first two Orions led Prudential to install a third in 1969.
The Orions were used to streamline the administration of customer policy records.
Prior to computerisation, records were maintained using mechanical punch cards and punching, sorting and tabulating machines.
Computerisation was a huge step forward: 300 cards could be mechanically punched in an hour, but the Orion could carry out 100,000 calculations every second.
While huge by modern standards, the Orions also saved valuable space.
A reel of magnetic tape weighing less than eight pounds could hold the equivalent of 500,000 punched cards, which would have required 300 square feet of storage space and weighed over a tonne.
