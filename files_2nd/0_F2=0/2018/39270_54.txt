This is a closed-form solution similar to a Monte Carlo simulation which takes account of the correlation between share price performance and the likelihood of a TSR performance condition being met.
For the shares awarded in March 2018, the significant inputs into the model were a share price of 271.2p 2017: 246.4p, an expected share price volatility of 18.4% 2017: 18.1%, a median share price correlation between the companies in the comparator group of 25.5% 2017: 31.2%, and an expected life commensurate with the three-year performance vesting period.
The share price volatility assumption is based on analysis of historical daily share prices.
As the awards are nil-cost i. e. there is no exercise price, the assumed risk-free rate of return has minimal impact on the fair value of the awards.
Similarly, as dividend equivalents are paid on the vesting portion of awards, the fair value of these awards is not reduced to reflect dividends paid during the vesting period.
The fair value of awards granted during 2018 was 11.4m 2017: 9.8m.
Operating leases Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases net of any incentives received from the lessor are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
The Group leases properties, vehicles, and plant and equipment under non-cancellable operating lease agreements.
The leases have varying terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights.
The lease expenditure charged to the income statement during the year is 76.6m 2017: 74.7m.
The future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: 2018 2017 m m Not later than one year 62.4 50.3 Later than one year and not later than five years 113.4 89.1 Later than five years 17.4 10.3 193.2 149.7 Rentokil Initial plc Annual Report 2018
