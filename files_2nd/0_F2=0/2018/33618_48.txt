Twin Metals has a 70% interest in the Birch Lake Joint Venture BLJV which holds the Birch Lake, Spruce Road and Maturi Southwest deposits, as well as a portion of the main Maturi deposit.
With these interests taken into consideration, Twin Metals owns 83.1%of the resource.
For 2018 the resource estimate increased by137 million tonnes due to re-evaluation of the categorisation criteria in the Maturi deposit.
The cut-off grade applied to the determination of mineral resources is0.3% copper, which when combined with credits from nickel, platinum, palladium and gold, is deemed appropriate for an underground operation.
In the resource table TPM Total Precious Metals refers to the sum of platinum, palladium and gold values in grammes per tonne.
The TPM value of 0.57 g tonne for the Maturi resource estimate is made up of 0.15 g tonne platinum, 0.34 g tonne palladium and 0.08 g tonne gold.
The TPM value of 0.30 g tonne for the Maturi Southwest resource estimate is made up of 0.08 g tonne platinum, 0.17 g tonne palladium and 0.05 g tonne gold.
The TPM value of 0.70 g tonne for the Birch Lake resource estimate is made up of 0.19 g tonne platinum, 0.41 g tonne palladium and 0.10 g tonne gold.
The Spruce Road resource estimate does not include TPM values as they were not assayed.
On 22 December 2017 the Solicitor of the Department of the Interior issued a new legal opinion concluding that the BLM did not have discretion to deny Twin Metals application for renewal of federal mineral leases MNES-1352 and MNES-1353.
Immediately after, TwinMetals dismissed its lawsuit filed in the U. S. District Court inMinnesota against the BLM and USFS, with immediate effect.
Currently there is no pending litigation.
As expected, on 2 May 2018 the BLM reinstated the federal mineral leases MNES-1352 and MNES-1353 and the renewal process is ongoing.
