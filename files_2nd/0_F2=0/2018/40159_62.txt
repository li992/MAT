Retirement benefit obligations Accounting policy The Group operates pension and other post-retirement benefit plans around the world, which can be categorised into dened contribution plans and dened benefit plans.
For dened contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension plans on a statutory or contractual basis, and such amounts are charged to operating expenses.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
For funded dened benefit plans, the liability recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of the dened benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets.
For unfunded dened benefit plans the liability recognised at the balance sheet date is the present value of the dened benefit obligation.
The dened benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit method.
The present value of the dened benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outows using an interest rate equal to the yield on high-quality corporate bonds of the same currency and term as the benefit payments.
Actuarial gains and losses that arise are recognised in shareholders equity and presented in the statement of other comprehensive income in the period they arise.
The Group determines the net interest expense on the net dened benefit liability for the year by applying the discount rate used to measure the dened benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net dened benefit liability, taking into account any changes in the net dened benefit liability during the year as a result of contributions and benefit payments.
Net interest expense, the cost of the accrual of new benets, benefit enhancements or reductions and administration expenses met directly from plan assets are recognised in the income statement.
Signi cant accounting estimates and judgements There are many factors that affect the measurement of the retirement benefit obligations of the UK Fund and Overseas Plans.
This measurement requires the use of estimates, such as discount rates, ination, pension increases, salary increases, and life expectancies which are inherently uncertain: the sensitivity of the liabilities to changes in these assumptions is shown in the Note below.

The aim of all these plans is to give employees the opportunity to save appropriately for retirement in a way that is consistent with local regulations, taxation requirements and market conditions.
The dened benefit plans expose the Group to currency risk, interest rate risk, investment risk and actuarial risks such as longevity risk.
The material holdings of government and corporate bonds page 314 partially hedge movements in the liabilities resulting from interest rate changes.
Setting aside movements from other drivers such as currency uctuation, the increases in discount rates in most geographies over 2018 have led to lower liabilities.
These have been somewhat offset by falls in the value of bonds held and poor stock market performance.
These movements are shown as actuarial gains versus losses respectively in the tables below.
Contributions into a number of plans in excess of the amounts required to fund benets accruing have also helped to reduce the net deficit over the year.
The disclosures required under IAS 19 have been calculated by independent qualied actuaries based on the most recent full actuarial valuations updated, where necessary, to 31 December 2018.
UK Fund The Standard Chartered Pension Fund the UK Fund is the Groups largest pension plan, representing 58 per cent 31 December 2017: 60 per cent of total pension liabilities, and provides pensions based on 1 60th of final salary per year of service, normally payable from age 60.
The UK Fund is set up under a trust that is legally separate from the Bank its formal sponsor and, as required by UK legislation, at least one third of the trustee directors are nominated by members: the remainder are appointed by the Bank.
The trustee directors have a duciary duty to members and are responsible for governing the UK Fund in accordance with its Trust Deed and Rules.
The financial position of the UK Fund is regularly assessed by an independent qualied actuary.
The funding valuation as at 31 December 2017 was completed in December 2018 by the Scheme Actuary, A Zegleman of Willis Towers Watson, using assumptions different from those disclosed on page 313, and agreed with the UK Fund trustee.
It revealed a past service deficit of $203 million 159 million.
To repair the deficit, four annual cash payments of $42.0 million 32.9 million were agreed, with the first of these paid in December 2018.
The agreement allows that if the funding position improves to being at or near a surplus in future years the three payments from December 2019 will be reduced or eliminated.
In addition, an escrow account of $140 million 110 million exists to provide security for future contributions.
With effect from 1 July 1998, the UK Fund was closed to new entrants and new employees are offered membership of a dened contribution plan.
With effect from 1 April 2018 the UK Fund was closed to further accrual of benets for the 91 active members remaining at that time.
There is no accounting impact as a result of the closure as the liabilities represented by the benets already accrued are not expected to be signicantly altered by the closure.
As at 31 December 2018, the weighted average duration of the UK Fund was 14 years 31 December 2017: 15 years.
A judgement in respect of Lloyds Bank on 26 October 2018 addressed the requirement to equalise the impact of Guaranteed Minimum Pensions GMP for males and females.
The impact on the UK Fund of this judgement was estimated by the Scheme Actuary to be $2 million.
This impact has been recognised as a past service cost in the income statement.
The Group is not required to recognise any additional liability under IFRIC 14 or the 2015 exposure draft of proposed amendments to it, as the Bank has control of any pension surplus under the Trust Deed and Rules.

Retirement benefit obligations continued Overseas plans The principal overseas dened benefit arrangements operated by the Group are in Germany, Hong Kong, India, Jersey, Korea, Taiwan, United Arab Emirates UAE and the United States of America US.
Key assumptions The principal financial assumptions used at 31 December 2018 were: Funded plans 1 UK Fund Overseas Plans 31.12.18 31.12.17 31.12.18 31.12.17 % % % % Discount rate 2.8 2.5 0.9 7.6 1.0 7.2 Price Ination 2.1 2.1 1.0 5.0 1.0 5.0 Salary increases n a 2.1 2.1 7.0 2.1 7.0 Pension increases 2.1 2.1 0.0 3.2 1.6 3.2 1 The range of assumptions shown is for the main dened benefit overseas plans in Germany, Hong Kong, India, Jersey, Korea, Taiwan, UAE and the US.
These comprise over 90 per cent of the total liabilities of overseas dened benefit plans The principal non-financial assumptions are those made for UK life expectancy.
The assumptions for life expectancy for the UK Fund are that a male member currently aged 60 will live for 28 years 31 December 2017: 28 years and a female member for 29 years 31 December 2017: 29 years and a male member currently aged 40 will live for 30 years 31 December 2017: 30 years and a female member for 30 years 31 December 2017: 30 years after their 60th birthdays.
Both financial and non-financial assumptions can be expected to change in the future, which would affect the value placed on the liabilities.
For example, changes at the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions, holding other assumptions constant, would have affected the dened benefit obligation by the amounts shown below: If the discount rate increased by 25 basis points the liability would reduce by approximately $55 million for the UK Fund 31 December 2017: $65 million and $30 million for the other plans 31 December 2017: $30 million If the rate of ination increased by 25 basis points the liability, allowing for the consequent impact on pension and salary increases would increase by approximately $40 million for the UK Fund 31 December 2017: $45 million and $20 million for the other plans 31 December 2017: $20 million If the rate salaries increase compared to ination increased by 25 basis points the liability would increase by nil for the UK Fund 31 December 2017: $2 million and approximately $15 million for the other plans 31 December 2017: $15 million If longevity expectations increased by one year the liability would increase by approximately $45 million for the UK Fund 31 December 2017: $55 million and $15 million for the other plans 31 December 2017: $15 million Although this analysis does not take account of the full distribution of cash ows expected under the UK Fund, it does provide an approximation of the sensitivity to the main assumptions.
While changes in other assumptions would also have an impact, the effect would not be as significant.
