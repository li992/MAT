Where an accounting policy is specific to one note, the policy section is described in the note to which it relates.
This section also shows new EU endorsed accounting standards, amendments and interpretations, and whether they are effective in 2018 or later years.
We explain how these changes are expected to impact the financial position and performance of the Group.
The financial statements consolidate those of ITV plc the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and the Groups interests in associates and jointly controlled entities.
The Company is domiciled in the United Kingdom.
As required by European Union law IAS Regulation EC 1606 2002, the Groups financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU IFRS, and approved by the Directors.
The financial statements are principally prepared on the basis of historical cost.
Where other bases are applied, these are identified in the relevant accounting policy.
The parent company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101.
Going concern At 31 December 2018, the Group was in a financial net debt position with a positive gross cash balance.
The Group is in a net current asset position with a solid balance sheet.
The Group continues to generate significant cash from operations which enables the Group to meet its obligations.
As a part of the going concern test, the Group reviews forecasts of the total advertising market to determine the impact on ITVs liquidity position.
The Groups forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group will be able to operate within the level of its current available funding.
The Group also continues to focus on development of the non-advertising business, and evaluates the impact of further investment against the cash headroom of the business.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operation for at least 12 months from the date of this report.
Accordingly, the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its consolidated financial statements.
Subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and investments Subsidiaries are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Group.
Control exists where the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity in order to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
A joint venture is a joint arrangement in which the Group holds an interest under a contractual arrangement where the Group and one or more other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control.
The Group accounts for its interests in joint ventures using the equity method.
Under the equity method, the investment in the entity is stated as one line item at cost plus the investors share of retained post-acquisition profits and other changes in net assets.
An associate is an entity, other than a subsidiary or joint venture, over which the Group has significant influence.
Significant influence is the power to participate in, but not control or jointly control, the financial and operating decisions of an entity.
These investments are also accounted for using the equity method.
Investments where the Group concludes it does not have significant influence.
These investments are held at fair value unless the investment is a start-up business, in which case it is valued at cost and assessed for impairment.
13 131 1 Financ Financiial al S Statem tateme en nt ts s Notes to the Financial Statements Section 1: Basis of Preparation continued Current non-current distinction Current assets include assets held primarily for trading purposes, cash and cash equivalents, and assets expected to be realised in, or intended for sale or use in, the course of the Groups operating cycle.
All other assets are classified as non-current assets.
Current liabilities include liabilities held primarily for trading purposes, liabilities expected to be settled in the course of the Groups operating cycle and those liabilities due within one year from the reporting date.
All other liabilities are classified as non-current liabilities.
Classification of financial instruments The financial assets and liabilities of the Group are classified into the following financial statement captions in the statement of financial position in accordance with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Loans and receivables separately disclosed as cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables Financial assets at fair value through OCI measured at fair value through other comprehensive income Financial assets liabilities at fair value through profit or loss separately disclosed as derivative financial instruments in assets liabilities and included in other payables contingent consideration and Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost separately disclosed as borrowings and trade and other payables Judgement is required when determining the appropriate classification of the Groups financial instruments.
Details on the accounting policies for measurement of the above instruments are set out in the relevant note.
Where unconditional rights to set off financial instruments exist, the Group presents the relevant instruments net in the statement of financial position.
Recognition and derecognition of financial assets and liabilities The Group recognises a financial asset or liability when it becomes a party to the contract.
Financial instruments are no longer recognised in the statement of financial position when the contractual cash flows expire or when the Group no longer retains control of substantially all the risks and rewards under the instrument.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, call deposits with a maturity of less than or equal to three months from the date of acquisition and cash held to meet certain finance lease commitments.
The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents is considered to approximate fair value.
Foreign currencies The primary economic environment in which the Group operates is the UK and therefore the consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling.
Where Group companies based in the UK transact in foreign currencies, these transactions are translated into pounds sterling at the exchange rate on the transaction date.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated into pounds sterling at the year end exchange rate.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at historical cost are translated into pounds sterling at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction.
Where there is a movement in the exchange rate between the date of the transaction and the year end, a foreign exchange gain or loss is recognised in the income statement.
The assets and liabilities of Group companies outside of the UK are translated into pounds sterling at the year end exchange rate.
The revenue and expenses of these companies are translated into pounds sterling at the average monthly exchange rate during the year.
Where differences arise between these rates, they are recognised in the translation reserve within other comprehensive income.
The Groups net investments in companies outside the UK may be hedged where the currency exposure is considered to be material.
Hedge accounting is implemented on certain foreign currency firm commitments, for which the effective portion of any foreign exchange gains or losses is recognised in other comprehensive income note 4.3.
Where a forward currency contract is used to manage foreign exchange risk and hedge accounting is not applied, any impact of movements in currency for both the forward currency contracts and the assets and liabilities is taken to the income statement.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of the Groups interests in joint ventures and associates are recognised in the translation reserve within other comprehensive income.
On disposal of a foreign subsidiary, an interest in a joint venture or an associate, the related translation reserve is released to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.

It also requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, with revisions recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
The area involving a high degree of estimation, judgement or complexity is set out below and in more detail in the related note: Revenue recognition note 2.1 In addition to the above, the areas involving the most sensitive estimates and assumptions that are significant to the financial statements are set out below and in more detail in the related notes: Defined benefit pension note 3.7 Taxation note 2.3 Business combinations including earnouts note 3.3 and note 3.1.
5 New or amended EU endorsed accounting standards The Group has adopted IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers from 1 January 2018.
Neither standard has a material effect on the Groups financial statements.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9 sets out requirements for recognising and measuring financial assets, financial liabilities and some contracts to buy or sell non-financial items.
This standard replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
IFRS 9 introduces new models for classification of financial assets and accounting for credit losses.
Hedging rules have been amended to allow hedge accounting to be applied to more risks.
The adoption of IFRS 9 did not result in a material adjustment to previously reported results.
IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 is effective 1 January 2019 and will change lease accounting for lessees under operating leases.
Such agreements will require recognition of an asset, representing the right to use the leased item, and a liability, representing future lease payments.
Lease costs such as property rent will be recognised in the form of depreciation and interest, rather than as an operating cost.
The Group plans on adopting the modified retrospective approach with the right of use asset equal to the lease liability at transition date, less any lease incentives received.
The likely impact to Operating costs is expected to be between 3 million to 5 million with the likely impact to Profit before tax being nil to 1 million.
Non-current assets and gross liabilities are both expected to increase by 90 million to 120 million with net assets remaining unchanged.
The Group has elected not to recognise right of use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases or low-value assets.
The Group will continue to expense the lease payments associated with these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognised.
It replaced IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and related interpretations.
The Group has adopted IFRS 15 on a fully retrospective basis.
The following table summarises the impacts of adopting IFRS 15 on the Groups Income Statement for the year end 31 December 2017.

The changes to revenue recognition as a result of IFRS 15 relate to: Principal versus agent consideration in the Broadcast & Online division resulted in movements between revenue and costs.
This resulted in an increase to revenue of 1 million with a corresponding increase in operating costs Certain contracts for production of programmes in ITV Studios meet over-time revenue recognition criteria under IFRS 15, compared to point-in-time recognition under the previous standard.
This change has resulted in a reduction in revenue by 3 million with a corresponding reduction in operating costs.
The Statement of Financial Position has been adjusted for the impact of this timing difference and the reclassification of contract assets and liabilities from other balances The changes in the Statement of Financial Position relate to the reclass of programme rights and accrued revenue to contract assets and deferred revenue to contract liabilities There was no impact to the Groups Statement of Cash Flows.
Other new or amended accounting standards IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration and the amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment on the classification and measurement of share-based payment transactions did not have an impact to our results.
Based on the Directors analysis, other than those specifically mentioned, the new or amended accounting standards outlined above do not have a material impact on the Groups financial position or performance for the year ended 31 December 2018.
EU endorsed accounting standards effective in future periods The Directors considered the impact on the Group of other new and revised accounting standards, interpretations or amendments that are currently endorsed but not yet effective.
IFRS 16 has been discussed earlier.
The Directors do not expect any other standards to have a significant impact on the Groups results.

This section analyses the Groups profit before tax by reference to the activities Keeping 2.1 Profit performed by the Group and an analysis of key operating costs.
it simple before tax Adjusted earnings before interest, tax and amortisation EBITA is the Groups key profit indicator.
This reflects the way the business is managed and how the Directors assess the performance of the Group.
This section therefore also shows each divisions contribution to total revenue and adjusted EBITA.
Accounting policies Revenue recognition The Group derives revenue from the transfer of goods and services.
Revenue recognition is based on the delivery of performance obligations and an assessment of when control is transferred to the customer.
Revenue is recognised either when the performance obligation in the contract has been performed point in time recognition or over time as control of the performance obligation is transferred to the customer.
Customer contracts can have a wide variety of performance obligations, from production contracts to format licences and distribution activities.
For these contracts, each performance obligation is identified and evaluated.
Under IFRS 15 the Group needs to evaluate if a format or licence represents a right to access the content revenue recognised over time or represents a right to use the content revenue recognised at a point in time.
The Group has determined that most format and licence revenues are satisfied at a point in time due to their being limited ongoing involvement in the use of the license following its transfer to the customer.
The transaction price, being the amount to which the Group expects to be entitled and has rights to under the contract is allocated to the identified performance obligations.
The transaction price will also include an estimate of any variable consideration where the Groups performance may result in additional revenues based on the achievement of agreed targets such as audience targets.
Variable consideration is not recognised until the performance obligations are met.
Revenue is stated exclusive of VAT and equivalent sales taxes.
Complexity in advertising revenue recognition is driven by automated and manual processes involved in measuring the value delivered to the customer.
Revenue recognition criteria for the Groups key classes of revenue are as follows: Segment Major classes of revenue Payment terms Broadcast & Online Advertising NAR is generated from selling spot airtime and is Received in the month Total advertising recognised at the point of transmission after transmission revenue Video on demand VOD is generated from selling advertising on the Received in the month ITV Hub and is recognised at the point of delivery after campaign is delivered Revenue from the sponsorship of programmes across ITV linear channels and online is recognised over the period of transmission Received prior to transmission Direct to Revenue from pay is generated from the provision of HD channels, Payment term for pay Consumer catch up content and licences to ready-made programmes in the and interactive is over form of box sets and is recognised either over the term of the the term of the contracts contract or per subscriber or download Revenue from interactive is from entries to competitions and is recognised as the event occurs Revenue is generated from the carriage fee or capacity of the SDN Payment term is over the digital multiplex and is recognised over the term of the contract term of the contract 13 135 5 F Fi ina nanc nci ia al l S St ta at te em me ent nts s Notes to the Financial Statements Section 2: Results for the Year continued Segment Major classes of revenue Payment terms Studios Revenue generated from the programmes produced for broadcasters Payment term is over Programme in the UK and internationally and is recognised at the point of delivery the term of the production of an episode and acceptance by the customer.

The Board is regarded as the chief operating decision-maker.
The Board considers the business primarily from an operating activity perspective.
The reportable segments for the years ended 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017 are therefore Broadcast & Online and ITV Studios, the results of which are outlined in the following tables: Broadcast i & Online ITV Studios Consolidated 2018 2018 2018 m m m Total segment revenue 2,096 1,670 3,766 Intersegment revenue 4 551 555 Revenue from external customers 2,092 1,119 3,211 ii Adjusted EBITA 555 255 810 Broadcast iii i, iii & Online ITV Studios Consolidated 2017 2017 2017 m m m Total segment revenue 2,076 1,579 3,655 Intersegment revenue 2 523 525 Revenue from external customers 2,074 1,056 3,130 ii Adjusted EBITA 599 243 842 i Revenue of 354 million Restated 2017: 393 million was generated in the US during the year: the US represented 329 million 2017: 330 million of non-current assets at year end.
ii Adjusted EBITA is before exceptional items and includes the benefit of production tax credits.
It is shown after the elimination of intersegment revenue and costs.
iii The Group has applied IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments at 1 January 2018.
The Groups principal operations are in the United Kingdom.
Revenue from external customers in the United Kingdom is 2,250 million Restated 2017: 2,273 million, and revenue from external customers in other countries is 961 million Restated 2017: 856 million.
The Operating and Performance Review provides further detail on ITVs international revenues.
Intersegment revenue, which is earned on arms length terms, is mainly generated from the supply of ITV Studios programmes to Broadcast & Online for transmission primarily on the ITV network.
This revenue stream is a measure that forms part of the Groups strategic priority of building a strong international content business, as producing and retaining rights to the shows broadcast on the ITV network benefits the Group further from subsequent international content and format sales.
In preparing the segmental information, centrally managed costs have been allocated between reportable segments on a methodology driven principally by revenue, headcount and building occupancy of each segment.
This is consistent with the basis of reporting to the Board of Directors.
There is one media buying agency 2017: one acting on behalf of a number of advertisers that represent the Groups major customers.
This agency is the only customer that individually represents over 10% of the Groups revenue.
Revenue of approximately 554 million 2017: 561 million was derived from this customer.
This revenue is attributable to the Broadcast & Online segment.

This type of deal is also known as a Buy-in, which resulted in recognition of a loss of 94 million in other comprehensive income as explained in section 3.7.
Further, as part of the buy-in transaction, certain amendments were made to the scheme.
As a result, a past service cost of 5 million has been included in the measurement of the pension scheme liabilities for the pension increase exchange option no longer being available to members of these schemes.
Certain members of the sections also had a change of rate of pension increases.
This change resulted in a credit of 15 million which has also been recognised as an exceptional past service cost.
E Other Other relates to ongoing litigation costs outside the normal course of business.
F Gain loss on sale of non-current assets The gain on sale of non-current assets arose primarily as a result of the sale of freehold land and buildings in Manchester and Belfast.
This section sets out the Groups tax accounting policies, the current and deferred Keeping 2.3 tax charges or credits in the year which together make up the total tax charge it simple Taxation or credit in the income statement, a reconciliation of profit before tax to the tax charge for the period and the movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Accounting policies The tax charge for the period is recognised in the income statement, the statement of comprehensive income and directly in equity, according to the accounting treatment of the related transactions.
The tax charge comprises both current and deferred tax.
The calculation of the Groups tax charge involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be fully determined until a resolution has been reached by the relevant tax authority.
Current tax Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment in respect of previous years.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on estimates of the additional taxes that are likely to become due, which require judgement.
Amounts are accrued based on managements interpretation of specific tax law and the likelihood of settlement.
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.
Deferred tax Deferred tax arises due to certain temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and those for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: The initial recognition of goodwill The initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination and Differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to utilise the temporary difference.
Recognition of deferred tax assets, therefore, involves judgement regarding the timing and level of future taxable income.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are disclosed net to the extent that they relate to taxes levied by the same authority and the Group has the right of set-off.

Similarly, non-taxable income is income that is not expected to be taxable.
Adjustments to prior periods primarily arise where an outcome is obtained on certain tax matters, which differs from expectations held when the related provision was made.
Where the outcome is more favourable than the provision made, the difference is released, lowering the current year tax charge.
Where the outcome is less favourable than our provision, an additional charge to current year tax will occur.
The current tax charge includes a 14 million charge relating to prior years, and the deferred tax credit includes a 25 million credit relating to prior years.
These adjustments largely represent a movement between current tax and deferred tax, however differences have also arisen following changes in estimates of taxes that have already become due, or will become due in the future.
Previously unrecognised deferred tax assets are in relation to capital losses utilised against gains on sale of property.
The impact of overseas tax rates reflects the fact that some of our profits are earned in territories other than the UK and taxed at rates different from the UK corporation tax rate.
This year, losses arising in higher taxed jurisdictions, which we recognise through deferred tax, give rise to a reconciling benefit.
The UK corporation tax rate fell from 20% to 19% from 1 April 2017 and has been enacted to fall further to 17% from 1 April 2020.
These rates were enacted at the previous balance sheet date, and the carrying value of UK temporary differences were adjusted accordingly.
To the extent that temporary differences have unwound in the current year, this has given rise to a credit of nil 2017: charge of 6 million of which 1 million is recognised as a credit in the income statement and 1 million as a debit in other comprehensive income.

The ability to access these tax credits is fundamental when assessing the viability of investment decisions in the production of high-end drama and childrens programmes.
Under IFRS, these production tax credits are reported within the total taxation charge in the income statement.
However, ITV considers them to be a contribution to production costs, and therefore working capital in nature, and excludes them from its adjusted tax charge, including them instead within Adjusted EBITA.
The effective tax rate is 17.1% 2017: 17.4%, and is the tax charge on the face of the income statement expressed as a percentage of the profit before tax.
As explained in the Finance Review, the Group uses an adjusted tax rate to show how tax impacts total adjusted earnings in a way that is more aligned with the Groups cash tax position.
This year, the current year movement on origination and reversal of temporary differences excluding exceptional items is a credit of 5 million, compared with a credit of 13 million in 2017.
Taxation Other comprehensive income and equity As analysed in the table below, a deferred tax credit of 8 million on actuarial movements on pensions has been recognised in other comprehensive income 2017: 39 million charge.
A deferred tax credit of 6 million has been recognised in equity in respect of share-based payments 2017: charge of 1 million.
There is no current tax recognised in equity in relation to share-based payments 2017: credit of 1 million.

After netting off balances within countries, there is a deferred tax liability of 64 million and a deferred tax asset of 38 million 2017: deferred tax liability of 111 million and deferred tax asset of 31 million recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.

The adjustment in other comprehensive income to the deferred tax balance primarily relates to the actuarial loss recognised in the period.
A deferred tax asset of 375 million 2017: 377 million in respect of capital losses of 2,205 million 2017: 2,217 million has not been recognised due to uncertainties as to whether capital gains will arise in the appropriate form and relevant territories against which such losses could be utilised.
For the same reasons, deferred tax assets of 19 million 2017: 13 million in respect of overseas losses that time expire between 2019 and 2026 have not been recognised.
In line with our accounting policy on current tax, provisions are held on the balance sheet within current tax liabilities in respect of uncertain tax positions where management believe that it is probable that future payments of tax will be required.
At the balance sheet date, these tax provisions were not material for the Group.
Earnings per share EPS is the amount of post-tax profit attributable to each Keeping 2.4 share.

Diluted EPS reflects any commitments made by the Group to issue shares in the future and so it includes the impact of share options.
Adjusted EPS is presented in order to show the business performance of the Group in a consistent manner and reflect how the business is managed and measured on a day-to-day basis.
Adjusted EPS reflects the impact of operating and non-operating exceptional items on Basic EPS.

On the following pages, there are notes section covering working capital, non-current assets and liabilities, acquisitions and disposals, provisions and pensions.
Liabilities relating to the Groups financing activities are addressed in section 4.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are shown in note 2.3.
Working capital represents the assets and liabilities the Group generates through Keeping 3.1 its trading activity.
The Group therefore defines working capital as distribution it simple Working rights, programme rights, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and capital contract assets and liabilities.
Careful management of working capital ensures that the Group can meet its trading and financing obligations within its ordinary operating cycle.
Working capital is a driver of the profit to cash conversion ratio, a key performance indicator for the Group.
For those subsidiaries acquired during the year, working capital at the date of acquisition is excluded from the profit to cash calculation so that only subsequent working capital movements in the period controlled by ITV are reflected in this metric.
In the following section, you will find further information regarding working capital management and analysis of the elements of working capital.
1 Programme rights and commitments Accounting policies Rights are recognised when the Group controls the respective rights and the risks and rewards associated with them.
Programme rights not yet utilised are included in the statement of financial position at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
In assessing net realisable value for programmes in production, judgement is required when considering the contracted sales price and estimated costs to complete.
Broadcast programme rights Acquired programme rights which include films and sports rights are purchased for the primary purpose of broadcasting on the ITV family of channels, including VOD and SVOD platforms.
These are recognised within current assets as payments are made or when the rights are ready for broadcast.
The Group generally expenses these rights through operating costs over a number of transmissions reflecting the pattern and value in which the right is consumed.
Commissions, which primarily comprise programmes purchased, based on editorial specification and over which the Group has some control, are recognised in current assets as payments are made and are generally expensed to operating costs in full on first transmission.
Where a commission is repeated on any platform, incremental costs associated with the broadcast are included in operating costs.

Programming commitments are transactions entered into in the ordinary course of business with programme suppliers, sports organisations and film distributors in respect of rights to broadcast on the ITV network.
Commitments in respect of these transactions, which are not reflected in the statement of financial position, are due for payment as follows: Transmission Programme Total 2018 m m m Within one year 34 471 505 Later than one year and not more than five years 135 610 745 More than five years 5 50 55 174 1,131 1,305 Transmission Programme Total 2017 m m m Within one year 32 455 487 Later than one year and not more than five years 132 709 841 More than five years 58 47 105 222 1,211 1,433 3.1.
2 Distribution rights Accounting policies Distribution rights are programme rights the Group buys from producers to derive future revenue, principally through licensing to other broadcasters.
These are classified as non-current assets as these rights are used to derive long-term economic benefit for the Group.
Distribution rights are recognised initially at cost and charged through operating costs in the income statement over a period not exceeding five years, reflecting the value and pattern in which the right is consumed.
Judgement is required when estimating future patterns of consumption.
Advances paid for the acquisition of distribution rights are disclosed as distribution rights as soon as they are contracted.
These advances are not expensed until the programme is available for distribution.
Up to that point, they are assessed annually for impairment through the reassessment of the future sales expected to be earned from that title.

3 Trade and other receivables Accounting policies Trade receivables are recognised initially at the value of the invoice sent to the customer and subsequently at the amounts considered recoverable amortised cost.
Where payments are not due for more than one year, they are shown in the financial statements at their net present value to reflect the economic cost of delayed payment.
The Group provides goods and services to substantially all of its customers on credit terms.
Estimates are used in determining the level of receivables that will not, in the opinion of the Directors, be collected.
These estimates include such factors as historical experience, the current state of the UK and overseas economies and industry specific factors.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is sufficient evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due.
We have applied the expected loss model and the impact was not material.
The carrying value of trade receivables is considered to approximate fair value.
Trade and other receivables can be analysed as follows: Restated 2018 2017 m m Due within one year: Trade receivables 261 311 Other receivables 48 51 Prepayments 46 51 355 413 Due after more than one year: Trade receivables 36 19 Other receivables 35 8 71 27 Total trade and other receivables 426 440 The Group has applied IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers at 1 January 2018.

A depreciation expense equipment is charged to the income statement to reflect annual wear and tear and the reduced value of the asset over time.
Depreciation is calculated by estimating the number of years the Group expects the asset to be used useful economic life.
If there has been a technological change or decline in business performance, the Directors review the value of the assets to ensure they have not fallen below their depreciated value.
If an assets value falls below its depreciated value, an additional impairment charge is made against profit.
This section also explains the accounting policies followed by ITV and the specific estimates made in arriving at the net book value of these assets.
Accounting policies Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Certain items of property, plant and equipment that were revalued to fair value prior to 1 January 2004 the date of transition to IFRS are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount less depreciation up to the date of transition.
Assets held for sale Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
An asset is held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Depreciation Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment less estimated residual value, on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
The annual depreciation charge is sensitive to the estimated useful life of each asset and the expected residual value at the end of its life.
The major categories of property, plant and equipment are depreciated as follows: Asset class Depreciation policy Freehold land not depreciated Freehold buildings up to 60 years Leasehold improvements shorter of residual lease term or estimated useful life Vehicles, equipment and fittings 3 to 20 years Equipment includes studio production and technology assets.
Assets under construction are not depreciated until the point at which the asset comes into use by the Group.
Impairment of assets Property, plant and equipment that is subject to depreciation is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Indicators of impairment may include changes in technology and business performance.

it simple Intangible These assets include formats and brands, customer contracts and relationships, assets contractual arrangements, licences, software development, film libraries and goodwill.
The cost of these assets is the amount that the Group has paid or, where there has been a business combination, the fair value of the specific intangible assets that could be sold separately or which arise from legal rights.
In the case of goodwill, its cost is the amount the Group has paid in acquiring a business over and above the fair value of the individual assets and liabilities acquired.
The value of goodwill is the intangible value that comes from, for example, a uniquely strong market position and the outstanding productivity of its employees.
The value of intangible assets, with the exception of goodwill, reduces over the number of years the Group expects to use the asset, the useful economic life, via an annual amortisation charge to the income statement.
Where there has been a technological change or decline in business performance, the Directors review the value of assets, including goodwill, to ensure they have not fallen below their amortised value.
Should an assets value fall below its amortised value, an additional impairment charge is made against profit.
This section explains the accounting policies applied and the specific judgements and estimates made by the Directors in arriving at the net book value of these assets.
Accounting policies Goodwill Goodwill represents the future economic benefits that arise from assets that are not capable of being individually identified and separately recognised.
The goodwill recognised by the Group has all arisen as a result of business combinations.
Goodwill is stated at its recoverable amount being cost less any accumulated impairment losses and is allocated to the business to which it relates.
Due to changes in accounting standards, goodwill has been calculated using three different methods depending on the date the relevant business was purchased.
Method 1: All business combinations that have occurred since 1 January 2009 were accounted for using the acquisition method.
Under this method, goodwill is measured as the fair value of the consideration transferred including the recognition of any part of the business not yet owned non-controlling interests, less the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, all measured at the acquisition date.
Any contingent consideration expected to be transferred in the future will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date and recognised within other payables.
Contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability that is a financial instrument is measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
The determination of fair value is based on discounted cash flows.
The key assumptions take into consideration the probability of meeting each performance target and the discount rate.
Where less than 100% of a subsidiary is acquired, and call and put options are granted over the remaining interest, a non-controlling interest is initially recognised in equity at fair value, which is established based on the value of the put option.
A call option is recognised as a derivative financial instrument, carried at fair value.
The put option is recognised as a liability within other payables, carried at the present value of the put option exercise price, and a corresponding charge is included in merger and other reserves.
Any subsequent remeasurement of the put option liability is recognised within finance income or cost.
Subsequent adjustments to the fair value of net assets acquired can only be made within 12 months of the acquisition date, and only if fair values were determined provisionally at an earlier reporting date.
These adjustments are accounted for from the date of acquisition.
Acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with owners and therefore no goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions.
Transaction costs incurred in connection with those business combinations, such as legal fees, due diligence fees and other professional fees, are expensed as incurred.
The Directors consider these costs to reflect the cost of acquisition and to form a part of the capital transaction, and highlight them separately as exceptional items.
1 15 55 5 Financial Financial S Statements tatements Notes to the Financial Statements Section 3: Operating Assets and Liabilities continued Method 2: All business combinations that occurred between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2008 were accounted for using the purchase method in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations 2004.
Goodwill on those combinations represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired and did not include the value of the non-controlling interest.
Transaction costs incurred in connection with those business combinations, such as legal fees, due diligence fees and other professional fees, were included in the cost of acquisition.
Method 3: For business combinations prior to 1 January 2004, goodwill is included at its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under UK GAAP at that time less accumulated amortisation up to 31 December 2003.
The classification and accounting treatment of business combinations occurring prior to 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, has not been reconsidered, as permitted under IFRS 1.
Other intangible assets Intangible assets other than goodwill are those that are distinct and can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights.
The main intangible assets the Group has valued are formats, brands, licences, contractual arrangements, customer contracts and relationships and libraries.
Within ITV, there are two types of other intangible assets: those assets directly purchased by the Group for day-to-day operational purposes such as software licences and development and intangible assets identified as part of an acquisition of a business.
Intangible assets acquired directly by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Those separately identified intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition or business combination are shown at fair value at the date of acquisition less accumulated amortisation.
Each class of intangible assets valuation method on initial recognition, amortisation method and estimated useful life is set out in the table below: Class of intangible asset Amortisation method Estimated useful life Valuation method Brands Straight-line 8 to 14 years Applying a royalty rate to the expected future revenue over the life of the brand.
Formats Straight-line up to 8 years Expected future cash flows from those assets existing at the date of acquisition are estimated.

The Directors make estimates regarding the timing and amount of future cash flows derived from exploiting the assets being acquired.
The Directors then estimate an appropriate discount rate to apply to the forecast cash flows.
Such estimates are based on current budgets and forecasts, extrapolated for an appropriate period taking into account growth rates, operating costs and the expected useful lives of assets.
Judgements are also made regarding whether, and for how long, licences will be renewed: this drives our amortisation policy for those assets.
The Directors estimate the appropriate discount rate using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the assets or businesses being acquired.
Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are judged to be indefinite.
Indefinite life assets, such as goodwill, are not amortised but are tested for impairment at each year end.
Impairment Goodwill is not subject to amortisation and is tested annually for impairment and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
Other intangible assets are subject to amortisation and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the amount carried in the statement of financial position is less than its recoverable amount.
Determining whether the carrying amount of intangible assets has any indication of impairment requires judgement.
Any impairment is recognised in the income statement.
An impairment test is performed by assessing the recoverable amount of each asset, or for goodwill the cashgenerating unit CGU, or group of CGUs, related to the goodwill.
Total assets which include goodwill are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
The value in use is based on the present value of the future cash flows expected to arise from the asset.
In testing for impairment, estimates are used in deriving cash flows and the discount rates.
Such estimates reflect current market assessments of the risks specific to the asset and the time value of money.
The estimation process is complex due to the inherent risks and uncertainties associated with long-term forecasting.
If different estimates of the projected future cash flows or a different selection of an appropriate discount rate or long-term growth rate were made, these changes could materially alter the projected value of the cash flows of the asset, and as a consequence materially different amounts would be reported in the financial statements.
Impairment losses in respect of goodwill cannot be reversed.
In respect of assets other than goodwill, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

When assessing impairment, the recoverable amount of each CGU is based on value in use calculations.
These calculations require the use of estimates, specifically: pre-tax cash flow projections: long-term growth rates: and a pre-tax market discount rate.
Cash flow projections are based on the Groups current five year plan.
Beyond the five year plan, these projections are extrapolated using an estimated nominal long-term growth rate of 1.5% 2017: 1.5%.
The growth rate used is consistent with the long-term average growth rates for both the industry and the countries in which the CGUs are located and is appropriate because these are long-term businesses.

There is currently no reasonably possible change in discount rate that would reduce the headroom in any CGU to zero.
Broadcast & Online The goodwill in this CGU arose as a result of the acquisition of broadcasting businesses since 1999, the largest of which was the merger of Carlton and Granada in 2004 to form ITV plc, which was treated as an acquisition of Carlton for accounting purposes.
Broadcast & Online goodwill also includes the goodwill arising on acquisition of UTV Limited in February 2016.
The main assumptions on which the forecast cash flow projections for this CGU are based include: the performance and share of the television advertising market: share of commercial impacts: programme and other costs: and the pre-tax market discount rate.
The key assumption in assessing the recoverable amount of Broadcast & Online goodwill is the size of the television advertising market.
In forming its assumptions about the television advertising market, the Group has used a combination of long-term trends, industry forecasts and in-house estimates, which place greater emphasis on recent experience.
Also as part of the impairment review, a sensitivity of up to -10% of growth was applied to 2020 and -3% to 2021 with no subsequent recovery, with no impairment identified.
The Directors believe that currently no reasonably possible change in these assumptions would reduce the headroom in this CGU to zero.
An impairment charge of 2,309 million was recognised in the Broadcast & Online CGU in 2008, as a result of the downturn in the short-term outlook for the advertising market.
The current year impairment review, set out above, results in significant headroom in excess of the 2008 impairment amount.
Even though the advertising market has improved since then and the impaired assets are still owned and operated by the Group, due to accounting rules the impairment cannot be reversed.
A pre-tax market discount rate of 8.5% 2017: 9.5% has been used in discounting the projected cash flows.
SDN Goodwill was recognised when the Group acquired SDN the licence operator for DTT Multiplex A in 2005.
It represented the wider strategic benefits of the acquisition specific to the Group, principally the enhanced ability to promote Freeview as a platform, business relationships with the channels which are on Multiplex A and additional capacity available from 2010.
The main assumptions on which the forecast cash flows are based are: income to be earned from renewals of mediumterm contracts: the market price of available multiplex video streams: and the pre-tax market discount rate.
These assumptions have been determined by using a combination of current contract terms, recent market transactions and in-house estimates of video stream availability and pricing.
As part of the impairment review, sensitivity was applied to the main assumptions with no impairment identified 2020: -10% growth, 2021: 0% growth.
The Directors believe that currently no reasonably possible change in the cash flow and availability assumptions would reduce the headroom in this CGU to zero.
A pre-tax market discount rate of 10.2% 2017: 11.4% has been used in discounting the projected cash flows.
ITV Studios The goodwill for ITV Studios has arisen as a result of the acquisition of production businesses since 1999.
Significant balances were created from the acquisition by Granada of United News and Medias production businesses in 2000 and the merger of Granada and Carlton in 2004 to form ITV plc.
ITV Studios goodwill also includes the goodwill arising from recent acquisitions since 2012, with the largest acquisitions being Leftfield in 2014, followed by Talpa in 2015.
The key assumptions on which the forecast cash flows for the whole CGU were based include revenue including international revenue and the ITV Studios share of ITV output, growth in commissions and hours produced, margins and the pre-tax market discount rate.
These assumptions have been determined by using a combination of extrapolation of historical trends within the business, industry estimates and in-house estimates of growth rates in all markets.
The Directors believe that currently no reasonably possible change in the cash flow assumptions would reduce the headroom in this CGU to zero.
A pre-tax market discount rate of 9.5% 2017: 10.8% has been used in discounting the projected cash flows.
Following the acquisitions made by ITV Studios in 2017, the Directors considered how assets and resources are shared across the ITV Studios division and the level of integration within the management structure for the purposes of reporting and strategic decision-making.
They concluded that a single ITV Studios CGU continues to remain appropriate.

3.4 Keeping it simple Acquisitions Most of the deals are structured so that a large part of the payment made to the sellers consideration is determined based on future performance.
This is done so that the Group can both align incentives for growth, while reducing risk so that total consideration reflects actual performance, not expected.
IFRS accounting standards require some of this consideration to be included in the purchase price used in determining goodwill contingent consideration.
Examples of contingent consideration include top-up payments and recoupable performance adjustments.
Any remaining consideration is required to be recognised as a liability or expense outside of acquisition accounting put option liabilities and employmentlinked contingent payments known as earnout payments.
The Group considers the income statement impact of all consideration to be capital in nature and so excludes it from adjusted profit.
Therefore, for each acquisition below, the distinction between the types of consideration has been explained in detail.
Acquisitions in the current year 2018 The Group did not make any acquisitions in the current year.
Acquisitions in the prior year 2017 In 2017, the Group made payments totalling 54 million for five acquisitions within the ITV Studios operating segment.
The businesses fit with the strategy of strengthening the Groups existing position as a producer for major television networks in the UK, Europe, US and OTT platforms.
Tetra Media Studio SAS On 28 February 2017, the Group purchased 65.04% of the share capital of Tetra Media Studio SAS, a French television production group which specialises in drama, including flagship crime series Profilage, and political crime thriller Les Hommes fide lOmbre.
Tomorrow ITV Studios LLC On 1 April 2017, the Group gained control of Tomorrow ITV Studios LLC due to the conversion of its 75% preference share capital into 75% ordinary share capital.
The company produced Aquarius, a US period crime series, which aired on NBC, and is producing Snowpiercer, an action sci-fi drama series, expected to be released in the US in 2019.
World Productions Limited On 30 April 2017, the Group purchased 92% of the share capital of World Productions Limited, a company which specialises in producing drama series with titles including Line of Duty, an award-winning British police crime drama, and Born to Kill, a British thriller television mini-series.
Elk Production AB On 21 June 2017, the Group acquired 96% of the share capital of Elk Production AB.
Elk is one of the leading independent production companies in Sweden.
Key titles produced by the company include Ninja Warrior, an obstacle course competition series, Dessertmstarna, a dessert cooking competition, and award-winning TV series Wahlgrens and Parneviks.
Cattleya S. r. l. On 11 October 2017, the Group purchased 51% of the share capital of Cattleya Srl, an Italian scripted production company behind international hit TV dramas Gomorrah, Romanzo Criminale and Suburra, Netflixs first Italian original TV series.
Acquisition accounting: Put and call options have been granted over the non-controlling interest of all five acquisitions, exercisable over the next two to seven years.
The total maximum consideration for the acquisitions is capped at 418 million undiscounted.
All future payments are dependent on future performance of the business and linked to ongoing employment.
The Group paid total consideration of 35 million with the fair value of previously held preference shares of 29 million, non-controlling interests of 25 million and acquired net assets with a fair value of 4 million resulting in goodwill of 85 million.
The present value of the expected liability on put options was 23 million and the present value of the expected earnout payment at acquisition was 11 million.
As disclosed in 2017, the contribution to the Groups performance from the date of acquisition to the end of 2017 was Revenue of 59 million and EBITA before exceptionals nil.
The proforma contribution to the Groups performance from January to December 2017 was Revenue 131 million and EBITA before exceptionals nil.

Keeping 3.5 Accounting for these investments, and the Groups share of any profits and losses, it simple Investments depends on the level of control or influence the Group is granted via its interest.
The three principal types of non-consolidated investments are: joint arrangements joint ventures or joint operations, associates and equity investments.
A joint arrangement is an investment where the Group has joint control, with one or more third parties.
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence i. e. power to participate in the investees financial and operating decisions.
Any other investment is an equity investment.
Accounting policies For joint ventures and associates, the Group applies equity accounting.
Under this method, it recognises the investment in the entity at cost and subsequently adjusts this for its share of profits or losses, which are recognised in the income statement within non-operating items and included in adjusted profit.
Where the Group has invested in associates by acquiring preference shares or convertible debt instruments, the share of profit recognised is usually nil as no equity interest exists.
Equity investments are held at fair value unless the investment is a start-up business, in which case it is valued at cost and assessed for impairment.
The carrying amount of each category of our investments is represented as follows: 2018 2017 m m Joint ventures 1 2 Associates 41 68 Equity investments 9 4 51 74 Equity investments have increased during the year due to an investment in Quibi, a US venture aimed at delivering highquality content to mobile devices.
Further smaller investments have been made in line with Groups strategy to grow the international content business.
In the current year, the carrying amount of certain short-form content investments was written down following an impairment review.

it simple Provisions A provision is made where the Group is not certain how much cash will be required to settle a liability, so an estimate is required.
The main estimates relate to the cost of holding properties that are no longer in use by the Group, the likelihood of settling legal claims and contracts the Group has entered into that are now unprofitable.
Accounting policies A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation arising from past events, it is probable cash will be paid to settle it and the amount can be estimated reliably.
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows by a rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a financing cost in the income statement.
The value of the provision is determined based on assumptions and estimates in relation to the amount and timing of actual cash flows, which are dependent on future events.
Provisions The movements in provisions during the year are as follows: Contract Property Legal and Other provisions provisions provisions Total m m m m At 1 January 2018 3 4 16 23 Additions 1 1 Utilised 1 1 Released 3 3 At 31 December 2018 2 2 16 20 Provisions of 16 million are classified as current liabilities 2017: 16 million.
Unwind of the discount is nil in 2018 and 2017.
Contract provisions comprise onerous commitments on playout and related services that are not expected to be utilised over the remaining contract period.
Property provisions primarily relate to expected dilapidation costs at rental properties.
Legal and Other provisions totalling 16 million 31 December 2017: 16 million primarily relate to potential liabilities that may arise as a result of Boxclever having been placed into administrative receivership, most of which relate to pension arrangements.
In 2011, the Determinations Panel of the Pensions Regulator determined that Financial Support Directions FSD should be issued against certain Group companies, which would require those companies to put in place financial support for the Boxclever Pension Scheme.
An FSD does not set out what form any financial support should take, nor its amount.
The Group challenged the Regulators decision in the Upper Tribunal.
However, in May 2018, the Upper Tribunal reached a decision to allow the Pension Regulator to issue an FSD.
Subsequently the Upper Tribunal gave ITV permission to appeal its decision to the Court of Appeal.
Such appeal was made in July 2018 and the appeal has been fixed for May 2019.
During the period of the appeal, an FSD cannot be issued.
The Directors, having taken advice, believe that they continue to have a strong case.
There are significant points of legal principle at issue and consequently any potential liability may take a considerable period to resolve.
While any potential liability might be significant, the Directors continue to believe that the provision held is appropriate 16 162 2 IIT TV V p plc lc A A nnu nna ul a R l R ep eo pr o t ra t a nd n d A Acc c o cu on uts nt2 s 2 018 01 8 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Additional information Section 3: Operating Assets and Liabilities In this note, we explain the accounting policies governing the Groups pension Keeping 3.7 schemes, followed by analysis of the components of the net defined benefit pension it simple Pensions deficit, including assumptions made, and where the related movements have been recognised in the financial statements.
In addition, we have placed text boxes to explain some of the technical terms used in the disclosure.
What are the Groups pension schemes?
There are two types of pension schemes.
A Defined Contribution scheme that is open to ITV employees, and a number of Defined Benefit schemes that have been closed to new members since 2006 and closed to future accrual in 2017.
In 2016, on acquisition of UTV Limited, the Group took over the UTV Defined Benefit Scheme, which remains open to future accrual.
What is a Defined Contribution scheme?
The Defined Contribution scheme is where the Group makes fixed payments into a separate fund on behalf of those employees participating in saving for their retirement.
ITV has no further obligation to the participating employee and the risks and rewards associated with this type of scheme are assumed by the members rather than the Group.
Although the Trustee of the scheme makes available a range of investment options, it is the members responsibility to make investment decisions relating to their retirement benefits.
What is a Defined Benefit scheme?
In a Defined Benefit scheme, members receive payments during retirement, the value of which is dependent on factors such as salary and length of service.
The Group makes contributions to the scheme, a separate trustee-administered fund that is not consolidated in these financial statements, but is reflected on the defined benefit pension deficit line on the consolidated statement of financial position.
It is the responsibility of the Trustee to manage and invest the assets of the Scheme and its funding position.
The Trustee, appointed according to the terms of the schemes documentation, is required to act in the best interest of the members and is responsible for managing and investing the assets of the scheme and its funding position.
The Group has a Pension Steering Committee, which liaises with the Trustee and has oversight of the management of the pension schemes and underlying risks.
In the event of poor returns, the Group may need to address this through a combination of increased levels of contribution or by making adjustments to the scheme.
Schemes can be funded, where regular cash contributions are made by the employer into a fund which is invested, or unfunded, where no regular money or assets are required to be put aside to cover future payments but in some cases security is required.
The accounting defined benefit pension deficit IAS 19 is different from the actuarial valuation deficit as they are calculated on the basis of different assumptions, such as discount rate.
The accounting defined benefit pension deficit IAS 19 figure is calculated as at the balance sheet date, and the actuarial deficit was calculated for the last triennial valuation as of 1 January 2017 for the ITV Pension Scheme and 30 June 2017 for the UTV Pension Scheme.
Accounting policies Defined contribution scheme Obligations under the Groups defined contribution schemes are recognised as an operating cost in the income statement as incurred.
For 2018, total contributions expensed were 21 million 2017: 18 million.
1 16 63 3 F Fi ina nanc nci ia al l S St ta at te em me ent nts s Notes to the Financial Statements Section 3: Operating Assets and Liabilities continued Defined benefit scheme The Groups obligation in respect of the Defined Benefit Scheme the Scheme is calculated by estimating the amount of future retirement benefit that eligible employees members have earned during their services.
That benefit payable in the future is discounted to todays value and then the fair value of scheme assets is deducted to measure the defined benefit pension position.
The liabilities of the Scheme are measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid using the projected unit method.
These calculations are complex and are performed by a qualified actuary.
There are many judgements and estimates necessary to calculate the Groups estimated liabilities, the main assumptions are set out later in this section.
Movements in assumptions during the year are called actuarial gains and losses and these are recognised in the period in which they arise through the statement of comprehensive income.
The latest triennial valuation of the ITV Pension Scheme was undertaken as at 1 January 2017 by an independent actuary appointed by the Trustee of the Scheme and agreed in early 2018.
The combined funding deficits of the ITV Pension Scheme as at 1 January 2017 amounted to 470 million.
The deficit funding contributions for the ITV main scheme will be 60 million per annum.
The next triennial valuation will be as at 1 January 2020.
This will drive subsequent contribution rates.
An unfunded scheme in relation to four former Granada executives is accounted for under IAS 19 and the Group is responsible for meeting the pension obligations as they fall due.
The unfunded scheme has additional security compared with the ITV main scheme, in the form of a charge over gilts held by the Group.
Therefore, the 49 million securitised gilts have been classified as other pension assets to reflect the Groups net pension deficit.
Due to the size of the UTV Pension Scheme, the Directors present the results and position of the UTV Scheme within this note combined with the existing ITV Schemes.
The latest triennial valuation was undertaken as at 30 June 2017 and was agreed during the second half of 2018.
The next triennial valuation will be as at 30 June 2020.
Unless otherwise stated, references to the Schemes within this note refer to the ITV Pension Scheme, the unfunded scheme and the UTV Scheme combined.
The sponsoring company of the ITV Pension Scheme is ITV Services Limited, the unfunded scheme is Granada Group Limited and the UTV Scheme is sponsored by UTV Limited.
The defined benefit pension deficit Net pension deficit of 38 million at 31 December 2018 2017: 83 million is stated after including the unfunded scheme security asset of 49 million 2017: 38 million.
The totals recognised in the current and previous years are: 2018 2017 m m Total defined benefit scheme obligations 3,719 3,987 Total defined benefit scheme assets 3,632 3,866 Defined benefit pension deficit IAS 19 87 121 Presented as: Defined benefit pension surplus 19 16 Defined benefit pension deficit 106 137 Defined benefit pension deficit IAS 19 87 121 Other pension asset 49 38 Net pension deficit 38 83 The defined benefit pension surplus relates solely to the UTV Scheme.
The defined benefit scheme assets in the UTV Scheme were 126 million as at 31 December 2018 2017: 130 million and the defined benefit scheme obligations were 107 million 2017: 114 million.
The remaining sections provide further detail of the value of the Schemes assets and liabilities, how these are accounted for and the impact on the financial statements.

Keeping The areas that impact the defined benefit obligation the pension scheme liabilities it simple position at the year end are as follows: Current service cost the cost to the Group of the future benefits earned by members that relates to the members service in the current year.
This is charged to operating costs in the income statement Past service cost is a change in present value of the benefits built up by the members in the prior periods: can be positive or negative resulting from changes to the existing plan as a result of an agreement between ITV and employees or legislative change including legal rulings or as a result of significant reduction by ITV in the number of employees covered by the plan curtailment Interest cost the pension obligations payable in the future are discounted to the present value at year end.
A discount factor is used to determine the current value today of the future cost.
The interest cost is the unwinding of one years movement in the present value of the obligation.
It is broadly determined by multiplying the discount rate at the beginning of the period by the updated present value of the obligation during the period.
The discount rate is a key assumption explained later in this section.
This interest cost is recognised through net financing costs in the income statement see note 4.4 Actuarial gains or losses there are broadly two causes of actuarial movements: experience adjustments, which arise when comparing assumptions made when estimating the liabilities and what has actually occurred, and adjustments resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions e. g. movements in corporate bond yields or change in mortality.
Key assumptions are explained in detail later in this section.
Actuarial gains or losses are recognised through other comprehensive income Benefits paid any cash benefits paid out by the Scheme will reduce the obligation One-off events for example, the acquisition of UTV Limited The movement in the present value of the Groups defined benefit obligation is analysed below: 2018 2017 m m Defined benefit obligation at 1 January 3,987 4,200 Current service cost 2 Past service cost GMP equalisation 6 Changes in relation to pension increases 15 Pension increase exchange option 5 Interest cost 97 107 Actuarial gain 166 121 Benefits paid 195 201 Defined benefit obligation at 31 December 3,719 3,987 Of the above total defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2018, 56 million relates to unfunded schemes 2017: 58 million, including the scheme in relation to the four former Granada executives.
On 26 October 2018, a High Court ruling the Lloyds Case determined that pension schemes need to address inequalities between men and women in Guaranteed Minimum Pension GMP earned between 17 May 1990 and 5 April 1997.
This is to comply with sex discrimination legislation known as GMP equalisation.
In previous years, given the legal uncertainty on the treatment of GMP equality, no allowance had been made in the IAS 19 defined benefit obligation.
The court ruling has now clarified how GMPs should be equalised and as a result, a past service cost of 6 million has been recognised in the current period.
In November 2018, the Pension Trustee entered into a bulk annuity insurance contract in respect of the benefits of two sections of the ITV Pension Scheme.
This type of deal is also known as a Buy-in.
As a result of the buy-in, a past service cost of 5 million has been included in the measurement of the pension scheme liabilities.
This is due to the pension increase exchange PIE option no longer being available to members of these schemes.
PIE is an option to give up future increases on your pension, in exchange for a higher immediate pension with lower or no further increases.
1 16 65 5 F Fi ina nanc nci ia al l S St ta at te em me ent nts s Notes to the Financial Statements Section 3: Operating Assets and Liabilities continued Assumptions used to estimate the Scheme obligations What are the main assumptions used to estimate the Scheme obligations?
Keeping The main assumptions are: it simple An estimate of increases in pension payments The life expectancy of members The effect of inflation on all these factors The discount rate used to estimate the present day fair value of these obligations Future salary levels for the UTV Scheme and Future pensionable salary levels for the UTV Scheme How do we determine the appropriate assumptions?
The Group takes independent actuarial advice relating to the appropriateness of the assumptions used.
IFRS requires that we estimate a discount rate by reference to high-quality fixed income investments in the UK that match the estimated term of the pension obligations.
The inflation assumption has been set by looking at the difference between the yields on fixed and index-linked Government bonds.
The inflation assumption is used as a basis for the remaining financial assumptions, except where caps have been implemented.
The discount rate has therefore been obtained using the yields available on AA rated corporate bonds, which match projected cash flows.
The Groups estimate of the weighted average term of the liabilities is 15 years 2017: 15 years.
The principal assumptions used in the Schemes valuations at the year end were: 2018 2017 Discount rate for: Past service liabilities 2.85% 2.50% Future service liabilities 2.85% 2.50% Inflation assumption for: Past service liabilities 3.20% 3.15% Future service liabilities 3.20% 3.15% Rate of pensionable salary increases UTV Pension Scheme 3.70% 3.65% 1 Rate of increase in pension payment LPI 5% pension increases 3.05% 2.95% Rate of increase to deferred pensions CPI 2.20% 2.15% 1.

it simple What are the pension Scheme assets?
At 31 December 2018, the Schemes assets were invested in a diversified portfolio that consisted primarily of equity and debt securities and insurance policies matching the pensions due to certain members.
The tables below set out the major categories of assets.
Financial instruments are in place in order to provide protection against changes in market factors interest rates and inflation, which could act to increase the net pension deficit.
One such instrument is the longevity swap, which the Scheme transacted in 2011 to obtain protection against the effect of increases in the life expectation of the majority of pensioner members at that date.
Under the swap, the Trustee agreed to make pre-determined payments in return for payments to meet the specified pension obligations as they fall due, irrespective of how long the members and their dependants live.
The difference in the present values of these two streams of payments is reflected in the Scheme assets.
The swap had a nil valuation at inception and, using market-based assumptions, is subsequently adjusted for changes in the market life expectancy and market discount rates, in line with its fair value.
How do we measure the pension Scheme assets?
Defined benefit scheme assets are measured at their fair value and can change due to the following: Interest income on scheme assets this is determined by multiplying the fair value of the Scheme assets by the discount rate, both taken as of the beginning of the year.
This is recognised through net financing costs in the income statement Return on assets arise from differences between the actual return and interest income on Scheme assets and are recognised through other comprehensive income Employers contributions are paid into the Scheme to be managed and invested and Benefits and administrative expenses paid out by the Schemes will lower the fair value of the Schemes assets The movement in the fair value of the defined benefit schemes assets is analysed below: 2018 2017 m m Fair value of Scheme assets at 1 January 3,866 3,833 Interest income on Scheme assets 95 98 Return on assets, excluding interest income 218 51 Employer contributions 90 90 Benefits paid 195 201 Administrative expenses paid 6 5 Fair value of Scheme assets at 31 December 3,632 3,866 1 167 67 F Fi ina nanc nci ia al l S St ta at te em me ent nts s Notes to the Financial Statements Section 3: Operating Assets and Liabilities continued How are the Schemes assets invested?
At 31 December 2018, the Schemes assets were invested in a diversified portfolio that consisted primarily of equity and debt securities and insurance policies matching pensions due to certain members.
The Trustee is responsible for deciding the investment strategy for the schemes assets, although changes in investment policies require consultation with the Group.
The assets are invested in different classes to hedge against unfavourable movements in the funding obligation.
When selecting the mix of assets to hold, and considering their related risks and returns, the Trustee will weigh up the variability of returns against the target long-term rate of return on the overall portfolio.
The fair value of the Schemes assets is shown in the following table by major category: Market value Market value 2018 2017 m m Liability hedging assets Fixed interest gilts 475 633 Index-linked interest gilts 1,067 1,456 Interest rate and inflation hedging derivatives swaps and repos 230 279 1,772 49% 2,368 61% Other bonds 834 23% 865 22% Return seeking investments Quoted equities 169 260 Infrastructure 171 88 Property 106 109 Hedge funds alternatives 172 193 618 17% 650 17% Other investments Cash and cash equivalents 183 240 Insurance policies 530 41 Longevity swap fair value 305 298 408 11% 17 Total Scheme assets 3,632 100% 3,866 100% Included in the above are overseas assets of 725 million 2017: 978 million, comprised of quoted equities of 68 million 2017: 244 million and bonds of 657 million 2017: 734 million.
A buy-in is where the Trustee purchases an insurance policy which is effectively a scheme asset which pays the members benefits.
The ultimate obligation to pay the members benefits still remains with the scheme.
As the acquisition of the insurance contract is an investment decision and this has been accounted for through the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income.
For IAS 19 purposes, the fair value of this insurance contract is set equal to the valuation of the insured member benefits using the IAS 19 assumptions.
As these two sections of the ITV Pension Scheme were in a surplus position under IAS 19, this has resulted in an investment loss of 94 million within the Groups Statement of Other Comprehensive Income.
The Trustee entered a longevity swap in 2011, which provides cash flow certainty by hedging the risk of increasing life expectancy over the next 70 years for 11,700 of current pensioners at inception covering 1.7 billion of the pension obligation.
The fair value of the longevity swap equals the discounted value of the projected net cash flows resulting from the contract and has reduced in value in 2018.

Keeping It is important to note that comparatively small changes in the assumptions used it simple may have a significant effect on the consolidated income statement and statement of financial position.
This sensitivity to change is analysed below to demonstrate how small changes in assumptions can have a large impact on the estimation of the defined benefit pension deficit.
The Trustee manages the investment, mortality and inflation risks to ensure the pension obligations are met as they fall due.
The investment strategy is aimed at the valuation obligation rather than IAS 19 defined pension deficit value.
As such, the effectiveness of the risk hedging strategies on a valuation basis will not be the same as on an accounting basis.
Those hedging strategies have significant impact on the movement in the net pension deficit as assumptions change, offsetting the impacts on the obligation disclosed below.
In practice, changes in one assumption may be accompanied by offsetting changes in another assumption although this is not always the case.
Changes in the assumptions may occur at the same time as changes in the market value of Scheme assets, which may or may not offset the changes in assumptions.
Changes in assumptions have a different level of impact as the value of the net pension deficit fluctuates, because the relationship between them is not linear.
The analysis below considers the impact of a single change in principal assumptions on the defined benefit obligation while keeping the other assumptions unchanged and does not take into account any risk hedging strategies: Assumption Change in assumption Impact on defined benefit obligation Increase by 0.1% Decrease by 60 million Discount rate Decrease by 0.1% Increase by 60 million Increase by 0.1% Increase by 30 million Rate of inflation Retail Price Index Decrease by 0.1% Decrease by 30 million Increase by 0.1% Increase by 10 million Rate of inflation Consumer Price Index Decrease by 0.1% Decrease by 10 million Life expectations Increase by one year Increase by 100 million The sensitivity analysis has been determined by extrapolating the impact on the defined benefit obligation at the year end with changes in key assumptions that might reasonably occur.
While the Schemes risk hedging strategy is aimed at a valuation basis, the Directors estimate that on an accounting basis it would significantly reduce the above impact on the defined benefit obligation.
In particular, an increase in assumption of life expectations by one year would benefit from an estimated increase of the value of the longevity swap by 100 million and the value of the bulk annuity insurance contracts by 15 million, resulting in a net reduction in the defined pension deficit of 15 million.
Further, the ITV Pension Scheme invests in UK Government bonds and interest rate and inflation swap contracts and therefore movements in the defined benefit obligation are typically offset, to an extent, by asset movements.

Amounts recognised through the income statement Amounts recognised through the income statement are as follows: 2018 2017 m m Amount charged to operating costs: Current service cost 2 Scheme administration expenses 6 5 6 7 Amount charged to exceptional costs: Past service credit 4 Amount charged to net financing costs: Net interest on defined benefit obligation 2 9 Total charged in the consolidated income statement 4 16 Amounts recognised through the consolidated statement of comprehensive income The amounts recognised through the consolidated statement of comprehensive income cost are: 2018 2017 m m Remeasurement gains losses : Return on scheme assets excluding interest income 218 51 Actuarial gains losses on liabilities arising from change in: experience adjustments 6 138 financial assumptions 172 12 demographic assumptions 29 166 121 Total recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 52 172 The 166 million actuarial gain on the Schemes liabilities was principally due to changes in bond yields.
The 218 million loss on the Schemes assets primarily results from increase bond yields and the purchase of the bulk annuity insurance contracts which have led to assets underperforming expectations.

This involves agreeing a Schedule of Contributions at each triennial it simple valuation, which specifies the contribution rates for the employer and, where relevant, scheme members and the date these contributions are due.
A recovery plan setting out the steps that will be taken to address a funding shortfall is also agreed.
In the event that the Groups defined benefit scheme is in a net liability position, the Directors must take steps to manage the size of the deficit.
Apart from the funding agreements mentioned above, this could involve pledging additional assets to the Scheme, as was the case in the SDN and London Television Centre pension funding partnerships.
The levels of ongoing contributions to the Scheme are based on the current service costs as assessed by the Scheme Trustee and the expected future cash flows of the Scheme.
Normal employer contributions in 2019 for UTV Scheme current service and administration expenses are expected to be in the region of 6 million 2018: 6 million and deficit funding contributions for the main ITV scheme in 2019 are expected to be 60 million 2018: 66 million, assuming current contribution rates continue as agreed with the Trustee.
The Group has two asset-backed pension funding agreements with the Trustee and makes annual payments of 11 million for 12 years from 2011, and also 3 million, increasing by 5% per annum until 2038.
In 2019, a payment of 14 million is expected as a result of those agreements.
With the London Television Centre held for sale, we will be reviewing the asset-backed structures.
IFRIC 14 clarifies how the asset ceiling rules should be applied if the Schemes are expected to be in surplus, for example as a result of deficit funding agreements.
The Group has determined that it has an unconditional right to a refund of any surplus assets if the Schemes are run off until the last member dies.
On this basis, IFRIC 14 rules do not cause any change in the pension deficit accounting or disclosures.

section The Directors determine the appropriate capital structure of ITV: specifically how much is raised from shareholders equity and how much is borrowed from financial institutions debt in order to finance the Groups activities both now and in the future.
Maintaining capital discipline and balance sheet efficiency remains important to the Group.
Any potential courses of action will take into account the Groups liquidity needs, flexibility to invest in the business, pension deficit initiatives and impact on credit ratings.
The Directors consider the Groups capital structure and dividend policy at least twice a year ahead of announcing results and do so in the context of its ability to continue as a going concern, to execute the strategy and to invest in opportunities to grow the business and enhance shareholder value.

Loans and facilities due within one year At various periods during the year, the Group drew down on the 630 million Revolving Credit Facility RCF to meet short-term funding requirements.
At 31 December 2018, the Group had drawings of 50 million under the RCF 2017: 60 million, leaving 580 million available to draw down at year end.
The maximum draw down of the RCF during the year was 400 million 2017: 390 million.
Loans and loan notes due after one year The Group has issued the following Eurobonds: A seven year 600 million Eurobond at a fixed coupon of 2.125%, which matures in September 2022: and A seven year 500 million Eurobond at a fixed coupon of 2.0%, which will mature in December 2023.
The bond issued in December 2016 has been swapped back to sterling using a cross-currency interest rate swap.
The resulting fixed rate payable in sterling is c. 3.5% In June 2017, the Group repaid in full a 100 million bilateral loan facility.

Credit risk: the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations and Liquidity risk: the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due The Group is required to disclose the fair value of its debt instruments.
The fair value is the amount the Group would pay a third party to transfer the liability.
It is sourced in the capital markets.
This estimation of fair value is consistent with instruments valued under level 1 in note 4.5.
Accounting policies Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs, with subsequent measurement at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Under the amortised cost method, the difference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption value is recorded in the income statement over the period of the borrowing on an effective interest rate basis.
Managing credit and liquidity risk Credit risk The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of derivative financial assets see note 4.3, trade receivables see note 3.1.
3, and cash and cash equivalents see note 4.1.
Trade and other receivables The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The majority of trade receivables relate to airtime sales contracts with advertising agencies and advertisers.
Credit insurance has been taken out against these companies to minimise the impact on the Group in the event of a possible default.
The Group also reviews other significant receivables and will seek to take out credit insurance on an individual basis where appropriate.
In 2016, the Group signed a 100 million non-recourse receivables purchase agreement.
As at 31 December 2018, this was fully utilised with nil remaining available under the agreement 2017: 10 million.
The receivables in relation to the invoices sold were derecognised and the Group collects cash on behalf of the counterparty as payments fall due.
Cash The Group operates investment guidelines with respect to surplus cash that emphasise preservation of capital.
The guidelines set out procedures and limits on counterparty risk and maturity profile of cash placed.
Counterparty limits for cash deposits are largely based upon long-term ratings published by the major credit rating agencies.
Deposits longer than 12 months require the approval of the Board.

ITVs credit ratings, the cost of credit default swap hedging and the absolute level of interest rates are key determinants in the cost of new borrowings for ITV.
Liquidity risk The Groups financing policy is to fund itself for the medium to long-term by using debt instruments with a range of maturities and to ensure access to appropriate short-term borrowing facilities with a minimum of 250 million of undrawn facilities available at all times.
Long-term funding comes from the UK and European capital markets, while any short to medium-term debt requirements are provided through bank credit facilities totalling 930 million see below.
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups liquidity reserve comprising undrawn bank facilities and cash and cash equivalents on the basis of expected cash flows.
This monitoring includes financial ratios to assess any possible future impact on credit ratings and headroom and takes into account the accessibility of cash and cash equivalents.
The Group has a 630 million Revolving Credit Facility with a group of relationship banks.
This facility, which was extended in October 2018, matures in 2023 and is committed with leverage and interest cover financial covenants.

Keeping 4.3 A derivative is a type of financial instrument typically used to manage risk.
it simple Managing A derivatives value changes over time in response to underlying variables such market risks: as exchange rates or interest rates and is entered into for a fixed period.
A hedge derivative is where a derivative is used to manage exposure in an underlying variable.
financial The Group is exposed to certain market risks.
In accordance with Board-approved instruments policies, which are set out in this note, the Group manages these risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge the underlying exposures.
The key market risks facing the Group are: Currency risk arising from: i.
Translation risk, that is the risk in the period of adverse currency fluctuations in the translation of foreign currency profits, assets and liabilities balance sheet risk and non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities income statement risk and ii.
Transaction risk, that is the risk that currency fluctuations will have a negative effect on the value of the Groups non-functional currency trading cash flows.
A non-functional currency transaction is a transaction in any currency other than the reporting currency of the subsidiary Interest rate risk to the Group arises from significant changes in interest rates on borrowings issued at or swapped to floating rates How do we use them?
The Group mainly employs three types of derivative financial instruments when managing its currency and interest rate risk: Foreign exchange swap contracts are derivative instruments used to hedge income statement translation risk arising from short-term intercompany loans denominated in a foreign currency Forward foreign exchange contracts are derivative instruments used to hedge transaction risk so they enable the sale or purchase of foreign currency at a known fixed rate on an agreed future date and Cross-currency interest rate swaps are derivative instruments used to exchange the principal and interest coupons in a debt instrument from one currency to another Analysis of the derivatives used by the Group to hedge its exposure and the various methods used to calculate their respective fair values are detailed in this section.
Accounting policies Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently remeasured at fair value with the movement recorded in the income statement, except where derivatives qualify for cash flow hedge accounting.
In this case, the effective portion of a cash flow hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve within equity.
The cumulative gain or loss is later reclassified to the income statement in the same period as the relevant hedged transaction is realised.
Derivatives with positive fair values are recorded as assets and negative fair values as liabilities.

The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the reporting date, taking into account current interest rates and our current creditworthiness, as well as that of our swap counterparties.
Third-party valuations are used to fair value the Groups interest rate derivatives.
The valuation techniques use inputs such as interest rate yield curves and currency prices yields, volatilities of underlying instruments and correlations between inputs.
How do we manage our currency and interest rate risk?
Currency risk As the Group expands its international operations, the performance of the business becomes increasingly sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates, primarily with respect to the US dollar and the euro.
The Groups foreign exchange policy is to use forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge material non-functional currency denominated costs or revenue for up to five years forward.
The Group ensures that its net exposure to foreign currency denominated cash balances is kept to a minimal level by using foreign currency swaps to exchange balances back into sterling or by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates when necessary.
The Group also utilises foreign exchange swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps both to manage foreign currency cash flow timing differences and to hedge foreign currency denominated monetary items.
The Groups net investments in overseas subsidiaries may be hedged where the currency exposure is considered to be material.
The Group designated a portion of its euro borrowings into a net investment hedge against its euro denominated assets following the acquisition of Talpa Media.
The following table highlights the Groups sensitivity to translation risk resulting from a 10% strengthening weakening in sterling against the US dollar and euro, assuming all other variables are held constant: 2018 post- 2017 posttax profit 2018 equity tax profit 2017 equity US dollar nil million 25 million 1 million 23 million Euro 2 million 16 million 3 million 17 million The Groups sensitivity to translation risk for revenue and adjusted EBITA is disclosed in the Finance Review on page 51.
The key difference between the foreign currency sensitivity for adjusted EBITA and profit after tax is the impact on the US dollar and euro denominated exceptional costs, including acquisition-related costs, acquired intangible amortisation and net financing cost.
Interest rate risk The Groups interest rate policy is to allow fixed rate gross debt to vary between 20% and 100% of total gross debt to accommodate floating rate borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.
At 31 December 2018, the Groups fixed rate debt represented 99% of total gross debt 2017: 98%.
Consequently, a 1% movement in interest rates on floating rate debt would impact the 2018 post-tax profit for the year by less than 1 million 2017: 1 million.
For financial assets and liabilities classified at fair value through profit or loss, the movements in the year relating to changes in fair value and interest are not separated.

In order to fix the sterling cash outflows associated with the commitments and interest payments which are mainly denominated in AUD or euros the Group has taken out forward foreign exchange contracts and cross-currency interest rate swaps for the same foreign currency amount and maturity date as the expected foreign currency outflow.
The amount recognised in other comprehensive income during the period all relates to the effective portion of the revaluation loss associated with these contracts.
There was less than 1 million 2017: 1 million ineffectiveness taken to the income statement and 6 million cumulative gain 2017: 20 million gain recycled to the income statement in the year.
In 2016, on issuing the 2023 Eurobond, the Group entered into a portfolio of cross-currency interest rate swaps, which swapped the euro principal and fixed euro interest rate coupons into fixed sterling interest rate.
As a result, the Group makes sterling interest payments at a fixed rate.
Under IFRS 9, the Group has adopted the cost of hedging approach which allows the recognition of the value of the currency basis at inception of the hedge to be recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and amortised through net financing costs in the Consolidated Income Statement over the life of the bond.
Any mark-tomarket change in fair value of the currency basis is recognised in cost of hedging in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Net investment hedges The Group uses euro denominated debt to partially hedge against the change in the sterling value of its euro denominated net assets due to movements in foreign exchange rates.
The fair value of debt in a net investment hedge was 176 million 2017: 177 million.
A foreign exchange loss of 2 million 2017: 6 million relating to the net investment hedges has been netted off within exchange differences on translation of foreign operations as presented on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

costs In reporting adjusted profit, the Group adjusts net financing costs to exclude unrealised mark-to-market movements on interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives, gains losses on bond buybacks, net pension interest, interest and fair value movements in acquisition-related liabilities and other financing costs.
Our rationale for adjustments made to financing costs is set out in the Finance Review.
Accounting policies Net financing costs comprise interest income on funds invested, gains losses on the disposal of financial instruments, changes in the fair value of financial instruments, interest expense on borrowings and finance leases, unwinding of the discount on provisions, unwinding of the discount on liabilities to non-controlling interest, foreign exchange gain losses, and imputed interest on pension assets and liabilities.
Interest income and expense is recognised as it accrues in profit or loss, using the effective interest method.
Net financing costs Net financing costs can be analysed as follows: 2018 2017 m m Financing income Interest income 3 4 Financing costs Interest expense on financial liabilities measured at amortised cost 30 30 Net pension interest see note 3.7 2 9 Change in fair value of instruments classified at fair value through profit or loss Foreign exchange loss 2 3 Other finance expense 12 12 46 54 Net financing costs 43 50 Interest on financial liabilities relates to the interest incurred on the Groups borrowings in the year.
Other finance expense includes the amortisation of facility commitment and upfront fees as well as movements in the estimated value of acquisition-related contingent liabilities.
This is where estimates of the future performance against stretch targets is reassessed, resulting in adjustments to the related put option liabilities.

The measurement of this fair it simple Fair value value can in some cases be subjective, and can depend on the inputs used in the hierarchy calculations.
ITV generally uses external valuations using market inputs or market values e. g. external share prices.
The different valuation methods are called hierarchies and are described below.
Level 1 Fair values are measured using quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 Fair values are measured using inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, which are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly.
Interest rate swaps and options are accounted for at their fair value based upon termination prices.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are accounted for at the difference between the contract exchange rate and the quoted forward exchange rate at the reporting date.

The share-based compensation is not pensionable.
A transaction will be classed as share-based compensation where the Group receives services from employees and pays for these in shares or similar equity instruments.
If the Group incurs a liability linked to the price or value of the Groups shares, this will also fall under a share-based transaction.
A description of each type of share-based payment arrangement that existed at any time during the period is set out in the Annual Remuneration Report.
Accounting policies For each of the Groups share-based compensation schemes, the fair value of the equity instrument granted is measured at grant date and spread over the vesting period via a charge to the income statement with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value of the share options and awards is measured using either market price at grant date or, for the SAYE scheme, a BlackScholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions of the individual scheme.
Vesting conditions are limited to service conditions and performance conditions.
For performance-based schemes, the relevant Group performance measures are projected to the end of the performance period in order to determine the number of options expected to vest.
The estimate is then used to determine the option fair value, discounted to present value.
The Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest, including an estimate of forfeitures at each reporting date.
The impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Exercises of share options granted to employees can be satisfied by market purchase or issue of new shares.
No new shares may be issued to satisfy exercises under the terms of the DSA.

assets and liabilities Contingent assets In 2017 Talpa Media took back the licence for The Voice of China due a breach of the agreement by the customer, Talent, for not fulfilling their payment obligations.
The Group is pursuing Talent vigorously for the 26 million still due under the agreement, which was recognised as an exceptional cost in 2017.
Further, the Group has credit insurance in place and a claim is in progress.
Whilst the Directors are confident of recovering the remaining amounts due, accounting standards set very specific requirements for the recognition of contingent assets, which is how the recovery of the amount due has been accounted for.
As discussions with the insurers and the claim against Talent are still in progress, the Group is not able to demonstrate sufficient certainty to be able to recognise a cash receivable at the year end.
Contingent liabilities In late 2016, the Group initiated legal proceedings against the minority owners of Gurney Productions LLC for alleged breaches of contracts and their fiduciary duties, as well as self-dealing and fraudulent concealment.
The minority owners dispute the allegations and they have counter-claimed for damages of at least $150 million.
The action is ongoing and, having taken legal advice, the Directors believe this counter-claim is completely without merit.
There are contingent liabilities in respect of certain litigation and guarantees, broadcasting issues, and in respect of warranties given in connection with certain disposals of businesses.
None of these items are expected to have a material effect on the Groups results or financial position.
