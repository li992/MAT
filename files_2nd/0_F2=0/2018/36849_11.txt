Critical accounting estimates and judgements The results of HSBC reflect the choice of accounting policies, assumptions and estimates that underlie the preparation of HSBCs consolidated financial statements.
The significant accounting policies, including the policies which include criticalaccounting estimates and judgements, are described inNote1.2 on the Financial Statements.
The accounting policies listed below are highlighted as they involve a high degree of uncertainty and have a material impact on the financial statements: Impairment of amortised cost financial assets and financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI : The most significant judgements relate to defining what is considered to be a significant increase in credit risk, determining the lifetime and point of initial recognition of revolving facilities, and in making assumptions and estimates to incorporate relevant information about past events, current conditions and forecasts of economic conditions.
A high degree of uncertainty is involved in making estimations using assumptions that are highly subjective and very sensitive to the risk factors.
Hedge accounting and the replacement of major interest rate reference rates: The financial markets are going through a significant reform and replacement of the major interest rate reference rates.
These interbank offered rates Ibors, such as Libor and Euribor, are currently widely used as benchmarks for a large volume and broad range of financial products and contracts.
This results in significant accounting judgement being involved in determining whether certain hedge accounting relationships that hedge variability of cash flows and interest rate risk due to changes in Ibors continue to qualify for hedge accounting as at 31 December 2018.
Deferred tax assets: The most significant judgements relate to those made in respect of expected future profitability.
Valuation of financial instruments: In determining the fair value of financial instruments a variety of valuation techniques are used, some of which feature significant unobservable inputs and are subject to substantial uncertainty.
Impairment of interests in associates: Impairment testing involves significant judgement in determining the value in use, and in particular estimating the present values of cash flows expected to arise from continuing to hold the investment, HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 35 Shareholder Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Financial Review Strategic Report Report of the Directors | Financial summary Consolidated income statement Summary consolidated income statement 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 Footnotes $m $m $m $m $m Net interest income 30,489 28,176 29,813 32,531 34,705 Net fee income 12,620 12,811 12,777 14,705 15,957 44, 45 Net income from financial instruments held for trading or managed on a fair value basis 9,531 8,426 7,521 8,717 6,730 Net income expense from assets and liabilities of insurance businesses, including 1,488 2,836 1,262 565 1,865 related derivatives, measured at fair value through profit or loss 45 44 Change in fair value of long-term debt and related derivatives 97 155 1,997 973 638 Changes in fair value of other financial instruments mandatorily measured at fair value 695 N A N A N A N A through profit or loss 45 Gains less losses from financial investments 218 1,150 1,385 2,068 1,335 Dividend income 75 106 95 123 311 Net insurance premium income 10,659 9,779 9,951 10,355 11,921 Other operating income expense 885 337 971 1,055 1,131 Total operating income 63,587 63,776 59,836 71,092 74,593 Net insurance claims and benefits paid and movement in liabilities to policyholders 9,807 12,331 11,870 11,292 13,345 Net operating income before change in expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges Loan impairment charges and other credit risk provisions 53,780 51,445 47,966 59,800 61,248 26 Change in expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges 1,767 N A N A N A N A Loan impairment charges and other credit risk provisions N A 1,769 3,400 3,721 3,851 Net operating income 52,013 49,676 44,566 56,079 57,397 Total operating expenses 34,659 34,884 39,808 39,768 41,249 Operating profit 17,354 14,792 4,758 16,311 16,148 Share of profit in associates and joint ventures 2,536 2,375 2,354 2,556 2,532 Profit before tax 19,890 17,167 7,112 18,867 18,680 Tax expense 4,865 5,288 3,666 3,771 3,975 Profit for the year 15,025 11,879 3,446 15,096 14,705 Attributable to: ordinary shareholders of the parent company 12,608 9,683 1,299 12,572 13,115 preference shareholders of the parent company 90 90 90 90 90 other equity holders 1,029 1,025 1,090 860 483 non-controlling interests 1,298 1,081 967 1,574 1,017 Profit for the year 15,025 11,879 3,446 15,096 14,705 Five-year financial information 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 Footnotes $ $ $ $ $ Basic earnings per share 0.63 0.48 0.07 0.65 0.69 Diluted earnings per share 0.63 0.48 0.07 0.64 0.69 46 Dividends per ordinary share 0.51 0.51 0.51 0.50 0.49 % % % % % 47 Dividend payout ratio 81.0 106.3 728.6 76.5 71.0 Post-tax return on average total assets 0.6 0.5 0.1 0.6 0.5 48 Return on average risk-weighted assets 2.3 2.0 0.7 1.6 1.5 Return on average ordinary shareholders equity 7.7 5.9 0.8 7.2 7.3 Return on average tangible equity 8.6 6.8 2.6 8.1 8.5 For footnotes, see page 67.
