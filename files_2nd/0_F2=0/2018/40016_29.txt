The separate accounts of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006.
On 1 January 2015, the Company transitioned from previously extant UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practices to Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework Reduced Disclosure Framework.
These financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with the Reduced Disclosure Framework for all periods presented.
There were no transitional adjustments required on adoption of the new standard.
The financial information for the Company has been prepared on the same basis as the consolidated financial statements, applying identical accounting policies as outlined throughout the Notes to the Group accounts.
The Directors have determined that the preparation of the Company financial statements on a going concern basis is appropriate as the Company receives dividend cash receipts from its subsidiary undertakings which enable it to meet its liabilities as they fall due.
In applying these policies, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the accounts and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
In these financial statements, the Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures: A Cash Flow Statement and related notes: Comparative period reconciliations for share capital and tangible fixed assets: Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly-owned subsidiaries: Disclosures in respect of capital management: The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs: and Disclosures in respect of the compensation of key management personnel.
As the consolidated financial statements include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken the exemptions under FRS 101 available inrespect of the following disclosures: IFRS 2 Share Based Payments in respect of group settled share based payments: and Certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement and the disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instrument Disclosures.
The Company proposes to continue to adopt the reduced disclosure framework of FRS 101 in its next financial statements.
