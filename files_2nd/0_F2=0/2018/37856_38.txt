Annual Report & Accounts 2018 134 NoTES To ThE CoNSoLIdATEd FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CoNTINuEd a Impairment Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment based on each cash generating unit CGU.
The CGUs are individual hotels.
The carrying value of individual hotels was compared to the recoverable amount of the hotels, which was derived with the reference to fair value through creation of discount cash flow models.
Under this methodology, the fair value measurement reflects current market expectations about the third party efficient operators is future cash flows, discounted to their present value.
The underlying basis for the impairment model involves each hotels projected cash flow for the financial year ending 31 December 2019, extrapolated to incorporate individual assumptions in respect of revenue growth principally factoring in room rate and occupancy growth and major expense lines.
The future cash flows are based on assumptions about competitive growth rates for hotels in that area, as well as internal business plans.
These plans and forecasts include managements most recent view of trading prospects for the hotel in the relevant market.
Where appropriate, the Directors sought guidance on value from a registered independent appraiser with an appropriately recognised professional qualification and recent experience in the location and category of the hotel being valued.
On the basis of external valuations in 2018, the Group recorded an impairment charge of 59m consisting of 31m in New York, 6m in Rest of Asia, 19m for Regional US and 3m in Rest of Europe.
For 2017, a total impairment charge of 34m was recognised in relation to 11m in New York, 4m in Rest of Europe, 13m in Rest of Asia and 6m for Regional US.
Further information is given in Note 12.
Circumstances and events that led to impairment are largely due to the performance of the hotels.
The fair values assumed through the impairment assessment are considered to fall within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
Refer to Note 22d for more detail.
b Key assumptions used by the external appraisers The key assumptions used were as follows: Pre-tax discount rate The discount rate is based on the country in which the hotel is located and is adjusted for risks associated with the hotel.
Discount rates ranged from 6.5% to 13% in the US, 10% in Europe and 8% to 9% in Asia.
Occupancy rate The occupancy growth rates ranged up to 9.5% in the US, up to 4.3% in Europe and up to 9.0% in Asia.
Average room rate The average room rate growth ranged from 3% to 4% in the US, 4% in Europe and 2% to 2.5% in Asia.
Terminal rate These rates ranged from 5% to 11% in the US, 6.5% in Europe and 6% to 7% in Asia.
The forecasts cover a five to ten year period, and cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using a growth rate ranging between 1.5% and 2.5%, which is based upon the expected trading growth for each hotel and inflation in the country.
c Sensitivities The Groups impairment review is sensitive to changes in key assumptions used, most notably the discount and terminal rates.
Based on the Groups sensitivity analysis performed on properties in New York which represents 53% of the total impairment recognised, assuming that all other variables were to remain constant, the increase decrease in the Groups total impairment recognised would be as follows: M Terminal rate decreased by 0.25% 8 Terminal rate increased by 0.25% 8 Discount rate decreased by 0.25% 5 Discount rate increased by 0.25% 5 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc
