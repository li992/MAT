It excludes the operating investment return on shareholder net assets, which has been separately disclosed as expected return on shareholder assets.
Fee income represents profits driven by net investment performance, being asset management fees that vary with the size of the underlying policyholder funds net of investment management expenses.
With-profits represent the pre-tax shareholders transfer from the with-profits funds for the year.
Insurance margin primarily represents profits derived from the insurance risks of mortality and morbidity.
Margin on revenues primarily represents amounts deducted from premiums to cover acquisition costs and administration expenses.
Acquisition costs and administration expenses represent expenses incurred in the year attributable to shareholders.
These exclude items such as restructuring costs which are not included in the segment profit for insurance, as well as items that are more appropriately included in other sources of earnings lines eg investment expenses are netted against investment income as part of spread income or fee income as appropriate.
DAC adjustments comprise DAC amortisation for the year, excluding amounts related to short-term fluctuations in investment returns, net of costs deferred in respect of new business.
Analysis of adjusted IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns by source and margin analysis of Group long-term insurance business The following analysis expresses certain of the Groups sources of adjusted IFRS operating profit based on long-term investment returns as a margin of policyholder liabilities or other relevant drivers.

Acquisition costs include only those relating to shareholder-backed business.
ii Margin represents the operating return earned in the year as a proportion of the relevant class of average policyholder liabilities excluding unallocated surplus.
iii The 2017 comparative information has been presented at AER and CER to eliminate the impact of foreign exchange translation.
CER results are calculated by translating prior year results using the current year foreign exchange rates.
All CER profit figures have been translated at current year average rates.
For Asia CER average policyholder liability calculations, the amounts have been translated using current year opening and closing exchange rates.
For the US CER average liability calculations, the amounts have been translated at the current year month-end closing exchange rates.
See note A1 in the IFRS financial statements for foreign exchange rates used.
iv For UK and Europe and Asia, opening and closing policyholder liabilities have been used to derive an average balance for the year, as a proxy for average balances throughout the year.
The calculation of average liabilities for Jackson is generally derived from month-end balances throughout the year, as opposed to opening and closing balances only.
The average liabilities for fee income in Jackson have been calculated using daily balances instead of month-end balances in order to provide a more meaningful analysis of the fee income, which is charged on the daily account balance.
Average liabilities for spread income are based on the general account liabilities to which spread income attaches.
Average liabilities used to calculate the administration expense margin exclude the REALIC liabilities reinsured to third parties prior to the acquisition by Jackson.
v The DAC adjustments contain a credit of 55 million in respect of joint ventures and associate in 2018 2017: AER credit of 43 million.
vi Under IFRS, the Groups share of results from its investments in joint ventures and associate accounted for using the equity method is included in the Groups profit before tax on a net of related tax basis.
In 2018, the Group altered the presentation of its analysis of Asia adjusted IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns by driver to show these tax charges separately in order for the contribution from the joint ventures and associate to be included in the margin analysis on a consistent basis as the rest of the Asia operations.

Fee income has increased by 8 per cent on a CER basis AER: 2 per cent to 210 million in 2018, broadly in line with the increase in movement in average unit-linked policyholder liabilities.
Insurance margin has increased by 15 per cent on a CER basis AER: 10 per cent to 1,481 million in 2018, primarily reflecting the continued growth of the in-force book, which contains a relatively high proportion of risk-based products.
Margin on revenues has increased by 4 per cent on a CER basis AER: less than 1 per cent to 2,105 million in 2018, primarily reflecting higher premiums together with the effect of changes in product mix and higher premium allocation to policyholders.
Acquisition costs have increased by 4 per cent on a CER basis AER: less than 1 per cent to 1,503 million in 2018, compared to a 2 per cent increase in APE sales on a CER basis, resulting in an increase in the acquisition costs ratio.
The analysis in the table above uses shareholder acquisition costs as a proportion of total APE sales.
If with-profits sales were excluded from the denominator, the acquisition cost ratio would become 69 per cent 2017: 67 per cent on a CER basis, the increase being the result of product and country mix.
Administration expenses including renewal commissions have increased by 10 per cent on a CER basis AER: 6 per cent to 1,029 million in 2018 as the business continues to expand.
On a CER basis, the administration expense ratio has decreased from 267 basis points in 2017 to 264 basis points in 2018 as a result of changes in country and product mix.

The reported spread margin decreased to 155 basis points from 193 basis points in 2017, primarily due to the impact of increasing LIBOR on interest rate swaps, lower investment yields and maturing of swaps previously entered into to more closely match the asset and liability duration.
Excluding the effect of these historic swap transactions, the spread margin would have been 130 basis points 2017: 144 basis points at CER and AER.
Fee income has increased by 8 per cent on a CER basis AER: 4 per cent to 2,445 million during 2018, primarily due to higher average separate account balances resulting from positive net flows from variable annuity business and market appreciation during most of 2018 before a decline in the fourth quarter of 2018.
Fee income margin has decreased to 183 basis points 2017:187 basis points at CER and AER primarily reflecting a change in business mix.
Insurance margin represents profits from insurance risks, including variable annuity guarantees and other sundry items.
Insurance margin increased by 8 per cent on a CER basis AER: 5 per cent to 949 million in 2018 mainly due to higher income from variable annuity guarantees and favourable mortality experience.
Acquisition costs, which are commissions and expenses incurred to acquire new business, including those that are not deferrable, have decreased by 10 per cent on a CER basis AER: 13 per cent.
This reflects a 4 per cent decrease in APE sales and lower level of front-ended commissions.
Administration expenses increased by 6 per cent on a CER basis AER: 3 per cent to 1,204 million during 2018, primarily as a result of higher asset-based commissions.
Excluding these asset-based commissions, the resulting administration expense ratio would be lower at 34 basis points 2017: 35 basis points at CER and AER.
DAC adjustments in 2018 was negative 114 million compared to 251 million credit in 2017 on a CER basis due to an increase in the DAC amortisation charge.
The higher DAC amortisation charge arises largely from an acceleration of amortisation of 194 million 2017: credit for deceleration of 83 million on a CER basis primarily relating to the market returns in 2018 and the reversal of the benefit received in 2015 under the mean reversion formula.

Fee business represents profits from variable annuity products.
As well as fee income, revenue for this product line includes spread income from investments directed to the general account and other variable annuity fees included in insurance margin.
Life and other business includes the profits from the REALIC business and other closed life books.
Revenue allocated to this product line includes spread income and premiums and policy charges for life protection, which are included in insurance margin after claim costs.

Fee income principally represents asset management fees from unit-linked business including direct investment only business to Group pension schemes where liability flows are driven by a small number of large single mandate transactions and mostly arises within the UK and Europe asset management business.
Fee income is after costs relating to managing the underlying funds which include recent rationalisation activity to remove sub-scale funds.
If these costs and the direct investment only schemes are excluded, the fee margin on the remaining balances would be 36 basis points 2017: 40 basis points.
Margin on revenues represents premium charges for expenses of shareholder-backed business and other sundry net income.
The 441 million favourable effect of longevity assumption relates to changes to annuitant mortality assumptions to reflect current mortality experience and the adoption of the Continuous Mortality Investigation CMI 2016 model.
Further information on changes to mortality assumptions is given in note C4.1 d in the IFRS financial statements.
An allowance provision of 55 million has been made in 2018 to reflect the costs of equalising guaranteed minimum pension benefits on pension products sold by the insurance business following the ruling by the High Court in October 2018.

These actions included repositioning the fixed income asset portfolio to improve the trade-off between yield and credit risk.
No new longevity reinsurance transactions were undertaken in 2018 2017: longevity reinsurance transactions entered into covering 0.5 billion of IFRS annuity liabilities.
The effect of these actions on the UKs long-term IFRS operating profit, underlying free surplus generation and EEV operating profit, before restructuring costs, is shown in the tables below.

II c Solvency II capital position The estimated Group shareholder Solvency II surplus at 31 December 2018 was 17.2 billion, before allowing for payment of the 2018 second interim ordinary dividend and reflecting approved regulatory transitional measures as at 31 December 2018.

The estimated solvency positions include managements calculation of UK transitional measures reflecting operating and market conditions at each valuation date, which for both 2018 and 2017 reflects the approved regulatory position.
In accordance with Solvency II requirements, these results allow for: Capital in Jackson in excess of 250 per cent of the US local Risk Based Capital requirement.
As agreed with the Prudential Regulation Authority, this is incorporated in the result above as follows: Own funds: represents Jacksons local US Risk Based available capital less 100 per cent of the US Risk Based Capital requirement Company Action Level : Solvency Capital Requirement: represents 150 per cent of Jacksons local US Risk Based Capital requirement Company Action Level : and No diversification benefits are taken into account between Jackson and the rest of the Group.
Matching adjustment for UK annuities and volatility adjustment for US dollar denominated Hong Kong with-profits business, based on approvals from the Prudential Regulation Authority and calibrations published by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority: and UK transitional measures, which have been recalculated using managements estimate of the impact of operating and market conditions at the valuation date.
An application to recalculate the transitional measures as at 31 December 2018 has been approved by the Prudential Regulation Authority and this recalculation will therefore be reflected in the formal regulatory Quantitative Reporting Templates as at 31 December 2018.
The Group shareholder Solvency II capital position excludes: A portion of Solvency II surplus capital 1.7 billion at 31 December 2018 relating to the Groups Asian life operations, primarily due to the Solvency II definition of contract boundaries which prevents some expected future cash flows from being recognised: The contribution to Own Funds and the Solvency Capital Requirement from ring-fenced with-profits funds in surplus representing 5.5 billion of surplus capital from UK with-profits funds at 31 December 2018 and from the shareholders share of the estate of with-profits funds: and The contribution to Own Funds and the Solvency Capital Requirement from pension funds in surplus.

At Jacksons request, the Department of Insurance Financial Services renewed its approval to carry these instruments at book value in the local statutory returns for the period 31 December 2018 to 1 October 2019.
At 31 December 2018, applying this approval had the effect of decreasing local available statutory capital and surplus and by extension Solvency II Own Funds and Solvency II surplus by 0.1 billion, net of tax.
This arrangement reflects an elective long-standing practice first put in place in 2009, which can be unwound at Jacksons discretion.
The 31 December 2018 Solvency II results above allow for the reinsurance of 12.0 billion of the UK annuity portfolio to Rothesay Life effective from 14 March 2018 and the transfer of Prudential plcs Hong Kong subsidiaries to Prudential Corporation Asia Limited.
In total these items have resulted in a decrease to UK Solvency II surplus in 2018 of 3.3 billion with Group Solvency II surplus increasing by 0.4 billion.
Analysis of movement in Group capital position A summary of the estimated movement in Group Solvency II surplus from 13.3 billion at year end 2017 to 17.2 billion at year end 2018 is set out in the table below.
The movement from the Group Solvency II surplus at 31 December 2016 to the Solvency II surplus at 31 December 2017 is included for comparison.

This includes a 0.4 billion benefit from the impact of updates to UK longevity best estimate assumptions and a 0.1 billion benefit from an insurance recovery relating to the costs and any related redress of reviewing internally vesting annuities sold without advice after 1 July 2008: Non-operating experience of 1.2 billion: resulting mainly from the negative impact of market movements, after allowing for the recalculation of the UK transitional measures at the valuation date, the impact of US Risk Based Capital updates announced in June 2018 to reflect US tax reform changes and the 0.3 billion impact from the acquisition of TMB Asset Management Co.

This item also reflects a fide-recognition of Own Funds of 1.0 billion, equivalent to the value of 100 per cent of Risk Based Capital requirements Company Action Level, as agreed with the Prudential Regulation Authority: 4.6 billion due to the removal of DAC, goodwill and intangibles from the IFRS balance sheet: 7.2 billion due to the addition of subordinated debt which is treated as available capital under Solvency II but as a liability under IFRS: 3.8 billion due to the inclusion of a risk margin for UK and Asia non-hedgeable risks, net of 1.6 billion from transitional measures after allowing for recalculation of the transitional measures as at 31 December 2018 which are not applicable under IFRS: 5.3 billion due to the inclusion of the value of future shareholder transfers from with-profits business excluding the shareholders share of the with-profits estate, for which no credit is given under Solvency II, which is excluded from the determination of the Groups IFRS shareholders funds: 13.3 billion mainly due to differences in insurance valuation requirements between Solvency II and IFRS, with Solvency II Own Funds partially capturing the value of in-force business which is excluded from IFRS: 1.5 billion due to the impact on the valuation of net deferred tax liabilities resulting from the liability valuation differences noted above: and 0.4 billion due to other items, including the impact of revaluing loans, borrowings and debt from IFRS to Solvency II.

The sensitivity analysis above allows for predetermined management actions and those taken to date, but does not reflect all possible management actions which could be taken in the future.
1,2 UK Solvency II capital position On the same basis as above, the estimated shareholder Solvency II surplus for The Prudential Assurance Company Limited PAC and 2 its subsidiaries at 31 December 2018 was 3.7 billion, after allowing for recalculation of transitional measures as at 31 December 2018.
This relates to shareholder-backed business including future with-profits shareholder transfers, but excludes the shareholders share of the estate in line with Solvency II requirements.

The Prudential Assurance Company Limited shareholder Solvency II position at 31 December 2018 includes the actual impact of the transfer of Prudential plcs Hong Kong subsidiaries to Prudential Corporation Asia Limited, and the impact of the reinsurance of 12.0 billion of the UK annuity portfolio to Rothesay Life.
In total these items have resulted in a decrease to UK Solvency II surplus in 2018 of 3.3 billion.
Upon completion of the Part VII transfer a further circa 0.1 billion of Solvency Capital Requirement is expected to be released.
Whilst there is a large surplus in the UK with-profits funds, this is ring-fenced from the shareholder balance sheet and is therefore excluded from both the Group and the UK shareholder Solvency II surplus results.

In combining these solvency positions, the contribution to own funds from these ring fenced funds will be set equal to their aggregate solvency capital requirements, estimated at 5.6 billion ie the solvency surplus in these ring fenced funds will not be captured in the templates.
There will be no impact on the reported Group Solvency II surplus.
Statement of independent review in respect of Solvency II Capital Position at 31 December 2018 The methodology, assumptions and overall result have been subject to examination by KPMG LLP.

II d Reconciliation of expected transfer of value of in-force business VIF and required capital to free surplus The tables below show how the value of in-force business VIF generated by the in-force long-term business and the associated required capital is modelled as emerging into free surplus over the next 40 years.
Although a small amount circa 5 per cent of the Groups embedded value emerges after this date, analysis of cash flows emerging in the years shown in the tables is considered most meaningful.
The modelled cash flows use the same methodology underpinning the Groups embedded value reporting and so are subject to the same assumptions and sensitivities used to prepare our 2018 results.
In addition to showing the amounts, both discounted and undiscounted, expected to be generated from all in-force business at 31 December 2018, the tables also present the expected future free surplus to be generated from the investment made in new business during 2018 over the same 40-year period for long-term business operations.

At 31 December 2018, the total free surplus expected to be generated over the next five years 2019 to 2023 inclusive, using the same assumptions and methodology as those underpinning our 2018 embedded value reporting was 18.6 billion, an increase of 1.4 billion from the 17.2 billion expected over an equivalent period from the end of 2017.
This increase primarily reflects the new business written in 2018, which is expected to generate 1,954 million of free surplus over the next five years.
At 31 December 2018, the total free surplus expected to be generated on an undiscounted basis in the next 40 years is 79.3 billion, up from the 70.1 billion expected at the end of 2017, reflecting the effect of new business written across all three business operations of 9.8 billion, a positive foreign exchange translation effect of 2.6 billion and a 0.4 billion net effect reflecting operating, market assumption changes and other items.
The 2.3 billion impact in Asia of operating, non-operating and other movements includes the net benefit from changes in operating assumptions following the annual review of experience, together with the benefit of management actions and generally higher interest rates increasing projected returns.
The 0.4 billion impact in the US mainly reflects the effect of lower than expected separate account return in the year, partially offset by the positive effect from persistency assumption updates and higher interest rates increasing future separate account return.
The 2.3 billion impact in the UK and Europe reflects the effect of lower than assumed investment returns on with-profits funds and the reinsurance of part of its shareholder annuity portfolio to Rothesay Life as discussed in note 17.
The overall growth in the Groups undiscounted value of free surplus reflects our ability to write both growing and profitable new business.
Actual underlying free surplus generated in 2018 from life business in force, before restructuring costs, at the end of 2018 was 4.4 billion including 0.8 billion of changes in operating assumptions and experience variances.
This compares with the expected 2018 realisation at the end of 2017 of 3.5 billion.
In the UK and Europe, the difference between the transfer to free surplus recognised in 2018 and the free surplus expected to be generated at 31 December 2017 reflects the reinsurance of the shareholder annuity portfolio to Rothesay Life as discussed in note 17 which was not known at 2017.

Gross premiums earned include 100 per cent of such premiums.
ii Other adjustments principally include amounts in respect of the following: Gross premiums earned include premiums from existing in-force business as well as new business.
The most significant amount is recorded in Asia, where a significant portion of regular premium business is written.
Asia in-force premiums form the vast majority of the other adjustment amount: In October 2018, Jackson entered into a 100 per cent reinsurance agreement with John Hancock Life Insurance Company to acquire a closed block of group pay-out annuity business.
The transaction resulted in an addition to gross premiums earned of 3.7 billion.
No amounts were included in APE new business sales.
APE includes new policies written in the year which are classified as investment contracts without discretionary participation features under IFRS 4, arising mainly in Jackson for guaranteed investment contracts and in M&GPrudential for certain unit-linked savings and similar contracts.
These are excluded from gross premiums earned and recorded as deposits: APE new business sales are annualised while gross premiums earned are recorded only when revenues are due: and For the purpose of reporting APE new business sales, we include the Groups share of amounts sold by the Groups insurance joint ventures and associates.
Under IFRS, joint ventures and associates are equity accounted and so no amounts are included within gross premiums earned.
iii Outward reinsurance premiums in 2018 include 12,149 million in respect of the reinsurance of the UK annuity portfolio.

The value of in-force business reflects the present value of future shareholder cash flows from long-term in-force business which are not captured as shareholders interest on an IFRS basis.
Net worth represents the net assets for EEV reporting purposes that reflect the regulatory basis position, sometimes with adjustments to achieve consistency with the IFRS treatment of certain items.
ii Other adjustments represent asset and liability valuation differences between IFRS and the local regulatory reporting basis used to value net worth for long-term insurance operations.
For the UK, this would be the difference between IFRS and Solvency II.
It also includes the mark to market of the Groups core structural borrowings which are fair valued under EEV but not IFRS.
The most significant valuation differences relate to changes in the valuation of insurance liabilities.
For example, in Jackson where IFRS liabilities are higher than the local regulatory basis as they are principally based on policyholder account balances with a deferred acquisition costs recognised as an asset whereas the local regulatory basis used for EEV is based on future cash flows due to the policyholder on a prudent basis with consideration of an expense allowance as applicable, but with no separate deferred acquisition cost asset.
III i Reconciliation of EEV operating profit based on longer-term investment returns To the extent applicable, the presentation of the EEV post-tax profit for the year is consistent in the classification between operating and non-operating results with the basis that the Group applies for the analysis of IFRS basis results.
Operating results reflect underlying results including longer-term investment returns, which are determined following the EEV Principles issued by the European Insurance CFO Forum.
Non-operating results comprise: Short-term fluctuations in investment returns: The mark to market value movements on core structural borrowings: The effect of changes in economic assumptions: and The impact of corporate transactions undertaken in the year.
More details on how EEV post-tax profit is determined and the components of EEV operating profit are included in note 13 of the EEV supplementary basis of results.
III j Calculation of return on embedded value Return on embedded value is calculated as the EEV post-tax operating profit based on longer-term investment returns, as a percentage of opening EEV basis shareholders funds.
