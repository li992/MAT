I spent years living and working in Tokyo, Japan, and that experience had a profound impact on my Never Settle means we must always strive to do professional career.
I have always admired the better: we can never settle for second best.
Japanese work ethic and dedication to their craft.
Afriend once said, for the Japanese, perfection does exist.
I took that to heart and always put my all into everything I do to strive to achieve the Japanese standard of perfection.
