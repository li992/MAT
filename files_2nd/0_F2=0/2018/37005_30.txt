116 ICG ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2018 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS FOR THE YE AR ENDED 31 MARCH 2018 1.
GENERAL INFORMATION AND BASIS OF PREPARATION General Information Intermediate Capital Group plc is incorporated in England and Wales with Company registration number 02234775.
The registered office is Juxon House, 100 St Pauls Churchyard, London EC4M 8BU.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are detailed in the Strategic Report.
Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted for use in the EU and in compliance with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for financial instruments that are measured at fair value at the end of the reporting period, as detailed in note 4.
In the application of the Groups accounting policies, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Details of the critical judgements made and key sources of estimation uncertainty are included in the note to which they relate.
The accounting policies as set out in the notes to the accounts have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
Basis of consolidation The Groups financial statements consolidate the results of Intermediate Capital Group plc and entities controlled by the Company for the period to 31 March each year.
Control is achieved when the Company controls an investee when it has power over the relevant activities, exposure to variable returns from the investee, and the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
The assessment of control is based on all relevant facts and circumstances and the Company reassesses its conclusion if there is an indication that there are changes in facts and circumstances.
Subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Each component of other comprehensive income and profit or loss is attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non controlling interests.
Adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries for consistency with the accounting policies of the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, unrealised income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Income recognition Management fees are charged on third party money managed by ICG on either a committed or invested basis dependent on the fund.
Fund management fees and commissions are recognised in the income statement when the related service has been performed.
The Group receives carried interest from the third party funds it manages once those funds exceed a performance target.
Performance fees are recognised only when there is a reasonable expectation that performance conditions will be met and the amounts will be paid in cash.
The accounting policies for the recognition of finance and divided income and net gains on investments are set out in notes 6 and 7 to the accounts.
Foreign currencies As the Group and Company operate primarily in the United Kingdom, the functional and presentational currency of both the Group and Company is Sterling.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transactions.
At each reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the reporting date.
Non monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are translated at the rate prevailing at the date the fair value was determined.
Non monetary items that are measured at historical cost are translated using rates prevailing at the date of the transaction.
The assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated using the exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date.
Income and expense items are translated using the average exchange rates during the year.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of foreign operations are taken directly to the translation reserve.
ICG ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2018 117 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Going concern The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Therefore, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of preparing the financial statements, as detailed in the Directors, report on page 95.
Changes in presentation For the year ended 31 March 2018, ICG Group changed its presentation of certain notes to the financial statements, and the classification of balances within them.
The purpose of this change to the financial statements was to provide more reliable and relevant information to the reader.
This change has been applied retrospectively and has had no impact on results.
The key changes relate to the notes to the financial statements, where the accounting policies and disclosures of critical judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty have been included within each relevant note.
On the face of the Consolidated and Parent Statement of Financial Position, the presentation of non-current financial assets have been enhanced.
This enhanced presentation has been applied to note 4 and 7 to the financial statements, where we have provided more relevant information of how our portfolio is classified and measured in accordance with IFRS.
Critical judgements in the application of accounting policies Critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations that the directors have made in the application of the accounting policy are disclosed within notes 4 and 28.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty The key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting period, that may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed in note 4.
ADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED STANDARDS At the date of signing of these financial statements, certain new standards and interpretations have been issued but are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group.
The Directors are in the process of assessing the impact of the forthcoming standards on the operations of the Group.
International Financial Reporting Standards IAS IFRS Accounting periods commencing on or after IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement 1 January 2018 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2018 IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019 IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration 1 January 2018 Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-based 1 January 2018 Payment Transactions Amendments to IFRS 4 Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 1 January 2018 Insurance Contracts Amendments to IAS 40 Transfers of Investment Property 1 January 2018 IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments 1 January 2019 IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts 1 January 2021 IFRS 9 is effective for implementation during the financial year ending 31 March 2019.
A detailed analysis of the Groups financial instruments and how these will be affected by the requirements of IFRS 9 has been undertaken and concluded that there is not expected to be any material impact to the returns recognised by the Group.
118 ICG ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2018 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS FOR THE YE AR ENDED 31 MARCH 2018 2.
ADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED STANDARDS CONTINUED The changes in accounting for financial instruments arising from the move from IAS 39 to IFRS 9 are as follows: Assets previously measured at amortised cost that are managed alongside an equity instrument 169.1 m as at 31 March 2018 will be measured at fair value.
Investments solely in debt instruments held directly by ICG Group 2.0m as at 31 March 2018 will continue to be held at amortised cost.
Impairment of loans and receivables held at amortised cost is calculated according to the expected loss model as opposed to the incurred loss model.
Direct investments in portfolio companies and investments in funds currently classified as available for sale AFS 57.7m at 31 March 2018, will be classified as fair value through profit and loss and any future movements in value will be recognised through the income statement as net gains and losses.
IFRS 15 is effective for implementation during the financial year ending 31 March 2019.
An assessment has been performed and there is not expected to be a material impact on the Groups revenue recognition approach.
However, there will be increased levels of disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers included within the financial statements.
3. BUSINESS AND GEOGRAPHICAL SEGMENTS For management purposes, the Group is currently organised into the Fund Management Company FMC and the Investment Company IC.
Segment information about these businesses is presented below and is reviewed by the Executive Directors.
The Group reports the profit of the FMC separately from the profits generated by the IC.
The FMC is defined as the operating unit and as such incurs the majority of the Groups costs, including the cost of the investment network, i. e. the Investment Executives and the local offices, as well as the cost of most support functions, primarily information technology, human resources and marketing.
The IC is charged a management fee of 1% of the carrying value of the average investment portfolio by the FMC and this is shown below as fee income.
The costs of finance, treasury and portfolio administration teams, and the costs related to being a listed entity, are allocated to the IC.
The remuneration of the Executive Directors is allocated equally to the FMC and the IC.

BUSINESS AND GEOGRAPHICAL SEGMENTS CONTINUED Reconciliation of financial statements reported to the Executive Committee to the position reported under IFRS Included in the table below are statutory adjustments made to the Investment Company for the following: For internal reporting purposes, the interest earned and impairments charged on assets where the Group co-invests in funds ICG Europe Fund V, ICG Europe Fund VI, ICG Asia Pacific Fund III and ICG North America Private Debt Fund and where the investment is in a fund where the underlying assets are interest bearing real estate, liquid credit and senior debt funds is presented within interest income impairments whereas under IFRS it is included within the value of the investment dividends.
The structured entities controlled by the Group are presented as fair value investments for internal reporting purposes, whereas the statutory financial statements present these entities on a fully consolidated basis.
Also included within this adjustment is the joint venture investment in Nomura ICG KK which is presented internally on a proportional consolidation basis, whereas it is equity accounted under IFRS and Questus Energy Pty Limited where the costs are included on a line by line basis in the income statement for internal reporting purposes whereas in the IFRS financial statements these are collapsed into a single line, administrative expenses, to reflect its status as a non controlled entity.

FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Accounting policy Financial assets Financial assets are classified into the following categories, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL, available for sale AFS financial assets and loans and receivables.
The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include held for trading derivative financial instruments and debt and equity instruments designated as fair value through profit or loss.
A financial asset is classified as at FVTPL if: it is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedging instrument: or the designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise: or the financial asset is managed, evaluated and reported internally on a fair value basis, in accordance with the Groups documented risk management or investment strategy.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised and subsequently measured at fair value on a recurring basis with gains or losses arising from changes in fair value recognised through gains on investments in the income statement.
Dividends or interest earned on the financial asset are excluded from the gains on investments and recognised separately within finance and dividend income.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are held at amortised cost, less any impairment.
They are non derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They include loans made as part of the Groups operating activities as well as trade and other receivables.
Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value including direct and incremental transaction costs and subsequently valued at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
The carrying value of loans and receivables is considered a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Any premium or discount on disposal of a loan or receivable to a third party is recognised through gains on investments.
Available For Sale AFS financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income FVTOCI are financial assets not classified elsewhere and include listed and unlisted equity instruments.
AFS financial assets are initially recognised at fair value.
They are subsequently measured at fair value on a recurring basis with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value included as a separate component of equity until its sale or impairment, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is recognised through gains in investments in the income statement.
Dividend income earned on the financial asset is excluded from the gains on investments and recognised separately within finance and dividend income.
Derecognition of financial assets The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset are transferred to another party.
On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the assets carrying value amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable, and the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity, is recognised in profit or loss.
Offsetting of financial assets Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends to either settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Current financial assets held for sale The Group classifies current financial assets that are expected to be recovered primarily from sale as held for sale.
This condition is regarded as met only when the asset is available for immediate sale, the Directors are committed to the sale, and the sale is expected to be completed within one year from date of classification.
Financial assets held for sale are initially recognised and subsequently measured at fair value or amortised cost, depending on its measurement requirement under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
ICG ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2018 12 125 5 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Classification policy Direct investments in portfolio companies are measured at FVTPL or FVTOCI Investments in funds are measured at FVTPL Investments in CLO loan notes are measured at FVTPL or FVTOCI Investments in loans held in credit funds consolidated in accordance with IFRS 10 are measured at FVTPL Loans to portfolio companies are measured at amortised cost and are subject to impairment Current financial assets held for sale are measured at FVTPL or amortised cost, depending on the instrument Critical judgements in the application of accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arms-length transaction at measurement date.
The fair value of equity investments and warrants are based on quoted prices, where available.
Where quoted prices are not available, the fair value is based on recent significant transactions using an earnings based valuation technique or, where the Group holds an investment in an unlisted fund, the net asset value of the fund.
We have reviewed the underlying valuation techniques of these funds and consider them to be in line with those of the Group.
The valuation techniques applied follow the International Private Equity and Venture Capital valuation guidelines December 2015 and include some assumptions which are not supportable by observable market prices or rates.
The majority of the portfolio of unquoted shares and warrants is valued using an earnings based technique.
Earnings multiples are applied to the maintainable earnings of the private company being valued to determine the enterprise value.
From this, the value attributable to the Group is calculated based on its holding in the company after making deductions for higher ranking instruments in the capital structure.
The Groups policy is to use reported earnings based on the latest management accounts available from the company, adjusted for non recurring items.
For each company being valued, the earnings multiple is derived from a set of comparable listed companies or relevant market transaction multiples that have been approved by the Investment Committee.
A premium or discount is applied to the earnings multiple to adjust for points of difference relating to risk and earnings growth prospects between the comparable company set and the private company being valued.
The adjusted multiple is the key valuation input which could change fair values significantly if a reasonably possible alternative assumption was made.
The sensitivity analysis of this input is disclosed in note 20.
The Directors have assessed the fair value of the financial assets and have deviated from a quoted price that was available for a direct portfolio investment with a carrying value of 18.5million.
In making their judgement, the Directors considered the Groups holding of the shares that were unlisted and the volatility of the listed shares.
Determining the fair value of the asset using the available quoted price at the reporting date would have had an 11.4m reduction of net assets and Other Comprehensive Income.

Financial liabilities at FVTPL include derivative liabilities and other financial liabilities designated as FVTPL within structured entities controlled by the Group.
A financial instrument is classified as at FVTPL if it is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedging instrument, or the designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are initially recognised and subsequently measured at fair value on a recurring basis with gains or losses arising from changes in fair value recognised through gains in investments in the income statement.
Interest paid on the financial instruments is excluded from the gains on investments and recognised separately within finance costs.
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Groups obligations are discharged, cancelled or expire.

Derivatives, including embedded derivatives which are not considered to be closely related to the host contract, are recognised at fair value determined using independent third party valuations or quoted market prices on a recurring basis.
Changes in fair values of derivatives are recognised immediately in the income statement.
A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whilst a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a financial liability.
A derivative is presented as a non current asset or non current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months, otherwise a derivative will be presented as a current asset or current liability.

All of the Credit Support Annex that have been agreed with our counterparties are fully EMIR compliant.
There were no breaches to loan agreements during the current or prior year.
The change in fair value related to credit risk as at 31 March 2018 was 0.1m 31 March 2017: Nil.
Under the relevant ISDA Master Agreements in place with our counter parties, the close-out netting provision would result in all obligations under a contract with a defaulting party being terminated and there would be a subsequent combining of positive and negative replacement values into a single net payable or receivable.
This reduces the credit exposure from gross to net.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty Other derivatives The fair value of the derivatives used for hedging purposes is derived from pricing models which take account of the contract terms, as well as quoted market parameters such as interest rates and volatilities.
The Group has loans and receivables with a conversion option embedded.
Given the low probability of conversion by the Group, the value attributed to these embedded derivatives is nil.
For details of the Groups risk management policies and disclosures see note 20.

FINANCE AND DIVIDEND INCOME Accounting policy Interest income on financial assets held at amortised cost is measured using the effective interest rate method.
Dividend income is recognised in the income statement when the Groups right to receive income is established.
Interest income recognised on financial assets designated at FVTPL relates to structured entities controlled by the Group, consolidated under IFRS 10.

Financial liabilities within structured entities controlled by the Group are held at fair value through profit or loss.
Interest expense on these liabilities is recognised when the obligation to pay interest is established.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised in the income statement as incurred.

IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS Accounting policy With the exception of financial assets classified as fair value through profit or loss, the Group assesses whether there is objective evidence that financial assets may be impaired at each reporting date.
A financial asset is impaired when objective evidence indicates that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset and that the loss event has an impact on the estimated future flows.
For an investment in an equity instrument held as an AFS financial asset, a significant or prolonged decline in its fair value below cost is considered objective evidence of impairment.
If an impairment event has occurred on financial assets measured at amortised cost, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
If the impairment relates to AFS financial assets, the loss is recycled from other comprehensive income to the income statement.
With the exception of AFS assets if, in a subsequent period, the amount of impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through the income statement to the extent that the carrying value of the investment at the date the impairment is reversed does not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised.
In respect of AFS financial assets, impairment losses previously recognised in the income statement are not reversed through the income statement.
Any increase in value, subsequent to an impairment loss, is recognised in other comprehensive income.

Assets which are underperforming or which the Committee wishes to receive regular updates on are added to the watch list.
During the quarterly review the Committee will identify any impairment events and subsequently determine the level of impairment required.
Typical impairment events include, but are not limited to non payment of cash interest covenant breach deterioration in trading, a restructuring or a significant and prolonged decline in the value of the investment.
Impairment losses are recognised as the difference between the carrying value of the investment and the discounted value of managements best estimates of future cash flow.
These estimates take into account the level and quality of the investees earning, the amount and sources of cash flows, the industry in which the investee operates and the likelihood of cash recovery.
Of the net impairments during the year, the management made a key judgement in relation to the partial impairment of 6.4million to a loan investment in one of the Groups portfolio companies.
The company has had continued underperformance during the year, which makes the recovery of the Groups asset uncertain.
Determining an impairment quantum and timing involves significant judgement.
Net assets and profit before tax would have reduced by a further 11m if the asset had been deemed fully impaired in the year.
The actual amount of future cash flows and the date that they are received may differ from these estimates and consequently actual losses incurred may differ from those initially recognised in the financial statements.

TAX EXPENSE Accounting policy Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax assets and liabilities comprise those obligations to, or claims from, fiscal authorities relating to the current or prior reporting period, that are unpaid at the reporting date.
Deferred tax is provided in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the deferred tax assets can be utilised.
Deferred tax is not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction, other than a business combination, that affects neither the tax nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to their respective period of realisation, provided they are enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right of set off, when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle on a net basis.
Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in the income statement, except where they relate to items that are charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the related deferred tax is also charged or credited directly to equity.

This is in part due to a significant proportion of the Investment Companys assets being invested directly into funds based outside the United Kingdom.
ICG ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2018 143 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Investment returns from these funds are paid to the Group in the form of non taxable dividend income.
This outcome is in line with other UK investment companies.
The Investment Companys taxable costs can therefore be used to offset the taxable profits of our UK Fund Management business, reducing the overall Group charge.
In addition, there are two deferred tax accounting adjustments in the current year which have further reduced the tax charge: 1.
Finance Act 2017 widened the definition of the Substantial Shareholder Exemption rules which exempt companies from tax on the disposal of an investment in which 10% of the shares are held and certain other conditions met.
As a result there are a small number of legacy assets, dating from when ICG was a principal investor, that will now qualify for SSE and be exempt from tax.
As tax had previously been expected to be paid on these balances, a deferred tax liability of 15.4m had been accrued which has been released in the current year.
The Group has reviewed, and updated, its transfer pricing policy to reflect current business practices and in line with the OECDs Base Erosion and Profit Shifting BEPS guidelines.
The updated methodology was prepared in conjunction with our corporate tax advisers and the use of external benchmarking.
Following this exercise, and in light of the Groups ongoing low risk tax status in the UK and no open enquiries elsewhere, the Directors reassessed the necessity for a tax risk provision.
The Directors concluded that whilst there remains an inherent risk of challenge by UK and overseas tax authorities this was not sufficient to maintain the provision of 27.1m.

As a result of the Groups low tax rate driven by the activities of the Investment Company, management have assessed that the taxable profits in the foreseeable future will be lower than the profits arising from the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences.
Accordingly the full value of deferred tax assets has not been recognised.
Deferred tax has been accounted for at the substantively enacted corporation tax rate of 19%.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS Accounting policy Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The acquisition method involves the recognition of all assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired business at their fair value at the acquisition date.
The excess of the fair value at the date of acquisition of the cost of investments in subsidiaries over the fair value of the net assets acquired which is not allocated to individual assets and liabilities is determined to be goodwill.
Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment.
Intangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired separately, including investment management contracts and contact databases, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
These are measured at cost and are being amortised on a straight line basis over the expected life of the contract, currently three to eight years.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Accounting policy The Groups property, plant and equipment provide the infrastructure to enable the Group to operate.
Assets are initially stated at cost, which includes expenditure associated with acquisition.
The cost of the asset is recognised in the income statement as a depreciation charge on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life, three years for furniture and equipment, five years for short leasehold premises.
TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES Accounting policy Other receivables are held at amortised cost and represent amounts the Group is due to receive in the normal course of business.
Other receivables within structured entities controlled by the Group relate principally to unsettled trades on the sale of financial assets.
Amounts owed by Group companies are non interest bearing and repayable on demand.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
There are systems of controls in place to create an acceptable balance between the potential costs, should such a risk occur, and the cost of managing those risks.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in the market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Group has exposure to market risk including exposure to interest rates and foreign currency, liquidity risk and credit risk arising from financial instruments.
This section provides details of the Groups approach to financial risks and describes the methods used by the Board to mitigate and control such risk.
Market risk Interest rate risk The Groups assets include both fixed and floating rate loans and non interest bearing equity investments.
The Groups operations are financed with a combination of its shareholders funds, bank borrowings, private placement notes, public bonds, and fixed and floating rate notes.
The Group manages its exposure to market interest rate movements by matching, to the extent possible, the interest rate profiles of assets and liabilities and by using derivative financial instruments.
As a result, the Group does not have material financial exposure to interest rate movements.
The sensitivity of assets and liabilities to interest rate risk is disclosed below.
The Groups sensitivity to movements is assumed by applying 100 basis points sensitivity to interest rates to the Groups forecast model.
Sensitivity to interest rate risk 2018 2017 Floating Fixed Total Floating Fixed Total m m m m m m Financial assets 4,198.5 1,956.4 6,154.9 4,336.0 1,629.6 5,965.6 Financial liabilities 3,314.7 1,575.6 4,890.3 3,227.0 1,544.7 4,771.7 883.8 380.8 1,264.6 1,109.0 84.9 1,193.9 The sensitivity of floating rate financial assets to the 100 basis points interest rate increase is 42.0m 2017: 43.4m and the sensitivity of financial liabilities to the same interest rate increase is 33.1m 2017: 32.3m.
There is no interest rate risk exposure on fixed rate financial assets or liabilities.
Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to currency risk in relation to currency transactions and the translation of net assets, and income statement of foreign subsidiaries.
The Groups most significant exposures are to the Euro and the US dollar.
Exposure to market currency risk is managed by matching assets with liabilities to the extent possible and through the use of derivative instruments.
The Group regards its interest in overseas subsidiaries as long term investments.
Consequently, it does not normally hedge the translation effect of exchange rate movements on the financial statements of these businesses.
The Group is also exposed to currency risk arising on the translation of fund management fee income receipts, which are primarily denominated in Euro and US dollar.
Fund management fee income is hedged to provide more certainty over the value of future cash inflows.
The sensitivity to movements in exchange rates is assumed by applying a percentage measure, based on the volatility of the applicable currency, as defined in the Groups treasury policy, to the net currency asset or liability at the balance sheet date.
ICG ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2018 149 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The effect of fluctuations in other currencies is considered by the Directors to be insignificant in the current and prior year.

Liquidity risk The Group manages its liquidity risk by maintaining headroom on its financing facilities, particularly its bank facilities.
The table below shows the liquidity profile of the Groups financial liabilities, based on contractual repayment dates of principal and interest payments.
Future interest and principal cash flows have been calculated based on exchange rates and floating rate interest rates as at 31 March 2018.
It is assumed that Group borrowings under its senior debt facilities remain at the same level as at 31 March 2018 until contractual maturity.

Due to the long term nature of the Groups assets, the Group seeks to ensure that the maturity of its debt instruments is matched to the expected maturity of its assets.
During the financial year, $292m and 74m of US private placements were raised with five, eight and 10 year maturities, enabling the repayment of maturing private placements and a reduction in existing bank facilities.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group as a result of a counterparty failing to meet its contractual obligations.
This risk is principally in connection with the Groups loans and receivables.
This risk is mitigated by the disciplined credit procedures that the Investment Committees have in place prior to making an investment and the ongoing monitoring of that investment throughout its lifespan.
In addition, the risk of significant credit loss is further mitigated by the Groups policy to diversify its investment portfolio in terms of geography and industry sector and to limit the amount invested in any single company.

Credit risk exposure on cash and derivative instruments is managed in accordance with the Groups treasury policy which provides limits on exposures with any single financial institution.
The credit rating of these institutions range from BBB to AAA.
The Directors consider the Groups credit exposure to trade and other receivables and current assets held for sale to be low and as such no further analysis has been presented.
The Directors consider the credit risk of the investments within the structured entities controlled by the Group to be low.
The Groups investments in CLO loan notes and loans held in credit funds principally comprise senior loans.
The credit risk related to any reduction in the value of investments in loans held in credit funds is borne by the investors in the loan notes or units in these funds.
ICGs exposure to the credit risk of the underlying collateral is therefore limited to its investments in these CLOs and credit funds, which at 31 March 2018 was 345.9m 2017: 292.8m.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the Directors assessment of the maximum credit risk exposure of the Group and Company at the balance sheet date.
Impairment losses taken during the year reflect the decline in recoverability on individual assets, either as a result of company specific or of general macroeconomic conditions.
ICG ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2018 151 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Directors believe that credit risk as a result of the concentration of significant counterparties is low as there is no individual counterparty comprising more than 10% of the Groups total exposure.
There are no financial assets that are past due and not impaired.
Capital management The primary objectives of the Groups capital management are to ensure that the Group complies with externally imposed capital requirements by the Financial Conduct Authority and ensure that the Group maximises the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The Groups strategy has remained unchanged from the year ended 31 March 2017.
The capital structure comprises debt, which include the borrowings disclosed in note 4, cash and cash equivalents, and capital and reserves of the Parent Company, comprising called up share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
The Capital Requirements Directive CRD IV sets out a three pillar approach to the assessment and disclosure of the adequacy of a relevant firms capital resources.
Pillar 1 calculates a firms minimum capital resource requirement mechanically by reference to the firm type and based on prescribed factors.
Pillar 2 requires a subjective assessment of the firms capital resource requirement by reference to the risks to which it is exposed and within the context of its overall risk management framework.
The process, known as the ICAAP, is a key input into the supervisory review process of the Financial Conduct Authority the FCA.
Pillar 3 requires public disclosure of information regarding the risk management, capital resources and capital requirements of a firm and group where a group exists with the aim of promoting market discipline.
The Group is required to maintain minimum Pillar 1 regulatory capital of 340.9m 2017: 323.4m, The Groups total capital requirement is 385.6m 2017: 368.1m.
The Groups regulatory surplus capital, comprising the Groups total equity less regulatory deductions and the regulatory capital requirement, was 607.7m 2017: 519.1m.
The Group has complied with the imposed minimum capital throughout the year.
The full Pillar 3 disclosures are available on the Companys website: www.

OWN SHARES RESERVE Accounting policy Own shares are recorded by the Group when ordinary shares are purchased in the market by ICG plc or through the Employee Benefit Trust EBT.
The EBT acts as a special purpose vehicle, with the purpose of purchasing and holding shares of the Company for the hedging of future liabilities arising as a result of the employee share based compensation scheme see note 24 in a way that does not dilute the percentage holdings of existing shareholders.
Own shares are held at cost and their purchase reduces the Groups net assets by the amount spent.
When shares vest or are cancelled, they are transferred from own shares to the profit and loss reserve at their weighted average cost.
No gain or loss is recognised on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Companys own shares.
These shares were purchased through share buy back in prior years.
The number of shares held by the Group at the balance sheet date represented 3.9% 2017: 4.5% of the Parent Companys allotted, called up and fully paid share capital.

SHARE BASED PAYMENTS Accounting policy The Group issues compensation to its employees under equity settled share based payment plans.
The Omnibus Plan provides for two different award types to be made over ICG shares: Deferred Share Awards and PLC Equity Awards.
FMC Equity Awards were awarded up until May 2017.
In addition, Buy Out Awards are shares awarded to new employees in lieu of awards forfeited from their previous employment.
Equity-settled share based payments are measured at the fair value of the awards at grant date.
The fair value includes the effect of non market based vesting conditions.
The fair value determined at the date of grant is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period.
At each reporting date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of non market based vesting conditions.
The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
All share based payment transactions are equity settled.
The total charge to the income statement for the year was 22.1m 2017: 25.1m and this was credited to the share based payments reserve in equity.
Details of the different types of awards are as follows: Deferred Share Awards Awards are made after the end of the financial year to reward employees for delivering cash profits, managing the cost base, employing sound risk and business management.
These share awards normally vest one third at the end of the first, second and third years following the year of grant, unless the individual leaves for cause or to join a competitor.
Dividend equivalents accrue to participants during the vesting period and are paid at the vesting date.
Awards are based on performance against individuals objectives.
There are no further performance conditions.
PLC Equity Awards Awards are made after the end of the financial year to reward senior employees for increasing long term shareholder value.
These share awards normally vest one third at the end of the third, fourth and fifth years following the year of grant, unless the individual leaves for cause or to join a competitor.
FMC Equity Awards FMC Equity Awards were awarded up until May 2017.
Awards were made after the end of the financial year to incentivise those employees charged with accelerating the expansion of the Companys fund management business.
The awards are over shares in FMC and shares normally vest one third in each of the first, second and third years following the year of grant subject to continuing service.
A holding period applies until the third year following the year of grant, at which time all vested FMC shares are automatically exchanged for Company shares of an equivalent value.
The value of a share is determined by an independent valuation every year.
Awards were based on performance against individuals objectives.
Buy Out Awards Shares may be awarded to a new employee in lieu of awards forfeited from their previous employment.
These share awards shall vest or be forfeited according to the schedule and terms of the forfeited awards, and any performance conditions detailed in the individuals employment contract.
Intermediate Capital Group plc 2001 approved and unapproved executive share option scheme All options under the Intermediate Capital Group plc 2001 scheme have vested, and no new options will be awarded as the scheme is now closed.

SUBSIDIARIES Accounting policy Investment in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries in the Parent Company statement of financial position are recorded at cost less provision for impairments or at fair value through profit or loss.
Key sources of judgement When assessing whether ICG controls any funds it manages it is necessary to determine whether ICG acts in the capacity of principal or agent for the third party investor.
An agent is a party primarily engaged to act on behalf and for the benefit of another party or parties, whereas a principal is primarily engaged to act for its own benefit.
This is an area of significant judgement and is determined with reference to decision - making authority, rights held by other parties, remuneration and exposure to returns.
A significant judgement when determining that ICG acts in the capacity of principal or agent is the kick-out rights of the third party shareholders.
Across each of the funds where ICG has a significant ownership interest greater than 15% we have reviewed these kick-out rights.
Where the investors have substantive rights to remove ICG as the investment adviser it has been concluded that ICG is an agent to the fund and thus the fund does not require consolidation into the Group.
However, we consider ICG to have significant influence over these funds and have therefore recognised them as associates.
Where the conclusion is that ICG acts in the capacity of principal the fund has been consolidated into the Group.
As a fund manager ICG participates in Carried Interest Partnerships CIPs, the participants of which are ICG and individuals connected to ICG.
The Directors have assessed the payments of carry to individuals and whether they require consolidation into the Consolidated Financial Statements.
In forming their conclusion the Directors considered whether the CIP participants were providing a service for the benefit of the Group, and whether ICG was acting as principal or agent of the CIPs.
The Directors concluded that the CIPs are not controlled by ICG and the participants are not rewarded for a service provided that benefits the Group.

ASSOCIATES AND JOINT VENTURES Accounting Policy Investment in associates An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence, but no control, over the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity.
As the investments in associates are held for venture capital purposes they are designated at fair value through profit or loss.
Investment in joint ventures A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control over the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangements.
The results and assets and liabilities of joint ventures are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting from the date on which the investee becomes a joint venture, except when the investment is held for venture capital purposes in which case they are designated as fair value through profit and loss.
Under the equity method, an investment in a joint venture is initially recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost, and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Groups share of the joint ventures profit or loss.
The nature of some of the activities of ICG plcs associates and joint ventures are investment related which are seen as complementing the Groups operations and contributing to achieving the Groups overall strategy.
The remaining associates and joint ventures are portfolio companies not involved in investment activities.

The Advisory Council could influence investors to invoke Special Investor Consent Combined Limited Partner Consent and remove the GP, and as such ICG acts in the capacity of agent.
However, as ICG has a 16.67%- 20% holding, and therefore significant influence in each entity, they have been considered as associates.
The following changes are of note to the Groups associates during the year: a. T he Group reduced its ownership interest in ICG Total Credit Fund to 12.61% during the year ended 31 March 2018 31 March 2017: 21.75% and is no longer considered to have significant influence.
As a result ICG Total Credit Fund is no longer classified as an associate and instead is classified as an investment.
b. T he Group reduced its ownership interest in Gerflor Group to 3.0% during the year to 31 March 2018 31 March 2017: 11.76% and therefore the Group are no longer considered to have significant influence.

c. The Groups investment in Longbow UK Real Estate Debt Investments II, which was previously classified as an associate was fully realised during the year.
There were no other changes of note in the Groups ownership interests in associates in the year.
ICG ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2018 163 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Details of each of the Groups joint ventures at the end of the reporting period are as follows: Proportion of ownership interest voting rights held by the Group Name of joint venture Principal activity Country of incorporation 2018 Nomura ICG KK Advisory company Japan 50.00% Brighton Administration Company Limited Investment Company United Kingdom 50.00% Nomura ICG KK is equity accounted as a joint venture in accordance with IFRS 11.
The West Quay Development Company Partnership LLP is accounted for at fair value in accordance with the Group`s accounting policy in note 4 to the financial statements.
ICG`s policy is to fair value investments in a portfolio company on a consistent basis with all other portfolio assets regardless of the classification in the financial statements.

The principal place of business for both these entities is Jersey.
The entities allow ICG to co-invest into Fund V and Fund VI through a parallel structure, aligning interests with other investors.
ICG has 20% exposure to Fund Vs net asset value and 16.67% exposure to Fund VIs net asset value.
ICG receives performance related carry interest income of 20% of the total performance fee of 20% of profit for both these funds.

STRUCTURED ENTITIES A structured entity is an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements.
ICG has determined that where ICG holds an investment, loan, fee receivable, guarantee or commitment with an investment fund, CLO or CDO, that this represents an interest in a structured entity.
ICG does not have any exposure to loans, guarantees or commitments.
Where ICG does not hold an investment in the structured entity, management has determined that the characteristics of control are not met.
