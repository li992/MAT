The acquisitions in the prior year principally relate to the acquisition of Go Outdoors Limited, Sports Unlimited Retail BV, Next Athleisure, JD Sports Fashion SDN.
Further details, including the provisional fair value of the assets acquired, are provided in Note 11.
Impairment The impairment in the current period relates to the impairment of the fascia name arising in prior years on the acquisition of Next Athleisure Pty Limited and JD Sports Fashion SDN.
BHD and the goodwill arising in prior years on the acquisition of Tiso Group Limited.
The impairment in the previous period related to the impairment of the ActivInstinct, Aspecto and Infinities fascia names and the impairment of the goodwill arising on the acquisition of 2Squared.
Intangibles Assets with Definite Lives Brand Licences Brand licences are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation of brand licences is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement within cost of sales over the term to the licence expiry on a straight line basis.
Brand licences are tested annually for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount to their carrying value.
Impairment losses are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The recoverable amount of brand licences is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing operation of the relevant cashgenerating unit until the licence expiry date and the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value.

The short term growth rate is the Board approved compound annual growth rate in sales for the first two year period following the January 2019 financial year currently underway 2.
The long term growth rate is the rate used thereafter until the end of the licence period 3.
The discount rate applied is pre-tax and reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the assets, for which future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted.
This discount rate is considered to be equivalent to the rate a market participant would use Brand Names Brand names acquired as part of a business combination are stated at fair value as at the acquisition date less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Brand names separately acquired are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
The useful economic life of each purchased brand name is considered to be finite.
In determining the useful economic life of each brand name, the Board considers the market position of the brands acquired, the nature of the market that the brands operate in, typical product life cycles of brands and the useful economic lives of similar assets that are used in comparable ways.
The brand names above are amortised over a period of 10 years and the amortisation charge is included within administrative expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Brand names are tested annually for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount to their carrying value.
The recoverable amount of brand names is determined based on a royalty relief method of valuation.
This is based on an estimation of future sales and the choice of a suitable royalty and discount rate in order to calculate the present value, when this method is deemed the most appropriate.
This method involves calculating a net present value for each brand by discounting the projected future royalties expected over the remaining useful life of each brand.
The future royalties are estimated by applying a suitable royalty rate to the sales forecast.
Alternatively the carrying value of the brand names has been allocated to a cash-generating unit, along with the relevant goodwill and fascia names, and tested in the value-in-use calculation performed for that cash-generating unit.

The long term growth rate is the rate used thereafter until the end of the useful life remaining 3.
This discount rate is considered to be equivalent to the rate a market participant would use Software Development Software development costs including website development costs are capitalised as Intangible Assets if the technical and commercial feasibility of the project has been demonstrated, the future economic benefits are probable, the Group has an intention and ability to complete and use or sell the software and the costs can be measured reliably.
Costs that do not meet these criteria are expensed as incurred.
Software development costs are stated at historic cost, less accumulated amortisation.
Software development costs are all amortised over a period of two to seven years and the amortisation charge is included within administrative expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement.

Intangible Assets continued Fascia Name Separately identifiable fascia names acquired are stated at fair value as at the acquisition date less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
The initial fair value is determined by using a royalty relief method of valuation.
This method involves calculating a net present value for each fascia name by discounting the projected future royalties expected using an indefinite useful economic life for each fascia.
Store and online fascia names are considered to have a finite useful economic life.
The useful economic life of an online fascia name is lower than that of a store fascia name due to increased competition in the marketplace as a result of reduced barriers to entry.
The estimated useful economic lives are as follows: Online fascia names 3 to 5 years Store fascia names 10 to 20 years All fascia names are subject to an impairment review on an annual basis or more frequently if there is an indicator that the fascia name is impaired.
The recoverable amount of these assets is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing operation of the cash-generating unit and the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value.
During the financial period ended 3 February 2018, the Board reassessed the useful life of each fascia name held by the Group and determined that fascia names should have a finite life rather than an infinite life as previously estimated.
The change in estimate is as a result of identifying that, based on historical experience, the estimated useful life of a fascia is finite taking into account factors such as group synergies and a homogenised offer.
The factors that the Board took into consideration when determining the useful life of each fascia name were: The strength of the respective fascia names in the relevant sector and geographic region where the fascia is located The history of the fascia names and that of similar assets in the relevant retail sectors The commitment of the Group to continue to operate these stores separately for the foreseeable future, including the ongoing investment in new stores and refurbishments The change in the useful life assessment from indefinite to finite has been accounted for as a change in the accounting estimate in accordance with IAS 8.
The change in accounting estimate has resulted in a 5.7 million amortisation charge for the period ended 3 February 2018.
Based on the carrying value of the fascia names held as at 3 February 2018 and the current estimate of the useful life for each of these assets, the amortisation charge for the financial period ended 2 February 2019 is expected to be at a similar level.

Intangible Assets continued Intangibles Assets with Indefinite Lives Goodwill Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition of subsidiaries.
Method 1: For acquisitions on or after 31 January 2010, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as: the fair value of the consideration transferred: plus the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree: plus if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree: less the net recognised amount of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
When the excess is negative, negative goodwill is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit loss on disposal.
Method 2: In respect of business acquisitions that occurred from 1 February 2004 to 30 January 2010, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree.
When the excess was negative negative goodwill, it was recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement as an exceptional item.
Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurred in connection with business combinations were capitalised as part of the cost of the acquisition.
Method 3: In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 February 2004, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under previous GAAP.
The classification and accounting treatment of business combinations that occurred prior to 1 February 2004 has not been reconsidered in preparing the Groups opening adopted IFRS balance sheet at 1 February 2004.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to groups of cash-generating units and is tested annually for impairment and whenever there is an indication that the goodwill may be impaired.
The cash-generating units used are individual stores and the groups of cash-generating units are either the store portfolios or individual businesses acquired.
The recoverable amount is compared to the carrying amount of the cash-generating units including goodwill.
The recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
The carrying amount of goodwill and fascia name by cash-generating units, along with the key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculation is set out on the following pages: 141 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 12.

The short term growth rate is the Board approved compound annual growth rate for the four year period following the January 2019 financial year currently underway 2.
The long term growth rate is the rate used thereafter, which is an estimate of the growth based on past experience within the Group taking account of economic growth forecast for the relevant industries 3.
The discount rate applied is pre-tax and reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and any specific risk premiums relevant to the individual cash-generating unit.
These discount rates are considered to be equivalent to the rates a market participant would use 4.
The impairment model prepared for Blacks and Millets, in addition to covering the fascia names, has also been used to support the net book value of the Peter Storm and Eurohike brand names, which are exclusively sold through the Blacks and Millets store portfolio The cash flow projections used in the value-in-use calculations are all based on actual operating results, together with financial forecasts and strategy plans approved by the Board covering a five year period.
These forecasts and plans are based on both past performance and expectations for future market development.
Sensitivity Analysis A sensitivity analysis has been performed on the base case assumptions of margin growth used for assessing the goodwill and other intangibles.
With regards to the assessment of value-in-use of all cash-generating units, with the exceptions of those listed below, the Board believe that there are no reasonably possible changes in any of the key assumptions, which would cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
For the Go Outdoors cash-generating unit, significant changes in key assumptions could cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
The following sensitivities were performed: Reduce the assumed short term store and online gross margin rate % growth of 2% to 1%, assuming the business would be unable to reduce selling and distribution and administrative costs.
Assuming all other assumptions remain unchanged, this would not lead to an impairment.
Increasing the pre-tax discount rate by 1% would lead to an impairment of 10.2 million.
All other assumptions remain unchanged.
Reducing the long term growth rate by 1% would lead to an impairment of 4.7 million.
The Board has considered the possibility of each of these businesses achieving less revenue and gross profit % than forecast.
Whilst any reduction in revenue would be partially offset by a reduction in revenue related costs, the Board would also take actions to mitigate the loss of gross profit by reducing other costs.
