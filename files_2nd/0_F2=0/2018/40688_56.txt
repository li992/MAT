NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNILEVER GROUP CONTINUED 17.
CREDIT RISK Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counter-party fails to meet its contractual obligations.
Additional information in relation to credit risk on trade receivables is given in note 13.
These risks are generally managed by local controllers.
Credit risk related to the use of treasury instruments, including those held at amortised cost and at fair value through other comprehensive income, is managed on a Group basis.
This risk arises from transactions with financial institutions involving cash and cash equivalents, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets.
To reduce this risk, Unilever has concentrated its main activities with a limited number of counter-parties which have secure credit ratings.
Individual risk limits are set for each counter-party based on financial position, credit rating and past experience.
Credit limits and concentration of exposures are actively monitored by the Groups treasury department.
Netting agreements are also put in place with Unilevers principal counter-parties.
In the case of a default, these arrangements would allow Unilever to net assets and liabilities across transactions with that counter-party.
To further reduce the Groups credit exposures on derivative financial instruments, Unilever has collateral agreements with Unilevers principal counterparties in relation to derivative financial instruments.
Under these arrangements, counter-parties are required to deposit securities and or cash as a collateral for their obligations in respect of derivative financial instruments.
At 31 December 2018 the collateral held by Unilever under such arrangements amounted to 10 million 2017: 6 million, of which 10 million 2017: 6 million] was in cash, and Nil 2017: Nil was in the form of bond securities.
The non-cash collateral has not been recognised as an asset in the Groups balance sheet.
Further details in relation to the Groups exposure to credit risk are shown in note 13 and note 16A.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FAIR VALUE RISK The Group is exposed to the risks of changes in fair value of its financial assets and liabilities.
The following table summarises the fair values and carrying amounts of financial instruments.

See page 117 and note 1 for further details.
The fair value of trade receivables and payables is considered to be equal to the carrying amount of these items due to their short-term nature.
The instruments that have a fair value that is different from the carrying amount are classified as Level 2 for both 2017 and 2018.
FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY The fair values shown in notes 15C and 17A have been classified into three categories depending on the inputs used in the valuation technique.
The categories used are as follows: Level 1: quoted prices for identical instruments: Level 2: directly or indirectly observable market inputs, other than Level 1 inputs: and Level 3: inputs which are not based on observable market data.

b Includes 140 million 2017: 113 million derivatives, reported within trade payables, that hedge trading activities.
Other than changes arising on adoption of IFRS 9, there were no significant changes in classification of fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities since 31 December 2017.
There were also no significant movements between the fair value levels since 31 December 2017.
The impact in 2018 income statement due to level 3 instruments is a gain of 272 million 2017: gain of 26 million.
Reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities is given below: million million Reconciliation of movements in Level 3 valuations 2018 2017 1 January 101 106 Gains and losses recognised in profit and loss 272 26 Gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income 9 2 Purchases and new issues 4 89 Sales and settlements 75 17 83 Transfers into Level 3 31 December 241 101 SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS USED IN LEVEL 3 FAIR VALUES The largest asset valued using Level 3 techniques is an executive Life Insurance of 17 million 2017: 22 million.
A change in one or more of the inputs to reasonably possible alternative assumptions would not change the value significantly.
The gains and losses recognised in profit and loss includes a credit from early settlement of contingent consideration for Blueair.
CALCULATION OF FAIR VALUES The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values are consistent with those used in the year ended 31 December 2017.
ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE The fair values of quoted investments falling into Level 1 are based on current bid prices.
The fair values of unquoted financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income and at fair value through profit or loss are based on recent trades in liquid markets, observable market rates, discounted cash flow analysis and statistical modelling techniques such as the Monte Carlo simulation.
If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2.
If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.
Derivatives are valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs.
The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counter-parties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, interest rate curves and forward rate curves of the underlying commodities.
For listed securities where the market is not liquid, and for unlisted securities, valuation techniques are used.
These include the use of recent arms length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same and discounted cash flow calculations.
