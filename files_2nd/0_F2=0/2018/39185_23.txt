It is used for management decision making and internal performance management and is the profit measure presented in the Groups segmental reporting.
Adjusted profit is a non-GAAP measure which adjusts the IFRS profit for specific agreed items as detailed in note 7 a : Adjusted profit adjusting items.
Adjusted profit excludes significant costs or income that are non-operating or one-off in nature, including the impairment of goodwill: amortisation and impairment of other intangibles acquired in business combinations: the profit or loss on business acquisitions and disposals: costs related to business transformation: Managed Separation costs: the effects of interest costs on borrowings: and voluntary customer remediation provisions.
Adjusted profit also treats policyholder tax as a pre-tax charge to offset against the related income collected from policyholders, though adjusted to remove the impact of non-operating tax items.
Adjusted earnings applied in the calculation of adjusted earnings per share is calculated based on adjusted profit after tax.
The calculation ofthe adjusted weighted average number of shares includes own shares held in policyholders funds.
The Group Audit Committee regularly reviews the use of adjusted profit to confirm that it remains an appropriate basis on which to analyse theoperating performance of the business.
The Committee assesses refinements to the policy on a case-by-case basis, and where possible the Group seeks to minimise such changes in order to maintain consistency over time.
