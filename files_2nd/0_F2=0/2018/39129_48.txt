The Group has designated US$3,725 million 31 December 2017: US$4,275 million of its US dollar denominated subordinated debt as a net investment hedge under IAS 39 to hedge the currency risks related to the net investment in Jackson.
ii The senior debt ranks above subordinated debt in the event of liquidation.
In 2018, as part of its preparation to demerge M&GPrudential, the Group made certain modifications to the terms and conditions of the senior bonds with bondholders consent.
The amendment to the terms and conditions will avoid an event of a technical default on the bonds, should the demerger proceed.
The fees paid to bondholders have been adjusted to the carrying value of the bonds and will be amortised in subsequent periods.
No other adjustments were made to the carrying value of the debt as a result of the modification.
iii The bank loan of 275 million is drawn at a cost of 12-month GBP LIBOR plus 0.33 per cent.
The loan, held by Prudential Capital as of 31 December 2017, was renewed in December 2018, with Prudential plc becoming the new holder.
The loan matures on 20 December 2022 with an option to repay annually.

The proceeds, net of costs, were 743 million: 500 million 6.25 per cent Tier 2 subordinated notes due 2068.
The proceeds, net of costs, were 498 million: and US$500 million 6.5 per cent Tier 2 subordinated notes due 2048.
The proceeds, net of costs, were 389 million US$498 million.
v In December 2018, the Company paid 434 million to redeem its US$550 million 7.75 per cent Tier 1 perpetual subordinated notes.
vi These borrowings can be converted, in whole or in part, at the Companys option and subject to certain conditions, on any interest payment date, into one or more series of Prudential preference shares.
vii The 20 million borrowings were issued at 20-year Euro Constant Maturity Swap capped at 6.5 per cent.
These have been swapped into borrowings of 14 million with interest payable at three-month GBP LIBOR plus 1.2 per cent.
viii Jacksons borrowings are unsecured and subordinated to all present and future indebtedness, policy claims and other creditor claims of Jackson.
co. uk Annual Report 2018 Prudential plc 269 C Balance sheet notes continued C6 Borrowings continued C6.1 Core structural borrowings of shareholder-financed businesses continued Prior to the demerger, the Group expects to rebalance its debt capital across Prudential and M&GPrudential.
This will include the ultimate holding company of M&GPrudential becoming an issuer of new debt, including debt substituted from Prudential, and Prudential redeeming some of its existing debt.
Following these actions, the overall absolute quantum of debt across Prudential and M&GPrudential is currently expected to increase, by an amount which is not considered to be material in the context of the Groups total outstanding debt as at 30 June 2018, before any substitutable debt had been issued, of 7.6 billion comprising the Groups core structural borrowings of 6.4 billion and shareholder borrowings from short-term fixed income securities programme of 1.2 billion.
At the time of the demerger, Prudential expects M&GPrudential to be holding around 3.5 billion of subordinated debt.
This expectation is subject to the M&GPrudential capital risk appetite being approved by the Board of the ultimate holding company of M&GPrudential, once fully constituted to include independent non-executive directors, and reflects the current operating environment and economic conditions, material changes in which may lead to a different outcome.
