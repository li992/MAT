The tax assessed for the year is lower than that resulting from applying the effective standard rate of corporation tax in the UK.
The difference is explained below.

No provision has been made for deferred tax on income outstanding at the end of the year as this will be covered by unrelieved business charges and eligible unrelieved foreign tax 2017: nil.
7.4 Factors that may affect future tax charges At 31 December 2018, the Company had excess expenses of 243,368,000 2017: 218,091,000 carried forward.
This sum has arisen due to cumulative deductible expenses having exceeded income over the life of the Company.
It is considered too uncertain that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which these expenses can be offset and, therefore, in accordance with IAS 12, a deferred tax asset of 41,372,000 2017: 37,076,000 in respect of unrelieved loan relationship deficit and unrelieved management expenses based on a prospective corporation tax rate of 17% 2017: 17% has not been recognised.
The reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax was substantively enacted on 15 September 2016 and will be effective 1 April 2020.
Provided the Company continues to maintain its current investment profile, it is unlikely that the expenses will be utilised and that the Company will obtain any benefit from this contingent asset.

14 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Risk management policies and procedures As an investment company, Witan invests in equities and other investments for the long term so as to secure its investment objective as stated on the inside front cover.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Group is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction in the Groups net assets or a reduction in the profits available for distribution by way of dividends.
These risks, market risk comprising price risk, currency risk and interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk, and the directors approach to the management of them, are set out below.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks and the methods used to manage the risks, as set out below, have not changed from the previous accounting period, although in some instances additional resources have been allocated to some areas.
14.1 Market risk The fair value of a financial instrument held by the Group may fluctuate due to changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises: price risk see note 14.2, currency risk see note 14.3 and interest rate risk see note 14.4.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks, which policies have remained substantially unchanged from those applying in the year ended 31 December 2017.
The investment managers assess the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitor the overall level of market risk on the whole of their investment portfolios on an ongoing basis.
78 Witan Investment Trust plc Annual report 2018 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 14.2 Price risk Price risks i. e. changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may affect the value of the quoted and the unquoted investments.
Management of the risk The Board manages the risks inherent in the investment portfolios by regularly reviewing relevant information from the investment managers.
The Board meets regularly and at each meeting reviews investment performance.
The Board monitors the managers compliance with their mandates and also whether each mandate and asset allocation is compatible with the Companys objective.
When appropriate, the Company has the ability to manage its exposure to risk through the controlled use of derivatives.
The Groups exposure to other changes in market prices at 31 December on its quoted equity investments, and on index futures and investments, was as follows: 2018 2017 000 000 Investments held at fair value through profit or loss 1,954,114 2,149,267 Nominal futures exposure long position 24,671 23,256 Concentration of exposure to price risks An analysis of the Groups investment portfolio is shown on page 31.
This shows that the greater geographical weighting is to UK companies, with significant exposure also to North America, Asia and Continental Europe.
Accordingly, there is a concentration of exposure to those regions, although an investments country of domicile or of listing does not necessarily equate to its exposure to the economic conditions in that country.
Price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after taxation for the year and the value of the shareholders funds to an increase or decrease of 15% in the fair values of the Groups equity investments including exposure through futures contracts.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of market conditions and historical trends.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Groups equities and equity exposure through options and futures at each balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.
The results of these example calculations are significant but not unreasonable, given that most of the Groups assets are equity investments.

As a consequence, movements in exchange rates affect the sterling value of those items.
Management of the risk The investment managers monitor their exposure to currencies as part of their normal investment processes.
The Board receives a monthly report on the currency exposures of the entire fund.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted into sterling on receipt.
The Group does not normally use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.
Foreign currency exposure The fair values of the Groups monetary items that have foreign currency exposure at 31 December are shown on page 80.
Where the Groups equity investments which are not monetary items are denominated in a foreign currency, they have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.

Foreign currency sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the profit loss after tax for the year and the Groups equity in regard to the Groups monetary financial assets and financial liabilities and the exchange rates for the US dollar, Euro and Japanese yen.
The results of these example calculations are significant but not unreasonable in the context of the majority of the Groups assets being invested overseas.
It assumes the following changes in exchange rates: US dollar - 15% 2017: 15% Euro - 15% 2017: 15% Japanese yen - 15% 2017: 15% The sensitivity analysis is based on the Groups foreign currency financial instruments held at the balance sheet date and takes account of any forward foreign exchange contracts that offset the effects of changes in currency exchange If sterling had depreciated against the currencies shown, this would have the following effect: 2018 2017 US$ Euro Yen US$ Euro Yen 000 000 000 000 000 000 Changes to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income Revenue return 1,880 1,560 337 1,805 1,452 331 Capital return 84,950 52,640 18,237 101,159 65,489 18,380 Change to the profit loss after tax 86,830 54,200 18,574 102,964 66,941 18,711 Change to the shareholders funds 86,830 54,200 18,574 102,964 66,941 18,711 80 Witan Investment Trust plc Annual report 2018 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE If sterling had appreciated against the currencies shown, this would have the following effect: 2018 2017 US$ Euro Yen US$ Euro Yen 000 000 000 000 000 000 Changes to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income Revenue return 1,389 1,153 249 1,334 1,073 245 Capital return 62,789 38,908 13,480 74,770 44,361 13,585 Change to the profit loss after tax 64,178 40,061 13,729 76,104 45,434 13,830 Change to the shareholders funds 64,178 40,061 13,729 76,104 45,434 13,830 14.4 Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable from fixed interest securities and cash at bank and on deposit.
Management of the risk The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment decisions.
The Group holds cash balances, partly to meet payments as they fall due but also when appropriate to offset the long-term borrowings that it has in place.
The Group finances part of its activities through preference shares that do not have redemption dates and through secured bonds and notes that were issued as part of the Companys planned gearing.
Interest rate exposure The exposure at 31 December 2018 of financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to: floating interest rates: when the interest rate is due to be re-set: and fixed interest rates: when the financial instrument is due to be repaid.
The Groups exposure to floating interest rates on liabilities is 8,754,000 2017: assets of 2,326,000.
This represents cash holdings minus variable rate borrowing.
The Groups exposure to fixed interest rates on assets is Nil 2017: 7,940,000.
This represents investments in bonds The Groups exposure to fixed interest rates on liabilities is 170,413,000 2017: 170,365,000.
This represents fixed rate borrowing.
Interest receivable and finance costs are at the following rates: interest received on cash balances, or paid on bank overdrafts and loans, is at margin under over LIBOR or its foreign currency equivalent 2017: same : the finance charge on the preference shares is at a weighted average interest rate of 3.3% 2017: 3.3% : the finance charge on the secured bonds is at a weighted average interest rate of 6.125% 2017: 6.125% : and the finance charge on the secured notes is at a weighted average interest rate of 3.23% for an average period of 27.1 years 2017: 3.23% for an average period of 28.1 years.
The above year-end amounts are not representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year, as the level of exposure changes as investments are made in fixed interest securities, long-term debt is partially redeemed and as the level of cash balances varies during the year.
In the context of the Groups balance sheet, the exposure to interest rate risk is not considered to be material.
Interest rate sensitivity Based on the Groups monetary financial instruments at each balance sheet date, an increase or decrease of 200 basis points in interest rates would decrease or increase revenue after tax by 1,040,000 2017: 1,151,000, capital return after tax by 1,215,000 2017: 1,095,000, and total profit after tax and shareholders funds by 175,000 2017: 156,000.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions.
This is not representative of the year as a whole, since the exposure changes as investments are made.
In the context of the Groups balance sheet, the outcome is not considered to be material.
Witan Investment Trust plc 81 Annual report 2018 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2018 14 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED 14.5 Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities.
Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the majority of the Groups assets are investments in quoted equities and other quoted securities that are readily realisable.
The Group has borrowed 63,174,000 by its issue in 2000 of 6.125 per cent Secured Bonds due 2025.
During 2015, the Group issued 3.47% and 3.29% secured notes for 54,000,000 and 21,000,000 respectively.
During 2017, the Group issued 2.74% secured notes for 30,000,000.
The Group is able to draw short-term borrowings of up to the sterling equivalent of 125m from its secured and committed multi-currency borrowing facility with BNP Paribas, London Branch expiring 4 December 2019.
81,000,000 was drawn down under the facility at 31 December 2018.
The figures also include the capital to be repaid.
2 The figures in the More than 5 years columns do not include the ongoing annual finance cost of 83,000.
The Board gives guidance to the investment managers as to the maximum amount of the Companys resources that should be invested in any one company.
The investment managers may hold cash from time to time but the Groups overall equity exposure is unlikely to fall below 80% in normal conditions.
14.6 Credit risk The failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Group suffering a loss.
Management of the risk The risk is managed as follows: cash at bank is held only with reputable banks with high-quality external credit ratings: transactions involving derivatives are entered into only with investment banks, the credit rating of which is taken into account so as to minimise the risk to the Group of default: investment transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers, whose credit standard is reviewed periodically by the investment managers, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker: stock lending transactions are carried out with a number of approved counterparties, the credit ratings of which are reviewed periodically, and limits are set on the amount that may be sent to any one counterparty.
Other than stock lending, none of the Companys financial assets or liabilities is secured by collateral or other credit enhancements.
None of the Groups financial assets is past its due date or impaired.
Credit risk exposure The table below summarises the credit risk exposure of the Group as at the year end.

Their fair value has therefore been deemed Level 1.
The carrying values are disclosed in note 13.

Capital management The Groups capital management objectives are: to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern: and to maximise the income and capital return to its equity shareholders through an appropriate balance of equity capital and debt.
Gearing The Groups policy is to manage the effective gearing in the portfolio to be below 20%, other than temporarily in exceptional circumstances.
Effective gearing is defined as the difference between shareholders funds and the total market value of the investments including the nominal value effective underlying exposure of futures positions which were 24,671,000 long at 31 December 2018 2017: 23,256,000 long expressed as a percentage of shareholders funds.
At 31 December 2018 effective gearingwas 11.6% 2017: 9.7% and the calculation is set out below: 2018 2017 000 000 Value of investments per the Balance Sheet 1,954,114 2,149,267 Add: Nominal exposure of futures 24,671 23,256 Adjusted gross value of investments including futures nominal exposure 1,978,785 2,172,523 Shareholders funds per the Balance Sheet A 1,773,442 1,980,521 Excess of gross value of investments over shareholder funds B 205,343 192,002 Effective gearing B as a percentage of A 11.6% 9.7% The Board monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Groups capital on an ongoing basis.
This review includes: the planned level of gearing, which takes into account the Chief Executive Officers view on the market: the opportunity to buy back equity shares, which takes account of the difference between the net asset value per share and the share price i. e. the level of share price discount or premium : and the extent to which revenue in excess of that which is required to be distributed should be retained.
The Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from the preceding accounting period.
The Company is subject to several externally imposed capital requirements: the terms of issue of the Companys secured bonds and notes require the aggregate amount outstanding in respect of borrowings, measured in accordance with the policies used to prepare the annual financial statements, not to exceed a sum equal to the Companys capital and reserves at any time see also note 13 on page 78 for details of other covenants : as a public company, the Company has a minimum issued share capital of 50,000: and in order to be able to pay dividends out of profits available for distribution by way of dividends, the Company has to be able to meet one of the two capital restriction tests imposed on investment companies by company law.
These requirements are unchanged since the previous year end and the Company has complied with them.
