22 RISK MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Companys investing activities undertaken in pursuit of its investment objective, as set out on page 10, involve certain inherent risks.
The main financial risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are market price risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, credit risk and currency risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks as summarised below.
The Board has also established a series of investment parameters, which are reviewed annually, designed to limit the risk inherent in managing a portfolio of investments.
These policies have remained substantially unchanged during the current and preceding periods.
The Board meets on seven scheduled occasions in each year and at each meeting it receives suf cient financial and statistical information to enable it to monitor adequately the investment performance and status of the business.
In addition, financial information is circulated to the directors on a monthly basis.
Market price risk Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Companys business.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
The Companys borrowings have the effect of increasing the market risk faced by shareholders.
This gearing effect is such that, for example, for a 10% movement in the valuation of the Companys investments, the net assets attributable to shareholders would move by approximately 11.1%.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk of movements in the value of financial instruments or interest income cash ows that arise as a result of uctuations in interest rates.
The Company nances its operations through retained pro ts including capital pro ts, and additional nancing is obtained through the debenture stock in issue and the two Private Placement Loans, on all of which interest is paid at a xed rate.
Liquidity risk The Companys assets comprise mainly readily realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding commitments if necessary.
Short term exibility is achieved through the use of cash balances and short term bank deposits.
