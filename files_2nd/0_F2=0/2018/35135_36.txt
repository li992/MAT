Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 239 Notes to the Company financial statements Section 6: Notes to the Company financial statements 6.1 Company basis of preparation The Company is incorporated in the UK and registered in England and Wales.
The Company financial statements of CYBG PLC, the Parent Company the Company, which should be read in conjunction with the Group Directors Report, have been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
No individual income statement or statement of comprehensive income is presented for the Company, as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis of measurement The financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention.
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
The accounting policies of the Company are the same as those of the Group which are set out in the notes to the consolidated financial statements except that the Company has no policy in respect of consolidation.
These accounting policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements.
6.2 Company investments in controlled entities Accounting policy The Companys investments in controlled entities are valued at cost or valuation less any provision for impairment.
Such investments are reviewed annually for potential evidence of impairment, or more frequently when there are indications that impairment may have occurred.
Losses relating to impairment in the value of shares in controlled entities are recognised in the income statement.
2018 2017 m m At 30 September 2,268 2,249 As disclosed in note 3.14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has entered into a Conduct Indemnity Deed with NAB.
Claims under the Conduct Indemnity Deed are made by the Company, while the provisions in respect of the qualifying conduct costs are raised and incurred by its principal trading subsidiary, Clydesdale Bank PLC.
As a consequence, the recognition and measurement basis of the Capped Indemnity in the Company differs from that of the Group.
For the Company, the substance of the indemnity agreement is that of variable consideration in relation to its investment in controlled entities.
When a claim is raised under the Capped Indemnity, the Company recognises a receivable from NAB presented within amounts due from other banks with a corresponding decrease in the cost of the Companys investments in controlled entities.
The Company does not recognise any income or expense in relation to claims under the Capped Indemnity.
It is intended that upon collection of the claim proceeds from NAB the capital impact of providing for Relevant Conduct Matters in Clydesdale Bank PLC is mitigated by the Company using the proceeds to subscribe for share capital.
During the year ended 30 September 2018 the Companys investments in controlled entities was reduced by 148m 2017: 536m in relation to Conduct Indemnity adjustments and the Company subscribed for 511m 2017: 179m of additional share capital in its controlled entities.
Where provisions for Relevant Conduct Matters are increased in respect of a reporting period, but proceeds from that claim are not received from NAB prior to the reporting date, the Company has put in place an agreement with Clydesdale Bank PLC in order to mitigate the effect of capital losses at the end of the reporting period.
Upon raising a provision for a Relevant Conduct Matter, the Company indemnifies Clydesdale Bank PLC for the Qualifying Conduct Costs excluding the Groups loss share until it subscribes for an equivalent amount of capital in Clydesdale Bank PLC.
The Company recognises a capital contribution within investments in controlled entities and a liability in amounts due to other entities in respect of these amounts.
This totalled Nil at 30 September 2018 2017: 364m.

All other amounts due from related entities are redeemable at call and therefore carrying value approximates fair value.
Debt securities in issue The fair value of subordinated debt is taken directly from quoted market prices.
The Company also holds 1m of debt investments measured at fair value, which were purchased from Clydesdale Bank PLC at 30 September 2018.
These investments are categorised as Level 3, as the valuations incorporate significant unobservable inputs.
Valuation is based on the transaction price which the Company believes is the best representation of an exit price.
The significant unobservable input is the recoverable amount which could range from 0 to 100%.
