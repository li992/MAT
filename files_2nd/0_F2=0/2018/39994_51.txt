Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 20.
Borrowings continued The carrying value of the Groups investment in junior debt issued by the securitisation entity was 19 million, which is included within trade and other receivables.
The carrying value represents the maximum exposure to losses in the unconsolidated entity, in the event that the receivables performed materially worse than anticipated.
The Group acts as servicing agent to the securitisation entity and impairment risk associated with this investment is mitigated to the extent that performance in the collection of the receivables is in line with expectations.
No impairment losses on the junior debt were recognised by the Group during the year.
The Group has no future obligation to repurchase the receivables sold to the entity, or provide other financial support and or liquidity to the entity.
In the current year, the Group sold 142 million of receivables to the securitisation entity, received less than 1 million in interest on its junior debt and received less than 1 million in fees for acting as the servicing agent for the securitisation entitys receivables.

This comprised: net assets of 327 million designated as cash flow hedges 2017: net assets of 544 million, net assets of 116 million designated as fair value hedges 2017: net assets of 148 million, net liabilities of 398 million designated as net investment hedges 2017: net liabilities of 353 million and net assets of 65 million not designated in a formal hedge relationship 2017: net assets of 131 million.
108 Sky plc Financial statements Hedge accounting classification and impact The Group designated certain interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of interest rate risk and cross-currency swaps as fair value hedges of interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk, representing 15% 2017: 16% of the total debt related derivative portfolio.
Movements in the fair value of the hedged items are taken to the income statement and are offset by movements in the fair value of the hedging instruments, to the extent that hedge accounting is achieved.
The Group designated certain fixed rate cross-currency swaps as cash flow hedges, representing 29% 2017: 31% of the total debt related derivative portfolio.
As such, the effective portion of the gain or loss on these contracts is reported as a separate component of the hedging reserve, and is then reclassified to the income statement in the same periods that the forecast transactions affect the income statement.
Cash flows on the swaps occur semi-annually up to and inclusive of the relevant bond maturity disclosed in note 20.
During the current year, losses of 64 million were removed from the hedging reserve and debited to finance costs in the income statement principally to offset the currency translation movements in the underlying hedged debt 2017: gains of 76 million.
The Group designated certain cross-currency swaps as net investment hedges, representing 38% 2017: 35% of the total debt related derivative portfolio.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are recognised directly in equity.
Gains and losses on those hedging instruments which include bonds and cross-currency swaps designated as hedges of the net investments in foreign operations are recognised in equity to the extent that the hedging relationship is effective: these amounts are as stated in the statement of comprehensive income.
Gains and losses relating to hedge ineffectiveness are recognised immediately in the income statement for the period.
Gains and losses accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
The Group designates certain forward foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges of forecast foreign currency sales and purchases.
Gains or losses are released from the hedging reserve and included in the income statement when the related hedged items are recognised in the income statement or in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability on the balance sheet, again being recognised in the income statement in the same periods as the related hedged items.
If forecast transactions are no longer expected to occur, any amounts included in the hedging reserve related to that forecast transaction would be recognised directly in the income statement.
During the current year, losses of 60 million were removed from the hedging reserve and debited to finance charges principally to offset the currency translation movements in the underlying hedged debt 2017: gains of 8 million.
Gains of 27 million were removed from the hedging reserve and credited to inventories in the balance sheet 2017: gains of 105 million and gains of 47 million were removed from the hedging reserve and credited to property, plant and equipment in the balance sheet 2017: gains of 63 million.
Losses of 3 million were removed from the hedging reserve and debited against intangibles in the balance sheet 2017: losses of 3 million.
Losses of 4 million were removed from the hedging reserve and debited against revenue in the income statement 2017: gains of less than 1 million.
Hedge effectiveness testing is performed quarterly using the dollar-offset approach.
The actual movement in the hedging items is compared with the movement in the valuation of the hypothetically perfect hedge of the underlying risk at inception, and any ineffectiveness is recognised directly in the income statement.
For fair value hedges, ineffectiveness of less than 1 million was recognised in the income statement during the current year 2017: 1 million.
For cash flow hedges, ineffectiveness of less than 1 million was recognised in the income statement during the current year 2017: less than 1 million.
For net investment hedges, ineffectiveness of nil was recognised in the income statement during the current year 2017: nil.
A hedge relationship is deemed to be effective if the ratio of changes in valuation of the underlying hedged item and the hedging instrument is within the range of 80% to 125%.
Any relationship which has a ratio outside this range is deemed to be ineffective, at which point hedge accounting is suspended.
During the year ended 30 June 2018, there was one instance in which the hedge relationship was not highly effective 2017: one instance.

Derivatives and other financial instruments continued Financial instruments a Carrying value and fair value The accounting classification of each class of the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities, together with their fair values, is as follows: Held to Derivatives Derivatives in Total Total fair maturity Availabledeemed held hedging Loans and Other carrying investments for-sale for trading relationships receivables liabilities value value m m m m m m m m At 30 June 2018 Quoted bond debt 8,125 8,125 8,584 Derivative financial instruments 58 47 105 105 Trade and other payables 3,887 3,887 3,887 Provisions 143 143 143 Obligations under finance leases and other borrowings 76 76 76 Available-for-sale investments 117 117 117 Trade and other receivables 1,031 1,031 1,031 Short-term deposits Cash and cash equivalents 1,622 1,622 1,622 At 30 June 2017 Quoted bond debt 9,111 9,111 9,701 Derivative financial instruments 122 351 473 473 3,637 3,637 3,637 Trade and other payables Provisions 160 160 160 Obligations under finance leases and other borrowings 70 70 70 Available-for-sale investments 110 110 110 Trade and other receivables 1,325 1,325 1,325 Short-term deposits 300 300 300 Cash and cash equivalents 2,200 2,200 2,200 The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows: The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities which includes our quoted bond debt, with standard terms and conditions and which are traded on active liquid markets is determined with reference to quoted market prices based on level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
The fair value of other financial assets and financial liabilities excluding derivative instruments is determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis using prices from observable current market transactions and dealer quotes for similar instruments: Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts: Interest rate and cross-currency swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates: and The fair value of obligations under finance leases and other borrowings is estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present value.
The fair value of short-term deposits and cash and cash equivalents is equivalent to carrying value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
The differences between carrying values and fair values reflect unrealised gains or losses inherent in the financial instruments, based on valuations as at 30 June 2018 and 30 June 2017.
The volatile nature of the markets means that values at any subsequent date could be significantly different from the values reported above.
Cash and cash equivalents classified as held to maturity investments comprise money market deposits which have maturity dates of less than three months from inception.
Money market deposits, enhanced return investments and tri-party repurchase agreements which have maturity greater than three months from inception are classified as short-term deposits.
Cash and cash equivalents classified as loans and receivables mainly comprise investments in AAAm rated money market funds which can be withdrawn without notice.

Level 2 Fair values measured using inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly.
Derivative financial instrument fair values are present values determined from future cash flows discounted at rates derived from market source data.
Level 3 Fair values measured using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
All of the Groups unlisted available-for-sale financial assets are held at fair value and are categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
