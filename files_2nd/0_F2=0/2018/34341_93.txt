Additional disclosures Non-GAAP measures To supplement the presentation of the Groups results of operations and financial condition in accordance with IFRS, we also present several non-GAAP measures used by management to monitor the Groups performance.
The Groups management regularly reviews the measures used to assess and present the financial performance of the Group and, as relevant, its geographic segments.
Changes to nonGAAP measures in 2018 Due to the significant impact of the acquisition of Reynolds American and other businesses in 2017 and to demonstrate the performance of the enlarged Group in 2018 with reference to 2017, several non-GAAP measures for the year ended 31 December 2017 have been presented as though the Group had owned those acquisitions from 1 January 2017.
This provides a representative basis against which the Group will assess the performance of 2018.
This is different to the 2017 measure of organic performance which seeks to remove the impact from acquisitions in the period.
Results on a representative basis seek to provide a comparator period inclusive of the acquisitions for the whole of the comparator period, including the performance of the acquisitions in the period prior to purchase.
Results on a representative basis are not deemed to be equivalent to pro forma financial information as they are derived from adjusted measures, which will exclude the adjusting items, that may arise in the context of a pro forma presentation due to the requirements of such areas as purchase price allocation adjustments to inventory, amortisation of the fair value adjustment to debt and the amortisation of trademarks.
The Group also introduced a new non-GAAP measure called Growth in Adjusted Revenue from the Strategic Portfolio.
The strategic portfolio comprises the strategic combustible brands Kent, Dunhill, Lucky Strike, Pall Mall and Rothmans previously collectively referred to as the Global Drive Brands, or GDBs, Camel US, Newport US and Natural American Spirit US and our potentially reduced-risk products portfolio, including our NGP business of THP and vapour, as well as the traditional oral and modern oral brands.
@ The Group also included free cash flow, to identify the level of cash earned before payment of items including dividends, and adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA, to assess its financial capacity and the Groups ability to meet its borrowing obligations.
Results on a representative basis Definition the performance of the business including the results of acquisitions for the whole of the immediately preceding comparator period.
The acquisitions undertaken during 2017 impact the understanding of the Groups results in 2018, as, in the year of acquisition, the results include less than a full years contribution from the acquired entities.
To supplement BATs results presented in accordance with IFRS, the Groups Management Board, as the chief operating decision maker, reviews certain of its results, including volume, revenue, profit from operations, and non-GAAP measures including adjusted revenue, adjusted revenue growth from the Strategic Portfolio and adjusted profit from operations, against the prior year as though the Group had owned the acquisitions made in 2017 for the whole of that year, and for profit from operations including an estimated 250 million of additional adjusting items related to the acquired companies, primarily related to Engle Progeny and transaction costs.
Although the Group does not believe that these measures are a substitute for IFRS measures, the Group does believe that such results provide additional useful information to investors regarding the underlying performance of the business on a comparable or representative basis.
Accordingly, the financial measures on a representative basis appearing in this document should be read in conjunction with the Groups results as reported under IFRS.
The table below reconciles the Groups revenue in 2018 to adjusted revenue at constant rates based on a re-translation of adjusted revenue in 2018 at 2017s exchange rates, and also reconciles 2017 revenue to adjusted revenue on a representative basis.

258 BAT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2018 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information Results on an organic basis Definition the performance of the business before inclusion of acquired entities.
The acquisition of Reynolds American Inc. and Winnington, and the business and certain tobacco assets of Bulgartabac, and Fabrika Duhana Sarajevo impacted the Groups results in 2017.
To supplement BATs results presented in accordance with IFRS, the Groups Management Board, as the chief operating decision maker, reviews certain of its results, including volume, revenue, profit from operations, and non-GAAP measures including adjusted revenue and adjusted profit from operations, prior to the impact of acquisitions.
Although the Group does not believe that these measures are a substitute for IFRS measures, the Group does believe that such results excluding the impact of acquisitions provide additional useful information to investors regarding the underlying performance of the business on a comparable basis.
Accordingly, the organic financial measures appearing in this document should be read in conjunction with the Groups results as reported under IFRS.
We also present the growth in organic adjusted operating margin in 2017 compared to adjusted operating margin in 2016: 2017 organic adjusted operating margin represents the ratio of profit from operations before adjusting items and the impact of 2017 acquisitions to revenue before adjusting items and the impact of 2017 acquisitions.
Please see the following reconciliations of revenue to adjusted revenue and profit from operations to adjusted profit from operations.
Adjusted revenue Definition revenue before the impact of adjusting items.
To supplement BATs revenue presented in accordance with IFRS, the Groups Management Board, as the chief operating decision maker, reviews adjusted revenue to evaluate the underlying business performance of the Group and its geographic segments.
The Groups Management Board defines adjusted revenue as revenue before the impact of adjusting items, specifically the excise on bought-in goods that the Group will acquire and sell, for a limited period, will be recorded in accordance with IFRS as a cost of sale and within revenue, with a dilutive effect on operating margin.
Once the short-term arrangements cease, the goods will be manufactured by the Group, and the excise, in accordance with Group policy, will not be included in cost of sales or revenue leading to a reduction in revenue and improvement in operating margin that does not represent the underlying performance of the Group.
As such, the excise on bought-in goods meets the Groups definition of an adjusting item, as defined in note 1 in the Notes on the Accounts.
The Groups Management Board also believes that adjusted revenue provides information that enables investors to better compare the Groups business performance across periods.
Adjusted revenue has limitations as an analytical tool.
The most directly comparable IFRS measure to adjusted revenue is revenue.
Adjusted revenue is not a presentation made in accordance with IFRS, is not a measure of financial condition or liquidity and should not be considered as an alternative to revenue as determined in accordance with IFRS.
Adjusted revenue is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
As a result, you should not consider this performance measure in isolation from, or as a substitute analysis for, BATs results as determined in accordance with IFRS.
The table below reconciles the Groups revenue to adjusted revenue for the periods presented and to adjusted revenue at constant rates based on a re-translation of adjusted revenue for each year at the previous years exchange rates.

To supplement BATs revenue presented in accordance with IFRS, the Groups Management Board, as the chief operating decision maker, reviews adjusted revenue growth from the Strategic Portfolio to evaluate the underlying business performance of the Group reflecting the focus of the Groups investment activity.
The Groups Management Board defines the growth in adjusted revenue from the Strategic Portfolio, at constant rates of exchange, as revenue before the impact of adjusting items and translated to the Groups reporting currency at the prior periods prevailing exchange rate, derived from the Groups Strategic Combustible portfolio Kent, Dunhill, Lucky Strike, Pall Mall, Rothmans, Camel US, Newport US, Natural American Spirit US and the potentially reduced-risk products portfolio, being vapour, THP, modern oral and traditional oral categories.
The Groups Management Board also believes that the adjusted revenue growth from the Strategic Portfolio at constant rates of exchange provides information that enables investors to better compare the Groups business performance across periods and by reference to the Groups investment activity.
Adjusted revenue growth from the Strategic Portfolio has limitations as an analytical tool.
The most directly comparable IFRS measure to adjusted revenue growth from the Strategic Portfolio is revenue.
Adjusted revenue growth from the Strategic Portfolio at constant rates of exchange is not a presentation made in accordance with IFRS, is not a measure of financial condition or liquidity and should not be considered as an alternative to revenue as determined in accordance with IFRS.
Adjusted revenue growth from the Stratetgic Portfolio is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
This metric was introduced for the period commencing 1 January 2018.
Comparative data for 2017 has been provided to determine the growth in 2018.
No comparator data is provided for the periods prior to 2017.
260 BAT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2018 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information Adjusted profit from operations and adjusted operating margin Definition profit from operations before the impact of adjusting items and adjusted profit from operations as a percentage of adjusted revenue.
To supplement BATs results from operations presented in accordance with IFRS, the Groups Management Board, as the chief operating decision maker, reviews adjusted profit from operations to evaluate the underlying business performance of the Group and its geographic segments, to allocate resources to the overall business and to communicate financial performance to investors.
The Group also presents adjusted operating margin, which is defined as adjusted profit from operations as a percentage of adjusted revenue, as defined previously.
Adjusted profit from operations and adjusted operating margin are not measures defined by IFRS.
The most directly comparable IFRS measure to adjusted profit from operations is profit from operations.
Adjusting items, as identified in accordance with the Groups accounting policies, represent certain items of income and expense which the Group considers distinctive based on their size, nature or incidence.
In identifying and quantifying adjusting items, the Group consistently applies a policy that defines criteria that are required to be met for an item to be classified as adjusting and provides details of items that are specifically excluded from being classified as adjusting items.
Adjusting items in profit from operations include restructuring and integration costs, amortisation of trademarks and similar intangibles, the fair value movement in stock on acquisition, a gain on deemed partial disposal of a trademark and certain litigation.
The definition of adjusting items is explained in note 1 in the Notes on the Accounts.
The Groups Management Board believes that these additional measures are useful to investors and are used by the Group management board as described above, because they exclude the impact of adjusting items in profit from operations, which have less bearing on the routine operating activities of the Group, thereby enhancing users understanding of underlying business performance.
The Groups Management Board also believes that adjusted profit from operations provides information that enables investors to better compare the Groups business performance across periods.
Additionally, the Groups Management Board believes that similar measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies comparable to the Group, many of which present an adjusted operating profitrelated performance measure when reporting their results.
Adjusted profit from operations and adjusted operating margin have limitations as analytical tools.
They are not presentations made in accordance with IFRS, are not measures of financial condition or liquidity and should not be considered as alternatives to profit for the year, profit from operations or operating margin as determined in accordance with IFRS.
Adjusted profit from operations and adjusted operating margin are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
As a result, you should not consider these performance measures in isolation from, or as a substitute analysis for, BATs results of operations as determined in accordance with IFRS.

To supplement BATs performance presented in accordance with IFRS, the Groups share of post-tax results of associates and joint ventures is also presented before adjusting items as defined in note 1 in the Notes on the Accounts.
The Groups Management Board believes that adjusted share of post-tax results of associates and joint ventures provides information that enables investors to better compare the Groups business performance across periods.
The Groups Management Board uses adjusted share of post-tax results from associates and joint ventures as part of the total assessment of the underlying performance of all the Groups business interests.
Adjusted share of post-tax results of associates and joint ventures has limitations as an analytical tool.
It is not a presentation made in accordance with IFRS, is not a measure of financial condition or liquidity and should not be considered as an alternative to the Groups share of post-tax results of associates and joint ventures as determined in accordance with IFRS.
Adjusted share of post-tax results of associates and joint ventures is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
As a result, you should not consider this performance measure in isolation from, or as a substitute analysis for, BATs results of operations as determined in accordance with IFRS.
The most directly comparable IFRS measure to adjusted share of post-tax results of associates and joint ventures is share of post-tax results of associates and joint ventures.
A reconciliation is provided on page 142 within note 5 in the Notes on the Accounts.
Underlying tax rate Definition Tax rate incurred before the impact of adjusting items and to adjust for the inclusion of the Groups share of posttax results of associates and joint ventures within the Groups pretax results.
BAT management monitors the Groups underlying tax rate to assess the tax rate applicable to the Groups underlying operations, excluding the Groups share of post-tax results of associates and joint ventures in BATs pre-tax results and adjusting items as defined in note 1 in the Notes on the Accounts.
Underlying tax rate is not a measure defined by IFRS.
The most directly comparable IFRS measure to underlying tax rate is the effective tax rate based upon profit before tax.
The Groups Management Board believes that this additional measure is useful to investors, and is used by BAT management as described above, because it excludes the contribution from the Groups associates, recognised after tax but within the Groups pre-tax profits, and adjusting items, thereby enhancing users understanding of underlying business performance.
Underlying tax rate has limitations as an analytical tool.

BAT management monitors adjusted diluted earnings per share, a measure which removes the impact of adjusting items, as defined in note 1 in the Notes on the Accounts, from diluted earnings per share.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share is used by management within the Groups incentive schemes, as reported within the remuneration report beginning on page 73 and reported in note 7 in the Notes on the Accounts.
The Groups Management Board believes that this additional measure is useful to investors, and is used by BAT management as described above, as an indicator of diluted earnings per share before adjusting items.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be used in isolation from, or as a substitute for, diluted earnings per share as determined in accordance with IFRS.

262 BAT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2018 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information Results on a constant translational currency basis Movements in foreign exchange rates have impacted the Groups financial results.
The Groups Management Board reviews certain of its results, including adjusted revenue, adjusted revenue growth from the strategic portfolio, adjusted profit from operations, adjusted diluted earnings per @ share and adjusted cash generated from operations, at constant rates of exchange.
The Group calculates these financial measures at constant rates of exchange based on a re-translation, at prior year exchange rates, of the current years results of the Group and, where applicable, its geographic segments.
The Group does not adjust for the normal transactional gains and losses in profit from operations that are generated by exchange movements.
Although the Group does not believe that these measures are a substitute for IFRS measures, the Groups Management Board does believe that such results excluding the impact of currency fluctuations year-on-year provide additional useful information to investors regarding the Groups operating performance on a local currency basis.
Accordingly, the constant rates of exchange financial measures appearing in the discussion of the Group results of operations beginning on page 33 should be read in conjunction with the information provided in note2 in the Notes on the Accounts.
In 2018, 2017 and 2016, results were affected by translational exchange rate movements.
In 2018, at the prevailing exchange rates, adjusted revenue increased by 25.9%, adjusted revenue growth from the strategic portfolio increased by 48.6%, adjusted profit from operations increased @ by 30.5% and adjusted cash generated from operations increased by 146% versus 2017.
At constant rates of exchange, adjusted revenue would have increased by 33.4%, adjusted revenue growth from the strategic portfolio would have increased by 56.1%, adjusted profit from @ operations would have increased by 37.8% and adjusted cash generated from operations would have increased by 158%.
This lower growth rate at prevailing exchange rates reflects the negative translational impact as a result on the relative strengthening of the pound sterling.
In 2017, at the prevailing exchange rates, adjusted revenue increased by 36.6%, adjusted profit from operations increased by 44.7% and adjusted cash @ generated from operations increased by 5.4% versus 2016.
At constant rates of exchange, adjusted revenue would have increased by 31.7%, @ adjusted profit from operations would have increased by 38.8% and adjusted cash generated from operations would have grown by 0.3%.
This higher growth rate at prevailing exchange rates reflects the translational benefitasa result of the relative weakness of the pound sterling.
In 2018, 2017 and 2016, adjusted diluted earnings per share was affected by translational exchange rate movements.
In 2018, the adjusted diluted earnings per share of 296.7p, an increase of 5.2%, would, when translated at 2017 exchange rates, have been 315.5p, an increase of 11.8%.
This lower growth rate, in 2018, at prevailing exchange rates, reflects the negative translational impact as a result of the relative strength of the pound sterling.
In 2017, the adjusted diluted earnings per share of 282.1p, an increase of 14.0%, would, when translated at 2016 exchange rates, have been 269.9p, an increase of 9.1%.
This higher growth rate, in 2017, at prevailing exchange rates, reflects the translational benefit as a result of the relative weakness of the pound sterling.
In 2016, adjusted diluted earnings per share of 247.5p, an increase of 18.8%, would, when translated at 2015 exchange rates, have been 230.0p, an increase of 10.4%.
This higher growth rate, in 2016, at prevailing exchange rates reflects the translational benefit as a result of the relative weakness of the pound sterling.
Operating cash flow conversion ratio Definition net cash generated from operating activities before the impact of adjusting items and dividends from associates and excluding trading loans to third parties, pension short fall funding, taxes paid and net capital expenditure, as a proportion of adjusted profit from operations.
@ Operating cash flow conversion ratio is a measure of operating cash flow which is used within the Groups incentive schemes as reported within the remuneration report beginning on page 73.
Operating cash flow conversion ratio has limitations as an analytical tool.
It is not a presentation made in accordance with IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to measures of liquidity or financial position as determined in accordance with IFRS.
Operating cash flow conversion ratio is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
As a result, you should not consider this measure in isolation from, or as a substitute analysis for, the Groups results of operations or cash flows as determined in accordance with IFRS.

@ To supplement the Groups presentation of net cash generated from operating activities, BAT also presents adjusted cash generated from operations.
Adjusted cash generated from operations is a measure of cash flow which is used by management to monitor the Groups financial position and is used within the Groups incentive schemes as reported within the remuneration report beginning on page 73.
The most directly comparable IFRS measure to adjusted cash generated from operations is net cash generated from operating activities.
The Groups Management Board believes that this additional measure is useful to investors and is used by BAT management as described above, because it excludes the impact of adjusting items on cash, includes the impact of capital expenditure given this is a core component of the underlying performance of the Group and excludes the impact of financing or dividends received from associates which do not form part of the underlying performance of the Groups day-to-day operations.
This measure is presented as it enhances users understanding of underlying business performance.
Adjusted cash generated from operations is not a measure defined by IFRS and has limitations as an analytical tool.
It is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
As a result, you should not consider this measures in isolation from, or as a substitute analysis for, the Groups liquidity or measures of financial position as determined in accordance with IFRS.
