The financial performance of the Group is presented using a variety of alternative performance measures.
These measures are not defined by IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable with similarly titled alternative performance measures used elsewhere.
These measures should be considered in addition to, and are not intended to be a substitute for, IFRS measures.
Adjusted results In order to provide a measure of underlying performance, management has chosen to present adjusted results for the year which exclude items that may distort comparability.
Such items arise from events or transactions that fall within the ordinary activities of the Group but which management believes should be separately identified to help explain underlying performance.
The adjusted results are also those used by management to monitor performance and run the business.
A reconciliation of adjusted results to the closest equivalent statutory measure is provided in the tables above for the current and prior years.
Like-for-like Like-for-like content revenue and programming costs exclude the one-off sale of the Rio Olympic rights in 2016 17 in Italy.

Constant currency exchange rates are the average actual exchange rates of the current financial year and are used to eliminate the effects of exchange rate fluctuations in assessing performance.
Actual exchange rates are the average actual periodic rates for that financial year.
The constant currency exchange rate used for the current year is 1.13:1 2017: 1.16:1.
A reconciliation of the adjusted measures at constant currency to the adjusted measures at actual exchange rates is provided below.
