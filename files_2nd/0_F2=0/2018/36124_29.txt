The charge increased both cash outflows in the year and the net debt balance in Construction at the year end.
Our provisioning for the loss on this project reflects our current estimate of the final costs, and is reduced by an estimate of our share of significant claims against the client and others, which are yet to be agreed and concluded.
This inherent uncertainty will be resolved only when the project is complete and the claims finally settled.

Accordingly, the Groups profits for the financial year to 30 June 2018 are taxed at a standard rate of 19.0%: and for the period to 30 June 2017 were taxed at a blended standard rate of 19.75%.
The UK corporation tax rate is due to be reduced to 17% in April 2020.
We have recognised deferred tax at 19% as it is likely that most assets and liabilities will have reversed within two years.
Had the 17% rate been applied to those balances that may reverse post April 2020 then the effect on the deferred tax balances would not have been significant.

100 Galliford Try plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 9 Earnings Per Share EPS Basic and diluted EPS Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding those held by the Trust, which are treated as cancelled.
The weighted average number of shares used for 2017 in the calculation of earnings per share information shown in the table below has been restated by adjusting those previously reported by an adjusting factor of 0.11147 to reflect the bonus element in the shares issued under the rights issue which completed on 16 April 2018.
Under normal circumstances, the average number of shares is diluted by reference to the average number of potential ordinary shares held under option in the year.
The dilutive effect amounts to the number of ordinary shares which would be purchased using the aggregate difference in value between the market value of shares and the share option price.
Only shares that have met their cumulative performance criteria are included in the dilution calculation.
The Group has two classes of potentially dilutive ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year and the contingently issuable shares under the Groups long-term incentive plans.
A loss per share cannot be reduced through dilution, hence this dilution is only applied where the Group has reported a profit.
The earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below.

102 Galliford Try plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 11 Goodwill continued Goodwill is allocated to the Groups CGUs identified according to business segment.
The goodwill is attributable to the following business segments: 2018 2017 m m Linden Homes 52.5 52.5 Partnerships & Regeneration 29.9 30.6 Building 40.0 40.0 Infrastructure 37.2 37.2 159.6 160.3 Impairment review of goodwill and key assumptions Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value in use calculations.
These calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on future financial budgets approved by the Board, based on past performance and its expectation of market developments.
The key assumptions within these budgets relate to revenue and the future profit margin achievable, in line with our strategy as set out in the Strategic Report.
Future budgeted revenue is based on managements knowledge of actual results from prior years and latest forecasts for the current year, along with the existing secured works, managements expectation of the future level of work available within the market sector and expected changes in selling volumes and prices for completed houses.
In establishing future profit margins, the margins currently being achieved are considered in conjunction with expected inflation rates in each cost category and the current market value of land being acquired.
Cash is monitored very closely on a daily, weekly and monthly basis for the purposes of managing both treasury and the business as a whole.
Details of the Groups treasury management are included within the Financial review in the Strategic Report.
The assumptions used are reviewed regularly and differences between forecast and actual results are closely monitored with variances being investigated fully.
The knowledge gained from this past experience is used to ensure that the future assumptions used are consistent with past actual outcomes and are managements best estimate of the future cash flows of each business unit.
Cash flows beyond the budgeted three-year period are extrapolated using an estimated growth rate of 2% per annum within each segment.
The growth rate used is the Groups estimate of the average long-term growth rate for the market sectors in which the CGU operates.
A pre-tax discount rate of 11.4% 2017: 11.5% in Linden Homes, 8.6% 2017: 8.5% in Partnerships & Regeneration, 9.0% 2017: 8.8% in Building and 8.5% 2017: 8.8% in Infrastructure has been applied to the future cash flows, based on an estimate of the weighted average cost of capital of each division.
Sensitivities The recoverable value of all CGUs are substantially in excess of the carrying value of goodwill.
Sensitivity analysis has been undertaken on each goodwill impairment review, by changing the discount rates, profit margins, growth rates and other variables applicable to each CGU.
Taking into account current market conditions within the construction and housebuilding markets, none of these sensitivities, either individually or combined, resulted in the recoverable amount of the goodwill being reduced to below its current carrying value.
The detailed sensitivity analysis indicates that an increase of more than 200% 2017: 108% in the pre-tax discount rate or a reduction of 24% 2017: 64% in the forecast operating cash flows of the Infrastructure CGU could give rise to an impairment.
The goodwill in the other segments is less sensitive to the detailed assumptions used and hence no additional disclosure is considered necessary.
Fixed assets included 0.2m net book value, and 0.4m depreciation, for assets held under finance leases 2017: 0.6m and 0.3m, respectively.
The Company has no property, plant or equipment.

Provisions for amounts due from joint venture undertakings are set out in note 14.
The other classes within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the book value of each class of receivable mentioned above, along with the Groups investment in shared equity receivables note 15 and its cash and cash equivalents.
The Group does not hold any collateral as security.
Management believes that the concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited due to the Groups customer base being large and unrelated.
Major water industry customers accounted for in total 4% 2017: 4% of Group revenue in the year.
However, the customers involved comprise a variety of entities including those both in the public and commercial sectors.
In addition, within the commercial sector each customer has an unrelated ultimate parent company.

The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
The Group and Company operate within financial risk policies and procedures approved by the Board.
It is, and has been throughout the year, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and investment of excess liquidity.
The Groups and Companys financial instruments principally comprise bank borrowings, cash and cash equivalents, receivables and payables, PPP and other investments and interest rate swaps that arise directly from its operations and its acquisitions.
Capital risk management The Group is funded by ordinary shares, retained profits and a single bank facility.
The Groups and Companys objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern, in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
The capital requirements of the Groups divisions differ, with housebuilding including Linden Homes and the mixed-tenure developments of Partnerships & Regeneration typically requiring debt and construction typically being cash generative, and the economic cycle of each business is also different.
The Group manages its capital taking these differing requirements into account.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group and Company may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
In 2017, the Group completed a debt private placement of 100m 10-year Sterling notes to supplement its bank facilities, following a review of its future capital requirements undertaken in the context of the Groups strategy to 2021, and the Group is continuing to target period-end gearing of no more than 30%.
Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total equity.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings including current and non-current borrowings as shown in the consolidated balance sheet less cash and cash equivalents.
The Group held net cash at 30 June 2018 and 30 June 2017 and therefore had gearing of nil%.
The Group also has capital requirements in the covenants in its bank facilities, as set out later in this note.
The Group has complied with all bank covenants during the year.
Financial risk factors a Market risk i Foreign exchange risk All material activities of the Group take place within the UK and consequently there is little direct exchange risk other than payments to overseas suppliers who require settlement in their currency.
If there is any material foreign exchange exposure, the Groups policy is to enter into forward foreign currency contracts.
The Group and Company had no material currency exposure at 30 June 2018 2017: nil.
ii Price risk The Group is affected by the level of UK house prices.
These are in turn affected by factors such as mortgage availability, employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence and availability of land with planning.
While it is not possible to fully mitigate such risks the Group continues to monitor its geographical spread within the UK concentrating its operations in areas that management believes minimise the effect of local microeconomic fluctuations.
As at 30 June 2018, the Groups house price linked financial instruments consisted entirely of shared equity receivables held as available for sale financial assets and the sensitivity to house price inflation and discount rates was not significant.
The concentration of the financial risk lies within price risk as a result of these financial instruments being linked to house prices.
The Group has no quoted investments that are exposed to equity securities price risk.
The Group and Company are not exposed to commodity price risk.
Our business Strategic review Business review Governance Financial information Annual Report and 113 Financial Statements 2018 26 Financial instruments continued Financial risk factors continued a Market risk continued iii Interest rate risk The Groups income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
The Groups interest rate risk arises from movement in cash and cash equivalents and long-term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The Groups policy is to accept a degree of interest rate risk as long as the effect of various changes in rates remains within prescribed ranges.
Details of the interest rate swaps entered into by the Group are set out below.
The Group analyses its interest rate exposure on a dynamic basis.
On a regular basis the Group calculates the impact on the income statement of a defined interest rate shift on the Groups borrowing position.
Based on the forecasts performed, the impact on post tax profit and equity of a 1% decrease or increase in interest rates for a year would be a maximum increase of 0.9m 2017: 0.9m or decrease of 1.2m 2017: 1.2m, respectively.
b Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a Group basis.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments, deposits and borrowings with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables including shared equity receivables and committed transactions.
The Group has a credit risk exposure to the providers of its banking facilities.
These are primarily provided by HSBC Bank plc, Santander UK plc, National Westminster Bank plc and Barclays Bank plc, being four of the UKs leading financial institutions.
Further details of credit risk relating to trade and other receivables are disclosed in note 19.
No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period, and management does not expect any material losses from non-performance of any counterparties, including in respect of receivables not yet due.
c Liquidity risk Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities and the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Group treasury maintains flexibility in funding by maintaining availability under committed credit lines.
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
The contracting operations of the Group generally generate cash.
The housebuilding operations, however, utilise cash and any future downturn in the housebuilding market may require additional borrowings, in addition to retained earnings, to finance the maintenance of the landbank and associated work in progress.
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups liquidity reserve, which comprises undrawn borrowing facilities see below and cash and cash equivalents note 20 on the basis of expected cash flow.
This is generally carried out at local level in the operating companies of the Group, in accordance with practices and limits set by the Group.
These limits vary by location to take into account the liquidity of the market in which the entity operates.
On a daily basis throughout the year, the bank balances or borrowings in all the Groups operating companies are aggregated into a total cash or borrowings figure, in order that the Group can obtain the most advantageous interest rate.
In accordance with IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement, the Group has reviewed all contracts for embedded derivatives that are required to be separately accounted for if they do not meet certain requirements set out in the standard.
No such embedded derivatives have been identified.
Financial liabilities derivative financial liabilities The fair value of interest rate swaps is detailed below: 2018 2017 Group and Company m m At 30 June Non-current liabilities 0.9 2.0 During the year ended 30 June 2015 the Group entered into a five-year interest rate swap contract that expires in February 2020.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap contract at 30 June 2018 was 100m 2017: 100m and the fixed interest rate is 1.4% 2017: 1.4%.
This swap is designated as a cash flow hedge and changes in fair value are recognised directly in reserves.
A profit of 1.1m 2017: 2.5m was recognised in other comprehensive income in the year.
Gains and losses recognised in reserves will be released to the income statement within finance costs over the period to maturity of the contract, and a loss of 0.8m 2017: 0.7m was recognised in the current year.

Borrowing facilities The Group had the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities available at 30 June: 2018 2017 Floating rate Floating rate m m Expiring: In more than two years 342.4 342.4 342.4 342.4 In February 2014 the Group agreed a five-year 400m unsecured revolving credit facility with HSBC Bank plc, Santander UK plc, Barclays Bank plc and The Royal Bank of Scotland plc.
In February 2015, the Group agreed a one-year extension on the facility, to 2020, and in March 2016 agreed an increase in the facility to 450m.
In December 2016, the Group agreed a further two-year extension to February 2022.
The facility provides long-term finance and bonding facilities and is subject to covenants over interest cover, gearing adjusted to take account of development land payables and minimum consolidated tangible net assets.
Interest is calculated by aggregating margin, LIBOR and relevant costs.
In February 2017 the Group completed a debt private placement of 100m 10 year Sterling notes, maturing in February 2027.
Our business Strategic review Business review Governance Financial information Annual Report and 115 Financial Statements 2018 26 Financial instruments continued Fair value estimation Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments are defined as: Level 1 Quoted market prices or dealer quotes in active markets for similar instruments.
Level 2 The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows, based on observable yield curves.
Level 3 Other techniques, such as discounted cash flow analysis, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments.
The fair value of other investments is set out in note 15.

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market for example, over-the-counter derivatives is determined by using valuation techniques.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.
If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2.
If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.
The Companys only liabilities that are measured at fair value are derivatives used for hedging.
In the table above, the derivatives used for hedging are fully attributable to the Company.
Fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs Level 3 30 June 2018 30 June 2017 Opening balance 0.7 0.7 Closing balance 0.7 0.7 The key assumptions used in Level 3 valuations include future house price movements, the expected timing of receipts, credit risk and discount rates.
The typical repayment period is 10-15 years and the timing of receipts is based on historical data.
The discount rate of 5.5% and future house price movements used to compute the fair value typically 2.5% are based on local market conditions.
The sensitivity to house price inflation and discount rates is set out earlier in this note.
If receipts were to occur earlier than expected, the fair value would increase.
The total impact in the period of Level 3, taken to the income statements, is a net charge of nil 30 June 2017: nil in cost of sales and nil 30 June 2017: nil in finance income.

On 14 February 2018, the Company announced that it was to undertake a rights issue.
The basis of the rights issue was 1 new ordinary share of 50p each for every 3 ordinary shares of 50p each.
The issue price per new ordinary share was 5.68.
The rights issue was completed on 16 April 2018 with gross proceeds of 157.6m and associated costs of 7.6m.
Ordinarily the excess of the net proceeds over the nominal value of the share capital would be credited to a non-distributable share premium account.
However, the rights issue was effected through a structure which resulted in the excess of the net proceeds over the nominal value of the share capital being recognised within retained earnings under section 612 of the Companies Act 2006.
At 30 June 2018 the total number of shares outstanding under the SAYE share option scheme was 1,416,686 2017: 1,368,887 and under the LTIPs was 994,630 2017: 824,024 as detailed below.
28 Share-based payments The Company operates performance-related share incentive plans for executives, details of which are set out in the Directors Remuneration Report.
The Company also operates sharesave schemes.
The total charge for the year relating to employee share-based payment plans was 2.8m 2017: 1.8m, all of which related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
After deferred tax, the total charge was 2.5m 2017: 1.8m.
Savings related share options The Company operates an HMRC approved sharesave scheme under which employees are granted an option to purchase ordinary shares in the Company at up to 20% less than the market price at grant, in either three or five years time, dependent on their entering into a contract to make monthly contributions into a savings account over the relevant period.
These funds are used to fund the option exercise.
This scheme is open to all employees meeting the minimum employment period.
No performance criteria are applied to the exercise of sharesave options.
The options were valued using the binomial option-pricing model.
Our business Strategic review Business review Governance Financial information Annual Report and 117 Financial Statements 2018 28 Share-based payments continued Savings-related share options continued The expected volatility is based on historical volatility in the movement in the share price over the last three or five years up to the date of grant depending on the option life.
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk free rate is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.

31 Retirement benefit obligations All employees are entitled to join the Galliford Try Pension Scheme, a defined contribution scheme established as a stakeholder plan, with a company contribution based on a scale dependent on the employees age and the amount they choose to contribute.
Since 1 July 2013 all non-participating and newly employed staff have been auto-enrolled into the separate stakeholder plan and are entitled to increase their contribution rates in line with existing members.
Since 1 April 2009, the Group has operated a pension salary sacrifice scheme which means that all employee pension contributions are paid as employer contributions on their behalf.
The Group also operates three defined benefit pension schemes, as detailed below.
Pension costs for the schemes were as follows: 2018 2017 m m Defined benefit schemes expense recognised in the income statement 0.6 0.3 Defined contribution schemes 18.7 16.3 Total included within employee benefit expenses note 4 19.3 16.6 Of the total charge for all schemes 8.5m 2017: 7.4m and 10.8m 2017: 9.2m were included, respectively, within cost of sales and administrative expenses.
nil 2017: nil was included within net finance costs.
Our business Strategic review Business review Governance Financial information Annual Report and 119 Financial Statements 2018 31 Retirement benefit obligations continued Defined benefit schemes The Group operates three defined benefit pension schemes under the UK regulatory framework that pay out pensions at retirement based on service and final pay, each with assets held in separate trustee administered funds: the Galliford Try Final Salary Pension Scheme, the Galliford Group Special Scheme and the Kendall Cross Holdings Ltd Assurance & Pension Scheme.
The financial statements include all three of these arrangements.
The Groups principal funded pension scheme is the Galliford Try Final Salary Pension Scheme which was closed to all future service accrual on 31 March 2007.
The Trustees of each scheme are required to act in the best interests of the plans beneficiaries and are responsible for the investment strategy of the Scheme.
For the Galliford Try Final Salary Pension Scheme the Trustee is Galliford Try Pension Trustee Limited.
The appointment of the directors to the Board is determined by the plans Trust documentation.
Currently the Trustee Board includes member-nominated, Company-nominated and independent directors.
The Group is ultimately responsible for making up any shortfall in the Scheme over a period agreed with the Trustees.
To the extent that actual experience is different to that assumed, the contributions required by the Group could vary in the future.
The two key risks face by pension schemes are longevity ie members living longer than expected and investment risk ie the Schemes assets perform poorly relative to the liabilities.
An independent actuary performs detailed triennial valuations together with periodic interim reviews.
The most recent completed formal actuarial valuation for the Galliford Try Final Salary Pension Scheme was as at 30 June 2015 and was prepared by LCP the scheme actuary.
In June 2016 the Galliford Try Final Salary Pension Scheme completed a 95m insurance buy-in transaction.
The IAS 19 accounting result for the Galliford Try Final Salary Pension Scheme has been calculated using a roll forward approach based on the liabilities calculated for the 30 June 2015 actuarial valuation, and incorporates the insurance buy-in referred to above.
The deficit recovery funding plan agreed with the Trustees in 2016 requires the Company to pay contributions of 389,583 per calendar month until January 2021, with potential additional payments being linked to dividend payments of the Company.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Galliford Group Special Scheme was prepared using the defined accrued benefit method as at 1 April 2016.
No further contributions are expected to be required for this Scheme and options for an insurance buy-in or buy-out transactions are currently being evaluated.
The Kendall Cross Holdings Limited Scheme is funded and provides benefits based on final pensionable salaries.
The Scheme was closed to new members and to future accrual for existing members prior to the date of the acquisition by Galliford Try plc in November 2007.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Scheme was prepared as at 13 November 2014.
A deficit recovery funding plan was agreed with the Trustees which requires the Company to pay contributions of 15,300 per month.
Principal assumptions The valuations of the Groups pension schemes have been updated to 30 June 2018 and all three schemes are consolidated for disclosure purposes below.
The principal actuarial assumptions used in the calculation of the disclosure items are as follows: 2018 2017 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries n a n a Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.00% 3.10% Discount rate 2.70% 2.65% Retail price inflation 3.15% 3.25% Consumer price inflation 2.15% 2.25% The life expectancies as at 30 June 2018 are based on S2NA tables 90% scaling factor applied for males with a future improvement in mortality assumptions in line with CMI 2017 tables with a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25%.
For 2017 they are based on S2NA tables 90% scaling factor applied for males with a future improvement in mortality assumptions in line with CMI 2016 tables with a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25%.
2018 2017 Male member age 65 current life expectancy 23.0 23.1 Male member age 45 life expectancy at age 65 24.3 24.5 Female member age 65 current life expectancy 24.9 25.0 Female member age 45 life expectancy at age 65 26.4 26.5 At 1 July 2015, the date of the last valuation, the scheme had 1,317 deferred members and 849 pensioners.
120 Galliford Try plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 31 Retirement benefit obligations continued Assets in the Scheme The fair value of the assets and present value of the obligations at 30 June of the Groups defined benefit arrangements are as follows: 2018 2017 Value Value m m 1 Equities 35.8 15% 40.9 17% 1 Gilts 10.0 4% 9.3 4% 1 Bonds 20.4 9% 1.4 1% 1 Diversified growth funds 42.3 18% 44.4 18% 1 Liability driven investments 44.0 19% 38.1 16% Cash 1.6 1% 20.3 8% 2 Unquoted insured annuities 81.5 34% 88.5 36% 235.6 100% 242.9 100% Present value of defined benefit obligations 228.6 246.1 Surplus deficit in scheme recognised as non-current asset liability 7.0 3.2 1 Equities, gilts, bonds and the diversified growth funds are quoted assets.
The asset classes are intended to minimise the volatility of the funding position.
2 Unquoted insured annuities include 80.5m in respect of the pensioner buy-in transaction completed by the Galliford Try Final Salary Pension Scheme in June 2016, and other annuities held by the Kendall Cross Holdings Ltd Assurance & Pension Scheme.
If the return on plan assets is below the discount rate, all else being equal, there will be an increase in the deficit.
This risk is partially managed by holding a diversified asset portfolio, including liability matching assets and a Liability Driven Investment LDI fund.
The risk is also mitigated by the holding of bulk annuity policies in respect of the Galliford Try Final Salary Pension Scheme and the Kendall Cross Holdings Limited Scheme, which provide a perfectly matching asset in respect of the members covered by the policies.
Sensitivity analysis of scheme liabilities The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligations at 30 June 2018 was 18 years.
The sensitivity of the present value of scheme liabilities at 30 June 2018 to changes in the principal assumptions is set out below.
1 Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities Discount rate Increase by 0.1% Decrease by 4.0m Rate of inflation Increase by 0.1% Increase by 3.2m Growth rate in pension payments Increase by 0.1% Increase by 1.7m Life expectancy Increase by one year Increase by 6.7m 1 Based on change in assumption while holding all other assumptions constant, which in practice may be unlikely as assumptions may be correlated.

Galliford Try plc, together with certain of its subsidiaries, has entered into non-cancellable contracts for the operational leasing of land and buildings and plant and machinery.
The leases have various terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights.
The leases do not impose restrictions on the Groups ability to pay dividends or obtain other financing.
The minimum commitments for payments under these contracts are as follows: 2018 2017 m m Amounts due: Within one year 15.4 15.5 Later than one year and less than five years 24.9 26.2 After five years 9.4 5.8 49.7 47.5 The Company, together with certain of its subsidiaries, has entered into arrangements with HSBC Bank plc, National Westminster Bank plc, Santander UK plc and Barclays Bank plc to guarantee the borrowings of Group companies.

Disputes arise in the normal course of business, some of which lead to litigation or arbitration procedures.
The directors record the appropriate liability in the financial statements when they believe a liability exists.
While the outcome of disputes and arbitration is never certain, the directors believe that the resolution of all existing actions will not have a material adverse effect on the Groups financial position.

36 Alternative performance measures Throughout the Annual Report, the Group has presented financial performance measures which are used to manage the Groups performance.
These financial performance measures are chosen to provide a balanced view of the Groups operations and are considered useful to investors as they provide relevant information on the Groups performance.
They are also aligned to measures used internally to assess business performance in the Groups budgeting process and when determining compensation.
An explanation of the Groups financial performance measures and appropriate reconciliations to its statutory measures are provided below.
Exceptional items are the causes of the differences between the pre-exceptional and statutory profitability.
Additionally, Revenue includes the Groups share of revenue in joint ventures and associates.
Providing clarity on the Groups alternative performance measures The Group has included this note and the enclosed explanations and reconciliations with the aim of providing transparency and clarity on the measures adopted internally to assess performance following the issuance of the Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures APMs by the European Securities and Markets Authorities ESMA in June 2015.
Throughout this report the Group has presented financial performance measures which are considered most relevant to the Group and are used to manage the Groups performance.
These measures are chosen to provide a balanced view of the Groups operations and are considered useful to investors as these measures provide relevant information on the Groups performance.
The APMs adopted by the Group are also commonly used in the sectors it operates in.
The Board believes that disclosing these performance measures enhances investors ability to evaluate and assess the underlying financial performance of the Groups operations and the related key business drivers.
These financial performance measures are also aligned to measures used internally to assess business performance in the Groups budgeting process and when determining compensation.
Measuring the Groups performance The following measures are referred to in this report: Statutory measures Statutory measures are derived from the Groups reported financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and in line with the Groups accounting policies, which can be found on pages 87 to 92.
The Groups statutory measures take into account all of the factors, including exceptional items which do not reflect the ongoing underlying performance of the Group.
Alternative performance measures In assessing its performance, the Group has adopted certain non-statutory measures that more appropriately reflect the underlying performance of the Group.
These typically cannot be directly extracted from its financial statements but are reconciled to statutory measures below: a Pre-exceptional performance The Group adjusts for certain material one-off exceptional items which the Board believes assist in understanding the performance achieved by the Group.
These items include: gains and losses on the disposal of businesses and investments, unless this is part of a programme of releasing value from the disposal of similar businesses or investments such as PPP and other investments: costs of restructuring and reorganisation of businesses: acquisition costs related to business combinations: material one-off losses on contracts: and impairment and amortisation charges on intangible assets arising on business combinations amortisation of acquired intangible assets.
124 Galliford Try plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 36 Alternative performance measures continued b Revenue including the share of joint ventures revenue The Group uses a revenue measure which includes its share of revenue generated from its joint ventures to ensure it reflects the total level of activity performed by the Group during the year, regardless of the form of legal entity that undertakes that activity.
This measure better reflects the size of the business and the volume of work carried out and more appropriately compares to profit from operations.
This differs from the statutory measure of revenue which presents Group revenue from its subsidiaries only.
A reconciliation of the statutory measure to the Groups performance measure is shown below: Construction Linden Partnerships & PPP Homes Regeneration Building Infrastructure Total Investments Central Total m m m m m m m m Year ended 30 June 2018 Statutory Group revenue 769.3 459.7 1,036.9 649.4 1,686.3 15.6 0.7 2,931.6 add: exceptional items note 3 add: share of joint ventures revenue note 13 178.0 15.5 1.1 1.1 6.1 200.7 Pre-exceptional revenue 947.3 475.2 1,038.0 649.4 1,687.4 21.7 0.7 3,132.3 Year ended 30 June 2017 Statutory Group revenue 804.8 319.4 1,013.3 512.8 1,526.1 11.1 0.7 2,662.1 add: exceptional items note 3 42.4 42.4 42.4 add: share of joint ventures revenue note 13 132.6 10.8 0.8 0.8 13.9 158.1 Pre-exceptional revenue 937.4 330.2 1,014.1 555.2 1,569.3 25.0 0.7 2,862.6 c Profit from operations and operating margin The Group uses an operating profit measure which is inclusive of its share of operating profit generated from its joint ventures as this is equivalent to the operating profit generated by its subsidiaries and reflects the profitability of the total activity performed by the Group during the year.
Additionally, this APM excludes exceptional items, the share of joint ventures interest and tax and amortisation of intangible assets.
Operating margin reflects the ratio of profit from operations and pre-exceptional revenue.
This differs from the statutory measure of profit before finance costs which includes the share of joint ventures interest and tax and amortisation of intangible assets.
