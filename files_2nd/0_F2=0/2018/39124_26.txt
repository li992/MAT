Accordingly, retained earnings are shown after directly writing off cumulative goodwill of 1.6m.
In addition, cumulative goodwill of 2.3m has been written off against the merger reserve in previous years.
The rights issue in April 2018 was undertaken through a cash box structure which allowed merger relief to be applied to the issue of shares rather than recording share premium.
The resulting merger reserve of 278.2m is included within other reserves, of which 228.2m isdistributable as the capital was retained for the purposes of the Company with the remaining 50.0m not distributable as it was used toinject capital into Vanquis Bank.
Other reserves are further analysed in note 27.
