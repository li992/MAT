126 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Section 1.
Basis of preparation This section provides general information about the Group and the accounting policies that apply to the consolidated financial statements as a whole.
Accounting policies that are specific to a particular note are provided within the note to which they relate.
This section also details the new or amended accounting standards adopted during the year as well as the anticipated impact of future changes to accounting standards that are not yet effective.
Renewi plc is a public limited company listed on the London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled in Scotland under the Companies Act 2006, registered number SC077438.
The address of the registered office is given on page 196.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in section 2.
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and related interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRS IC adopted by the European Union EU and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments, share-based payments and assets classified as held for sale, which are stated at fair value.
The accounting policies adopted in the consolidated financial statements have been consistently applied.
The Group has applied all accounting standards and interpretations issued relevant to its operations and effective for accounting periods beginning on 1 April 2017.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and all amounts are rounded to the nearest 0.1m unless otherwise stated.
There were no new standards, amendments to standards or interpretations adopted for the first time for the Groups financial year beginning 1 April 2017 that had a significant impact on these financial statements.
Comparative information The comparative information in the consolidated balance sheet for the year ended March 2017 has been restated for acquisition accounting adjustments in relation to the Van Gansewinkel Groep BV VGG acquisition in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, see note 6.1 for the impact of the restatement.
Changes in presentation The Group changed the composition of its reporting segments from 1 April 2017, following the VGG acquisition which in the prior year was reported as a separate reportable segment.
A new divisional structure has been created as a result of the merger of Shanks and VGG which is both market facing and customer-focused.
Accordingly, the segmental information presented in these financial statements has been restated to reflect the information now provided to the chief operating decision maker in order to assess performance and to make decisions on allocating resources.
The following changes have been made to the Groups reportable segments as reported at 31 March 2017: The Commercial Waste reportable segment comprises the former Shanks Commercial Divisions in the Netherlands and Belgium and the former VGG Collections Division in the Netherlands and Belgium.
The Hazardous Waste reportable segment comprises the former Shanks Hazardous Waste Division and now includes VGIS previously Van Gansewinkel Industrial Services and CFS previously Van Gansewinkel CFS.
Monostreams is a new reportable segment which includes the three former businesses of the Recycling Division of VGG and the former Shanks Dutch Orgaworld business previously included in the Commercial Waste reportable segment.
The Group Central Services reportable segment comprises the former Shanks and former VGG corporate head office functions.
The Municipal reportable segment is unchanged.
As required under IFRS 8 Operating Segments, the Group has restated the corresponding segment information for the prior year to enable comparisons to the new structure.
Going concern Having assessed the principal risks and other matters in connection with the viability statement, the Directors consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing these consolidated financial statements.
127 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS New standards and interpretations not yet adopted Standards and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB are only applicable if endorsed by the European Union.
At the date of approval of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations were in issue but not yet effective: Accounting standard Requirements Impact on financial statements IFRS 9 Financial Instruments This standard addresses the classification, The Group has performed an initial assessment of the measurement and recognition approaches for impact of this standard.

The assets will be depreciated and interest charged on the lease Effective for periods beginning on or after liabilities, which replaces the operating lease costs 1 April 2019. currently recognised in the Income Statement.
This may initially result in the Group recognising a higher lease expense than the current operating lease cost.
It is not expected to have a material impact on the Income Statement but the exact value will depend on the leases held in the future.
The current level of operating leases held by the Group is disclosed in note 3.3.
There are no other IFRSs or IFRS IC interpretations not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group and there were no new IFRSs or IFRS IC interpretations which were early adopted by the Group.
Basis of preparation continued Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Renewi plc the Company, all its subsidiary undertakings subsidiaries and the Groups interests in joint ventures and associates.
Subsidiaries are entities which are directly or indirectly controlled by the Group.
Control exists where the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
Where there is a non-controlling interest this is identified separately from the Groups equity.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with those used by the Group.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from or up to the date control passes.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.
An associate is an entity, other than a subsidiary or joint venture, over which the Group has significant influence.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating decisions of an entity but is not in control or joint control over those policies.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost or, in the case of a disposal of the majority shareholding, at fair value.
The cumulative post-acquisition profits or losses and movements in other comprehensive income are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment.
When the Groups share of losses exceeds the carrying amount of the joint venture or associate, the carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture or associate.
Accounting policies of associates and joint ventures have been adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies of the Group.
Where the Group is party to a jointly-controlled operation, the Group proportionately accounts for its share of the income and expenditure, assets and liabilities and cash flows on a line-by-line basis in the consolidated financial statements.
Equity investments in entities that are neither associates, joint ventures nor subsidiaries are held at cost, less any provision for impairment.
Foreign currencies The financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the Groups presentation currency.
The results and financial position of all the Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency of the Group as follows: assets and liabilities at each balance sheet date are translated into Sterling at the closing year end exchange rate: income and expenses in each Income Statement are translated into Sterling at the average rate of exchange for the year: and the resulting exchange differences are recognised in the exchange reserve in other comprehensive income.
Cumulative exchange differences are recognised in the Income Statement in the year in which an overseas subsidiary undertaking is disposed of.
The most significant currencies for the Group were translated at the following exchange rates: Closing rates Averagerates 31 March 31 March 31 March 31 March Value of 1 2018 2017 Change 2018 2017 Change Euro 1.14 1.17 2.4 % 1.14 1.19 4.7 % Canadian Dollar 1.81 1.67 8.5 % 1.71 1.79 4.1 % The Group applies the hedge accounting principles of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement relating to net investment hedging to offset the exchange differences arising on foreign currency denominated borrowings with the translation of foreign operations.
Net investment hedges are accounted for by recognising exchange rate movements in the exchange reserve, with any hedge ineffectiveness being charged to the Income Statement in the period the ineffectiveness arises.
129 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Section 1.
Basis of preparation continued Critical accounting judgements and estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenditure.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity are set out below and in more detail in the related notes.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on factors that are considered to be relevant and are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Judgements in applying the Group's accounting policies Underlying business performance The Group uses alternative performance measures as they believe these measures provide additional useful information on the underlying trends, performance and position of the Group.
These measures are used by the Group for internal performance analysis and incentive compensation arrangements for employees.
The term underlying refers to the relevant measure being reported for continuing operations excluding non-trading and exceptional items, financing fair value remeasurements and amortisation of acquisition intangibles.
These include underlying earnings before interest and tax underlying EBIT, underlying profit before tax, underlying profit after tax, underlying free cash flow, underlying earnings per share and EBITDA earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.
The terms EBIT, exceptional items and underlying are not defined terms under IFRS and may therefore not be comparable with similarly titled profit measures reported by other companies.
They are not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP measurements of profit.
Underlying EBIT is defined as continuing operating profit before amortisation of acquisition intangibles and exceptional items.
Landfill related expenses and provisioning are no longer an adjusting item in determining the Groups EBITDA as it is part of the underlying business.
A full list of alternative performance measures and non-IFRS measures together with reconciliations are set out on pages 182 to 183.
PPP contracts in the Netherlands Following the acquisition of VGG, the Group now participates in PPPs with local governments in the Netherlands with regard to waste collecting activities.
The PPP entities are each 100% owned by the local government municipality with the Group wholly responsible for the management of the legal entity.
In addition to 100% ownership by the municipality, the considerations taken into account in reaching this conclusion are that the municipality has the ability to direct the activities that significantly affect the investees returns through approval of budgets, investment plans and business plans and has the ability to terminate the operating agreement.
The Group has considered all relevant factors in the contractual arrangements between the parties and has concluded that the municipality has control over the PPPs and therefore the PPP entities are not consolidated within the Groups financial statements.
Non-trading and exceptional items Management uses judgement to determine items to be classified as non-trading and exceptional to enable a better understanding of the underlying financial performance of the Group.
Further details are given in note 3.4.
Estimates and assumptions Impairment of intangible assets Impairment testing is carried out annually on a cash generating unit CGU level.
The Group estimates the recoverable amount of a CGU using a value in use model by projecting future cash flows.
Further details are given in note 4.1.
Provisions The Group has landfill related provisions of 117.1m 2017: 113.4m and onerous contract provisions of 95.9m 2017: 46.1m, of which 89.2m 2017: 35.9m relates to UK Municipal PPP PFI long term contracts.
These provisions are long term in nature and are based on the best estimate of the likely future cash flows discounted to present value.
Further details are given in note 4.9.
Defined benefit pension schemes The calculation of the present value of the defined benefit pension schemes is determined by using actuarial valuations based on assumptions including discount rate, life expectancy and inflation rates.
Further details are given in note 7.2.
Taxation Deferred tax assets based on unused tax losses are recognised based on managements projections of future profits.
Further details are given in note 3.5.
Segmental information This section shows the performance, net assets and other information on a segmental basis.
The Groups segmental reporting reflects the management structure which is aligned with the core activities of the Group.
The Groups chief operating decision maker is considered to be the Board of Directors.
The Groups reportable segments determined with reference to the information provided to the Board of Directors in order for it to allocate the Groups resources and to monitor the performance of the Group are set out below.
Following the implementation of the new divisional structure on 1 April 2017 the Groups reportable segments are: Commercial Waste Collection and treatment of commercial waste in the Netherlands and Belgium.
Hazardous Waste Industrial cleaning and treatment of hazardous waste in the Netherlands.
Monostreams Production of materials from waste streams in specific end markets such as glass, electrical and electronic equipment, organics and minerals in the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany, Hungary and Portugal.
Municipal Operation of waste management facilities under long-term municipal contracts in the UK and Canada.
Group central services Head office corporate function.
Segmental reporting The Commercial Waste reportable segment includes the Netherlands and Belgium operating segments and the Municipal reportable segment includes the UK and Canada operating segments, based on geographical location.
Operating segments within the Commercial Waste and Municipal divisions have been aggregated and reported as one reportable segment as they operate in similar markets in relation to the nature of the products, services, processes and type of customer.
The Monostreams reportable segment includes three businesses from the former VGG Recycling Division and the former Shanks Dutch Orgaworld business.
The profit measure the Board of Directors uses to evaluate performance is underlying EBIT.
Underlying EBIT is continuing operating profit before the amortisation of acquisition intangibles, fair value measurements, non-trading and exceptional items.
The Group accounts for inter-segment trading on an arms length basis.

133 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Section 3.
Operating profit and tax This section contains the notes that relate to the results and performance of the Group during the year, along with the related accounting policies that have been applied.
3.1 Revenue recognition Accounting policy Revenue represents the fair value of consideration received or receivable, including landfill tax but excluding sales taxes, discounts and intercompany sales, for goods and services provided in the normal course of business.
Revenue is recognised when it can be reliably measured and when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity.
Revenue recognition criteria for the key types of transaction are as follows: Waste collection services revenue is recognised once the waste is delivered to the transfer station or processing facility.
Waste processing services where the Groups revenue contracts include an obligation to process waste, revenue is recognised as processing occurs.
Hazardous waste industrial cleaning revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion based on services performed to date.
Sales of recyclate materials and products from waste revenue is based on contractually agreed prices and is recognised when the risks and rewards have passed to the buyer.
Income from power generated from gas produced by processes at anaerobic digestion facilities and landfill sites is recognised at the time of supply based on the volumes of energy produced and an estimation of the amount to be received.
Construction services under the Canada Municipal service concession arrangement revenue is recognised based on the stage of completion of the work performed.
Accrued income at the balance sheet date is recognised at the fair value based on services provided and contractually agreed prices.
It is subsequently invoiced and accounted for as a trade receivable.
Unprocessed waste may give rise to deferred revenue, where invoices to customers are raised in advance of performance obligations being completed, or require an accrual for the costs of disposing of residual waste once the Group has an obligation for its disposal.
These amounts are shown in deferred revenue or accruals in the financial statements as appropriate.
The Groups Private Finance Initiative Public Private Partnership PFI PPP contracts in the Municipal Division are waste management contracts which require the building of new infrastructure and all rights to the infrastructure pass to the local authority at the termination or expiry of the contract.
The Group applies IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements which specifies the accounting treatment applied by concession operators.
Under IFRIC 12, the operators rights over infrastructure operated under concession arrangements should be accounted for based on having considered the extent to which the grantor the local authority controls the assets, over what services the operator must provide with the infrastructure, to whom it must provide them and at what price.
Having considered these factors the Group applies the financial asset model to account for the infrastructure as it has an unconditional right to receive cash.
The Group splits the local authority payment between a service element as revenue and a repayment element that is deducted from the financial asset.
The part of the service element which covers the obligation to undertake major refurbishments and renewals lifecycle expenditure to maintain the infrastructure such that it is handed over to the local authority in good working order is deferred and only recognised as revenue when the service is provided.
Income and costs relating to specific rights and obligations within the contracts are transferred to deferred revenue or other receivables and either released or charged to the Income Statement over the period of delivery.
Operating profit and tax continued 3.2 Operating profit Detailed below are the key amounts recognised in arriving at operating profit for the year: 2018 2017 Continuing operations Note m m Staff costs 7.1 368.6 178.2 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment 4.2 78.9 41.8 Amortisation of intangible assets 4.1 12.7 5.4 Repairs and maintenance expenditure on property, plant and equipment 81.7 42.8 Net loss profit on disposal of property, plant and equipment 2.1 0.5 Non-trading and exceptional items 3.4 101.5 75.5 Trade receivables impairment 4.7 2.2 1.4 Operating lease costs: Minimum lease payments 35.6 15.8 Less sub-lease rental income 0.3 0.3 35.3 15.5 The total remuneration of the Groups auditors,  LLP and its associates, for services provided to the Group during the year was: 2018 2017 m m Audit of parent company and consolidated financial statements 0.2 0.2 Audit of subsidiaries pursuant to legislation 1.1 1.0 Fees payable to the auditors pursuant to legislation 1.3 1.2 Corporate finance services 3.1 Other non-audit services 0.1 Total fees 1.3 4.4 Corporate finance services in the year to March 2017 related to professional services performed in respect of the acquisition of VGG.
The Corporate Governance section on page 88 includes an explanation of how the external auditors objectivity and independence are safeguarded when non-audit services are provided by the external auditors.
3.3 Operating leases Accounting policy All leases other than finance leases are treated as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Minimum lease payments The future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: 2018 2017 m m Within one year 32.2 31.1 Later than one year and less than five years 69.7 70.8 More than five years 131.5 140.3 233.4 242.2 Future minimum lease payments expected to be received under non-cancellable sub-leases 0.5 0.6 232.9 241.6 135 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Section 3.
Operating profit and tax continued 3.4 Non-trading and exceptional items To improve the understanding of the Groups financial performance, items which are not considered to reflect the underlying performance are presented in non-trading and exceptional items.
Items classified as non-trading and exceptional are disclosed separately due to their size or incidence to enable a better understanding of performance.
These include, but are not limited to, significant impairments, significant restructuring of the activities of an entity including employee associated severance costs, acquisition and disposal related transaction costs, integration costs, synergy delivery costs, significant fires, onerous contracts, profit or loss on disposal of properties or subsidiaries, as these are irregular, and amortisation of acquisition intangibles.
The Group incurs costs each year in maintaining intangible assets which include acquired customer relationships, permits and licences and excludes amortisation of these assets from underlying EBIT to avoid double counting such costs within underlying results.
Exceptional items are considered individually and assessed at each reporting period.
2018 2017 Note m m Merger related costs: Synergy delivery costs cash 12.3 4.5 Synergy delivery costs non-cash 2.3 Integration costs 7.5 2.9 22.1 7.4 Portfolio management activity: UK Municipal 22.5 Acquisition costs 0.4 18.9 Industrial Cleaning disposal in Belgium 0.4 Disposals in the Netherlands 0.3 22.9 19.0 Other items: UK Municipal onerous contract provisions 52.7 28.2 ATM soil issues 2.7 Restructuring charges and employee related costs 0.1 2.4 Income costs relating to fires 2.3 1.6 Other UK Municipal contract issues 2.5 5.3 50.7 37.5 Exceptional finance costs 11.6 Impairment of assets 9.5 Amortisation of acquisition intangibles 4.1 5.8 2.1 Non-trading and exceptional items in loss before tax continuing operations 101.5 87.1 Tax on non-trading and exceptional items 8.2 6.4 Exceptional tax credit 6.8 Non-trading and exceptional items in loss after tax continuing operations 86.5 80.7 Discontinued operations 6.2 0.5 0.5 Total non-trading and exceptional items in loss after tax 86.0 81.2 The above non-trading and exceptional items include the following: Merger related costs Due to the significance of the merger on the Group and the associated synergy delivery projects these costs are considered to be exceptional.
Synergy delivery costs of 14.6m 2017: 4.5m and integration costs of 7.5m 2017: 2.9m were incurred as the Group executes merger plans for generating value.
Synergy delivery costs include 2.3m of non-cash impairments of assets at the Belgium Commercial Zaventem shared service centre and property in Netherlands Commercial identified as part of site rationalisation.
The total cost of 22.1m 2017: 7.4m was split 4.2m 2017: nil in cost of sales and 17.9m 2017: 7.4m in administrative expenses.
Operating profit and tax continued Portfolio management activity UK Municipal charge of 22.5m 2017: nil included the exit of its loss-making anaerobic digestion facility at Westcott Park and the decision to initiate the termination of the D&G PFI operating contract.
The Group completed the sale of the Westcott Park facility on 28 March 2018 resulting in a loss on disposal and related costs totalling 14.0m.
Discussions are ongoing with the D&G council and other stakeholders with termination of the operating contract expected in the next financial year therefore the onerous contract was increased together with a noncash write down of the investment totalling 9.0m.
Additionally a provision of 0.5m in relation to a previous disposal was released as no longer required.
Further transaction costs of 0.4m 2017: 18.9m relating to the merger of Van Gansewinkel Groep BV have been incurred in the year, principally comprising legal and other advisory costs.
These are considered exceptional as part of the overall total transaction costs.
The total cost of 22.9m 2017: 19.0m was split 8.3m 2017: nil in cost of sales and 14.6m 2017: 19.0m in administrative expenses.
Other items UK Municipal onerous contract provisions charge of 52.7m 2017: 28.2m relates to additional provisions of 27.1m 2017: 8.6m and 29.5m 2017: nil at BDR and Wakefield respectively given the financial and operational performance of these assets this year and specifically the material underperformance in organic throughput, subsidies and off-take pricing compared with the original contractual assumptions made many years ago.
This charge is net of a 3.9m release in relation to Cumbria following successful management action to resolve operational and compliance issues.
The prior year charge also included increases to the Cumbria and D&G onerous contract provisions, a specific lossmaking contract under the ELWA operating contract and provisions for incremental capital works required at BDR and Wakefield to enable the plants to function as intended.
The charge for ATM soil issues of 2.7m 2017: nil relates to the soil offset market and includes additional costs of logistics and off-site storage.

Net credit of 2.3m 2017: 1.6m charge as a result of significant fires during the year at two Commercial sites, one in the Netherlands and one in Belgium.
At each site property, plant and equipment has been impaired totalling 1.8m and clean-up costs have been incurred.
These have been partly offset by the insurance recovery of 5.1m of which 3.6m has been received in cash.
In addition insurance funds of 0.6m were received in relation to a prior year claim for a fire at a legacy VGG site.
The prior year charge related to incremental operating costs which were unable to be reclaimed under the Groups business interruption insurance following the fire at the UK Municipal East London site in August 2014.

137 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Section 3.
Operating profit and tax continued 3.5 Taxation This section details the accounting polices applied for tax, the current and deferred tax charges or credits in the year, a reconciliation of the total tax expense to the accounting profit and the movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Accounting policy Current tax is based on taxable profit or loss for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit before tax in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years or that are never taxable or deductible.
The asset or liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in full where the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the financial statements is different to the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profits.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that the taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except where it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred income tax liabilities are not provided on taxable temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements as the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities, when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority.
The Group operates principally in the Netherlands, Belgium, the UK, France and Canada, all of which have their own tax legislation.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities have been calculated based on the substantively enacted tax rates in the relevant jurisdictions at the balance sheet date or those rates expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
The Group has available tax losses, some of which have been recognised as a tax asset and some have not based on managements best estimate of the ability of the Group to utilise those losses.
Income statement The tax credit based on the loss for the year from continuing operations is made up as follows: 2018 2017 m m Current tax: UK corporation tax Current year 1.2 1.4 Overseas tax Current year 8.7 3.7 Prior year 0.2 0.2 Total current tax charge 10.1 5.3 Deferred tax Origination and reversal of temporary differences in the current year 11.7 5.3 Adjustment in respect of the prior year 0.4 0.5 Total deferred tax credit 12.1 5.8 Total tax credit for the year 2.0 0.5 138 Section 3.
Operating profit and tax continued 3.5 Taxation continued The tax on the Groups loss for the year from continuing operations differs from the UK standard rate of tax of 19% 2017: 20%, as explained below: 2018 2017 m m Total loss before taxation 50.0 61.4 Tax credit based on UK tax rate of 19% 2017: 20% 9.5 12.3 Effects of: Adjustment to tax charge in respect of prior years 0.2 0.3 Profits taxed at overseas tax rates 1.5 0.8 Non-deductible other items 1.8 1.3 Non-deductible transaction costs 0.2 1.9 Unrecognised deferred tax assets 11.4 6.4 Exceptional credit relating to change in Belgian tax rate 6.8 Change in tax rate 0.4 1.7 Total tax credit for the year 2.0 0.5 Changes to the UK corporation tax rate were substantively enacted as part of Finance Bill 2016 on 7 September 2016.
This included a reduction in the main corporation tax rate from 19% to 17% by 1 April 2020.
As a result the UK deferred tax for the year has been calculated based on the substantively enacted rates.
Exceptional credit relating to change in Belgium tax rate For the accounting period ended 31 March 2018, the standard Belgian corporate income tax rate is 33.99%.
Under the corporate income tax reform as enacted by the Belgian government on 22 December 2017, there will be a phased reduction of this tax rate to 29.58% for accounting periods starting on or after 1 January 2018 and furthermore 25% from 1 January 2020.
As a result, the Belgian deferred tax has been calculated at the substantively enacted rates depending on when the timing differences are expected to reverse.
This has resulted in an exceptional tax credit of 6.8m in the current year.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences under the liability method using applicable local tax rates.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
The analysis of the net deferred tax liability and the deferred tax credit in the Income Statement is as set out below: Balance sheet Income Statement Restated 2018 2017 2018 2017 m m m m Retirement benefit schemes 4.5 5.3 0.5 0.4 Tax losses 19.0 15.0 4.0 4.6 Derivative financial instruments 3.7 5.2 Capital allowances 52.7 56.3 4.7 1.9 Other timing differences 12.5 15.4 3.9 3.5 At 31 March 38.0 46.2 12.1 5.8 The deferred tax balance as at 31 March 2017 has been restated for acquisition accounting adjustments in relation to the VGG acquisition.
139 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Section 3.
Operating profit and tax continued 3.5 Taxation continued The movement in the deferred tax balance during the year is: Restated 2018 2017 m m Net deferred tax liability at 1 April 46.2 11.7 Acquisitions through business combination note 6.1 0.7 38.7 Credited to Income Statement 12.1 5.8 Charged credited to equity 2.3 0.9 Exchange 0.9 2.5 38.0 46.2 Analysed in the balance sheet, after offset of balances within countries, as: Deferred tax assets 24.9 31.3 Deferred tax liabilities 62.9 77.5 38.0 46.2 The deferred tax balance as at 31 March 2017 has been restated for acquisition accounting adjustments in relation to the VGG acquisition.
The majority of the 24.9m 2017: 31.3m deferred tax asset and the majority of the 62.9m 2017: 77.5m deferred tax liability are expected to be recovered after more than one year.
As at 31 March 2018, the Group had unused trading losses tax effect of 59.2m 2017: 61.2m available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 19.0m 2017: 15.0m of such losses and recognition is based on managements projections of future profits in the relevant companies.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 40.2m 2017: 46.2m due to the uncertainty of future profit streams.
Tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely in the relevant companies with the exception of the Netherlands where the losses expire after 9 years 2.6m recognised and 21.6m unrecognised.
No liability has been recognised on the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries.
This is because the Group is in a position to control the timing and method of the reversal of the differences and it is probable that such differences will not give rise to a tax liability in the foreseeable future.
The total temporary difference at 31 March 2018 amounted to 218.0m 2017: 194.3m and the unrecognised deferred tax on the unremitted earnings is estimated to be 0.1m 2017: 0.3m which relates to taxes payable on repatriation and dividend withholding taxes levied by overseas jurisdictions.
UK tax legislation relating to company distributions provides for exemption from tax for most repatriated profits, subject to certain exemptions.
Operating profit and tax continued 3.6 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the owners of the parent entity by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding at the year end.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing profit for the year attributable to the owners of the parent entity by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of any commitments made by the Group to issue shares in the future.
Underlying basic and diluted earnings per share excludes amortisation of acquisition intangibles, the change in fair value of derivatives, non-trading and exceptional items net of related tax.
Exceptional items are those items that need to be disclosed separately on the face of the Income Statement, because of their size or incidence, to enable a better understanding of performance.
The Directors believe that adjusting earnings per share in this way enables comparison with historical data calculated on the same basis to reflect the business performance in a consistent manner and reflect how the business in managed and measured on a day to day basis.

Operating assets and liabilities This section contains balance sheet notes showing the assets and liabilities used to generate the Groups results and the related accounting policies.
4.1 Intangible assets Accounting policy Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable assets at the date of acquisition and is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to the date of transition to IFRS 31 March 2004 has been retained at the previous UK GAAP net book value following impairment tests.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to those cash generating units CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment.
Any impairment is charged immediately to the Income Statement and is not reversed in a subsequent period.
In conducting the impairment review on goodwill and intangibles, management is required to make estimates of pre-tax discount rates, future profitability and growth rates.
Landfill void represents the acquisition of a landfill operation in the Netherlands in 2006, the landfill void was capitalised based on the fair value of the void acquired.
This asset is amortised over its estimated useful life on a void usage basis and measured at cost less accumulated amortisation.
The estimated remaining useful life is 17 years.
Other intangible assets are capitalised on the basis of the fair value of the assets acquired or on the basis of costs incurred to purchase and bring the assets into use.
They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortisation.
They are amortised over the estimated useful life on a straight-line basis, as follows: Contract right relating to leasehold land Term of the lease Contract right relating to PFI PPP contracts in Municipal Term of the contract Computer software 1 to 5 years Acquisition related intangibles: Waste permits and licences 5 to 20 years Customer relationships Up to 14 years 142 Section 4.
Of the total amortisation charge of 12.7m 2017: 5.4m, 5.8m 2017: 2.1m related to intangible assets arising on acquisition.
Of the remaining amortisation expense of 6.9m 2017: 3.3m, 2.2m 2017: 1.9m has been charged in cost of sales and 4.7m 2017: 1.4m has been charged in administrative expenses.
The impairment charge of 3.2m 2017: 3.2m related to 1.9m 2017: 3.2m of contract right intangibles in UK Municipal as it has been determined that they are no longer recoverable and 1.3m 2017: nil of software in the Commercial Division as part of the synergy delivery programme.
The net book value of acquisition related intangibles of 32.9m 2017: 37.7m included customer relationships of 20.2m 2017: 21.5m, permits of 6.3m 2017: 7.3m and licences of 5.8m 2017: 8.2m.
143 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Section 4.
Operating assets and liabilities continued 4.1 Intangible assets continued Goodwill impairment Impairment testing is carried out at a cash generating unit CGU level on an annual basis.
The Group has revised the CGUs for the year ended March 2018 in line with the operating segments.
The significant CGUs are Netherlands Commercial Waste, Belgium Commercial Waste, Hazardous Waste and Monostreams which are in line with the operating segments explained in section 2.
The following is a summary of the goodwill allocation for each reporting segment: Restated 2018 2017 m m Commercial Waste 322.3 314.5 Hazardous Waste 125.5 109.9 Monostreams 72.3 70.5 Municipal 16.0 15.7 Total goodwill 536.1 510.6 The comparatives have been restated as a result of purchase price accounting adjustments as included in section 6.1 and to reflect the new reportable segments from 1 April 2017.
The Group estimates the recoverable amount of a CGU using a value in use model by projecting cash flows for the next five years together with a terminal value using a growth rate.
The key assumptions underpinning the recoverable amounts of the CGUs tested for impairment are forecast revenue and underlying EBIT.
The forecast revenues in these models are based on managements predictions of overall market growth rates, including both volume and price.
Underlying EBIT margin is the average EBIT margin as a percentage of revenue over the five-year forecast period.
The five-year plans used in the impairment models are based on managements past experience and future expectations of performance and reflect the planned changes in the CGUs as a result of restructuring programmes and actions instigated in the current year together with limited recovery and improvement in general market and economic conditions.
For each of the CGUs with significant goodwill in comparison with the total carrying value of goodwill of the Group, the key assumptions, longterm growth rate and discount rate used in the value in use calculations are shown below.

Operating assets and liabilities continued 4.2 Property, plant and equipment Accounting policy Property, plant and equipment, except for freehold land and assets under construction, is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and provision for impairment.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at the end of each reporting period.
Assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value.
An impairment loss is recognised immediately as an operating expense and at each subsequent reporting date the impairment is reviewed for possible reversal.
Depreciation is provided to write off cost less the expected residual value on a straight line basis over the expected useful economic lives as follows: Buildings Up to 30 years Fixtures and fittings Up to 10 years Plant and installations Up to 20 years Cars and service vehicles 5 to 10 years Trucks Up to 12 years Other items of plant and machinery 5 to 15 years Computer equipment 3 to 5 years Landfill site development costs including engineering works Up to 30 years over the operational life of the site Property, plant and equipment are analysed as follows: Land and Landfill Plant and buildings sites machinery Total m m m m Cost At 1 April 2016 252.8 39.9 493.8 786.5 Acquisition through business combination note 6.1 140.4 3.9 140.8 285.1 Additions 7.8 0.1 26.4 34.3 Disposals 4.4 18.7 23.1 Exchange 20.4 3.1 37.7 61.2 At 31 March 2017 417.0 47.0 680.0 1,144.0 Purchase price allocation adjustment note 6.1 31.5 3.0 28.5 At 31 March 2017 - restated 448.5 47.0 677.0 1,172.5 Acquisition through business combination note 6.1 4.9 2.8 7.7 Additions 16.5 0.7 65.5 82.7 Disposals 9.8 0.8 36.1 46.7 Exchange 6.4 0.9 17.0 24.3 At 31 March 2018 466.5 47.8 726.2 1,240.5 Accumulated depreciation and impairment At 1 April 2016 101.9 37.3 350.3 489.5 Depreciation charge 10.00.4 31.441.8 Impairment charge 0.5 6.36.8 Disposals 2.6 17.0 19.6 Exchange 8.1 2.7 27.3 38.1 At 31 March 2017 117.9 40.4 398.3 556.6 Depreciation charge 16.21.1 61.678.9 Impairment charge 2.6 0.43.0 Disposals 3.8 0.4 28.8 33.0 Exchange 1.6 1.0 9.4 12.0 At 31 March 2018 134.5 42.1 440.9 617.5 Net book value At 31 March 2018 332.0 5.7 285.3 623.0 At 31 March 2017 330.6 6.6 278.7 615.9 At 31 March 2016 150.9 2.6 143.5 297.0 145 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Section 4.
Operating assets and liabilities continued 4.2 Property, plant and equipment continued Depreciation expense of 76.4m 2017: 40.0m has been charged in cost of sales and 2.5m 2017: 1.8m in administrative expenses.
The impairment charge of 3.0m 2017: 6.8m includes 1.8m in relation to the fires in the Netherlands and Belgium and 1.2m in the Commercial Division as part of the synergy delivery programme.
The prior year charge related principally to plant and machinery at the UK Municipal anaerobic digestion facility as a result of adverse market developments.
The impairment charge was split 2.8m 2017: 6.0m cost of sales, 0.2m 2017: 0.3m administrative expenses and in the prior year 0.5m in discontinued cost of sales.
Plant and machinery includes assets under construction of 10.1m 2017: 9.8m and land and buildings includes assets under construction of 9.6m 2017: 2.7m.
Included in plant and machinery are assets held under finance leases with a net book value of 38.0m 2017: 55.2m and in land and buildings are assets under finance leases with a net book value of 4.8m 2017: 8.9m.
4.3 Investments and loans to joint ventures and associates Accounting policy Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost or, in the case of a disposal of the majority shareholding, at fair value.
The carrying amount of investments and loans to associates and joint ventures is represented as follows: Loans Investments Loans to associates and Other unlisted joint ventures Joint ventures Associates investments Total investments m m m m m At 1 April 2016 1.3 4.2 3.9 2.7 10.8 Additions 18.5 Acquisitions through business combinations note 6.1 0.1 0.4 1.1 1.0 2.5 Share of retained profits 1.50.5 2.0 Dividend income 0.1 0.1 Fair value adjustment on cash flow hedges 0.3 0.3 Exchange 0.3 0.3 At 31 March 2017 19.9 6.1 5.7 4.0 15.8 Additions 0.1 Share of retained profits 1.50.8 2.3 Dividend income 0.7 0.6 1.3 Fair value adjustment on cash flow hedges 0.7 0.7 Impairment charge 0.2 0.7 0.9 Repayments 0.2 Exchange 0.1 0.1 At 31 March 2018 19.8 6.7 5.9 4.1 16.7 The impairment charge of 0.9m 2017: nil relates to UK Municipal investments and has been recorded in administrative expenses.
Where investments in joint ventures are held at nil as the Groups share of losses exceeds the carrying amount, the Groups share of profits in the year was 3.4m 2017: 1.7m losses, cumulatively losses of 8.4m 2017: 11.8m are unrecognised.
In the prior year the loans to joint ventures and associates increased by 18.5m which included 17.5m in relation to the subordinated debt injection into Resource Recovery Solutions Derbyshire Limited.
The loans to joint ventures and associates is split 5.9m current 2017: 5.7m and 13.9m non-current 2017: 14.2m.
Where the associate or joint venture holds non-recourse PFI PPP debt there is a restriction on payment of dividends, which is due to the terms of the financing facility agreements and as such requires lender approval.
Details of joint ventures and associated investments are shown in note 8.1.
No joint venture or associate is considered individually material to the Group for further disclosure.
Operating assets and liabilities continued 4.4 Financial assets relating to PFI PPP contracts Financial assets result from the application of IFRIC 12 on accounting for concession arrangements relating to the UK and Canada PFI PPP Municipal contracts.
Accounting policies and key judgements Financial assets relating to PFI PPP contracts are classified as loans and receivables and are initially recognised at the fair value of consideration receivable and subsequently at amortised cost.
These service concession arrangements under IFRIC 12 represent the present value of the future cash flows of the contract.
These cash flows are dependent on, amongst other things, tonnages, indexation, recycling rates and labour costs.
UK PFI PPP contracts The Groups UK PFI PPP arrangements involve the construction of waste management facilities to be provided to local authorities.
The building of the facilities is governed by the engineer, procure and construct contract entered into by the Group.
The construction work is undertaken by third party contractors with drawdowns of financing from the UK PFI PPP funders used to pay the subcontractor for the construction works.
The Group has considered all relevant factors in the contractual arrangements between the parties to determine whether the Group acts as agent or principal during the construction phase of the contracts.
The considerations taken into account in reaching this conclusion are: The Group obtains quotes for the fixed price construction contract from a number of contractors as part of the preparation to submit a bid to the municipality.
Once the Group has been selected as preferred bidder it has no further opportunity to vary the prices it has bid other than indexation for inflation following delay to financial close.
The detailed specification and prices of the works are agreed in advance and milestone payments are only made against works to the agreed specification.
In the event that a revision to the specification of works is required these and the pricing adjustment are jointly agreed with the municipality and the funders.
At the date of financial close direct agreements are signed between the municipality, the funders and the construction contractors which govern the procedures for the completion of the waste management facilities.
The Group has an obligation to pay the construction contractor from the non-recourse bank debt regardless of any non-payment by the municipality.
In the event that the municipality fails to pay tonnage fees after the construction period there is a termination procedure which calculates the amount of damages due to all parties including fully repaying the debt.
We consider that the likelihood of the risk of the municipality becoming insolvent is remote.
Therefore in our view the weight of this factor in coming to our overall judgement is reduced.
In the event that the construction contractor fails to perform under the terms of the contract the Group holds performance and retention bonds which guarantee the obligations of the contractor.
Any additional costs arising from having to replace the contractor, should they arise, would be satisfied by payments from the bonds.
The Group earns certain fixed fees in connection with UK PFI PPP arrangements.
These fees represent consideration for services delivered before financial close or for ongoing project management.
In summary we consider that, on the basis that the construction contractor is known to the municipality at the date of financial close and in view of the negligible credit risk taken by the Group, on balance, despite some overall risk residing with the Group for delivery of services, we consider that we act as agent versus principal in the provision of construction services.
Accordingly, revenue and costs for the construction are not recognised gross in the Income Statement.
In light of these conclusions and the presentation of the revenue and costs associated with the construction services net in the Income Statement, we consider that the most appropriate classification of the PFI PPP non-recourse debt cash flows associated with the construction of the waste management facilities in the Statement of Cash Flows is as financing and investing cash flows respectively and not as operating cash flows.
This classification has been consistently applied to all periods presented in the financial statements.
The Group is the operator for one class of service concession arrangements, that of the provision of waste treatment and waste treatment facilities, and these are classified as service concession arrangements in accordance with IFRIC.
If the Group underperforms, including failure to divert waste from landfill, the contract can be terminated before the end of its term.
147 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Section 4.
Operating assets and liabilities continued 4.4 Financial assets relating to PFI PPP contracts continued Canadian PPP contract The Groups Canadian PPP arrangement involves the construction of waste management facilities to be provided to the City of Surrey.
The building of the facilities is governed by the design-build agreement entered into by the Group.
The construction work is undertaken by third party contractors with the financing provided from the Groups core bank facilities.
All relevant factors in the contractual arrangements between the parties have been considered to determine whether the Group acts as agent or principal during the construction phase of the contracts.
Given the level of risks and rewards borne by the Group it has been concluded that we act as principal in this contract.
Revenue and costs for the construction are therefore recognised gross in the Income Statement and the cash flows associated with the construction of the waste management facilities are classified as operating cash flows in the Statement of Cash Flows.
For the year ended March 2018 the construction revenue recognised was 5.9m 2017: 20.8m.

These have now been addressed and first waste was accepted in December 2017.
The facility was formally opened in March 2018 and full service commencement is expected later in the year.
Negotiations commenced with the SPV owners and the Council at the Dumfries and Galloway PFI contract with a view to exiting the operating contract.
This contract was not capable of meeting the waste regulations in Scotland requiring full diversion from landfill and long-running negotiations were unable to agree the required amendments without materially increasing risk to Renewi, see note 3.4 for further details.
There have been no changes to the other arrangements during the year ended 31 March 2018.
Further disclosures in respect of service concession arrangements as required by paragraph 6 SIC 29 are provided on pages 54 to 59 of the Municipal operating review.

Operating assets and liabilities continued 4.7 Trade and other receivables Accounting policy Trade receivables do not carry interest and are recognised initially at their fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying value and the value of estimated future cash flows.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited in the Income Statement.
The Group has entered into invoice finance facilities whereby certain of its trade receivables are sold to third parties on a monthly basis.
Trade receivables subject to these arrangements are derecognised when the Groups rights to receive cash flows and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.
For trade receivables where the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and control has not passed to the third party, the Group continues to recognise part of the trade receivable according to the Groups continuing exposure to the risks and rewards of the financial asset.
This is determined by the extent to which the Group remains exposed to changes in the value of the transferred asset being the remaining late payment risk and is included within trade receivables and other payables.
The Group continues to perform the servicing of the receivables sold and is not authorised to use the receivables sold other than in its capacity as servicer.
The value of this service is not considered material for specific disclosure.
Other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Deferred consideration receivable is provided for at the NPV of the Groups expected receipt at the date of disposal.
The likelihood of receipt for deferred consideration where conditional on meeting certain performance targets is considered on disposal.
Trade and other receivables are analysed as follows: 2018 2017 m m Non-current assets Deferred consideration 0.6 0.8 Prepayments 4.0 2.3 4.6 3.1 Current assets Trade receivables 162.2 144.5 Provision for impairment of receivables 7.2 8.5 Trade receivables net 155.0 136.0 Accrued income 56.1 53.0 Deferred consideration 0.2 Other receivables 30.4 30.7 Prepayments 16.1 15.0 257.8 234.7 As at 31 March 2018, the carrying amount included in trade and other receivables representing the Groups continuing involvement in trade receivables, subject to invoice finance facilities, totalled 3.8m 2017: 4.0m in trade receivables and 12.9m 2017: 12.9m in other receivables.

The Group considers that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.
There is no concentration of credit risk with respect to trade and other receivables as the Group has a large number of customers internationally dispersed with no individual customer owing a significant amount.
The carrying amounts of trade and other receivables are denominated in the following currencies: 2018 2017 m m Sterling 34.9 34.8 Euro 224.9 201.6 Canadian Dollar 2.6 1.4 262.4 237.8 151 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Section 4.

Where the effect of the time value of money is material the value of a provision is the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation.
A discount is applied to recognise the time value of money and is unwound over the life of the provision.
The discount rates are reviewed at each year end with consideration given to appropriate market rates and the risk in relation to each provision.
The unwinding of the discount to present value is included within finance costs.
The Groups policies on provisions for specific areas are: Site restoration and aftercare provisions are recognised at the net present value NPV of the estimated future expenditure required to settle the Groups restoration and aftercare obligations at its landfill and mineral extraction sites.
Full provision is made for the Groups unavoidable costs in relation to restoration liabilities.
Provision is made for the NPV of post closure costs aftercare as the aftercare liability arises.
Costs are charged to the Income Statement based on the quantity of waste deposited in the year and when the obligation recognised as a provision gives access to future economic benefits an asset is recognised in property, plant and equipment.
Onerous contract provisions are recognised when under a contract the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligation under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received.
Provision for restructuring costs is recognised when a detailed formal plan exists and those affected by that plan have a valid expectation that the restructuring will be carried out.

The Groups minimum unavoidable costs have been reassessed at the year end and the net present value fully provided for.
These costs are expected to be paid over a period of up to 33 years from the balance sheet date and may be impacted by a number of factors including changes in legislation and technology.
Aftercare Post-closure costs of landfill sites, including such items as monitoring, gas and leachate management and licensing, have been estimated by management based on current best practice and technology available.
These costs may be impacted by a number of factors including changes in legislation and technology.
The dates of payments of these aftercare costs are uncertain but are anticipated to be over a period of at least 30 years from closure of the relevant landfill site.
Restructuring The restructuring provision relates to redundancy and related costs incurred as part of previous structural cost programmes in the legacy businesses and more recently, restructuring initiatives including the delivery of merger related synergies.
As at 31 March 2018 the provision is expected to be spent in the following year as affected employees leave the business.
Onerous contracts Onerous contracts are provided at the net present value of either exiting the contracts or fulfilling our obligations under the contracts.
The provisions are to be utilised over the period of the contracts to which they relate with the latest date being 2040.
Further details of the additions in the year principally relate to the UK Municipal business and are shown in note 3.4.
Other Other provisions principally cover dilapidations, long-service employee awards, legal claims, warranties and indemnities.
Under the terms of the agreements for the disposal of certain businesses, the Group has given a number of warranties and indemnities to the purchasers which may give rise to payments.
153 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Section 5.
Capital structure and financing This section outlines how the Group manages its capital structure and related financing costs.
It includes cash, borrowings, derivatives and the equity of the Group.
The instruments in place enable the Group to maintain the required capital structure in order to finance the activities both now and in the future.
Net debt reflects the Groups cash and cash equivalents, core borrowings and PFI PPP non-recourse net debt.
Core net debt includes cash and cash equivalents but excludes the non-recourse net debt relating to the UK PFI PPP contracts.

Where the Group has a legal right to offset with a financial institution and the intention to settle net, then bank overdrafts are offset against the cash balances.
Cash and cash equivalents are analysed as follows: 2018 2017 m m Cash at bank and in hand 63.8 74.8 Short-term deposits 0.1 0.1 63.9 74.9 The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents are denominated in the following currencies: 2018 2017 m m Sterling 12.3 18.1 Euro 50.8 56.2 Canadian Dollar 0.8 0.6 63.9 74.9 154 Section 5.
Capital structure and financing continued 5.3 Borrowings Accounting policy Interest bearing loans and retail bonds are recorded at their initial fair value which normally reflects the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
When the Group exchanges with an existing lender one debt instrument for another one with substantially different terms, such exchange is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability.
Similarly the Group accounts for substantial modifications of the terms of an existing liability or part of it as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new liability.
The terms are considered to be substantially different if the discounted present value of the cash flows under the new terms, including any fees paid and discounted using the original effective rate, is at least 10% different from the discounted present value of the remaining cash flows of the original financial liability.
Any gain or loss on extinguishment is recognised in the Income Statement.
Where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a leased asset, the lease is treated as a finance lease.
Leased assets are included in property, plant and equipment at the total of the capital elements of the payments during the lease term and the corresponding obligation is included in borrowings.
Depreciation is provided to write down the assets over the shorter of the expected useful economic life and the lease term, unless there is reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership of the asset by the end of the lease term, in which case it is depreciated over its useful economic life.

Capital structure and financing continued 5.3 Borrowings continued Core borrowings The Groups core bank loans and retail bonds are unsecured and have cross guarantees from members of the Group.
At 31 March 2018, the Group had a core Euro denominated multicurrency bank facility of 575m 2017: 600m consisting of a 143.8m 2017: 143.8m term loan and 431.2m 2017: 456.2m revolving credit facility.
The facility matures on 29 September 2022 following the exercise of the first one year extension option and is subject to a further one year extension option.
At 31 March 2018 the term loan was fully drawn at 118.8m 2017: 123.0m and 172.0m 2017: 156.2m of the revolving credit facility was drawn for borrowings in Euros, Canadian dollars and Sterling.
The remaining 205.0m 2017: 233.9m was available for drawing under the revolving credit facility of which 46.1m 2017: 69.7m was utilised for ancillary guarantee facilities.
At 31 March 2018 the Group had two issues of retail bonds to investors in Belgium and Luxembourg which are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The retail bonds due July 2019 of 87.5m 100m 2017: 85.2m 100m have an annual coupon of 4.23% and the green retail bonds due June 2022 of 87.1m 100m 2017: 85.0m 100m have an annual coupon of 3.65%.
Included within core borrowings are capitalised loan fees of 1.5m 2017: 0.8m.

There are no restrictions imposed by lessors to take out further debt or leases.
PFI PPP non-recourse net debt The PFI PPP non-recourse debt is held in three PFI PPP companies: Argyll & Bute, Cumbria and Barnsley, Doncaster & Rotherham with maturities on 15 January 2023, 30 September 2032 and 30 June 2037 respectively.
Each UK Municipal PFI PPP company has non-recourse loan facilities which are secured by a legal mortgage over any land and a fixed and floating charge over the assets of the PFI PPP company.
PFI PPP cash and cash equivalents are offset against the non-recourse gross debt as they are subject to offsetting arrangements under the debt facilities.

Capital structure and financing continued 5.3 Borrowings continued Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group does not have sufficient financial resources to meet its obligations as they fall due.
The Group primarily manages liquidity risk by monitoring forecast cash flows to ensure that revolving credit facility drawdowns are arranged as necessary and an adequate level of headroom is maintained.
The way the Group manages liquidity risk has not changed from the previous year.

In the majority of cases subsidiaries holding non-recourse PFI PPP debt and financial assets are restricted in their ability to transfer funds to the parent in the form of cash dividends or to repay loans and advances.
This is due to the terms of the financing facility agreements and require lender approval to make such transfers.
The following table analyses the Groups financial liabilities and net settled derivative financial instruments into relevant maturity groupings.

Capital structure and financing continued 5.4 Net finance charges Accounting policy Finance charges, including direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the Income Statement using the effective interest rate method.
Interest receivable on financial assets relating to PFI PPP contracts is added to the financial asset based on the rate implied at the start of the PPP PFI project.
Net finance charges are analysed as follows 2018 2017 m m Finance charges Interest payable on borrowings wholly repayable within five years 16.6 7.9 Interest payable on borrowings repayable after five years 2.9 Interest payable on PFI PPP non-recourse net debt 7.0 7.3 Unwinding of discount on provisions note 4.9 5.6 2.6 Interest charge on the retirement benefit schemes note 7.2 0.6 0.3 Amortisation of loan fees 0.3 1.0 Other finance costs 2.1 1.1 Total finance charges 32.2 23.1 Finance income Interest receivable on financial assets relating to PFI PPP contracts note 4.4 9.7 9.6 Unwinding of discount on deferred consideration receivable 0.2 0.2 Interest receivable on other loans and receivables 2.4 0.5 Total finance income 12.3 10.3 Exceptional finance charges note 3.4 11.6 Net finance charges 19.9 24.4 5.5 Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities Accounting policy In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group only holds derivative financial instruments to manage the Groups exposure to financial risk.
The Group does not hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
The exposure to financial risk includes: Interest risk and foreign exchange risk on the Groups variable rate borrowings: Commodity risk in relation to diesel consumption: and Foreign exchange risk on the Groups off-take contacts in the UK Municipal business.
The Group manages these risks through a range of derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, crosscurrency interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts and fuel derivatives.
Derivative financial instruments are considered to be used for hedging purposes when they alter the risk profile of an underlying exposure of the Group in line with the Groups risk management policies.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
Such hedges are expected at inception to be highly effective and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they are designated.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into profit or loss as the hedged cash flows occur.
Any ineffectiveness is recognised in the Income Statement as a non-trading income or charge.
Certain derivative financial instruments do not quality for hedge accounting.
Changes in the fair value of such instruments are recognised immediately in the Income Statement as a non-trading income or charge.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecast transaction occurs at which point it is recognised in the Income Statement.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the Income Statement immediately.

Cumulative losses recognised in equity on the derivative financial instruments at 31 March 2018 were 22.2m 2017: 29.4m with a gain of 7.2m recognised in the current year 2017: 1.3m in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
There was no ineffectiveness to be recorded for the cash flow hedges 2017: nil.
The foreign exchange gain on translation of the borrowings under the cross currency interest rate swaps of 2.3m 2017: 0.9m is included within the 7.2m 2017: 1.3m gain recognised in other comprehensive income.
Cross-currency interest rate swaps The notional principal amount of the outstanding forward cross currency interest rate swaps at 31 March 2018 was 147.6m 2017: 75.0m.
The Group holds three contracts: a floating rate term loan borrowing of Canadian dollar $50.0m swapped to 36.1m at a fixed interest rate of 2.18% expiring February 2020, a floating rate revolving credit facility RCF borrowing of Sterling 45m swapped to 53.0m at a fixed interest rate of 2.17% expiring February 2020 and a RCF borrowing of Sterling 75m swapped to 85.0m at a fixed rate of 1.71% expiring September 2019.
Interest rate cap The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate cap contract at 31 March 2018 was 109.6m 2017: 106.9m.
Under this contract the 3-month Euribor interest rate payable on 109.6m 2017: 106.9m 125m of term loan and RCF borrowings is capped at 0.25% until February 2020.
Fuel derivatives The value of wholesale fuel covered by fuel derivatives at 31 March 2018 amounted to 12.6m 2017: 12.6m.
The combined Group has annual usage across the Netherlands and Belgium of approximately 53m litres of diesel per annum of which approximately 33m litres has been fixed at an average of 0.36 per litre for the year to 31 March 2019 and a further 7m litres has been fixed at an average of 0.37 per litre for the year to 31 March 2020.
Forward foreign exchange contracts The notional principal amount of the outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts at 31 March 2018 was 11.4m 2017: 10.1m.
Under these contracts the UK Municipal business has fixed the Sterling rate of underlying Euro off-take contracts on a monthly basis at an average GBP:EUR rate of 1.12 expiring March 2019.
Interest rate swaps relating to PFI PPP contracts The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 March 2018 was 97.1m 2017: 100.4m.
Under these contracts the Libor rate of PPP PFI non-recourse borrowing for Argyll & Bute, Cumbria and Barnsley Doncaster & Rotherham projects are fixed at rates of 5.8%, 4.8% and 3.4% respectively from inception to expiry on 16 January 2023, 30 September 2032 and 30 June 2037 respectively.
The gains and losses recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income for cash flow hedges will be released to the Income Statement within finance costs until the repayment of the non-recourse borrowings.
159 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Section 5.
Capital structure and financing continued 5.6 Fair value hierarchy, fair values and carrying values of financial instruments Fair value hierarchy The Group uses the following hierarchy of valuation techniques to determine the fair value of financial instruments: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly: Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data During the year ended 31 March 2018, there were no transfers between level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements and no transfers into and out of level 3.
Valuation techniques used to derive Level 2 fair values The fair values of interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts and fuel derivatives are determined by discounting the future cash flows using the applicable period-end yield curve.
For the retail bonds, the fair value is based on indicative market pricing.
The table below presents the Groups assets and liabilities measured at level 2 fair values: 2018 2017 m m Assets Derivative financial instruments note 5.5 1.9 0.3 1.9 0.3 Liabilities Derivative financial instruments note 5.5 29.2 30.8 Retail bonds 176.6 177.4 205.8 208.2 Carrying value of financial assets and financial liabilities 2018 2017 Financial assets Note m m Loans and receivables Loans to associates and joint ventures 4.3 19.8 19.9 Trade and other receivables excluding prepayments 4.7 242.3 220.5 Cash and cash equivalents 5.2 63.9 74.9 Financial assets relating to PFI PPP contracts 4.4 179.9 178.8 Derivative financial instruments Fuel derivatives 5.5 1.5 Interest rate cap 5.5 0.3 Cross-currency interest rate swaps 5.5 0.4 Available for sale financial assets Unlisted investments 4.3 4.1 4.0 511.9 498.4 The trade and other receivables excluding prepayments value as at March 2017 has been restated for acquisition accounting adjustments in relation to the VGG acquisition.
Capital structure and financing continued 5.6 Fair value hierarchy, fair values and carrying values of financial instruments continued The Group considers that the fair value of financial assets is not materially different to their carrying value.
For unlisted investments the carrying value is measured at cost as the range of possible fair values is significant and the Group has no current plans to dispose of these investments.

The Group considers that the fair value of bank loans, trade and other payables and finance lease obligations are not materially different to their carrying value.
5.7 Financial risk management objectives and policies The Group is exposed to market risk interest rate risk and commodity price risk, foreign exchange risk, liquidity risk and counterparty credit risk.
The Groups Treasury Committee is charged with managing and controlling risk relating to the financing and liquidity of the Group under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
The Group does not enter into speculative transactions.
Interest rate risk Changes in interest rates could have an impact on the interest cover covenant of the Groups core facilities and on the interest charge in the Income Statement.
In order to monitor and manage the risk, borrowings and the expected interest cost for the year are frequently forecasted and sensitised for potential changes.
The Group has continued to limit its exposure to interest rate risk by using fixed rate retail bonds, fixed rate finance leases, cross currency interest rate swaps and an interest rate cap.
The proportion of the Groups core borrowing that was fixed or hedged at 31 March 2018 was 466.6m 2017: 387.1m or 93% 2017: 78%.
Additionally the PFI PPP non-recourse floating rate borrowings are hedged using interest rate swaps which hedge the interest cash flows.
The interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps are accounted for under IAS 39 with changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps being recognised directly in reserves, as they are effective hedges.
The interest rate swap in relation to Argyll & Bute has not been designated as a hedge by the Group therefore it is classified as held for trading in accordance with IAS 39.
161 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Section 5.
Capital structure and financing continued 5.7 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Interest rate sensitivity for core borrowings Interest on the floating rate term and revolving credit facilities will vary as interest rates increase or decrease.
If rates had moved by 1% the impact on profit before tax would have been a loss or gain of 1.1m 2017: 0.8m based on the average core bank borrowing during the year.
The fair values of cross currency interest rate swaps for hedging the core borrowing are determined with reference to floating market interest rates.
A 1% increase in interest rates would have reduced the fair value of the interest rate hedge liabilities and resulted in a pre-tax gain in other comprehensive income of 2.7m 2017: 2.3m.
A 1% decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of the interest rate hedge liabilities and led to a pre-tax loss in other comprehensive income of 2.7m 2017: 2.4m.
The fair value of the interest rate cap used for hedging the core borrowing was determined with reference to floating market interest rates.
A 1% increase in interest rates would have increased the fair value of the interest rate cap asset and resulted in a pre-tax gain in other comprehensive income of 1.0m 2017: 1.6m.
A 1% decrease in interest rates would not have impacted the fair value of the interest rate cap asset in the current year, in the prior year a 1% decrease would have reduced the fair value of the interest rate cap and led to a pre-tax loss in other comprehensive income of 0.2m.
Interest rate sensitivity for PFI PPP non-recourse borrowings There is no unhedged amount of the PFI PPP facilities.
The fair values of interest rate swaps used for hedging of PFI PPP non-recourse borrowings are determined with reference to floating market interest rate.
A 1% increase in interest rates would have reduced the fair value of the interest rate swap liabilities and resulted in a pre-tax gain in other comprehensive income of 9.6m 2017: 11.0m.
A 1% decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of the interest rate swap liabilities and led to a pre-tax loss in other comprehensive income of 10.9m 2017: 12.6m.
Foreign exchange risk The Group operates in Europe and Canada and is exposed to translation risk on the value of assets denominated in Euros and Canadian Dollars into Sterling.
This exposure is reduced by borrowing in Euros and Canadian Dollars.
The Group applies hedge accounting principles to net investments in foreign operations and the related borrowings.
The Group has limited transactional risk as the Groups subsidiaries conduct the majority of their business in their respective functional currencies.
Some risk arises in Euros on the export of processed waste from the UK to Europe which is managed through the use of forward exchange contracts.
The Group has designated the carrying value of Euro borrowings excluding finance leases of 283.3m 2017: 349.8m fair value of 285.3m 2017: 357.0m as a net investment hedge of the Groups investments denominated in Euros.
The hedge was 100% effective for the year ended 31 March 2018 2017: 100% and as a result the related exchange loss of 9.8m 2017: 17.2m on translation of the borrowings into Sterling has been recognised in the exchange reserve.
Foreign exchange sensitivity The impact of a change in foreign exchange rates of 10% on the Groups profit before tax would be 3.6m 2017: 2.3m and the impact on underlying profit before tax would have been 6.0m 2017: 3.4m.
The fair values of cross currency interest rate swaps for hedging the core borrowing are determined with reference to spot foreign exchanges rates.
A 10% increase in the Euro foreign exchange rate against the Canadian Dollar and Sterling would have increased the fair value of the cross currency interest rate swap liabilities and resulted in a pre-tax loss in other comprehensive income of 13.9m 2017: 7.3m.
A 10% decrease in the Euro foreign exchange rate against the Canadian Dollar and Sterling would have reduced the fair value of the cross currency interest rate swap liability or created an asset and led to a pre-tax gain in other comprehensive income of 17.0m 2017: 8.9m.
Commodity price risk and sensitivity The Group is exposed to diesel price changes which are managed using forward contracts.
The Group manages other exposures to prices of paper, plastics, metals, residual fuels and other recyclates associated with off-take through commercial contracting.
The impact of a change in unhedged wholesale fuel prices excluding duty of 10% on the Groups profit before tax would have been 0.9m 2017: 0.4m.
Capital structure and financing continued 5.7 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss where counterparties are not able to meet their obligations.
At 31 March 2018 the amount of credit risk on cash and short-term deposits totalled 63.9m 2017: 74.9m.
Trade and other receivables mainly comprise amounts due from customers for services performed.
Management considers that the exposure of any single customer is not significant and that where credit quality is in doubt, adequate provision has been made for probable losses.
At 31 March 2018 the amount of credit risk on trade and other receivables amounted to 242.3m 2017: 220.5m.
The Group does not hold any collateral as security.
The financial assets relating to PFI PPP contracts are recoverable from the future revenues relating to these contracts.
Management consider that as the counterparties for the future revenues are local authorities or councils, there is minimal credit risk.
At 31 March 2018 the amount of credit risk on financial assets amounted to 179.9m 2017: 178.8m.
5.8 Capital management The Group actively manages the capital available to fund the Group, comprising equity and reserves together with core debt funding.
In order to make decisions over where capital is allocated, the Group monitors the return on capital employed.
The Group has a funding strategy to ensure there is an appropriate debt to equity ratio as well as an appropriate debt maturity profile.
The strategy is based on the requirements of the Companys Articles of Association, which state that borrowings should be limited to three times the level of capital and reserves, which is the equity attributable to the owners of the parent.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as core net debt divided by total capital.
The gearing ratios at 31 March 2018 and 2017 were as follows: 2018 2017 Note m m Total core borrowings 5.3 502.6 498.8 Less: cash and cash equivalents 5.2 63.9 74.9 Core net debt 438.7 423.9 Total equity 382.4 437.4 Total capital 821.1 861.3 Gearing ratio 53% 49% The Group has to comply with a number of banking covenants which are set out in the core bank facility agreements including interest cover and the ratio of debt to EBITDA of the Group.
There are other restrictions in the loan documentation concerning acquisitions, disposals, security and other issues.
The Group has complied with its banking covenants during the year.
5.9 Equity Accounting policy Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or share options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Any excess of the net proceeds over the nominal value of any shares issued is credited to the share premium account.

Acquisitions and disposals The Group completed a major acquisition on 28 February 2017 for the Van Gansewinkel Groep BV VGG and the purchase price accounting has been completed in the current year.
Two small acquisitions were made in the current year and there were no business disposals.
6.1 Acquisitions Accounting policy The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations.
The consideration transferred for the acquisition of the subsidiary is the fair value of assets transferred, liabilities incurred or assumed including the equity interests issued by the Group.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed, meeting the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3, are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
The fair value of businesses acquired may include waste permits, licences and customer relationships with the value calculated by discounting the future attributable revenue streams, which are recognised as intangible assets and amortised.
The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity on an acquisition by acquisition basis either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests proportionate share of the acquired entitys net identifiable assets.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
The costs of acquisition are charged to the Income Statement in the year in which they are incurred.
Van Gansewinkel Groep VGG acquisition On 28 February 2017, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Van Gansewinkel Groep BV VGG for 204.9m being 24.9m cash paid, consideration shares of 180.7m net of 0.7m received subsequently in accordance with the terms of the Purchase agreement.
The fair value of the 190,187,502 shares issued was based on the published share price on the date of acquisition of 95p per share.
The fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in respect of the VGG acquisition were: m Intangible assets: Customer relationships 20.9 Intangible assets: Licenses 8.2 Intangible assets: Permits 5.5 Intangible assets: Software 8.6 Intangible assets: Leasehold title 1.7 Property, plant and equipment 313.6 Investments 2.5 Trade and other receivables 107.8 Assets held for sale 0.3 Inventory 11.1 Deferred taxation 5.6 Current tax receivable 0.1 Cash and cash equivalents 78.2 564.1 Trade and other payables 188.4 Provisions 100.2 Defined benefit pension schemes deficit 8.1 Deferred tax liability 44.3 Current tax payable 7.8 Derivatives 12.6 Borrowings Syndicated facility 276.9 Borrowings Finance leases, overdraft and other loans 41.7 680.0 Net identifiable assets acquired 115.9 Less: Non-controlling interests 7.0 Add: Goodwill arising on acquisition 327.8 Net assets acquired 204.9 165 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Section 6.
Acquisitions and disposals continued 6.1 Acquisitions continued At 31 March 2017 the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in respect of the VGG acquisition were provisional.
These have now been retrospectively adjusted to reflect new information obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date.
The impact of the restatement has been to increase property, plant and equipment by 28.5m, other intangibles by 1.2m, trade and other receivables by 0.7m, trade and other payables by 1.5m, provisions by 3.7m, deferred tax liability by 3.9m and corporation tax liability by 3.2m with a reduction in goodwill of 9.4m, acquisition intangibles of 9.4m and non-controlling interests of 0.7m.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition is attributable to managements expectations in regard to VGGs growth prospects and margin improvements as well as synergies to be achieved post acquisition.
None of the goodwill on this acquisition is expected to be deductible for tax.
Other acquisitions In December 2017 ATM in the Hazardous Waste division acquired MVO Moerdijk BV, subsequently renamed ATM Terra BV, for a consideration of 6.3m.
The business comprises a waterside quay and warehousing under a long-term lease from the Dutch authorities and a permit together with soil offset and deferred tax liabilities.
The provisional fair value of the total identifiable net liabilities acquired was 6.7m resulting in goodwill of 13.0m representing the possibilities for strategic expansion.
In March 2018 the Netherlands Commercial division made a small tuck in business combination comprising of plant and equipment and customer relationships for a consideration of 0.2m.
6.2 Discontinued operations The table below show the results of the UK Solid Waste discontinued operations which are included in the Income Statement.
2018 2017 m m Administrative expenses 0.1 Trading loss before exceptional and non-trading items 0.1 Exceptional and non-trading items 0.5 0.5 Operating profit before tax on discontinued operations 0.4 0.5 Taxation Profit after tax on discontinued operations 0.4 0.5 The 0.5m non-trading item related to profit on sale of an unused piece of land which was impaired in the previous year.
The net cash inflow generated from the discontinued operations included in the consolidated cash flow statement was 0.4m 2017: 0.4m.
6.3 Assets classified as held for sale Accounting policy Assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the assets are available for sale in their present condition.
Assets classified as held for sale At 31 March 2018 the Group had 0.3m 2017: 0.3m of property, plant and equipment held for sale.
These assets were acquired through the VGG acquisition and consist of a piece of land on the Maarheeze site in the Netherlands which was formerly used as a waste collection site.

The actual number of VGG employees for the month of March 2017 was 3,709.
7.2 Retirement benefit schemes The Group operates defined benefit and defined contribution schemes in the UK and overseas.
For the defined benefit schemes actuarial valuations are carried out as determined by the trustees at intervals of not more than three years.
Accounting policy The Group accounts for pensions and similar benefits under IAS 19 revised Employee Benefits.
The pension cost for the defined benefit schemes is assessed in accordance with managements best estimates using the advice of an independent qualified actuary and assumptions in the latest actuarial valuation.
For defined benefit plans, obligations are measured at discounted present value whilst plan assets are recorded at fair value.
The operating and financing costs of the plans are recognised separately in the Income Statement.
Interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined pension liability.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full through the Statement of Comprehensive Income: surpluses are recognised only to the extent that they are recoverable.
Movements in irrecoverable surpluses are recognised immediately in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged to the Income Statement as they become due.
The Group participates in several multiemployer schemes in the Netherlands and Belgium.
With the exception of certain schemes in Belgium, these are accounted for as defined contribution plans as it is not possible to split the assets and liabilities of the schemes between participating companies, and the Group has been informed by the schemes that it has no obligation to make additional contributions in the event that the schemes have an overall deficit.

Employee benefits continued 7.2 Retirement benefit schemes continued UK defined benefit scheme The UK defined benefit pension scheme called the Shanks Group Pension Scheme covers eligible UK employees and is closed to new entrants.
The defined benefit plan provides benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life and the level of benefits provided depends on the members length of service and salary.
Plan assets are managed by the trustees.
There are four trustees, two appointed by the Company and two nominated by members, who are responsible for ensuring the scheme is run in accordance with the members best interests and the pension laws of the UK which are overseen by The Pensions Regulator.
The most recent triennial actuarial valuation of the Scheme, which was performed by independent qualified actuaries for the trustees of the Scheme, was carried out as at 5 April 2015.
The Group has agreed that it will aim to eliminate the pension plan deficit with an agreed annual deficit contribution of 3.1m for a further four years.
The total estimated contributions expected to be paid to the scheme in the year ending 31 March 2019 are 3.3m.
The schemes assets of 168.3m 2017: 174.0m are invested via Aons Delegated Consulting Service which is a fiduciary investment management platform managed by Hewitt Risk Management Services Limited.
The delegated mandate is split into a growth and a hedging component and the allocation to each is determined by the investment objectives set by the trustees.
The growth component of 108.1m 2017: 97.0m comprises the following asset classes: equities, fixed income, debt, property, infrastructure and hedge funds.
The hedging component of 60.2m 2017: 77.0m comprises a mix of leveraged gilt funds and cash.
The significant actuarial assumptions adopted at the balance sheet date were as follows: 2018 2017 % p. a.
Discount rate 2.7 2.6 Rate of price inflation 3.2 3.3 Consumer price inflation 2.1 2.2 The discount rate assumption is derived from the single agency curve based on high quality AA rated bonds.
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements.
The assumptions are that a member currently aged 65 will live on average for a further 23 years if they are male and for a further 25 years if they are female.
For a member who retires in 2038 at age 65 the assumptions are that they will live on average for around a further 25 years after retirement if they are male or for a further 27 years after retirement if they are female.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is approximately 20 years.
The sensitivity of the net defined benefit obligation to changes in the weighted principal assumptions is: Impact on net defined benefit obligation Change in Increase in Decrease in assumption assumption assumption % m m Discount rate 0.25 8.7 9.0 Rate of price inflation 0.25 4.9 4.9 Consumer price inflation 0.25 4.9 4.9 Increase Decrease by 1 year in by 1 year in assumption assumption m m Life expectancy 6.6 6.7 The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, as changes in assumptions may be correlated.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the balance sheet.
Employee benefits continued 7.2 Retirement benefit schemes continued Overseas defined benefit schemes The overseas net defined benefit obligation relates to funded plans, mainly insurance contracts managed by insurers, in both the Netherlands and Belgium.
There are various schemes which are based on final salaries and in some cases on average salaries.
The assets consist of qualifying insurance policies which match the vested benefits.
The vested benefits will be financed immediately for the pension plan.
The buildup of rights for inactives are indexed on the basis of additional interest and rights of active employees are being indexed unconditionally with the price-inflation figure.
There are no unfunded plans.
The total estimated contributions expected to be paid to the schemes in the year ending 31 March 2018 are 2.4m.
The significant actuarial assumptions adopted at the balance sheet date for the most significant scheme were as follows: 2018 2017 % p. a.
Discount rate 2.2 2.2 Rate of salary inflation 2.5 2.5 Rate of price inflation 2.0 2.0 The discount rate assumption is based on interest rates applying to high quality corporate bonds with a term approximately equal to the term of the related pension liability.
The assumptions are that a member currently aged 65 will live on average for a further 22 years if they are male and for a further 24 years if they are female.
For a member who retires in 2038 at age 65 the assumptions are that they will live on average for around a further 24 years after retirement if they are male or for a further 26 years after retirement if they are female.

Asset volatility - The UK scheme liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields and if plan assets underperform this yield, this will result in a deficit.
The UK pension schemes assets are held in a portfolio of pooled funds which are single priced at the net asset value.
The investment objective of the portfolio is to achieve long-term total returns in excess of a nominal portfolio of long-dated Sterling bonds through a diversified portfolio of collective investment schemes, which may include derivatives.
Investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.
The trustees have agreed an underlying strategy with the Company so that any ongoing improvements in the schemes funding position would trigger movements from growth assets to non-growth assets in order to protect and consolidate such improvements.
The assets in the overseas pension schemes consist of qualifying insurance policies which match the benefits that will be paid to employees.
Inflation risk - The majority of benefit obligations are linked to inflation and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
For the UK scheme caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect the plan against extreme inflation.
Life expectancy - The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in the life of the member will result in an increase in the liabilities.
Changes in bond yields - A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the schemes bond holdings.
171 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Section 7.
Employee benefits continued 7.2 Retirement benefit schemes continued Other overseas schemes The total cost in the year for other overseas pensions was 24.2m 2017: 11.2m.
In the Netherlands in particular, most employees are members of either a multi-employer pension scheme or other similar externally funded schemes, including Government funded schemes.
These schemes are treated as defined contribution plans as it is not possible to separately identify the Groups share of the assets and liabilities of those schemes.
The Group has been informed by the schemes that it has no obligation to make additional contributions in the event that the schemes have an overall deficit.
In addition there are a number of pension schemes in Belgium which are considered as defined benefit schemes under IAS 19.
At 31 March 2018 the potential liability to the Group was estimated and determined as not significant.
7.3 Share-based payments As described in the Remuneration Report, the Group issues equity-settled share-based payments under a Savings Related Share Option Scheme SRSOS, a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and a Deferred Annual Bonus DAB arrangement.
Further details and performance metrics of both LTIPs and DABs can be found in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 92 to 107.
Accounting policy The Group issues equity-settled share-based awards to certain employees.
The fair value of share-based awards is determined at the date of grant and expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity based on the Groups estimate of the shares that will eventually vest.
At each balance sheet date the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on service and non-market performance conditions.
The amount expensed is adjusted over the vesting period for changes in the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest, except for changes resulting from any market-related performance conditions.

The Monte Carlo valuation model is used to determine the weighted average fair value of the market conditions element of awards granted.
Expected volatility has been calculated using average volatility historical data over a three-year period from the grant date.
The riskfree interest rate is based on the implied yield of zero-coupon government bonds with a remaining term equal to the expected life.
The expected life used in the models equals the vesting period.
The awards granted in 2016 17 vest after three years, three and a half years and four and a half years.
The awards granted during 2015 16 and 2017 18 vest after three years, four years and five years.
There is no service condition after three years on any of the awards granted, just a holding period of between half a year and two years.
Charge for the year The Group recognised a total charge of 1.8m 2017: 0.5m relating to equity-settled share-based payments.
The DAB awards for the year ended March 2018 have not yet been granted and therefore the charge is based on an estimate.
