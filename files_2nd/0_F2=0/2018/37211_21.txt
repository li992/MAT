Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements Year ended 31 December 2018 1.
General information Just Eat plc the Company and subsidiaries controlled by the Company together, the Group operate a leading global marketplace for online food delivery.
Further details about our operations and principal activities are disclosed within the Strategic Report on pages 02 to 37.
The Company is a public limited company listed on the premium listing segment of the Official List of the Financial Conduct Authority and is incorporated and domiciled inEngland and Wales.
Our registered address is Masters House, 107 Hammersmith Road, London W14 0QH, UnitedKingdom.
Basis of preparation This section describes how these financial statements have been prepared, as well as the critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty that could potentially have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements in the next 12 months.
This Note also sets out the significant accounting policies that relate to the financial statements as a whole and the impact of new accounting standards.
Where an accounting policy is applicable to a specific Note to the financial statements, the policy is described within that Note.
In accordance with accounting standards, where balances are considered to be immaterial to these financial statements, no further disclosures are provided.
These include available-for-sale investments, inventories and the detailed information on trade receivables.
We have prepared the financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed by the European Union IFRS, those parts of the Companies Act 2006 the Act applicable to companies reporting under IFRS and Article 4 of the International Accounting Standard IAS Regulations.
Critical judgements in the application of accounting policies For some companies, critical judgements can be made when applying accounting policies that could have a significant impact on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements.
No such judgements were made by us in the current year.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty At the balance sheet date, key assumptions regarding the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty are made.
A significant risk may exist where changes to these assumptions cause a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
The potential impairment of goodwill and uncertain tax positions are the only key sources of estimation uncertainty which could realise this risk.
Impairment of goodwill The Consolidated Balance Sheet includes significant carrying values of goodwill and identifying whether there are indicators of impairment requires a good understanding of the drivers of value behind the asset.
This is of significance to the Group due to the impairment of the goodwill associated with the Australia & New Zealand ANZ cash-generating unit CGU in 2017.
At each reporting period end, an assessment is performed in order to determine whether there are any indicators of impairment.
This involves considering the performance of the business and any significant changes to the markets inwhich we operate.
Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal FVLCD and its value in use VIU.
The key assumptions used in the VIU calculations are the discount rate and the anticipated future cash flows.
The keyassumptions used in the FVLCD are similar to the VIU.
However, the assumptions are based on a likely market participants perspective when completing a discounted cash flow model and are therefore guided by advice received from third party advisers.
In both the VIU and FVLCD calculations, discount rates are used which reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the particular CGU.
The assumptions on growth in future cash flows are based on past experience, recent results and future expectations, in particular, order growth.
The main drivers for future order growth are the continued investment in marketing, which helps drive brand awareness and customer traffic to our platforms, and the investment in technology, which ensures the platforms are stable, secure, efficient and scalable.
This investment will assist in increasing both the relevant overall market as well as the CGUs market share over the medium to long term.
Winning large chains of Quick Service Restaurants is also a key driver for future growth, due to the impact on order volumes and the effect of encouraging new users to our platform.
Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Just Eat plc 99 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Year ended 31 December 2018 2.
Basis of preparation continued Key sources of estimation uncertainty continued Impairment of goodwill continued Future expected cash flows reflect the most recent financial projections presented to the Board.
A further two years of growth projections are applied to the initial projections, based on previous experience of growth rates across all CGUs.
For the majority of the CGUs, a long-term growth rate is applied to the fifth year of our projected cash flows, equivalent to the long-term rates of inflation expected in the relevant economies.
However, some markets are expected to experience a period of sustained high growth continuing from the end of the fifth year before reaching relative stability the medium term.
Due to the higher level of uncertainty resulting from this growth stage, these are the CGUs with the highest risk of impairment.
The ANZ and Italian CGUs have seen significant investment in delivery capability in 2018.
The full impact of this investment is expected to crystallise through the medium term, following a pattern similar to that experienced by the SkipTheDishes business in Canada.
For these CGUs, it is appropriate to use forecasts extending beyond five years as it correlates with experience in similar markets.
The medium-term period extends to eight years for both CGUs.
Mexico is one of the least mature markets we have operations in and therefore extrapolating short-term cash outflows could indicate an impairment.
However, the business has also been valued based on a potential disposal value and given that this is greater than the carrying value, no impairment is required.
The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for ANZ, Mexico, Italy and all other CGUs, including a sensitivity analysis, are disclosed and further explained in Note 12.
Uncertain tax positions Our tax charge is the sum of the total current and deferred tax charges arising in each jurisdiction.
As a result ofourgrowing global footprint and the changing global tax environment and income taxes arising in numerous jurisdictions, there are some transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business.
The calculation of our total tax charge involves estimation and judgement in respect of certain matters where the tax impact is uncertain until a conclusion is reached with the relevant tax authority or through a legal process.
Resolving tax issues can take several years and is not always within our control.
Current tax liabilities are recognised for uncertain tax positions when we have a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that there will be a future outflow of funds to a taxing authority.
These may be, for example, in respect of enquiries raised and additional tax assessments issued.
Liabilities in respect of uncertain tax positions are measured based on interpretation of country-specific tax law and assigning probabilities to the possible likely outcomes and range of taxes payable in order to ascertain a weighted average probable liability.
In-house tax experts, external tax experts and previous experience are used to help assess the tax risks when determining and recognising such liabilities.
See Note 10 for further details of the 19.9 million tax provision held at 31 December 2018, which includes an amount relating to an ongoing transfer pricing audit in Denmark.
The tax provision held in relation to the Danish matter is calculated based on probability weighting of a range of possible outcomes, the most extreme of which is the full claim of 126.0 million.
Therefore, it is possible that a change in our estimate could result in a material adjustment within the next 12 months.
The key areas which are factored into our estimate of the likely outcome are: whether the basis for the claim made by the Danish authorities is valid: the valuation applied to the relevant assets: and the length of time over which royalty relief may be applied, ranging from 5 years to 25 years.
Where the final amounts payable are different to the liabilities recognised in previous periods, the required adjustments in respect of prior years are recorded in the current period in the income statement, or directly in equity, as appropriate.
Significant accounting policies that relate to the financial statements as a whole a Accounting convention These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for assets and liabilities acquired as part of a business combination, deferred contingent consideration, provisions, available-for-sale investments, and derivative financial instruments, which have been measured at fair value.
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, further detail of which is provided in the principal risks and uncertainties section of the Strategic Report on page 21.
The policies have been consistently applied to all years presented with the exception of the change in definition of operating profit as explained in Note 2e and the adoption of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with customers on 1 January 2018.
Neither of the two new accounting standards resulted in a restatement of the comparative figures.
b Basis of consolidation These consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, made up to 31 December each year.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which we obtain control and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.
Control comprises the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee, to be exposed to a variable return as a result from our involvement and to have the ability to use our power to affect the amount of our returns in the investee.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to align with our Group accounting policies.
All intercompany transactions and balances between Group entities within our Group, including unrealised profits arising from them, are eliminated upon consolidation.
100 Just Eat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial statements 2.
Basis of preparation continued Significant accounting policies that relate to the financial statements as a whole continued b Basis of consolidation continued Non-controlling interests represent the equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the Company and are presented separately within equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, separately from equity attributable to shareholders of the Company.
Losses within a subsidiary are attributed to the non-controlling interest even if that results in a deficit balance.
c Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each subsidiary are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates the functional currency.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each subsidiary are expressed in pound sterling, which is the functional currency ofthe Company, and also the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than that entitys functional currency foreign currencies are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value, that are denominated in foreign currencies, are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they arise, except for exchange differences on monetary items receivable or payable to a foreign operation where settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future therefore forming part of the net investment in the foreign operation, which are recognised initially in other comprehensive income and reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the net investment.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the monetary assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
Exchange differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity attributed to non-controlling interests as appropriate.
On the disposal of a foreign operation i. e. a disposal of our entire interest in a foreign operation, all of the accumulated exchange differences in respect of that operation attributable to us are reclassified to profit or loss.
Goodwill and intangible assets arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Exchange differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income.
d Asset impairment The carrying amounts of tangible and intangible assets including goodwill are reviewed at each reporting period end, together with any other assets under the scope of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, in order to assess whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any indication of impairment exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine if there is any impairment loss.
Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually, irrespective of whether there are any indicators of impairment.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the asset is assigned to a CGU.
Recoverable amount is defined as the higher of FVLCD and VIU.
Estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value with reference to discount rates that reflect the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates offuture cash flows have not been adjusted.
Our calculation of discount rates are performed based on a risk-free rate of interest appropriate to the geographic location of the cash flows related to the asset being tested, which issubsequently adjusted to factor in local market risks and risks specific to us and the asset itself.
Discount rates used for internal purposes are post-tax rates: however, for the purpose of impairment testing in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets we calculate a pre-tax rate based on post-tax targets.
If the recoverable amount is estimated to be less than the carrying amount of the asset, the carrying amount is impaired to its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years.
Impairment losses and reversals are recognised immediately in the income statement within administrative expenses.
Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Just Eat plc 101 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Year ended 31 December 2018 2.
Basis of preparation continued Significant accounting policies that relate to the financial statements as a whole continued e Prior year restatement: change in definition of operating profit During the year the definition of operating profit has been restated to exclude the results of our associated undertakings.
The financial performance of these businesses is not within the control of the Group and therefore does not reflect our operational performance.
No other performance measures were restated.
The operating loss of 72.5million previously reported for the year ended 31 December 2017 has been restated to 71.9million as a result of removing the results of the associates.
In previous periods, the Group has separated out certain items within administrative expenses and disclosed them as exceptional items.
All such items are included within the reconciliation of the uEBITDA alternative performance measure rather than on the face of the income statement: therefore, this classification is no longer applied.
New and amended standards adopted IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with customers were both adopted on 1 January 2018.
Neither standard has had a material impact on our financial position or performance: and therefore, no restatement of the comparative figures has been required.
No other new standards, amendments or interpretations to standards effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on 1 January 2018 have had a material impact on our financial position or performance, nor the disclosures in these consolidated financial statements.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted Certain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for the year ended 31 December 2018 and have not been early adopted.
With the exception of IFRS 16 Leases, none of the accounting standards issued but not yet effective are expected to have a significant impact on our annual financial statements, including IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income TaxTreatments.
IFRIC 23 clarifies how to apply the recognition and measurement requirements in IAS 12 Taxes when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments.
In particular, the interpretation addresses whether uncertain tax treatments should be considered separately or together with one or more other uncertain tax treatments, and addresses the assumptions an entity makes about the examination of tax treatments by taxation authorities.
IFRS 16 The new leasing standard will be adopted with effect from 1 January 2019.
IFRS 16 replaces IAS 17 Leases, with the key change being that lessee accounting will eliminate the IAS 17 distinction between operating leases and finance leases, treating most leases in the same manner as finance leases under IAS 17.
Where an arrangement meets the IFRS 16 definition of a lease and we act as a lessee, at commencement a loan obligation for future lease payables will be recognised together with an equal value non-current asset representing the right to use the leased item.
This will have no impact on net assets at the commencement date on 1 January 2019, but due to the different methods of unwinding the asset and liability, over time, a difference will arise.
Lease costs will be recognised in the form of depreciation of the right-of-use asset and interest on the lease liability, which may impact the phasing of operating profit and profit before tax, compared to the cost profiles and presentation in the income statement under IAS 17.
This will also impact the classification of associated cash flows in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement.
We intend to apply the modified retrospective basis when adopting the standard, meaning that the carrying amount of the initial right-of-use assets will equal the respective lease liabilities for all leases entered into before 1 January 2019: therefore, no restatement of prior years is required.
The impact of the change in accounting standard on each line item in the financial statements will be provided.
If we had implemented IFRS 16 on 1 January 2018, using estimated discount rates based on lease specific incremental borrowing rates, the impact of applying the modified retrospective basis would be as follows: Income statement Administrative expenses would be broadly consistent, as a result of the lease expense of between 5 million and 10 million being replaced by an increase in depreciation on the right-of-use asset in the same range.
Finance costs would increase by less than 5 million to reflect the current year unwind of the discounted lease liability.
Balance sheet At 31 December 2018, a right-of-use asset of between 20 million and 30 million would be recognised as a non-current asset, along with a lease liability in the same range.
Cash flow statement The lease payments would be reclassified from operating activities to financing activities.

Revenue Revenue is earned through the contracts held with Restaurant Partners and through the arrangements entered into with customers via the Just Eat ordering platforms.
This Note provides detail on our revenue recognition policy and a disaggregation of revenue.
Accounting policy General revenue recognition The majority of our revenue is recognised at the point in time when value and control is transferred to the customer and it is probable that the Group will collect the related consideration, being delivery of food to a customer.
Revenue is measured net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Commission Commission revenue generated from Restaurant Partners is earned and recognised when a customers order is fulfilled, being the point at which we have no remaining transactional obligations.
As fulfilment of the food order remains the responsibility of, and therefore remains within the control of, the Restaurant Partner, the gross order value placed by customers is not recognised as revenue, only the commission to which we are entitled.
Delivery revenue Delivery revenue is earned when we arrange the food delivery, instead of the Restaurant Partner using its own delivery system.
Where we arrange delivery, all delivery fees are recognised as revenue at the point of order fulfilment to the customer.
This is irrespective of whether the individual making the delivery is our employee, a contractor, or an employee of a third party service company, as we maintain primary responsibility for delivery under any of these arrangements.
The obligation to fulfil the food order itself remains the responsibility of the Restaurant Partner, and therefore the gross order value placed by customers isnot recognised as revenue, only the commission to which we are entitled.
Administration fees Revenue from administration fees are recognised at the point of order fulfilment.
Discounts Marketing discount vouchers usually have a unique reference number and have an expiry date.
These are recognised as a deduction to revenue when the order takes place: as the discount is in respect of future orders no provision is made at the point the discount vouchers are granted.
Customer care vouchers are given where there is an unsatisfactory customer experience.
These are recognised as a deduction to revenue when the voucher is awarded as they relate to orders previously recognised.
A provision is therefore made at the end of each reporting period for any amounts not redeemed or credited to a customers account.
Top Placement fees Top Placement fees represent income for placing prioritisation on our website for specified periods.
These arrangements cover specified periods of time and the associated revenues are recognised evenly over the same time period.
Sign-up fees Restaurants pay one-off fees to join our network, which covers the cost of an order confirmation terminal used for communicating orders between customers and Restaurant Partners via our ordering infrastructure, plus the ongoing costs of supporting the Restaurant Partners.
Sign-up fees are deferred to the balance sheet and recognised evenly over 48 months, reflecting the delivery of the performance obligation to provide the equipment to the Restaurant Partners.
This is considered to be an appropriate time period, as the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the equipment.
Where a restaurant has ended its relationship with us and they are no longer included on the Groups platforms, any remaining deferred income balances are recognised in revenue at the point there is evidence supporting the end of the relationship.
In addition to sign-up fees, Danish and French Restaurant Partners pay an annual subscription fee.
Revenue in respect of subscription fees is recognised evenly over the subscription period, being the period over which the performance obligation is delivered.
Other revenue Other revenue includes the sale of branded merchandise to Restaurant Partners.
Merchandise revenue is recognised when the goods are delivered and control has transferred to the Restaurant Partner.
Such revenues are not significant to our results.

Operating segments Our business is managed with a geographical focus, with management of the UK, Canada and Australia & New Zealand businesses reporting directly to the Chief Executive Officer and the other international operations reporting as a combined business.
This Note presents selected financial data as reported to the Chief Executive Officer.
Accounting policy IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires operating segments to be identified on the same basis as is used internally for the review of performance and allocation of resources by the chief operating decision maker CODM.
The CODM is the ChiefExecutive Officer.
Our operations are organised and reported internally in four segments, split geographically.
The main measure of profitability used by the CODM to assess the performance of the business is uEBITDA.
EBITDA is defined as earnings before investment revenue and costs, taxation, depreciation, amortisation and asset impairment charges.
uEBITDA also excludes share based payment charges, including social security costs, acquisition transaction and integration costs, foreign exchange gains and losses, and other gains and losses.
Included within total uEBITDA is our share of uEBITDA losses from associates.
The CODM uses uEBITDA to assess internal performance, as it excludes items that are either non-cash, relate to investments, or do not reflect the day-to-day commercial performance of the business.
As a result, uEBITDA provides a measure of the underlying performance of the business and is considered to enhance the comparability of profit or loss across segments.
Accordingly, Executive Team incentives are partially based on uEBITDA results and, therefore, it is considered to be both useful and necessary to disclose this measure.
Further details relating to the non-IFRS financial performance measures are provided as an appendix to this Annual Report and Accounts.
Due to both the current and expected future size of the Canada segment, during the year we have changed our reporting segments to: United Kingdom: Canada: Australia and New Zealand ANZ : and International.
Previously, the segments were: United Kingdom: ANZ: Established Markets: and Developing Markets.
The International segment consists of Denmark, France, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Norway, Spain and Switzerland.
Each of the operations in the International segment have similar business models and are expected to have similar long-term uEBITDA margins and display similar economic characteristics.
The comparative segmental disclosures below have been restated to reflect this change.
The operating segments reflect the information reported to the CODM.
Segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Central administration costs are allocated to the individual segments on a consistent basis year on year.
The CODM does not regularly review segment assets and liabilities and therefore no such details are provided below.

Share based payments We operate a number of equity-settled share based compensation plans.
In accordance with IFRS 2, the awards aremeasured at fair value on the date of the grant.
The fair value is expensed evenly over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
The fair value of the awards granted is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
Accounting policy Equity-settled share based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date.
The fair value includes the effect of market based vesting conditions.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share based payments is expensed evenly over the vesting period, based on our estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest.
At each balance sheet date, we revise our estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions.
The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to reserves.

No movements were noted in the year.
No share options arise: awards are restricted interests in Ordinary shares.
Just Eat plc Performance Share Plan PSP PSP awards are granted to eligible employees meeting criteria determined by the Board to help incentivise sustained performance over the long term and to promote alignment with the shareholders interests.
Awards under the PSP are granted as nil-cost options which vest to the extent performance conditions are satisfied, predominantly over a period of three years.
The vesting of interests granted to employees is subject to the option holder continuing to be an employee.
For members of the Executive Team, 50% of the awards granted have total shareholder return TSR performance criteria and 50% are based on EPS targets.
The fair value of interests awarded under the PSP was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, with the TSR performance criteria being calculated using the stochastic simulation model.
Sharesave Plan Employees that are determined eligible by the Board are offered the option to buy shares in the Company after a period of three years, based on a discounted share price set at the start of the award period.
Employees taking part in the scheme contribute to a savings pool from their salaries on a monthly basis, the full amount of which is repaid if the options lapse.

The SIP is an equity-settled share option scheme approved by Her Majestys Revenue & Customs HMRC.
The shares vest after three years from grant.
Shares were granted under this scheme on the date of the IPO with afair value of 260.0 pence and all awards outstanding vested on 8 April 2017.
Just Eat plc Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme EMI Scheme Options are no longer being granted under this scheme.
Under the terms of the EMI Scheme, the Board granted options to employees whom they deem as eligible to purchase shares in the Company.
Options are exercisable at a price equal to the estimated fair value of the Companys shares on the date of grant.
Options vest in stages over a three-year period commencing on a specified date which is typically one year after the date of grant.
Options are forfeited if an employee leaves before the options vest and expire if they remain unexercised ten years after the date of grant.
Just Eat plc Company Share Option Plan CSOP Options are no longer being granted under this scheme.
Under the terms of the CSOP, the Board granted options to purchase Ordinary shares in the Company to eligible employees.
The eligible employees to whom options are granted and the terms of such options are determined by the Board.
All employees were eligible to participate in the CSOP, including employees of the Companys subsidiaries, but not all grants are approved by HMRC.
Options vest in stages over a three-year period commencing on a specified date which is typically one year after thedate of grant.
The CSOP is an equity-settled share option scheme approved by HMRC.
The exercise price of options may not be less than the market value of the Companys shares on the date of grant inorder for the scheme to qualify as an approved HMRC scheme.
Vested options in the CSOP became exercisable on the Companys IPO in April 2014.
Just Eat Joint Share Ownership Plan JSOP Awards are no longer being granted under this scheme.
The JSOP is a share ownership scheme under which the employee and Estera Trust Jersey Limited, the EBT Trustee, hold a joint interest in Ordinary shares.
Interests under the JSOP take the form of restricted interests in Ordinary shares in the Company.
An interest permits a participant to benefit from the increase if any in the value of a number of Ordinary shares in the Company over specified threshold amounts.
In order to acquire an interest, a participant must enter into a joint share ownership agreement with the EBT Trustee, under which the participant and the EBT Trustee jointly acquire the shares and agree that when the shares are sold the participant has a right to receive the proportion of the sale proceeds that exceed the threshold amount.
Interests vest in stages over a three-year period commencing on a specified date, typically one year after the date of grant.
The fair value of interests awarded under the JSOP was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The range of exercise prices for both current and prior year options outstanding was 4.6 to 76.3 pence.
During the year ended 31 December 2018, the weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 798.9 pence 2017: 681.1 pence.
The weighted average remaining contractual life of the JSOP awards was 5.0 years 2017: 6.0 years.

Taxation Uncertain tax positions is a key source of estimation uncertainty see Note 2, in particular the Danish transfer pricing audit.
Set out in this Note are details of how our tax charge arises, together with information on the deferred tax position.
Accounting policy The income tax expense comprises both current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income, in which case the income tax is recognised in other comprehensive income.
Current tax Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable profit for the year, using tax rates prevailing in each respective jurisdiction and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The amount of deferred tax recognised is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, using tax rates that are expected to apply when the temporary differences reverse, based on rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is not recognised for temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where we are able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related deferred tax benefit will be realised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and we intend to settle the current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

Taxation continued Accounting policy continued Tax deductions on the exercise of share options Under IAS 12, to the extent that the tax deduction available on the exercise of share options is equal to, or is less than, the cumulative share based payment charge calculated under IFRS 2 Share based Payments, current and deferred tax is recognised through the income statement.
However, when the tax deduction is greater than the cumulative expense, the incremental current tax deduction and deferred tax recognition are recognised in equity.

The UK Government announced in the summer 2015 budget a reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax from 20% to 19%, effective from 1 April 2017.
The Finance Bill 2016 subsequently reduced the main rate of corporation tax to 17%, effective from 1 April 2020.
Taxation for territories outside of the UK was calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
Taxation on items taken directly to equity in respect of share options was a net debit of 0.6 million 2017: 2.0 million credit, which comprised 0.6 million credit relating to current tax and 1.2 million debit relating to deferred tax.
Factors affecting the tax expense for the year The total tax charge for the year can be reconciled to the profit loss per the income statement as follows: 2018 2017 m m Profit loss before tax 101.7 76.0 UK rate of 19.00% 2017: 19.25% 19.3 14.6 Adjusted for the effects of: Non-deductible expenditure 2.7 3.1 Non-taxable income 1.0 5.9 Share based payments 0.8 0.3 Impairment charges 34.7 Prior year adjustments 0.3 0.5 Unrecognised deferred tax asset changes 1.5 1.6 Overseas tax rates 2.1 1.7 Other overseas taxes including movement in provisions 2.7 10.4 Associates results 1.2 0.1 Total tax charge for the year 21.8 27.5 Effective tax rate 21.4% 36.2% The effective tax rate ETR for the year ended 31 December 2018 is 21.4% 2017: -36.2%.
Underlying ETR is provided in the Alternative Performance Measures appendix to these Annual Report and Accounts.
The total tax charge of 21.8 million 2017: 27.5 million is made up of: a current tax charge of 31.2 million 2017: 37.7 million, primarily consisting of corporate tax arising in the UK, Denmark, France, Ireland and Switzerland: and a deferred tax credit of 9.4 million 2017: 10.2 million resulting from the unwind of deferred tax liabilities arising on acquired intangibles and the recognition of a deferred tax asset on the cumulative losses in SkipTheDishes in Canada.
As a result of the geographical spread of our operations and the varied, increasingly complex nature of local and global tax law, there are some transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business.
The provision held in relation to uncertain tax items totalled 19.9million at 31 December 2018 2017: 17.4million.
Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Just Eat plc 111 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Year ended 31 December 2018 10.
Taxation continued Factors affecting the tax expense for the year continued Included within the total uncertain tax provision is an amount held in relation to an ongoing transfer pricing audit inDenmark.
In 2012, our transfer pricing arrangements were updated, in line with the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines, to reflect the commercial and economic reality of our headquarters being established in the UK.
An Advanced Pricing Agreement APA was submitted to the Danish and UK Competent Authorities to obtain certainty over the position taken.
The Danish Tax Authorities subsequently opened a local transfer pricing audit into the periods covered by the APA and in January 2018 issued a formal notice of assessment from their findings, making a claim that the taxable income for financial year 2013 should be increased, equalling an additional tax payment of 126 million, including interest and surcharges.
We strongly disagree with the claim made by the Danish Tax Authorities and have appealed the assessment through a Mutual Agreement Procedure MAP between the UK and Danish Competent Authorities.
During the MAP, the two tax authorities enter into discussions with the intention of resolving the transfer pricing dispute.
Our case was formally accepted into the MAP in April 2018.
We expect this issue to be resolved through theMAP, with the outcome being full elimination of the potential double taxation.
Such an outcome may result in areallocation of income between the UK and Denmark with different tax rates applying over different time periods and net interest charges.
An amount has been provided in respect of this uncertain tax position.
This is a key source of estimation uncertainty as outlined in Note 2.
As we operate in multiple countries, our effective tax rate will be impacted by the tax rates applicable in those countries.
We expect our future tax charge and effective tax rate will be driven by various factors including: the timing of the recognition of tax losses: changes in the mix of business profits: local or international tax reform for example, any arising from the implementation of the OECDs BEPS actions and European Union state aid investigations, new challenges by the tax authorities or the resolution of ongoing enquiries raised by tax authorities: and the impact ofany acquisitions, disposals or restructurings.

Earnings per share We use earnings per share as a measure of management performance.
The principal metric used is adjusted earnings per share.
This Note sets out the IFRS earnings per share.
Adjusted earnings per share is provided in the alternative performance measures appendix to this Annual Report and Accounts.
Accounting policy Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year, excluding unvested share awards.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares outstanding to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive shares.
Ordinary shares are only treated as dilutive when their conversion would decrease earnings per Ordinary share or increase loss per Ordinary share from continuing operations.

Goodwill The consolidated balance sheet contains significant goodwill carrying values.
Goodwill arises when a business isacquired for an amount higher than the fair value of its net assets, representing primarily the synergies and growth potential expected to materialise, or the value of the assembled workforce.
Goodwill is not amortised but is subject to annual impairment reviews.
Potential impairment of goodwill is a critical accounting judgement and akey source of estimation uncertainty and further details are provided in Note 2.
Accounting policies Goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is recognised as an intangible asset when control is achieved.
Fair value measurements are based on provisional estimates and may be subject to amendment within one year of the acquisition, resulting in an adjustment to goodwill.
The fair values associated with material business combinations are valued by external advisers and any amount of consideration which is contingent in nature is evaluated at the end of each reporting period, based on internal forecasts.
Goodwill itself does not generate independent cash flows and, therefore, in order to perform required tests for impairment, it is allocated at inception to the specific CGUs or groups of CGUs which are expected to benefit from the acquisition.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the CGU may be impaired.
When an indication of impairment exists, we review the carrying amount and recoverable amount of the investment.
The recoverable amount is the higher of FVLCD and VIU.
However, in line with IAS 36, FVLCD is only determined where VIU would result in an impairment.
If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to the other assets of the CGU pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
The key assumptions used in the VIU calculations are the discount rate and the anticipated future cash flows which are a function of increases in both revenue and costs, along with other factors.
The key assumptions used in the FVLCD are similar to the VIU.
However, the assumptions are based on a likely market participants perspective.
The assumptions on growth in future cash flows are based on past experience, recent results and future expectations.
The main drivers for future cash flows are the investment in delivery, the continued investment in marketing, which helps drive brand awareness and customer traffic to our platforms, and the investment in technology, which ensures the platforms are stable, secure, efficient and scalable.
We prepare cash flow forecasts based on the most recent financial budgets approved by the Board.
Some markets are expected to enjoy a period of sustained high growth continuing from the end of the current budgetary cycle to maturity the medium term.
A suitable medium-term growth rate, based on previous experience of growth rates including historical growth rates of all CGUs, has been applied individually to reflect each CGUs activity in this period.
After this, a long-term growth rate is applied.
For VIU, cash flows are typically forecast for periods up to five years, but there are some CGUs that are forecast for longer periods.
These CGUs are located in immature markets which are currently lacking penetration, and where future investment inthe business is expected to result in its long-term growth being achieved outside of five years.
For these CGUs, it is appropriate to use forecasts extending beyond five years as they correlate with trading experienced in similar markets.

Further details are provided in Note 25.
Due to timing constraints between the acquisition of SkipTheDishes on 14 December 2016 and the publication of the 2016 Annual Report, the acquisition accounting in 2016 was provisional, based on estimated inputs.
In the prior year, the valuation models and acquisition accounting were finalised, resulting in an increase in goodwill of 1.5 million see Note 25.
The Flyt acquisition in 2018 is currently held at provisional values due to the timing of the transaction.
114 Just Eat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial statements 12.
Goodwill continued Carrying value of goodwill continued Goodwill is attributable to the future growth of the acquired businesses, through expansion of the networks of Restaurant Partners and the number of orders per Restaurant Partner, anticipated future operating synergies, and the ability to leverage intellectual property in new markets around the world.
In addition, the goodwill balances represented the value of the businesses active customer bases and assembled workforce, which do not meet the recognition criteria of an intangible asset.
Goodwill allocated by CGU Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated on acquisition to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
During the year we integrated the operations of SkipTheDishes and Just Eat Canada and as a result these two CGUs were combined, leading to the transfer of 6.1 million into the SkipTheDishes CGU and its renaming to Canada.
As a result of the acquisition of HungryHouse, the UK CGU has been separately disclosed and the existing goodwill balance of 4.3 million attributable to this CGU has been moved from the Other CGUs category, where it was previously disclosed.

The individual amount of goodwill assigned to these CGUs is not considered significant in comparison with the carrying value of goodwill.
Impairment review For the year ended 31 December 2018, no impairment charge has arisen.
During the prior year, a non-cash impairment charge of 180.4 million was recorded in respect of the ANZ CGU.
The charge was driven by lower projected cash flows within the business plans resulting in a reassessment of expected future business performance in light of the prevailing trading environment.
For all CGUs except for MX, the recoverable amount was determined by measuring their VIU.
The recoverable amount for the MX CGU was calculated based on FVLCD.
The key VIU assumptions used were: ANZ UK CA ES IT FR 1 Pre-tax discount rate 10.7% 10.9% 11.3% 11.2% 11.3% 11.8% 2 Terminal growth rate 2.5% 2.0% 2.0% 1.8% 1.6% 1.9% Number of years forecasted before terminal growth rate applied 8 5 5 5 8 5 1.
Pre-tax discount rates have been calculated using the capital asset pricing model, the inputs of which include a country risk-free rate, equity risk premium, Group size premium and a risk adjustment beta.
Terminal growth rate is based on long-term inflationary rates in the country of operation.
FVLCD was calculated based on a revenue multiple model based on budgeted revenues for 2019 and is therefore a level 3 measurement.
Level 3 measurements are based inputs which are normally unobservable to market participants.
Costs of disposal can be assumed to be 10% of expected disposal proceeds.
Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Just Eat plc 115 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Year ended 31 December 2018 12.
Goodwill continued Sensitivity analysis We have conducted sensitivity analysis on each CGUs VIU.
This included either increasing the discount rates, reducing the long-term growth rate, or reducing the anticipated future cash flows through changes to revenue orcosts in each of the years through to the terminal year.
The sensitivity assumptions applied to the VIU calculations are set out in the table below.
These are considered tobe reasonably possible, but not likely.
ANZ UK CA ES IT FR Increase in discount rate 1% 1% 1% 1% 1% 1% Reduction in long-term growth rate applied in terminal year 1% 1% 1% 1% 1% 1% Decrease in total revenue for all years through to terminal year 5% 5% 5% 5% 5% 5% Increase in total costs for all years through to terminal year 5% 5% 5% 5% 5% 5% Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that it is reasonably possible that an impairment charge could arise in the ANZ, ES and IT CGUs.
The following table sets out the goodwill attributable to each of these CGUs, the excess of the recoverable amount over the carrying value of each CGU under the base case assumptions set out above the headroom, together with the potential headroom shown as a positive value or impairment shown as negative values under each of the four sensitised scenarios.

Other intangible assets Other intangible assets predominantly arise on acquisition of subsidiaries or are internally developed.
Other intangible assets are amortised as well as being tested at least annually for impairment.
Detail of the movement in intangible assets is provided in this Note.
Accounting policy Intangible assets are recorded at cost, net of amortisation and any provision for impairment.
Amortisation is spread evenly over the assets useful economic lives.
The cost of intangible assets arising from a business combination or associate is determined at their fair value on the date of initial recognition.
We have four classes of intangible asset: patents, licences and intellectual property IP, Restaurant Partner contracts, brands, and development costs.
Due to both the absence of a contractual arrangement and a practice of establishing such contracts with customers, acquired customer user lists are not classified as an intangible asset and remain as part of goodwill.
Detail of the policy on asset impairment is provide in Note 2.
Patents, licences and IP Patents, licences and IP are generally acquired as part of a business combination, and predominantly relate to acquired operating platforms such as websites and apps.
Software licences are also included in this category.
The useful economic life is typically between three and five years, depending on the period over which benefits are expected to be realised from the asset.
The initial fair values are established as the estimated costs to replace the acquired platforms.
Restaurant contracts Restaurant contracts are generally the primary revenue-generating assets of a business combination and relate to the acquired contractual agreements between the business and the Restaurant Partners.
The useful economic life is determined as the period over which the acquired Restaurant Partner contracts are reasonably expected to transfer economic benefits, which is usually between three and ten years.
The initial fair values are established with reference to the present value of their post-tax cash flows projected over their remaining useful lives.
The cash flows and discount rates used in the valuations are risk adjusted to the extent deemed necessary to accurately reflect local risks and uncertainties associated with the asset.
Brands Brands are acquired as part of a business combination.
The useful economic life is determined as the period of time over which the acquired brand is reasonably expected to transfer economic benefits, which is usually between three and ten years.

Other intangible assets continued Accounting policy continued Brands continued The initial fair values are established using the relief from royalty valuation method.
The cash flows and discount rates used in the relief from royalty valuation model are risk adjusted to the extent deemed necessary to accurately reflect local risks and uncertainties associated with the asset.
Development costs Internally developed websites, apps and other software, that together comprise the Just Eat ordering platforms, are capitalised to the extent that incremental costs can be separately identified, the product is technically feasible, expenditure can be measured reliably, and sufficient resources are available to complete the project.
Where these conditions are not met the amounts are expensed as incurred.
The useful economic life is typically three years, from the date the developed asset is available for use.
Due to timing constraints between the acquisition of SkipTheDishes on 14 December 2016 and the publication of the 2016 Annual Report, the prior year acquisition accounting was provisional, as permitted under IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
The prior year valuation of the acquired intangible assets was based on estimated inputs.
In the current year, the valuation models and acquisition accounting have been finalised, resulting in an increase in intangible assets of 1.8 million see Note 25.
The cash outflow in respect of additions of intangible assets was 33.3 million 2017: 24.0 million.
Of the amortisation charge for the year ended 31 December 2018, 23.9 million 2017: 24.4 million related to intangible assets arising onacquisition and 13.3 million 2017: 6.7 million related to other intangible assets.
At 31 December 2018, we had not entered into any significant contractual commitments for the acquisition of intangible assets 2017: none.
Patents, licences and IP As at 31 December 2018, the patents, licences and IP carrying amount was 15.3 million 2017: 11.0 million.
Included within this category are assets arising on acquisition with a net book value of 1.7 million 2017: 2.4 million.
The weighted average remaining amortisation period for this category is 3.1 years.

Investments in associates We hold an interest in certain companies where the ability to exert significant influence exists.
The biggest of these is IF-JE Participaes S. A. IF-JE.
Key information and judgements made are provided in this Note.
Accounting policy An associate is an entity over which we have significant influence.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but does not control or have joint control over those policies.
Theconsiderations made in determining significant influence are similar to those necessary to determine control over subsidiaries.
The results, assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method ofaccounting.
The investment in an associate is initially recognised at cost.
At the acquisition date, any excess of the cost of acquisition over our share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the associate is recognised as goodwill.
Goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment.
Under the equity method, the carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognise changes in our share of net assets of the associate since the acquisition date.
The Consolidated Income Statement reflects our share of the results of operations of the associate.
Any change in other comprehensive income of those investees is presented as part of consolidated other comprehensive income.
In addition, when there has been a change recognised directly in the equity of the associate, we recognise our share of any changes, when applicable, in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
Profits and losses resulting from transactions between us and our associates are eliminated to the extent of our interest in the associate.
Detail of the policy on asset impairment is provided in Note 2.

Investments in associates continued We have investments in two associates, IF-JE Participaes S. A. IF-JE and IF-JE Holdings B. V. IF-JE NL.
Both associates are 33% owned, with the remaining 67% owned by Movile Internet Movel S. A. Movile, or parties connected to Movile.
Both entities are accounted for using the equity method in these consolidated financial statements as we are considered to have significant influence through representation on the companies board of directors and through the voting rights given by share ownership.
Only IF-JE is considered to be material.
IF-JE operates a marketplace for online food delivery.
IF-JE is incorporated and has its principal place of business inBrazil, an area of significant growth potential and complementary to our strategic objectives.
During the year ended 31 December 2018 we paid 24.7 million to acquire additional shareholdings in IF-JE from other non-controlling parties.
A further 12.4 million was paid against historical liabilities, taking the total cash payment to 37.1 million.
In addition, we provided IF-JE with working capital funding of 5.9 million 2017: 0.8 million.
We received additional shares as consideration for the funding.
The majority shareholder Movile also participated inthe funding.
IF-JE NL is a holding company with its principal place of residence in the Netherlands.
The primary investment of IF-JE NL is El Cocinero a Cuerda SL ECAC, a Mexican online food marketplace business.
The remaining 51% is owned directly by us: therefore ECAC is fully consolidated in these financial statements and the investment in the IF-JE NL associated undertaking represents only the holding company activities.
During the year, no dividends have been received from associated undertakings 2017: nil.
Our share of losses after tax and total comprehensive loss includes amortisation of acquired intangibles recognised by us, but not by IF-JE.

Provisions for liabilities The principal provisions held are in relation to contingent consideration on acquisition of subsidiaries and associates.
Details of the key balances and judgements are provided in this Note.
Accounting policy Provisions are recognised when we have an obligation to make a cash outflow as a result of a past event.
They are distinct from liabilities recorded within trade and other payables in that either the value or timing of the outflow is uncertain.
Provisions are measured at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date when settlement is considered to be likely.
Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the obligation, the carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows.
The unwinding of any discount is recognised in the income statement within other gains and losses.

At 31 December 2018, other provisions included 9.8 million 2017: 9.6 million in respect of our commitment to buy out the minority shareholder of FBA Invest SaS and associated legal costs.
The amount payable is dependent onthe results of the French businesses for 2016 and 2017.

Liabilities arising from financing activities and net debt Net debt is defined as financing liabilities plus operating cash.
This measure therefore excludes the cash amounts received from customers which are due to be remitted to Restaurant Partners.
In the current year the amount is a surplus and is therefore described as net cash.
The table below details changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, including both cash and non-cash changes.
Liabilities arising from financing activities are those for which cash flows were, or future cash flows will be, classified in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement as cash flows from financing activities.

Financial instruments Financial instruments comprise financial assets and financial liabilities.
The fair values and carrying values held atamortised cost are set out in the table below.
Unless otherwise stated, the valuation basis is level 2, comprising financial instruments where fair value is determined from inputs other than observable quoted prices for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
There were no transfers between fair value measurement categories in the current or prior year.
We enter into forward foreign exchange contracts, which are our only derivative financial instruments.
Accounting policies Recognition and derecognition of financial assets and liabilities Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when we become a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
We derecognise a financial asset or liability only when the contractual right that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled orexpires.
Fair value measurement We measure certain financial instruments at fair value at each balance sheet date.
The carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the financial statements approximate to their fair values.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level 1: Quoted unadjusted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
Level 3: Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis, we determine whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by reassessing categorisation based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole at the end of each reporting period.
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, we have determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits.
Included within theamounts held at bank is cash received from customers through our platform which will be subsequently remitted toRestaurant Partners.
For the purpose of showing the level of available cash at the balance sheet date, cash to be paid toRestaurant Partners is separated on the face of the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Within the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, movements in the amount to be paid to Restaurant Partners is included within the movement in payables and theoverall movement in cash and cash equivalents.
All cash and cash equivalents, including the cash to be paid to Restaurant Partners, is available for use at the balance sheet date.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are held at fair value, with revaluation gains or losses taken to the income statement within other gains and losses.
Hedge accounting No hedge accounting has been applied in the current year.

Our current capital structure consists of cash and cash equivalents, a 350 million revolving credit facility RCF and equity attributable to shareholders of the Company, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in Note 23.
Nochanges to our objectives or practices have taken place in the year as these objectives were met through the use of our RCF.
We are not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
Financial risk management The main financial risks we face are market risk which includes currency risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Our treasury function, which operates under the Treasury Policy approved by the Board of Directors, uses certain financial instruments to mitigate potentially adverse effects on financial performance from these risks.
These financial instruments consist of bank loans and deposits, spot and forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign exchange swaps.
Policy prohibits the use of financial derivatives for speculative purposes.
a Market risk management Our activities expose us primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interestrates.
Foreign currency risk management We undertake transactions denominated in foreign currencies and consequently exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise.

The US dollar exposure arises on the purchase of restaurant order pads and the rest of the exposures relate to surplus cash generated in overseas operations, overseas investments and the deferred consideration of overseas acquisitions.
We use spot and forward foreign exchange contracts with maturities up to one year to manage theseexposures.
The translation risk on converting overseas currency profits or losses is not hedged and such profits or losses are converted into sterling at average exchange rates throughout the year.
Our principal translation currency exposures are the euro and the Canadian dollar.
The following table details the sensitivity to a 10% depreciation and 10% appreciation in pound sterling against the relevant foreign currencies.
10% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to senior management and represents an assessment of a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency-denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates.
The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well asinternal loans to foreign operations.

Interest rate sensitivity analysis Our interest rate risk arises primarily on cash and loans, all of which are at floating rates of interest and which therefore expose us to cash flow interest rate risk.
These floating rates are linked to LIBOR and other interest rate bases as appropriate to the instrument and currency.
Future cash flows arising from these financial instruments depend on the interest periods agreed at the time of rollover.
Our policy permits the use of interest rate derivatives to manage the risks associated with movements in interest rates but no interest rate hedges were transacted during the year.
The sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates at the balance sheet date.
Forfloating rate assets and liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of asset liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
A 1% increase or decrease in the interest rate is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to senior management and represents an assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 1% higher lower and all other variables were held constant, there would be no impact on the profit before taxation or equity 2017: nil.

Financial instruments continued Financial risk management continued b Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss.
Our exposure and the credit ratings of major counterparties is continuously monitored.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of Restaurant Partners, spread across geographical areas.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and credit guarantee insurance cover is purchased where appropriate.
Credit risk is not considered to be a significant risk.
c Liquidity risk management Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board, which has established an appropriate liquidity risk framework for the management of our short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
We manage liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and by ensuring adequate borrowing facilities are available.
We have access to a committed 350.0 million RCF which expires in November 2023, following the exercise of a one-year extension option in November 2018.
We have the option to extend the facility for a further year, subject tolender consent.
We also have an option, subject to lender consent, to increase the amount of the facility by a further 150.0 million.
The facility is unsecured and contains common financial covenants, including: the ratio of total net debt to uEBITDA must not exceed 3.0: interest cover ratio of uEBITDA to net finance charges must not be less than 4.0: and any new earn-out deferred consideration must not exceed one times the uEBITDA.
The financial covenants are tested on a quarterly basis and have been complied with at all measurement points.
Liquidity and interest risk tables The following table details our remaining contractual maturity profile for financial liabilities and has been prepared based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.
The table includes both interest and principal cash flows.
To the extent that interest flows are a floating rate, the undiscounted amount is derived from interest rate curves at the balance sheet date.

Contingent liabilities In October 2017, the European Commission announced that it will be conducting a State Aid investigation into the Group Financing Exemption contained within the UKs Controlled Foreign Company CFC legislation.
The Group Financing Exemption contained within Chapter 9 of Part 9A TIOPA 2010 was introduced in 2013 when the UK CFC rules were revised.
Similar to other UK based international companies, we may be impacted by the final outcome of this investigation.
Whilst there is considerable uncertainty in regards to both the final outcome of the investigation and any corresponding liability, the maximum potential liability has been calculated to be 14.4 million excluding any associated interest, should the European Commission conclude the Group Financing Exemption is in contravention of the State Aid provisions.
At this stage, due to uncertainty over the technical position, no provision has been recorded and no critical judgements are required until the investigation is concluded.
Operating lease arrangements Operating leases mainly consist of the lease of office buildings and motor vehicles.
Accounting policy Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to profit or loss evenly over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the lease asset are consumed.
Contingent rentals arising under operating leases are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.

Capital and reserves Share capital Share capital is the number of shares in issue at their nominal value.
In the current year, this increased due to the exercise of employee share options.
Ordinary shares have a nominal value of 0.01 each, are issued, allotted, called up, fully paid and entitle the holders to receive notice, attend, speak and vote at general meetings.
Holders of Ordinary shares are entitled to distributions of available profits pro rata to their respective holdings of shares.

Dividends payable to the holders of the Companys Ordinary shares are recognised when they have been appropriately authorised.
No dividend has been recommended for the year.
Translation reserve Exchange differences relating to the translation of the net assets, income and expenses of foreign operations, fromtheir functional currency into our reporting currency, being pound sterling, are recognised directly in the translation reserve.

When an available-for-sale investment is realised, the reserve is recycled through the income statement.
If there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, any cumulative loss recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to the income statement within other gains and losses.
Merger reserve In July 2009 a Group reorganisation was undertaken.
Under this reorganisation, Ordinary shares were issued and cancelled and Preference A shares were issued.
This was treated as a common control transaction under IFRS as the ultimate shareholders and their relative rights were the same before and afterwards.
This reserve represents the difference between the nominal value of the shares issued and the nominal value of the shares on the Group reorganisation in July 2009.
Treasury shares reserve This reserve arose when equity share capital was issued under the JSOP and SIP, which are held in Employee Benefit Trusts EBTs.
At 31 December 2018, the EBTs held 2.8 million shares 2017: 3.5 million shares, which had a historical cost of 3.5 million 2017: 3.9 million and a market value of 16.4 million 2017: 27.4 million.
See Note 7 for more information on the JSOP and SIP.
Cash flow hedging reserve The cash flow hedging reserve represents the cumulative effective portion of gains or losses arising on changes inthe fair value of hedging instruments designated as cash flow hedges.

Non-controlling interest The NCI is the equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the Group.
At 31 December 2018, NCIs are held in the French and Mexican operations.
Accounting policy NCI in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries is identified separately from the equity therein.
NCI consists of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the non-controlling shareholders share of changes in equity since the acquisition date of the combination.

Acquisitions In the year ended 31 December 2018, we completed the acquisitions of HungryHouse and Flyt.
The Note below sets out the final acquisition accounting for these transactions.
The measurement of acquired intangible assets is a key source of estimation of uncertainty see Note 2.
Accounting policy Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued in exchange for control of the acquiree.
For each business combination, we elect whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
Acquisition costs paid on behalf of the vendor are included in the fair value of consideration transferred.
When the consideration for the acquisition includes an asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, the contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition-date fair value and is included as part of the consideration transferred in the business combination.
Where the contingent amount is dependent on future employment, itis recognised as an expense over the relevant period in the income statement.
Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as measurement period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments against goodwill.
Measurement period adjustments are adjustments that arise from additional information obtained during the measurement period which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date.
The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments depends on how the contingent consideration is classified.
Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured at subsequent reporting dates and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.
Contingent consideration that is classified as an asset or liability is remeasured at subsequent reporting dates in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement or IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, as appropriate, with the corresponding gain or loss being recognised in profit or loss.
When a business combination is achieved in stages, the previously held interests in the acquired entity are remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date i. e. the date control is obtained and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in profit or loss.
Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest were disposed of.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for certain items which are measured in accordance with the relevant IFRS.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, we report provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete.
Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period.
Additional assets or liabilities are recognised to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.
Acquisition of HungryHouse On 15 December 2016, we announced the agreement to acquire 100% of the share capital of HungryHouse from Delivery Hero Holding GmbH.
Approval from the Competition and Markets Authority CMA was obtained on 16 November 2017 and completion of the acquisition occurred on 31 January 2018 for consideration totalling 239.5 million.
Funding for the acquisition was obtained from both existing cash reserves and a drawdown on the revolving credit facility.
Estimated deferred consideration of 23.5 million is payable on 31 January 2019.
The acquisition is consistent with our strategic ambition for growth and increased market presence in every geography in which we operate.
HungryHouse is an online food company operating solely in the UK, with a comparable business model to Just Eat.
The acquisition is expected to generate significant benefits for Restaurant Partners and customers.
It creates an enlarged customer base for Restaurant Partners to access, whilst increasing the breadth of choice on offer to UK customers through our platform.
The combination of the two businesses also generates compelling economic benefits of scale, with high operating leverage expected to drive material synergies post integration.
Goodwill is attributable to the future growth of the acquired business, through expansion of its networks of Restaurant Partners, the number of orders per restaurant, and the anticipated future operational synergies.
In addition, the goodwill balance represents the value of the customer bases and assembled workforce, which do not meet the recognition criteria of an intangible asset.
None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
No brand asset was recognised on acquisition of HungryHouse, given that the brand was number two behind Just Eat and there would be little incentive for any market participant to have acquired the HungryHouse brand itself.
Transaction costs incurred on acquisition in the year were 1.8 million and integration costs 7.5 million, both of which are recorded in administrative expenses in the income statement.
Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Just Eat plc 131 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Year ended 31 December 2018 25.
Acquisitions continued Acquisition of Flyt On 22 December 2018, we acquired 92% of the share capital of Flyt Limited formerly named Flypay Limited for an initial cash outlay of 21.8 million with an estimated earn-out to the founders and previous owners of 20.8 million, payable over three years, with the actual amount contingent upon certain revenue and profit targets being met in that three-year window.
We acquired an 8% shareholding in Flyt in September 2016 for 3.5 million, which was treated as an available-for-sale investment prior to the acquisition of the remaining shareholding.
At the point control was obtained, the fair value of the 8% investment was 4.2 million: the difference to the carrying value of 3.5 million was included in other gains and losses see Note 8.
The core Flyt application is middleware that connects a restaurants point of sale terminal to third party applications, such as the Just Eat platform.
This enables orders and payments to be made directly from the third party applications to the point of sale terminals.
Flyt works with some of the UKs largest Branded Restaurant Groups.
The acquisition of Flyt creates in-house point of sale integration expertise which improves our platform and creates a more attractive solution to large Branded Restaurant Groups.
Goodwill is attributable to the anticipated operational benefits and improvements to our commercial offering.
Transaction costs incurred on the acquisition in the year were 0.5 million, which are recorded in administrative expenses in the income statement.

Due to the limited amount of time since the acquisition of Flyt, on 31 December 2018, the acquisition accounting is provisional.
This includes the valuation of the acquired intangible assets as some of the inputs to the valuation models are based on estimates.
Immediately after acquisition, the HungryHouse customers and Restaurant Partners were transferred onto the JustEat UK ordering platform.
The HungryHouse platform ceased operating on 22 May 2018.
Because of this, it isnot possible to track HungryHouses total contribution to our results since the date of acquisition, as information isonly available in respect of orders placed directly through the HungryHouse platform, which would exclude orders from Hungyhouse customers that had transferred onto the Just Eat platform.
As the Flyt business was acquired on 22 December 2018, there was no significant contribution to our revenue or profits during the year ended 31 December 2018.
