1.2 Adoption of new and revised standards The accounting policies used in the preparation of these separate financial statements are consistent with previous years, and the accounting policies applied in the consolidated financial statements of Direct Line Insurance Group plc, except for the adoption of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and the additional accounting policies specific to the separate financial statements of the Company as set out below.
The Company has adopted IFRS 9 which became mandatory for the first time in 2018.
IFRS 9 replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, introducing new guidance on the classification and measurement of financial assets, an expected credit loss impairment model, and new hedge accounting requirements.
The Company completed an impact assessment on transition to IFRS 9, including an assessment of its financial assets under the new impairment model, and concluded there was no impact on the Companys equity at 1 January 2018.
The Company will continue applying the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 as permitted under IFRS 9.
The Company assessed its business model for managing the financial assets held by the Company and classified its financial assets into the appropriate IFRS 9 categories.
The impact of the reclassification was as follows: Measurement category Carrying amount Difference IAS 39 IFRS 9 Financial asset IAS 39 IFRS 9 m m m AFS debt securities AFS Fair value through other comprehensive income 5.1 5.1 Loan to subsidiary undertakings Amortised cost Amortised cost 531.8 531.8 Derivative financial instruments Fair value through profit or loss Fair value through profit or loss 1.4 1.4 Cash and cash equivalents Amortised cost Amortised cost 236.1 236.1 UK sovereign debt securities were reclassified from AFS to fair value through other comprehensive income as the AFS category has been removed under IFRS 9.
This is appropriate as the Companys business model is achieved by collecting contractual cash flows and selling these investments, and contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest.
The treatment of changes in fair value remain consistent and as a result there is no impact on equity.
There is no difference in the carrying amount of any financial assets under IAS 39 and IFRS 9.
IFRS 9 accounting policies adopted in the period are presented in note 1.5.
1.3 Investment in subsidiaries Investment in subsidiaries is stated at cost less any impairment.
1.4 Dividend income Dividend income from investment in subsidiaries is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
184 DIRECT LINE GROUP 2018 ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 184 DIRECT LINE GROUP 2018 ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS FINANCIALS V6.1 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.5 Financial assets Financial assets are classified at initial recognition and subsequently measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income.
The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial assets contractual cash flow characteristics and the Companys business model for managing them.
The Company initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs.
Amortised cost Assets which are held to collect contractual cash flows, and with contractual terms which give rise to cash flows which are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, are subsequently measured at amortised cost, unless designated as fair value through profit or loss.
Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest method and are subject to impairment.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the asset is derecognised, modified or impaired.
Fair value through other comprehensive income Assets which are held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell the financial asset, where the contractual terms of the asset give rise to cash flows which are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, unless designated as fair value through profit or loss.
Movements in the carrying amount are taken through other comprehensive income, except for gains or losses recognised in the income statement when the asset is derecognised, modified or impaired.
Impairment On recognition of a financial asset measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income, an expected credit loss allowance is recognised by multiplying the financial assets gross carrying amount by the probability of default multiplied by the loss given default.
At each balance sheet date, the Company assesses on a forward-looking basis, whether there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on a financial asset or group of financial assets classified as held at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income, is expected.
This assessment depends on whether there has been a deterioration in the instruments credit quality since initial recognition.
The Company measures the expected loss as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset or group of assets including the allowance for expected losses, and the present value of estimated future cash flows from the asset or group of assets, discounted at the effective interest rate of the instrument.
The expected loss allowance is based on assumptions about risk of default and expected loss rates.
The Company uses judgement in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the impairment calculation based on the credit quality and history of the financial asset or group of financial assets, as well as existing market conditions and forward-looking expectations.
Impairment losses, including the expected credit allowance, are recognised in the income statement and the carrying amount of the financial asset or group of financial assets is reduced by establishing an allowance for the impairment losses.
If in a subsequent period the amount of the expected impairment allowance reduces, and this can be ascribed to an event after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised loss is reversed by adjusting the allowance.
A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.
Hedge accounting The Company has utilised the transition for hedge accounting option in IFRS 9 to continue applying the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39.
