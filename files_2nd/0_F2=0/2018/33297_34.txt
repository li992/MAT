Company Overview Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2018 1.
GENERAL INFORMATION Admiral Group plc is a company incorporated in England and Wales.
Its registered office is at T Admiral, David Street, Cardiff, CF10 2EH and its shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU.
The Company has elected to prepare its Parent Company financial statements in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101.
The Group has branches in Spain, Italy, France, Canada and India as part of its international insurance and price comparison businesses.
Adoption of new and revised standards The Group has adopted the following IFRS and interpretations during the year, which have been issued and endorsed by the EU: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-based payment transactions.
The application of these amendments has not had a material impact on the Groups results, financial position and cash flows.
Further information on the impact of the transition to IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 is provided below.
IFRS 9 During the year the Group has applied IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with a date of initial application of 1 January 2018, which resulted in changes in accounting policies and the potential for adjustments to the amounts previously recognised in the financial statements in respect of financial instruments.
As permitted by the transitional provisions of IFRS 9 the Group elected not to restate comparative figures.
Any adjustments to the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the date of transition would be recognised in the opening retained earnings and other reserves of the current period.
The adoption of IFRS 9 has resulted in changes to the Groups accounting policies for recognition, classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities and impairment of financial assets.
Set out below are disclosures relating to the impact of the adoption of IFRS 9 on the Group.
Further details of the specific IFRS 9 accounting policies applied in the period as well as previous IAS 39 accounting policies applied in the comparative period are described in more detail in note 7. a Impact of transition A reconciliation of the opening retained earnings and fair value reserve under IAS 39 and IFRS 9 is provided below: Impact of adopting IFRS 9 on opening balance sheet Note m Fair value reserve Recognition of expected credit losses under IFRS 9 for financial assets at FVOCI, net of tax 7c 0.4 Impact at 1 January 2018 0.4 Retained profit and loss Recognition of expected credit losses under IFRS 9 for financial assets at FVOCI, net of tax 7c 0.4 Impact 0.4 Admiral Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 127 Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2018 1.
GENERAL INFORMATION CONTINUED Adoption of new and revised standards continued b Classification and measurement of financial instruments IFRS 9 contains three principal classification categories for financial assets: measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI and fair value through profit or loss FVTPL.
IFRS 9 classification is generally based on the business model in which a financial asset is managed and its contractual cash flows.
The standard eliminates the previous IAS 39 categories of held-tomaturity, loans and receivables and available-for-sale.
The measurement category and the carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities in accordance with IAS 39 and IFRS 9 at 1 January 2018 are as follows: IAS 39 IFRS 9 Carrying Carrying Measurement Amount Measurement Amount Category m Category m m Financial Assets Government gilts Available for sale FVOCI 173.8 FVOCI 173.8 Debt securities Available for sale FVOCI 1,319.7 FVOCI 1,319.7 Deposits with credit institutions Loans and receivables Amortised cost 130.0 Amortised cost 130.0 Money-market funds FVTPL 1,069.3 FVTPL mandatory 1,069.3 Equity instruments FVTPL 2.6 FVOCI designated 2.6 Cash and cash equivalents Loans and receivables Amortised cost 326.8 Amortised cost 326.8 Trade and other receivables Loans and receivables Amortised cost 202.1 Amortised cost 202.1 Derivative financial instruments FVTPL 2.4 FVTPL 2.4 Insurance receivables Loans and receivables Amortised cost 737.6 Amortised cost 737.6 Loans and advances to customers Loans and receivables Amortised cost 66.2 Amortised cost 66.2 It can be seen from the above that there is no difference in the carrying amount of financial instruments under IAS 39 and IFRS 9.
The classification of all financial assets has also remained consistent other than equity investments which have been elected to be treated as FVOCI as permitted under IFRS 9.
The basis for the classification of the financial assets is set out in note 7c.
There is no material impact to the income statement as a result.
There were no changes to the classification and measurement of financial liabilities.
Financial liabilities consist of subordinated notes, trade and other payables, loan backed securities through the Groups special purpose entity SPE, and a credit facility.
These are measured at amortised cost under IAS 39 and this has not changed under IFRS 9. c Impairment of financial assets IFRS 9 replaces the incurred loss model in IAS 39 with an expected credit loss model.
Under IFRS 9, credit losses are recognised earlier than under IAS 39.
For an explanation of how the Group applies the impairment requirements of IFRS 9, see note 7.
IFRS 15 During the year the Group has applied IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers with a date of initial application of 1 January 2018.
The core principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity should recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
The Group has opted to apply IFRS 15 retrospectively using the cumulative effect method i. e. by recognising the cumulative effect of initially applying IFRS 15 as an adjustment to the opening balance of equity as at 1 January 2018.
Therefore, the comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under IAS 18 and IAS 11.
No differences in the accounting treatment between these standards have been identified in relation to the Groups revenue.
The Group has not identified any impact on the consolidated financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2018 as a result of adopting IFRS 15 and therefore no transition adjustment is presented.
The disclosures required by IFRS 15 are set out in note 8 to the financial statements.
128 Admiral Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Company Overview Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Standards endorsed but not yet effective As at 31 December 2018, the following standards had been endorsed by the EU but are not yet effective: IFRS 16 Leases effective date 1 January 2019.
IFRS 16 Leases was issued in early 2016 and is effective from 1 January 2019.
The standard specifies how firms will recognise, measure, present and disclose leases.
It presents a single lessee accounting model and requires that assets and liabilities be recognised in the Consolidated statement of financial position, other than in the cases where leases are of low value or of a short-term nature of 12 months or less.
The Group has opted to apply the modified retrospective approach to transition that is permitted under IFRS 16.
Impact assessments performed during 2018 conclude that: Property leases represent the most significant class of lease held by the Group that will be impacted by the new standard.
There will be no adjustment to IFRS equity at the transition date of 1 January 2019.
The presentation of the Consolidated statement of financial position will be significantly impacted, with material lease liabilities and Right of Use assets being included for the first time.
The total lease liability is expected to be in the region of 140 million to 160 million, with a corresponding Right of Use asset.
The profile of lease related expense recognised in the Consolidated income statement is not expected to change materially.
Standards yet to be endorsed by the EU There are a number of standards, amendments to standards and interpretations that were issued by 31 December 2018 but have either yet to be endorsed by the EU, or were endorsed shortly after the year end.
The following IFRSs have been issued but have not been applied by the Group in these financial statements: IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts.
Annual improvements to IFRS standard 2015-2017 cycle.
Amendments to IAS 28 Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures.
Amendment to IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 7 Definition of Material.
IFRS 17 Insurance contracts IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts was issued in May 2017.
The standard will replace IFRS 4, establishing new principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of Insurance contracts within the scope of the standard.
The current IASB effective date is 1 January 2021, although the IASB has proposed a delay of one year to the effective date to 1 January 2022.
The Group is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 17 on its results and financial position, along with any impacts of the other standards and amendments which have yet to be endorsed.
BASIS OF PREPARATION The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis.
In considering this requirement, the Directors have taken into account the following: The Groups projections for the next 12 months and beyond, in particular the profit forecasts, regulatory capital surpluses and levels and sources of liquidity.
The risks included on the Groups risk register that could impact on the Groups financial performance, levels of liquidity and solvency over the next 12 months.
The risks on the Groups risk register that could be a threat to the Groups business model and capital adequacy.
The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic Report.
The Strategic Report also includes the Groups principal risks and uncertainties.
In addition, the Governance report includes the Directors statement on the viability of the Group over a three year period.
Admiral Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 129 Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2018 2.
BASIS OF PREPARATION CONTINUED Following consideration of the above, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future, a period not less than 12 months from the date of this report, and that it is therefore appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Further information regarding the Companys business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, is set out in the Strategic Report.
Further information regarding the financial position of the Company, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are also described in the Strategic Report.
In addition, notes 7 and 12 to the financial statements include the Companys objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The accounting policies set out in the notes to the financial statements have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Group financial statements.
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of financial assets classified as fair value through profit or loss or as available for sale.
The Group and Company financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, rounded to the nearest 0.1 million.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that are currently exercisable.
The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing so causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance.
The Group has securitised certain loans and advances to customers by the transfer of the loans to a special purpose entity SPE controlled by the Group.
The securitisation enables a subsequent issuance of debt by the SPE to investors who gain the security of the underlying assets as collateral.
The SPE is fully consolidated into the Group financial statements under IFRS 10, as the Group controls the entity in line with the above definition.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with adopted IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in which the estimate is reviewed.
To the extent that a change in an accounting estimate gives rise to changes in assets and liabilities, it is recognised by adjusting the carrying amount of the related asset or liability in the period of the change.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY In applying the Groups accounting policies as described in the notes to the financial statements, management has primarily applied judgement in the following areas: Classification of the Groups contracts with reinsurers as reinsurance contracts: A contract is required to transfer significant insurance risk in order to be classified as such.
Management reviews all terms and conditions of each such contract, and if necessary obtains the opinion of an independent expert at the negotiation stage in order to be able to make this judgement.
All reinsurance contracts both excess of loss and quota share contracts held by the Group have been assessed and it has been concluded that all contracts transfer significant insurance risk and have therefore been classified and accounted for as reinsurance contracts within these financial statements.
Consolidation of the Groups special purpose entity SPE : During the year the Group set up an SPE in relation to the Admiral Loans business, whereby the Group has securitised certain loans by the transfer of the loans to the SPE.
The securitisation enables a subsequent issue of debt by the SPE to investors who gain the security of the underlying assets as collateral.
The accounting treatment of the SPE has been assessed and it has been concluded that it should be fully consolidated into the Groups financial statements under IFRS 10.
This is due to the fact that despite not having legal ownership, the Group has control of the SPE, being exposed to the returns and having the ability to affect those returns through its power over the SPE.
The SPE has therefore been fully consolidated into the Groups financial statements.
130 Admiral Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Company Overview Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information There are two further significant accounting estimates within the financial statements that also require management to apply judgement: Calculation of insurance claims reserves: The Groups reserving policy requires management to set insurance claims reserves for the purpose of the financial statements, above the projected best estimate outcome, to allow for unforeseen adverse claims development.
Management applies judgement in determining where, above the projected best estimate outcome the insurance claims reserves should sit, in line with the Groups reserving methodology.
Refer to the section on estimation techniques below, and the analysis of Insurance risk in note 5 to the financial statements for further detail on the development of the Groups reserving methodology applied during the period and the calculation of the projected best estimate outcome.
Recognition of deferred tax assets relating to unused tax losses: Management applies judgement in determining the probability of future taxable profits of an entity against which to utilise accumulated losses in determining the recognition of deferred tax assets.
In applying this judgement, management makes an assessment of the reliability of approved business plan projections using both qualitative and quantitative factors including the age and status of the business, the Groups previous experience in similar markets, historic performance against business plans and the application of a number of stress and sensitivity tests to the projections.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty Estimation techniques are used in the calculation of the provisions for claims outstanding, which represent a projection of the ultimate cost of settling claims that have been incurred prior to the balance sheet date and remain unsettled at the balance sheet date.
The Groups reserving policy requires management to reserve above the projected best estimate, or ultimate, outcome, to allow for unforeseen adverse claims development.
There are two key areas of estimation uncertainty: the actuarial best estimate and the margin held above this best estimate.
Best estimate The key area where estimation techniques are used is in the ultimate projected cost of reported claims.
A secondary area relates to the emergence of claims that occurred prior to the balance sheet date, but had not been reported at that date.
The Groups independent actuarial advisors project the best estimate claims reserves using a variety of different recognised actuarial projection techniques for example incurred and paid chain ladder and an average cost of claim approach to allow an actuarial assessment of their potential outcome.
This includes allowance for unreported claims.
The most significant sensitivity in the use of the projection techniques arises from any future step change in claims costs, which would cause future claim cost inflation to deviate from historic trends.
This is most likely to arise from a change in the regulatory or judicial regime that leads to an increase in awards or legal costs for bodily injury claims that is significantly above or below the historical trend.
The Groups reserving methodology which determines the basis for setting this reserve estimate has been developed and enhanced in the period in line with new information that has become available in relation to both the projected best estimate reserve and the reserve uncertainty through the Groups development of its internal capital model.
Margin A wide range of factors inform managements recommendation in setting the margin held above actuarial best estimates, which is subject to approval from the Groups Reserving and Audit Committees, including: Reserve KPIs such as the level of margin as a percentage of the ultimate reserve.
Results of stress testing of key assumptions underpinning key actuarial assumptions within best estimate reserves.
A review of a number of individual and aggregated reserve scenarios which may result in future adverse variance to the ultimate best estimate reserve.
Qualitative assessment of the level of uncertainty and volatility within the reserves and the change in that assessment compared to previous periods.
In addition, the internal reserve risk distribution is used to determine the approximate confidence level of the recommended booked reserve position which enables comparison of the reserve strength to previous periods and demonstration of the compliance with IFRS 4.
For further detail on objectives, policies and procedures for managing insurance risk, refer to note 5 of the financial statements.
Future changes in claims reserves also impact profit commission income, as the measurement of this income is dependent on the loss ratio booked in the financial statements, and cash receivable is dependent on actuarial projections of ultimate loss ratios.

GROUP CONSOLIDATION AND OPERATING SEGMENTS 4a.
Accounting policies i Group consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the results and balances of the Company and all entities controlled by the Company, being its subsidiaries and special purpose entity together referred to as the Group, for the year ended 31 December 2018 and comparative figures for the year ended 31 December 2017.
The financial statements of the Companys subsidiaries and its special purpose entity are consolidated in the Group financial statements.
The Company controls 100% of the voting share capital of all its principal subsidiaries, except Admiral Law Limited, BDE Law Limited, Inspop USA LLC, the indirect holding in comparenow.
com Insurance Agency LLC, Rastreator.
com Limited, the indirect holding in Comparaseguros Corredura fide Seguros, S. L. Sociedad Unipersonal, Preminen Price Comparison Holdings Limited and the indirect holding in Preminen Dragon Price Comparison Limited.
The SPE is fully consolidated into the Group financial statements under IFRS 10, whereby the Group has control over the SPE.
The Parent Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
In accordance with IAS 24, transactions or balances between Group companies that have been eliminated on consolidation are not reported as related party transactions in the consolidated financial statements.
ii Foreign currency translation Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, rounded to the nearest 0.1 million, which is the Groups presentation currency.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary items measured at cost are translated at their historic rate and non-monetary items held at fair value are translated using the foreign exchange rate on the date that the fair value was established.
The financial statements of foreign operations whose functional currency is not pounds sterling are translated into the Group presentation currency sterling as follows: Assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet.
Income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the date of the transaction.
All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and in a separate component of equity except to the extent that the translation differences are attributable to non-controlling interests.
On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular operation is recognised in the income statement.
Segment reporting The Group has four reportable segments, as described below.
These segments represent the principal split of business that is regularly reported to the Groups Board of Directors, which is considered to be the Groups chief operating decision maker in line with IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
UK Insurance The segment consists of the underwriting of car insurance, van insurance, household insurance, travel insurance and other products that supplement these insurance policies within the UK.
It also includes the generation of revenue from additional products and fees from underwriting car insurance in the UK.
The Directors consider the results of these activities to be reportable as one segment as the activities carried out in generating the revenue are not independent of each other and are performed as one business.
This mirrors the approach taken in management reporting.
132 Admiral Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Company Overview Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information International Car Insurance The segment consists of the underwriting of car insurance and the generation of revenue from additional products and fees from underwriting car insurance outside of the UK.
It specifically covers the Group operations Admiral Seguros in Spain, ConTe in Italy, Lolivier assurance auto in France and Elephant Auto in the US.
None of these operations are reportable on an individual basis, based on the threshold requirements in IFRS 8.
Price Comparison The segment relates to the Groups price comparison businesses: Confused.
com in the UK, Rastreator in Spain, LeLynx in France and compare.
Each of the price comparison businesses are operating in individual geographical segments but are grouped into one reporting segment as Confused.
com, Rastreator, LeLynx and compare.
com do not individually meet the threshold requirements in IFRS 8.
Other The Other segment is designed to be comprised of all other operating segments that do not meet the threshold requirements for individual reporting.
It includes the Admiral Loans business and the Groups commercial van insurance broker, Gladiator.
Taxes are not allocated across the segments and, as with the corporate activities, are included in the reconciliation to the Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
An analysis of the Groups revenue and results for the year ended 31 December 2018, by reportable segment, is shown below.
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are materially consistent with those presented in the notes to the financial statements for the Group.

Segment revenues The UK and International Car Insurance reportable segments derive all insurance premium income from external policyholders.
Revenue within these segments is not derived from an individual policyholder that represents 10% or more of the Groups total revenue.
The total of Price Comparison revenues from transactions with other reportable segments is 19.3 million 2017: 19.8 million which has been eliminated on consolidation.
There are no other transactions between reportable segments.
Revenues from external customers for products and services are consistent with the split of reportable segment revenues as shown on page 133.
Information about geographical locations All material revenues from external customers, and net assets attributed to a foreign country, are shown within the International Car Insurance reportable segment shown on the previous pages.

134 Admiral Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Company Overview Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Segment assets and liabilities The identifiable segment assets and liabilities at 31 December 2018 are as follows: As at 31 December 2018 International UK Car Price Insurance Insurance Comparison Other Eliminations Total m m m m m m Property and equipment 22.0 3.7 2.4 28.1 Intangible assets 64.9 30.8 1.3 65.0 162.0 Reinsurance assets 1,540.6 343.1 0.2 1,883.5 Insurance and other receivables 1,389.5 191.7 36.7 17.0 552.9 1,082.0 Financial investments 2,590.6 182.8 20.0 2,793.4 Loans and advances to customers 300.2 300.2 Cash and cash equivalents 152.9 78.9 28.8 32.9 293.5 Reportable segment assets 5,760.5 831.0 89.2 414.9 552.9 6,542.7 Insurance contract liabilities 3,197.9 538.9 0.4 3,736.4 Trade and other payables 1,672.4 163.2 35.0 383.7 452.8 1,801.5 Other financial liabilities 240.1 240.1 Reportable segment liabilities 4,870.3 702.1 35.0 623.4 452.8 5,778.0 Reportable segment net assets 890.2 128.9 54.2 208.5 100.1 764.7 Unallocated assets and liabilities 6.4 Consolidated net assets 771.1 Unallocated assets and liabilities consist of other central assets and liabilities, plus deferred and current corporation tax balances.
These assets and liabilities are not regularly reviewed by the Board of Directors in the reportable segment format.
There is an asymmetrical allocation of assets and income to the reportable segments, in that the interest earned on cash and cash equivalent assets deployed in the UK Insurance, Price Comparison and International Car Insurance segments is not allocated in arriving at segment profits.
This is consistent with regular reporting to the Board of Directors.
Eliminations represent inter-segment funding and balances included in insurance and other receivables.

PREMIUM, CLAIMS AND PROFIT COMMISSIONS 5a.
Accounting policies i Revenue premiums Premiums relating to insurance contracts are recognised as revenue, net of insurance premium tax, proportionally over the period of cover.
Premiums with an inception date after the end of the period are held in the statement of financial position as deferred revenue.
Outstanding collections from policyholders are recognised within policyholder receivables.
ii Revenue profit commission Under some of the co-insurance and reinsurance contracts under which motor premiums are shared or ceded, profit commission may be earned on a particular year of account, which is usually subject to performance criteria such as loss ratios and expense ratios.
The commission is dependent on the ultimate outcome of any year, with revenue being recognised when loss and expense ratios used in the preparation of the financial statements move below a contractual threshold.
Profit commission receivable from reinsurance contracts is accounted for in line with IFRS 4, whereas profit commission receivable from co-insurance contracts is in line with IFRS 15.
Further detail of the policy under IFRS 15 is set out in note 8. iii Insurance contracts and reinsurance assets Premiums The proportion of premium receivable on in-force policies relating to unexpired risks is reported in insurance contract liabilities and reinsurance assets as the unearned premium provision gross and reinsurers share respectively.
Claims Claims and claims handling expenses are charged as incurred, based on the estimated direct and indirect costs of settling all liabilities arising on events occurring up to the balance sheet date.
The provision for claims outstanding comprises provisions for the estimated cost of settling all claims incurred but unpaid at the balance sheet date, whether reported or not.
Anticipated reinsurance recoveries are disclosed separately as assets.
136 Admiral Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Company Overview Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Whilst the Directors consider that the gross provisions for claims and the related reinsurance recoveries are fairly stated on the basis of the information currently available to them, the ultimate liability will vary as a result of subsequent information and events and may result in significant adjustments to the amounts provided.
Adjustments to the amounts of claims provisions established in prior years are reflected in the income statement for the period in which the adjustments are made and disclosed separately if material.
The methods used, and the estimates made, are reviewed regularly.
Provision for unexpired risks is made where necessary for the estimated amount required over and above unearned premiums net of deferred acquisition costs to meet future claims and related expenses.
Co-insurance The Group has entered into certain co-insurance contracts under which insurance risks are shared on a proportional basis, with the coinsurer taking a specific percentage of premium written and being responsible for the same proportion of each claim.
The co-insurer therefore takes direct insurance risk from the policyholder and is subsequently directly responsible to the claimant for its proportion of the claim.
As the contractual liability is several and not joint, neither the premiums nor claims relating to the co-insurance are included in the income statement.
Under the terms of these agreements the co-insurers reimburse the Group for the same proportionate share of the costs of acquiring and administering the business.
Reinsurance assets Contracts entered into by the Group with reinsurers under which the Group is compensated for losses on the insurance contracts issued by the Group are classified as reinsurance contracts.
A contract is only accounted for as a reinsurance contract where there is significant insurance risk transfer between the insured and the insurer.
Reinsurance assets are comprised of balances due from reinsurance companies for ceded insurance liabilities.
Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a consistent manner with the outstanding claims provisions or settled claims associated with the reinsured policies and in accordance with the relevant reinsurance contract.
The Group assesses its reinsurance assets for impairment on a regular basis, and in detail every six months.
If there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, then the carrying value will be written down to its recoverable amount.
On the commutation of reinsurance contracts, the reinsurer is discharged from all obligations relating to the contract.
Reinsurance assets and liabilities relating to the commuted contracts are settled in the period in which the commutation agreement is signed.

Reinsurance assets and insurance contract liabilities i Objectives, policies and procedures for the management of insurance risk The Groups primary business is the issuance of insurance contracts that transfer risk from policyholders to the Group and its co-insurance partners.
Insurance risk involves uncertainty over the occurrence, amount or timing of claims arising on insurance contracts issued.
It is primarily comprised of Reserve risk: the risk that the value of insurance liabilities established is insufficient to cover the ultimate cost of claims incurred at the balance sheet date, and premium risk: the risk that the claims experience on business written but not earned is higher than allowed for in the premiums charged to policyholders.
The Board of Directors is responsible for the management of insurance risk, although as mentioned in note 7, it has delegated the detailed oversight of risk management to the Group Risk Committee.
The Group also has a Reserving Committee which comprises senior managers within the finance, claims, pricing and actuarial functions.
The Reserving Committee primarily recommends the approach for UK Car Insurance reserving but also reviews the systems and controls in place to support accurate reserving and material reserving issues such as Periodic Payment Order PPO and claims inflation, which represent the key uncertainties in the amount or timing of claims settlements.
The Board implements certain policies in order to mitigate and control the level of insurance risk accepted by the Group.
These include pricing policies and claims management and administration processes, in addition to reserving policies and coand reinsurance arrangements as detailed below.
Reserve Risk Reserving risk is mitigated through a series of processes and controls.
The key processes are as follows: Regular management and internal actuarial review of individual and aggregate case claim reserves, including regular reporting of management information and exception reporting of significant movements: Regular management and internal actuarial review of large claims, including claims settled or potentially settled by PPOs for which the uncertainty is increased by factors such as the lifetime of the claimant and movements in the indexation for the cost of future care of the claimant: Bi-annual external actuarial review of best estimate claims reserves using a variety of recognised actuarial techniques: Internal actuarial analysis of reserve uncertainty through qualitative analysis, scenario testing and a range of stochastic reserving techniques: 138 Admiral Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Company Overview Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Ad hoc external reviews of reserving related processes and assumptions: and Use of a reserving methodology which informs managements reserving decisions for the purposes of the Groups financial statements.
As described in note 3, critical accounting judgements and estimates, the methodology determines that reserves should be set above projected best estimate outcomes to allow for unforeseen adverse claims development.
As noted above, the Group shares a significant amount of the insurance business generated with external underwriters.
As well as these proportional arrangements, excess of loss reinsurance programmes are also purchased to protect the Group against very large individual claims and catastrophe losses.
Claims reserving As previously disclosed, Admirals reserving policy both within the claims function and in the financial statements is initially to reserve conservatively, above internal and independent projections of actuarial best estimates.
This is designed to create a margin held in reserves to allow for unforeseen adverse development in open claims and typically results in Admiral making above industry average reserve releases.
Admirals booked claims reserves continue to include a significant margin above projected best estimates of ultimate claims costs.
As at 31 December 2018, the level of relative reserve margin is lower than that at 31 December 2017, albeit remaining prudent when measured against the internal reserve risk distribution and other market benchmarks.
As profit commission income is recognised in the income statement in line with loss ratios accounted for on Admirals own claims reserves, the reserving policy also results in profit commission income being deferred and recognised over time.
Premium Risk As noted above, the Group defines Premium risk as the risk that claims cost on business written but not yet earned is higher than allowed for in the premiums charged to policyholders.
This also includes catastrophe risk: the risk of incurring significant losses as a result of the occurrence of manmade catastrophe or natural weather events.
Key processes and controls operating to mitigate premium risk are as follows: Experienced and focused senior management and teams in relevant business areas including pricing and claims management: A data-driven and analytical approach to regular monitoring of claims and underwriting performance: and Capability to identify and resolve underperformance promptly through changes to key performance drivers, in particular pricing.
In addition, as mentioned above, excess of loss reinsurance programmes are also purchased to protect the Group against very large individual claims and catastrophe losses.
Other elements of insurance risk include reinsurance risk: the risk of placement of ineffective reinsurance arrangements, or the economic risk of reduced availability of co-insurance and reinsurance arrangements in future periods.
The Group mitigates these risks by ensuring that it has a diverse range of financially secure reinsurance partners, including a long-term relationship with Munich Re and a number of other very large reinsurers.
Concentration of insurance risk The Directors do not believe there are significant concentrations of insurance risk.
This is because, although the Group has historically written only one significant line of UK insurance business, the risks are spread across a large number of people and a wide regional base.
The international car insurance and UK household businesses further contribute to the diversification of the Groups insurance risk.

Reinsurance assets and insurance contract liabilities continued ii Sensitivity of recognised amounts to changes in assumptions Ogden discount rate As noted above, the gross and reinsurers share of UK motor insurance liabilities in these financial statements are prepared on the basis of an Ogden discount rate of 0% 2017: minus 0.75%.
On 7 September 2017, the Lord Chancellor announced draft legislation to change the way in which the Ogden discount rate is set, with initial indications being that the new discount rate could be set between 0% and 1%.
Royal assent was received in December 2018, with the new discount rate expected to be set during 2019.
The sensitivity of a change in this assumption by 50 basis points both an increase and decrease is shown in the table below.
This is disclosed as Management consider it to be the most material assumption in the projection of the best estimate reserve outcomes.
The impact presented is the total impact of the change on the Groups pre-tax profit on an ultimate basis.
It should be noted that not all of the ultimate impact would necessarily be recognised immediately.

FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES 7a.
Accounting policies i Financial assets Classification and measurement The classification and subsequent measurement of the financial assets under IFRS 9 depends on: a the Groups business model for managing the financial assets and b the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets.
Based on these factors, a financial asset is classified into one of the following categories: Amortised cost assets which are held in order to collect contractual cash flows, and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise to cash flows which are solely payments of principal and interest SPPI on the principal amount outstanding, where the asset is not designated as FVTPL.
The carrying amount is adjusted by the expected credit loss allowance.
Interest income from these assets is included in Interest return using the effective interest rate method.
For the Group these include deposits with credit institutions, cash and cash equivalents, insurance receivables, trade and other receivables and loans and advances to customers.
Fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI assets which are held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell the asset, where the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise to cash flows which are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding SPPI, where the asset is not designated as FVTPL.
Movements in the carrying amount are taken through OCI, with the exception of recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest revenue and foreign exchange gains or losses which are recognised in profit or loss.
For the Group these assets include Government gilts and debt securities.
In addition, IFRS 9 allows an irrevocable election at initial recognition to designate equity investments at FVOCI that otherwise would be held at FVTPL, provided these are not held for trading.
The Group has made this election for certain equity investments.
Fair value through profit or loss FVTPL assets which do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI, or which are designated as FVTPL.
For the Group these assets include investment liquidity funds investing in short duration assets and derivative financial instruments.
A gain or loss on a debt instrument measured at FVTPL which is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in profit or loss and presented within Investment return in the period in which it arises.
Impairment IFRS 9 outlines an expected credit loss ECL model for impairments, which replaces the incurred loss model under IAS 39.
Under IFRS 9 an expected credit loss should be calculated for all assets measured at amortised cost, as well as debt instruments measured at FVOCI.
fide-recognition A financial asset is derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from that asset have expired, or when the Group transfers the asset and all the attached substantial risks and rewards relating to the asset to a third party.
ii Financial Liabilities Classification and subsequent measurement Subsequent measurement of financial liabilities is at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Movements in the amortised cost are recognised through the income statement.
fide-recognition A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under that liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.

Classification At initial recognition, the Group measures financial investments at fair value plus or minus, in the case of financial instruments not measured at fair value through profit and loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
Transaction costs of financial instruments measured at fair value through profit and loss are expensed to the income statement when incurred.
Money market funds and derivative financial instruments are measured at FVTPL.
These assets used to invest regulatory capital within the Group, and surplus liquidity which may be held.
Buying and selling activity depending on timing of different cashflows.
Government gilts and debt securities are measured at FVOCI and as such fall under the scope of the ECL model.
These assets are held to match policyholder liabilities or interest on debt liabilities.
Selling of these assets has occurred, and is likely to occur in future.
Private Equity investments have been designated as being reported through FVOCI.
These investments are long term, strategic investments.
Dividends are recognised in the Income Statement whilst a change in fair values will be reflected in OCI.
Given the immaterial amount 7.8 million of these investments, detailed levelling disclosures have not been provided.

FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES CONTINUED 7c.
Financial Investments continued Impairment All financial assets held at FVOCI and at amortised cost have been assessed for impairment using the expected credit loss model under IFRS 9.
The assessment has been made based on the credit ratings of the entities, and externally available credit loss ratios.
The fair value of the gilts and debt securities is calculated with reference to quoted market valuations and as such take into account future expected credit losses.
As a result, no material impairment provision is required.
The calculated impairment loss within the fair value is recognised through the Income Statement whilst fair value movements are recognised in other comprehensive income.
All assets that are purchased, which require a calculation of impairment, are of considered investment grade or above i. e. BBB rated or higher, as defined by an external credit rating agency or an assessment from Admirals external asset managers.
The credit rating of all assets is regularly monitored.
As at the year end reporting date, all financial assets are of investment grade and considered low credit risk under IFRS 9.
Therefore, these assets remain within stage 1 and a 12 month expected loss is used to calculate the impairment provision required.
If any assets where to be downgraded below BBB the Group would consider these to be have significantly increased in credit risk since inception, therefore enter stage 2 under IFRS 9.
On transition from IAS39 to IFRS 9 an impairment provision of 0.4 million was recognised on these assets.
This increased to 0.5 million at 31 December 2018.
Given there is no material change in the credit quality or type of financial assets in the year, and the movement in provision is immaterial, no further disclosure has been made.
Deposits are held with well rated institutions: as such no impairment provision is required.
Fair value measurement For assets held at fair value through profit and loss, their value equates to level one quoted prices in active markets of the fair value hierarchy.
The measurement of debt securities and government gilts is based on active quoted market values level one.
Deposits are held with well rated institutions: as such the approximate fair value is the book value of the investment as impairment of the capital is not expected.
There is no quoted market for these holdings and as such a level two valuation is used.
The book value of these deposits is 100.0 million 2017: 130.0 million.
Equity investments held at fair value are measured at level three of the fair value hierarchy.
No further information is provided due to the immateriality of the balance at 31 December 2018.
7d Cash and cash equivalents 31 December 31 December 2018 2017 m m Cash at bank and in hand 376.0 325.3 Short-term deposits 0.8 1.5 Total cash and cash equivalents 376.8 326.8 Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term deposits with original maturities of three months or less.
All cash and cash equivalents are measured at amortised cost.
An assessment has been completed for impairment purposes.
Given the short-term duration of these assets and low risk of these assets, no impairment provision has been recognised.
This will be regularly tracked and monitored.
For cash at bank and cash deposits and other receivables, the fair value approximates to the book value due to their short maturity.
All assets are of investment grade or above e. g. BBB rated or higher.
As at the year end reporting date all financial assets are of investment grade and considered low risk under IFRS 9.
These therefore remain within stage 1 and a 12 month expected loss is used to calculate the impairment provision required.
152 Admiral Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Company Overview Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information 7e Loans and advances to customers 31 December 31 December 2018 2017 m m Loans and advances to customers gross carrying amount 310.4 67.4 Loans and advances to customers provision 10.2 1.2 Total loans and advances to customers 300.2 66.2 Loans and advances to customers relate to the Admiral loans business.
This includes unsecured personal loans and car finance products.
Due to the size of the provision and sensitivities that could reasonably be applied, this is not considered a critical accounting judgement or key source of estimation uncertainty.
Classification Loans and advances to customers are measured at amortised cost.
This is because the assets are held in order to collect contractual cash flows, and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise to cash flows which are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
Fair value measurement The amortised cost of loans and advances to customers is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Expected credit losses The expected credit loss model is a three-stage model based on forward looking information regarding changes in the credit quality since origination.
Credit risk is measured using a probability of default PD, exposure at default EAD and loss given default LGD defined as follows: Probability of Default PD : The likelihood of an account default calibrated through analysis of historic customer behaviour.
Exposure at Default EAD : The amount of balance at the time of default.
For loans that are in arrears the EAD is taken as the current balance, for up to date loans the contractual outstanding balance in each future month is used.
Loss Given Default LGD : The amount of the asset lost if a borrower defaults, determined through a combination of historic recovery performance and expert judgement.
The PD is applied to the EAD balance to calculate the expected loss stemming from each future period based on the likelihood of the customer entering default on the exposure at that point.
The LGD is then applied to this loss to calculate the total expected loss excluding recoveries.
A forward looking provision is also calculated, as set out later in this note.
The three stages of the model are defined as follows: Stage 1 no significant increase in credit risk of the financial asset since inception: Stage 2 significant increase in credit risk of the financial asset since inception: and Stage 3 financial asset is credit impaired.
For instruments in stage 1, the allowance is calculated as the expected credit losses that result from default events possible within 12 months after the reporting date.
For instruments in stages 2 and 3 the allowance is calculated as the expected credit loss on a lifetime basis.
Significant increase in credit risk A significant increase in credit risk is deemed to have occurred where: The loan is 1 to 3 loan payments in arrears: or Two or more payments are overdue elsewhere, other than within the Admiral loans business.
The Group will not rebut the presumption within IFRS 9 that loans which are 30 days past due have experienced a significant increase in credit risk.
Admiral Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 153 Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2018 7.
FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES CONTINUED 7e Loans and advances to customers continued Credit Impaired A loan is deemed to be credit impaired where 4 or more payments have been missed, or where there is a confirmed IVA agreement or debt collection agency instruction.
The Group will not rebut the presumption within IFRS 9 that default has occurred when an exposure is greater than 90 days past due, which is consistent with a customer being 4 or more payments in arrears.
Payments in arrears Days past due 1 0 30 2 31 60 3 61 90 4 91 Write off policy Loans are written off where there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.
The Groups policy is to write off balances to their estimated net realisable value.
Write-offs occur on a case by case basis taking into account the operational position and the collections strategies.
Forward-looking information Under IFRS 9 the provision must reflect an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes.
The means by which the Group has determined to this is to run scenario analysis.
Economic downturn and upturn scenarios are given a 25% weighting with the best estimate provision receiving a 50% weighting.
Management judgement has been used to define the weighting and severity of the different scenarios, based on available data without undue cost or effort.
A downturn has been calibrated to be consistent with a return to losses from loans written in 2007 and 2009, the most recent economic downturn.
The 2007 09 period is considered to be a significant economic global event.
The upturn is consistent with a consumer behaviour from loans written in 2013, when credit providers tightened significantly on their lending criteria.
These scenarios are reviewed on a semi-annual basis, and the assumptions and weighting reviewed based on additional information available at the time of review.
Amounts arising from ECL: loans and advances to customers The Group is exposed to credit risk from the Admiral loans business, which has continued to expand during 2018.
The following table sets out information about the credit quality of the loans and advances to customers, measured at amortised cost.
Credit grades are used to segment customers by apparent credit risk at the time of acquisition.
The Group does not have any purchased or originated credit-impaired POCI assets.
All probability of defaults include forward looking information.
The average probability of default in relation to the assets in Stage 1 is 1.8% based on defaults within 12 months of the reporting date.
On entering Stage 2 the average PD increases to 5.2% reflecting losses over the life of the asset.
The average PD for all assets in Stage 2 is 25.1%.
Assets in Stage 3 are deemed to be in default.

Insurance receivables Insurance receivables are also measured at amortised cost.
Given the short-term duration of these assets no impairment provision has been recognised.
Trade and other receivables are measured at amortised cost, being made up of multiple types of receivable balances.
Where a provision is required for these receivables, it is calculated in line with the simplified method for trade receivables per IFRS 9, whereby lifetime expected credit losses are recognised irrelevant of the credit risk.
In this case, the provision is based on a combination of: i aged debtor analysis ii historic experience of write-offs for each receivable, iii any specific indicators of credit deterioration observed, and iv management judgement The level of provision is immaterial.
There was no change to the provision at 1 January 2018 on transition from IAS39 to IFRS 9.
The amortised cost carrying amount of receivables is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
7g Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are inclusive of 200 million subordinated notes issued on 25 July 2014 at a fixed rate of 5.5% with a redemption date of 25 July 2024.
The notes are unsecured subordinated obligations of the Group and rank pari passu without any preference among themselves.
In the event of a winding-up or bankruptcy, they are to be repaid only after the claims of all other creditors have been met.
There have been no defaults on any of the notes during the year.
The Group has the option to defer interest payments on the notes but to date has not exercised this right.
The fair value of subordinated notes level one valuation at 31 December 2018 is 211.3 million 2017: 229.2 million.
The Group holds a revolving credit facility of 200 million which expires in December 2020.
As at 31 December 2018, 71.5 million 2017: 20 million was drawn under this agreement as shown within other borrowings in the table above.
In addition, during 2018 an asset backed senior loan note facility of 300 million was established in relation to the Admiral loans business.
As at the year end, 168.3 million of this facility had been utilised.

Objectives, policies and procedures for managing financial assets and liabilities The Groups activities expose it primarily to financial risks of credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign exchange risk.
The Board of Directors has delegated the task of supervising risk management and internal control to the Group Risk Committee.
There is also an Investment Committee that makes recommendations to the Board on the Groups investment strategy.
There are several key elements to the risk management environment throughout the Group.
These are detailed in full in the Corporate Governance Statement.
Specific considerations for the risks arising from financial assets and liabilities are detailed below.
Credit risk The Group defines credit risk as the risk of loss if another party fails to perform its obligations.
The key areas of exposure to credit risk for the Group result through its reinsurance programme, investments, bank deposits, loans and advances to customers and policyholder receivables.
The Directors consider counterparty exposure frequently and in significant detail.
The Directors consider that the policies and procedures in place to manage credit exposure continue to be appropriate for the Groups risk appetite and, during 2018 and historically, no material credit losses have been experienced by the Group.
Financial Investments There are no specific concentrations of credit risk with respect to investment counterparties due to the structure of the liquidity funds and the parameters set for managing the Fixed Income Mandates.
Both forms of investment hold a wide range of very short duration, high quality securities.
Cash balances and deposits are placed only with highly rated credit institutions.
The detailed holdings are reviewed regularly by the Investment Committee.
Reinsurance assets To mitigate the risk arising from exposure to reinsurers in the form of reinsurance recoveries and profit commissions, the Group only conducts business with companies of appropriate financial strength ratings.
In addition, many reinsurance contracts are operated on a funds withheld basis, which substantially reduces credit risk, as the Group withholds the cash received from policyholders as collateral.
Loans and Advances to Customers The risk appetite for the lending business is set with respect to anticipated loan losses over a 12-month period.
Management has defined an amber and a red loan loss limit, representing points at which action is required.
These limits have been defined by management to reflect the business maturity, the business ambitions and the economic climate.
Risk appetite is assessed at least annually, while the limits are continuously monitored.
Insurance assets A further principal form of credit risk is in respect of amounts due from policyholders, largely due to the potential for default by instalment payers.
The impact of this is mitigated by the large customer base and low average level of balance recoverable.
There is also mitigation by the operation of numerous highand low-level controls in this area, including payment on policy acceptance as opposed to inception and automated cancellation procedures for policies in default.
The amount of bad debt expense relating to policyholder debt charged to the income statement in 2018 and 2017 is insignificant.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables and other debtors are also subject to credit risk, although this is mitigated by a review of the credit worthiness of all counterparties prior to them being accepted.
Admiral Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 157 Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2018 7.
FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES CONTINUED 7h.
Objectives, policies and procedures for managing financial assets and liabilities continued Other Assets All other assets are assessed as low credit risk under IFRS 9, with no significant amounts past due or impaired.
The Groups credit risk exposure to assets with external ratings is as follows: 31 December 31 December 2018 2017 Rating m m Financial institutions Credit institutions AAA 164.3 210.7 Financial institutions Credit institutions AA 942.1 650.3 Financial institutions Credit institutions A 1,501.3 1,737.0 Financial institutions Credit institutions BBB and below 567.9 249.7 UK Government gilts AA 170.9 173.8 Reinsurers AA 458.5 355.7 Reinsurers A 303.6 256.4 The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2018 is 4,507.4 million 2017: 3,723.8 million, being the carrying value of financial investments and cash, the carrying value of loans and advances to customers, and the excess of reinsurance assets over amounts owed to reinsurers under funds withheld arrangements.
The Group does not use credit derivatives or similar instruments to mitigate exposure.
9.2 million 2017: 1.0 million was charged to the income statement in respect of loans and advances to customers.
Further details are provided in note 7e above.
There were no further significant financial assets that were past due at the close of either 2018 or 2017.
Interest rate risk The Group considers interest rate risk to be the risk that unfavourable movements in interest rates could adversely impact on the capital values of financial assets and liabilities.
Invested Assets As noted above, the Group primarily invests the following asset types: Investment funds and cash plus liquidity funds, which in turn invest in a mixture of short dated fixed and variable rate securities, such as cash deposits, certificates of deposits, floating rate notes and other commercial paper.
Deposits with well rated institutions are short in duration one to five years.
These are classified as held at amortised cost.
Therefore neither the carrying value of the asset, nor the interest return will be impacted by fluctuations in interest rates.
Debt securities are held within two segregated mandates.
The guidelines of the investments retain a similar credit quality of the investment funds all holdings are investment grade.
The duration of the securities is relatively short and similar to the duration of the on book claims liabilities the average duration is three years.
UK Government gilts are classified FVOCI.
Loans and Advances to customers The Groups Loan portfolio is made up of fixed rate on loans and funded at floating variable rate.
The Group has instigated an interest rate swap arrangement in the year.
The risk management objective is to eliminate the majority of the Interest Rate risk from the Loans portfolio.
This relates to the difference between fixed rate on loans written and floating variable rate on funding.
158 Admiral Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Company Overview Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Hedge Accounting Hedge accounting is applied when the criteria specified in IFRS 9 are met.
In line with IFRS 9, the gain or loss on the hedged position as at the balance sheet date is recognised through Other Comprehensive Income.
This results in a hedging reserve at 31 December 2018 in relation to the interest rate swap.
Due to the immateriality of the transaction and balance, no further disclosure is made.
Financial Liabilities The Group also holds a financial liability in the form of 200 million of subordinated notes with a ten year maturity and fixed rate coupon of 5.5%.
This liability is valued at amortised cost and therefore neither the carrying value of the deposits, nor the interest payable, will be impacted by fluctuations in interest rates.
No sensitivity analysis to interest rates has been presented on the grounds of materiality.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group does not have sufficient, available financial resources to enable it to meet its obligations as they fall due, or can only secure them at excessive cost.
The Group is strongly cash-generative due to the large proportion of revenue arising from non-underwriting activity.
Further, as noted above, a significant portion of insurance funds are invested in investment funds with same day liquidity, meaning that a large proportion of the Group cash and investments is immediately available.
A breakdown of the Groups other financial liabilities, trade payables and other payables is shown in note 11.
The subordinated notes have a ten year maturity whereas all trade and other payables will mature within three to six months of the balance sheet date.
Refer to the maturity profile at the start of this note for further detail.
In practice, the Groups Directors expect actual cash flows to be consistent with this maturity profile except for amounts owed to coinsurers and reinsurers.
Of the total amounts owed to co-insurers and reinsurers of 1,275.9 million 2017: 1,157.5 million, 1,022.7 million 2017: 938.4 million is held under funds withheld arrangements and therefore not expected to be settled within 12 months.
A maturity analysis for insurance contract liabilities is included in note 5.
The maturity profile for financial assets is included at the start of this note.
The Groups Directors believe that the cash flows arising from these assets will be consistent with this profile.
Liquidity risk is not, therefore, considered to be significant.
Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk arises from unfavourable movements in foreign exchange rates that could adversely impact the valuation of overseas assets and liabilities.
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk through its operations overseas.
Although the relative size of the international operations means that the risks are relatively small, increasingly volatile foreign exchange rates could result in larger potential gains or losses.
Assets held to fund insurance liabilities are held in the currency of the liabilities: however, surplus assets held as regulatory capital in foreign currencies remain exposed.
The Groups exposure to net assets and profits in currencies other than the reporting currency is immaterial other than for US dollars and Euros.
The Groups exposure to net assets held in dollars at the balance sheet date was 60.7 million 2017: 55.1 million : the exposure to net assets held in Euros was 69.3 million 2017: nil.
The loss before tax derived from business carried out in the US was 19.2 million 2017: 23.4 million.
If the Sterling rates with US dollars had strengthened weakened by 10%, the Groups profit before tax for the year would increase decrease by 1.8 million 2017: 2.2 million.
The profit before tax derived from business carried out in Euros was 5.2 million 2017: loss before tax of 0.7 million.
If the Sterling rates with euros had strengthened weakened by 10%, the Groups profit before tax for the year would increase decrease by 0.4 million 2017: 0.1 million.
Admiral Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 159 Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2018 8.
OTHER REVENUE The Group has applied IFRS 15 using the cumulative effect method therefore the comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under IAS 18 and IAS 11.
No material differences in the accounting treatment between these standards has been identified.
Accounting policy i Contribution from additional products and fees and Other Revenue Revenue is credited to the income statement over the period matching the Groups obligations to provide services.
Where the Group has no remaining obligations, the revenue is recognised immediately.
An allowance is made for expected cancellations where the customer may be entitled to a refund of the amount charged.
Commission from the provision of insurance intermediary services is credited to revenue on the sale of the underlying insurance policy.
There has been no change in revenue recognition from the comparative period, as revenue recognition was in line with the requirements of IFRS 15.
Interest income received in relation to loans and advances to customers is calculated using the effective interest method which allocates interest, and direct and incremental fees and costs, over the expected lives of the assets and liabilities.
There has been no change in recognition of interest income from the comparative period.
ii Nature of goods and services The following is a description of the principle activities within the scope of IFRS 15 from which the Group generates its other revenue.
Products and services Nature, timing of satisfaction of performance obligations and significant payment terms Profit commission The performance obligation is the provision of insurance intermediary services.
from co-insurers Profit commission revenue is calculated as a proportion of the ultimate profitability of individual underwriting years.
Uncertainty over the ultimate profitability of an underwriting year results in the recognition of profit commission revenue being constrained through the use of margin for uncertainty within the calculation of underwriting year profit.
This ensures that at any point in time, in line with the requirements of IFRS 15, there is a high probability that there will be no significant reversal of revenue in any financial period.
Further detail on the recognition of profit commission is included in note 5.
Price comparison The performance obligation is the provision of insurance intermediary services, at which point the performance obligation is met.
Revenue is therefore recognised at a point in time.
Commission on underlying The performance obligation is the provision of insurance intermediary services, at which point the products performance obligation is met.
Payment of the commission is due within 30 days of the period close.
Administration fees The performance obligation is the change requested being made to the underlying policy, at which point the performance obligation is met.
Revenue is therefore recognised at a point in time and is collected immediately or in line with direct debit instalments.
Revenue from law firms The performance obligation is the pursuit of the compensation from the other sides insurer OSI on behalf of the customer.
Revenue is therefore recognised over time using inputs and the expected value method.
Inputs including hours incurred and a 12 month realisable rate are used to calculate the expected value of revenue.
Payment is due within 28 days of invoice.

Accounting policies i Acquisition costs and operating expenses Acquisition costs incurred in obtaining new and renewal business are charged to the income statement over the period in which those premiums are earned.
All other operating expenses are charged to the income statement in the period that they are incurred.
ii Employee benefits Pensions The Group contributes to defined contribution personal pension plans for its employees.
The contributions payable to these schemes are charged in the accounting period to which they relate.
Employee share schemes The Group operates a number of equity and cash settled compensation schemes for its employees.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of free shares under the equity settled schemes is recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in equity.
For cash settled schemes, the fair value of services received are also recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in liability.
For equity settled schemes, the total charge expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the free shares granted as determined at the grant date excluding the impact of non-market vesting conditions.
Non-market conditions such as profitability targets as well as staff attrition rates are included in assumptions over the number of free shares to vest under the applicable scheme.
162 Admiral Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Company Overview Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information For cash settled schemes, the total charge expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the closing Admiral Group share price at the end of the period.
Prior to the vesting of each scheme, the closing share price at the end of the reporting period is used as an approximation for the closing share price at the end of the vesting period.
As with equity settled schemes, non-market vesting conditions also impact on the total charge expensed over the vesting period.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its assumptions on the number of shares which will vest with the impact of any change in the assumptions recognised through income.
Refer to note 9f for further details on share schemes.
iii Leases Operating leases Leases which do not transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased items are classified as operating leases.
The Group has entered into a number of non-cancellable operating lease arrangements for properties and other assets.
The leases have varying terms, escalation values and renewal rights.
Operating lease payments, including the effects of any lease incentives, are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Contingent rentals are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.

The co-insurance share of the charge is included in the change in trade and other payables line.
i The Approved Share Incentive Plan the SIP Eligible UK based employees qualified for awards under the SIP based upon the performance of the Group in each half-year period.
The maximum award for each year is 3,600 per employee.
The awards are made with reference to the Groups performance against prior year profit before tax.
Employees must remain in employment for the holding period three years from the date of award otherwise the shares are forfeited.
The fair value of shares awarded is the share price at the date of award.
Awards under the SIP are entitled to receive dividends, and, hence, no adjustment has been made to this fair value.

Accounting policy Income tax on the profit or loss for the periods presented comprises current and deferred tax.
i Current tax Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, and includes any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Current tax related to items recognised in other comprehensive income is also recognised in other comprehensive income and not in the income statement.
ii Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided in full using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences arising between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
It is calculated at the tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
The principal temporary differences arise from carried forward losses, depreciation of property and equipment and share scheme charges.
The resulting deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except in relation to share scheme charges where the amount of tax benefit credited to the income statement is limited to an equivalent credit calculated on the accounting charge.
Any excess is recognised directly in equity.
Deferred tax assets relating to carried forward losses are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets can be utilised.
The probability of the availability of future taxable profits is determined by a combination of the classification of the status of the businesses holding cumulative tax losses and the business plan profit projections for that business, subject to appropriate stress testing.

A further reduction to the main rate of corporation tax to 17% effective from 1 April 2020 was enacted on 15 September 2016.
This will reduce the Groups future current tax charge accordingly.
The deferred tax asset 31 December 2018 has been calculated based on the rate at which each timing difference is most likely to reverse.
The deferred tax asset in relation to carried forward losses has been reduced to nil following the impairment of Admiral Groups investment in Compare.

OTHER ASSETS AND OTHER LIABILITIES 11a.
Accounting policy i Property and equipment, and depreciation All property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight line method to write off the cost less residual values of the assets over their useful economic lives.
These useful economic lives are as follows: Improvements to short leasehold buildings four to ten years Computer equipment two to four years Office equipment four years Furniture and fittings four years Motor vehicles four years 168 Admiral Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Company Overview Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information ii Impairment of property and equipment In the case of property and equipment, carrying values are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there are any indications of impairment.
If any such indications exist, the assets recoverable amount is estimated and compared to the carrying value.
The carrying value is the higher of the fair value of the asset, less costs to sell and the assets value in use.
Impairment losses are recognised through the income statement.
iii Leased assets The rental costs relating to assets held under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Leases under the terms of which the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classed as finance leases.
Assets acquired under finance leases are included in property and equipment at fair value on acquisition and are depreciated in the same manner as equivalent owned assets.
Finance lease and hire purchase obligations are included in creditors and the finance costs are spread over the periods of the agreements based on the net amount outstanding.
iv Intangible assets Goodwill All business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
Goodwill has been recognised in acquisitions of subsidiaries, and represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.
The classification and accounting treatment of acquisitions occurring before 1 January 2004 have not been reconsidered in preparing the Groups opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 January 2004 due to the exemption available in IFRS 1 First time adoption.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, goodwill is included at the transition date on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under UK GAAP, which was tested for impairment at the transition date.
On transition, amortisation of goodwill has ceased as required by IAS 38.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units CGUs according to business segment and is reviewed annually for impairment.
The goodwill held on the balance sheet at 31 December 2018 is allocated solely to the UK Car Insurance segment.
Impairment of goodwill The annual impairment review involves comparing the carrying amount to the estimated recoverable amount by allocating the goodwill to CGUs and recognising an impairment loss if the recoverable amount is lower.
Impairment losses are recognised through the income statement and are not subsequently reversed.
The recoverable amount is the greater of the fair value of the asset less costs to sell and the value in use of the CGU.
The value in use calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a three year period.
Cash flows beyond this period are considered, but not included in the calculation.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations are those regarding growth rates and expected changes in pricing and expenses incurred during the period.
Management estimates growth rates and changes in pricing based on past practices and expected future changes in the market.
The headroom above the goodwill carrying value is very significant, and there is no foreseeable event that would eliminate this margin.
Deferred acquisition costs Acquisition costs comprise all direct and indirect costs arising from the conclusion of insurance contracts.
Deferred acquisition costs represent the proportion of acquisition costs incurred that correspond to the unearned premiums provision at the balance sheet date.
This balance is held as an intangible asset.
It is amortised over the term of the contract as premium is earned.
Software Purchased software is recognised as an intangible asset and amortised over its expected useful life generally the licence term.
Internally generated software is recognised as an intangible asset, with directly attributable costs incurred in the development stage capitalised.
The internally generated software assets are amortised over the expected useful life of the systems and amortisation commences when the software is available for use.
The carrying value of software is reviewed every six months for evidence of impairment, with the value being written down if any impairment exists.
Impairment may be reversed if conditions subsequently improve.

OTHER ASSETS AND OTHER LIABILITIES CONTINUED 11a.
Accounting policy continued iv Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets Provisions are recognised when a legal or constructive obligation arises as a result of an event that occurred before the balance sheet date, when a cash-outflow relating to this obligation is probable and when the amount can be estimated reliably.
Where a material obligation exists, but the likelihood of a cash out-flow or the amount is uncertain, or where there is a possible obligation arising from a past event that is contingent on a future event, a contingent liability is disclosed.
Contingent assets are possible assets that arise from past events, whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or nonoccurrence of future events.
Where it is probable that a cash-inflow will arise from a contingent asset, this is disclosed.

Goodwill relates to the acquisition of Group subsidiary EUI Limited formerly Admiral Insurance Services Limited in November 1999.
It is allocated solely to the UK Car Insurance segment.
As described in the accounting policies, the amortisation of this asset ceased on transition to IFRS on 1 January 2004.
All annual impairment reviews since the transition date have indicated that the estimated recoverable value of the asset is greater than the carrying amount and therefore no impairment losses have been recognised.

com Limited, the Groups Spanish Price comparison business, is currently undergoing a tax audit in respect of the 2013 and 2014 financial years.
The Spanish Tax Authority is disputing the VAT exemption relating to insurance intermediary services which Rastreator.
com has applied to its supplies.
com believes its application of the exemption is justifiable in line with the EU Directive and is also consistent with the way similar supplies are treated throughout Europe.
No formal assessment has been received from the Spanish Tax Authority as at the date of these financial statements, however should a formal assessment be received at a future date Rastreator.
com will immediately appeal and is confident of a successful outcome.
The potential liability for the financial years subject to audit is approximately 5 million, though if the exemption is also disallowed in respect of years 2015 to date, the liability could increase up to 18 million.
No provision has been made in these financial statements in relation to this matter.

Objectives, policies and procedures for managing capital The Group manages its capital to ensure that all entities within the Group are able to continue as going concerns and also to ensure that regulated entities meet regulatory requirements with an appropriate margin.
Excess capital above these levels within subsidiaries is paid up to the Group holding company in the form of dividends on a regular basis.
The Groups dividend policy is to make distributions after taking into account capital that is required to be held a for regulatory purposes: b to fund expansion activities: and c as a further buffer against unforeseen events.
This policy gives the Directors flexibility in managing the Groups capital.
The Groups regulatory capital requirements are discussed in the Group Financial Review within the Strategic Report.

Aggregate compensation for the Executive Directors is disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 98 to 107.
Post balance sheet events As a result of the Groups preparations for Brexit, on 1 January 2019, as outlined in the Strategic Report, the assets and liabilities of Admiral Seguros, ConTe and LOlivier were transferred to a new European intermediary, AIS, and European underwriter, AECS, from EUI Limited and Admiral Insurance Company Limited and Admiral Insurance Gibraltar Limited respectively.
The operations of the businesses have not been impacted and there is no material impact on the Groups reported results either in 2018, or as a result of the transition in 2019.
RECONCILIATIONS The following tables reconcile significant key performance indicators and non-GAAP measures included in the Strategic Report to items included in the financial statements.
Reconciliation of turnover to reported gross premiums written and Other Revenue as per the financial statements 31 December 31 December 2018 2017 m m Gross premiums written after co-insurance per note 5b of financial statements 2,166.7 1,927.7 Premiums underwritten through co-insurance arrangements and true up of 2017 gross written premium 587.4 571.7 Total premiums written before co-insurance arrangements 2,754.1 2,499.4 Other Revenue 449.2 399.9 Admiral Loans interest income and other fee income 15.4 1.6 3,218.7 2,900.9 1 UK vehicle commission 0.4 1.0 2 Other 45.3 38.5 Turnover as per note 4b of financial statements 3,263.6 2,938.4 3 Intra-group income elimination 19.3 19.8 Total turnover 3,282.9 2,958.2 1 During 2012 Admiral ceased earning Other Revenue from the sale of non-optional legal protection policies.
At the same point, the Group began charging its panel of coand reinsurers a vehicle commission.
The substance of these changes meant that the total premiums written increased by the amount of revenue that was previously earned from the sale of non-optional legal protection policies.
The vehicle commission included within Other Revenue is therefore eliminated from the turnover measure to avoid double counting.
2 Other reconciling items represent co-insurer and reinsurer shares of Other Revenue in the Groups Insurance businesses outside of UK Car Insurance.
3 Intra-group income elimination relates to price comparison income earned in the Group from other Group companies.
