The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption available under s408 of the Companies Act 2006 and have not presented a profit and loss account of the Company.
A summary of the Companys significant accounting policies is set out below.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost, less provision for impairment.
The carrying amount of the Companys investments in subsidiaries is reviewed annually to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the investments recoverable amount is estimated.
If the carrying value of the investment exceeds the recoverable amount, the investment is considered to be impaired and is written down to the recoverable amount.
The impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
Foreign currency Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement unless it relates to items recognised directly in equity, when it is recognised directly in equity, or when it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income, when it is recognised through the statement of comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Deferred tax is provided on certain temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and taxation purposes respectively.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.
After considering forecast future profits, deferred tax assets are recognised where it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which those assets can be utilised.

The fair value is measured at grant date and charged as the employees become unconditionally entitled to the rights.
The Groups equity-settled share plans are settled either by the issue of shares by Merlin Entertainments plc or by the purchase of shares in the market.
The fair value of the share plans is recognised as an expense over the expected vesting period net of deferred tax with a corresponding entry to retained earnings.
The fair value of the share plans is determined at the date of grant.
Non-market based vesting conditions i. e. earnings per share and return on capital employed targets are taken into account in estimating the number of awards likely to vest.
The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each accounting date up to the vesting date, at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the actual awards issued.
No adjustment is made after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or are not exercised.
The Group operates cash-settled versions of the employee incentive schemes for employees in certain territories.
The issues and resulting charges of these schemes are not material to the financial statements.
Loans to Group undertakings Loans to Group undertakings are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment.
Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group Financial instruments are recognised on the statement of financial position when the Company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The accounting policy for each type of financial instrument is included within the relevant note.
Financial assets are initially measured at fair value, unless otherwise noted, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss.
A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or the Company transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity.
Financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, plus, in the case of other financial liabilities, directly attributable transaction costs.
Other financial liabilities, primarily the Companys interest-bearing loans and borrowings, are measured at amortised cost.
Financial liabilities are measured at fair value through profit or loss and are held on the statement of financial position at fair value.
A financial liability is derecognised when the Companys obligations are discharged, expire or are cancelled.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance costs.
An equity instrument is any contract that has a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities.
Finance payments associated with financial instruments that are classified in equity are dividends and are recorded directly in equity.
Where financial instruments consist of a combination of debt and equity, the Company will assess the substance of the arrangement in place and decide how to attribute values to each taking into consideration the policy definitions above.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings These are initially recognised at the principal value of the loan concerned, less any related fees.
These fees are then amortised through the income statement on an effective interest rate basis over the expected life of the loan or over the contractual term where there is no clear indication that a shorter life is appropriate.
If the Companys estimate of the expected life based on repayment subsequently changes, the resulting adjustment to the effective interest rate calculation is recognised as a gain or loss on re-measurement and presented separately in the income statement.
Dividends Dividends are recognised through equity on the earlier of their approval by the Companys shareholders or their payment.
ii OPERATING EXPENSES Staff numbers and costs The average number of persons employed by the Company during the year was nine 2017: nine.

Fixed rate borrowings, which have been hedged to floating rates, are measured at amortised cost adjusted for changes in the value attributable to the hedged risk arising from the changes in underlying market interest rates.
