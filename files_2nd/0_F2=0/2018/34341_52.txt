As part of the transition, and to ensure shareholders receive the equivalent amount of total cash payments in 2018 as they would have under the previous payment policy, an additional interim dividend of 43.6 pence per share was announced on 5 December 2017 which was paid on 8 February 2018.
The dividend declared in 2018 for payment on 9 May 2018, 8 August 2018, 15 November 2018 and 7 February 2019 was 1,117 million, 1,112 million, 1,115 million and 1,119 million respectively and is estimated based on the number of shares and the proportion of dividends to be paid in foreign currency using the applicable exchange rate.
This takes the total dividend declared in respect of 2018 to 4,463 million.
