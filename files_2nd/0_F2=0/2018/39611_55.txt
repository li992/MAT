At 1 January 2018 Other provisions for liabilities and charges included 800 million in respect of a package of remedies that would conclude its State Aid commitments which were paid during 2018.
Payment protection insurance To reflect the increased volume of complaints following the FCAs introduction of an August 2019 PPI timebar as outlined in FCA announcement CP17 3 and the introduction of new Plevin unfair commission complaint handling rules, RBS increased its provision for PPI by 200 million in 2018 2017 - 175 million, 2016 - 601 million, 2015 - 600 million bringing the cumulative charge to 5.3 billion, of which 4.2 billion 79% in redress and 0.4 billion in administrative expenses had been paid by 31 December 2018.
Of the 5.3 billion cumulative charge, 4.8 billion relates to redress and 0.5 billion to administrative expenses.
The principal assumptions underlying the Groups provision in respect of PPI sales are: assessment of the total number of complaints that the Group will receive: the proportion of these that will result in redress: and the average cost of such redress.
The number of complaints has been estimated from an analysis of the Groups portfolio of PPI policies sold by vintage and by product.
Estimates of the percentage of policyholders that will lodge complaints the take up rate and of the number of these that will be upheld the uphold rate have been established based on recent experience, guidance in FCA policy statements and the expected rate of responses from proactive customer contact.
The average redress assumption is based on recent experience and FCA calculation rules.
The table below shows the sensitivity of the provision to changes in the principal assumptions all other assumptions remaining the same.

4 Processing costs per claim on a valid complaints basis, includes direct staff costs and associated overhead - excluding FOS fees.
Background information for all material provisions is given in Note 27 Critical accounting policy: Provisions for liabilities Judgment is involved in determining whether an obligation exists, and in estimating the probability, timing and amount of any outflows.
Where the Group can look to another party such as an insurer to pay some or all of the expenditure required to settle a provision, any reimbursement is recognised when, and only when, it is virtually certain that it will be received.
Estimates - Provisions are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount, and are recognised when there is a present obligation as a result of a past event, the outflow of economic benefit is probable and the outflow can be estimated reliably.
Any difference between the final outcome and the amounts provided will affect the reported results in the period when the matter is resolved.
