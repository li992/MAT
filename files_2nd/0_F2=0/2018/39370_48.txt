As in the case of Ore Reserves, managed operations estimates are being economically extracted in the future but which is not yet classified completed using or testing against Rio Tinto long-term pricing and market asProved or Probable Ore Reserves.
This material is defined as Mineral forecasts scenarios.
Mineral Resources are stated as additional to the Ore Resources under the JORC Code.
Estimates of such material are based Reserves reported earlier.
Where operations are not managed by RioTinto, largely on geological information with only preliminary consideration of the Mineral Resources are published as received from the managing mining, economic and other factors.
While in the judgment of the company.
Where new project Mineral Resources or Ore Reserves are Competent Person there are realistic expectations that all or part of the footnoted as being reported for the first time, additional information Mineral Resources will eventually become Proved or Probable Ore Reserves, aboutthem can be viewed on the Rio Tinto website.
