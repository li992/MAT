Financial Statements Notes to the Company Accounts Notes to the Company Accounts C1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The separate Company financial statements are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006 and have been prepared on the historical cost basis, and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments at fair value as permitted by the Companies Act 2006.
Effective this financial year, the Company changed its reporting basis from weeks to calendar months.
The accounting reference date is therefore 31 March, and the Company financial statements have been prepared for the year ended 31 March 2018.
For the current financial year, 52 weeks is equivalent to one year, so the comparative period presented in the financial statements and related notes remains consistent.
The principal accounting policies have been applied consistently in both the current and prior year.
Financial reporting standard 101 reduced disclosure exemptions The Company has taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions under FRS 101: - the requirements of paragraphs 45 b and 4652 of IFRS 2 Share based-payment: - the requirements of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures: - paragraph 79 a iv of IAS 1: - paragraph 73 e of IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment: - paragraph 118 e of IAS 38 Intangible Assets: - the requirements of paragraphs 10 d, 10 f, 16, 38A, 38B, 38C, 38D, 40A, 40B, 40C, 40D, 111 and 134136 of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: - the requirements of IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows: - the requirements of paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors: and - the requirements in IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group, provided that any subsidiary which is a party to the transaction is wholly owned by such a member.
Significant accounting judgements and estimates In preparing the financial statements, management has made judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the Companys accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The most significant area of estimate is determining whether there is impairment of the Companys investments which requires estimation of the investments value in use.
The value in use calculation requires the Company to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the investments and apply suitable discount rates in order to calculate present values.
Summary of significant accounting policies Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currency are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates prevailing at that date.
Any gain or loss arising from subsequent exchange rate movements is included as an exchange gain or loss in the Profit and Loss Account.
Financial Instruments The Company recognises financial instruments when it becomes a party to the contractual arrangements of the instrument.
Financial instruments are fide-recognised when they are discharged or when the contractual terms expire.
The Company's accounting policies in respect of financial instruments transactions are explained below: Financial assets The Company recognises its financial assets into one of the categories discussed below, depending on the purpose for which the asset was acquired.
Other than the financial assets in a qualifying hedging relationship, the Company's accounting policy for each category is as follows: Fair value through profit or loss This category comprises only in-the-money derivatives.
These are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the Profit and Loss Account.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They arise principally through the provision of goods and services to customers e. g. trade receivables, but also incorporate other types of contractual monetary asset.
They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to their acquisition or issue, and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment.
182 safer | cleaner | healthier Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 182 Financial Statements Notes to the Company Accounts continued C1 Accounting policies continued Financial assets continued Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence such as significant financial difficulties on the part of the counterparty or default or significant delay in payment that the company will be unable to collect all of the amounts due under the terms receivable, the amount of such a provision being the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future expected cash flows associated with the impaired receivable.
Financial liabilities The Company classifies its financial liabilities into one of the categories discussed below, depending on the purpose for which the liability was acquired.
Fair value through profit or loss These comprise only out-of-the-money derivatives.
They are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the Profit and Loss Account.
At amortised cost Financial liabilities at amortised cost including bank borrowings are initially recognised at fair value.
Such interest bearing liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Share-based payments The Company has adopted IFRS 2 and the accounting policies followed are in all material respects the same as the Groups policy.
This policy is shown on page 159.
Investments Investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
Fixed assets and depreciation Fixed assets are stated at cost less provisions for impairment and depreciation which, with the exception of freehold land which is not depreciated, is provided on all fixed assets on the straight-line method, each item being written off over its estimated life.
The principal annual rates used for this purpose are: Freehold property 2% Plant, equipment and vehicles 8% to 33.3% Leases The costs of operating leases of property and other assets are charged on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Pensions The Company makes contributions to defined contribution pension plans, which are charged against profits when they become payable.
The Company also operates a UK defined benefit pension plan.
For defined benefit plans, the asset or liability recorded in the Company Balance Sheet is the difference between the fair value of the plans assets and the present value of the defined obligation at that date.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated separately for the plan on an annual basis by an independent actuary using the projected unit credit method.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the year in which they occur, and are taken to other comprehensive income.
Current and past service costs, along with the impact of settlements or curtailments, are charged to profit and loss.
The unwinding of the discounting on the net liability is recognised within finance income or expense as appropriate.
Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises both current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account except to the extent that it relates to items recognised either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable, on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted, or substantively enacted, at the balance sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred taxation is provided on taxable temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and their corresponding tax bases.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised if recovery is considered more likely than not on the basis of all available evidence.
The recognition of deferred tax assets is dependent on assessments of future taxable income.
