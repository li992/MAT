Notes on the EEV basis results continued 10 Analysis of movement in free surplus For EEV covered business, free surplus is the excess of the regulatory basis net assets for EEV reporting purposes net worth over the capital required to support the covered business.
Where appropriate, adjustments are made to the net worth so that backing assets are included at fair value rather than cost so as to comply with the EEV Principles.
In Asia and the US operations, assets deemed to be inadmissible on local regulatory basis are included in net worth where considered fully recognisable on an EEV basis.
Free surplus for asset management operations and the UK general insurance commission is taken to be IFRS basis post-tax earnings and shareholders equity net of goodwill.
Free surplus for other operations including Group and Asia Regional Head Office, holding company borrowings, Africa operations and Prudential Capital is taken to be EEV basis post-tax earnings and shareholders equity net of goodwill, with subordinated debt recorded as free surplus to the extent that it is classified as available capital under Solvency II.
