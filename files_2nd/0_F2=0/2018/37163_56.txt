Return on Net Assets with Debt at Fair Value APM The Companys debt debenture is valued in the Statement of Financial Position on page 58 at amortised cost, which is materially equivalent to the repayment value of the debt on the assumption that it is held to maturity.
This is often referred to as Debt at Par Value.
The current replacement or market value of the debt, which assumes it is repaid and renegotiated under current market conditions, is often referred to as the Debt at Fair Value.
This fair value is explained in note 22 d on page 76 on the accounts.
The difference between fair and par values of the debt is subtracted from the NAV to derive the NAV with debt at fair value.
The fair value of the 50.0 million Debenture issued by the Company has been calculated using discounted cash flow techniques, using the yield from similar dated gilt plus a margin based on the five year average for the AA Barclays Sterling Corporate Bond spread.
The 50.0 million Debenture was repaid on 8th June 2018.

Benchmark total return Total return on the benchmark, on a closing-market value to closing-market value basis, assuming that all dividends received were reinvested, without transaction costs, in the shares of the underlying companies at the time the shares were quoted ex-dividend.
The benchmark is a recognised index of stocks which should not be taken as wholly representative of the Companys investment universe.
The Companys investment strategy does not follow or track this index and consequently, there may be some divergence between the Companys performance and that of the benchmark.

Performance Attribution Definitions: Asset allocation Measures the impact of allocating assets differently from those in the benchmark, via the portfolios weighting in different countries, sectors or asset types.
Stock selection Measures the effect of investing in securities to a greater or lesser extent than their weighting in the benchmark, or of investing in securities which are not included in the benchmark.
Currency effect Measures the impact of currency exposure differences between the Companys portfolio and its benchmark.
Gearing net cash Measures the impact on returns of borrowings or cash balances on the Companys relative performance.
Management fee Other expenses The payment of fees and expenses reduces the level of total assets, and therefore has a negative effect on relative performance.
