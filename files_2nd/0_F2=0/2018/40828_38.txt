Overview Strategic Report Governance Financials Other information Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2018 207 Alternative performance measures Unaudited information In the discussion of the Groups reported operating results, alternative performance measures are presented to provide readers with additional financial information that is regularly reviewed by management.
However, this additional information presented is not uniformly defined by all companies including those in the Groups industry.
Accordingly, it may not be comparable with similarly titled measures and disclosures by other companies.
Additionally, certain information presented is derived from amounts calculated in accordance with IFRS but is not itself an expressly permitted GAAP measure.
Such alternative performance measures should not be viewed in isolation or as an alternative to the equivalent GAAP measure.
Service revenue Service revenue comprises all revenue related to the provision of ongoing services including, but not limited to, monthly access charges, airtime usage, roaming, incoming and outgoing network usage by non-Vodafone customers and interconnect charges for incoming calls.
We believe that it is both useful and necessary to report this measure for the following reasons: It is used for internal performance reporting: It is used in setting director and management remuneration: and It is useful in connection with discussion with the investment analyst community.
A reconciliation of reported service revenue to the respective closest equivalent GAAP measure, revenue, are provided in the Our financial performance section on pages 22 to 29 and the Prior year operating results on pages 178 to 182.
Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin Adjusted EBITDA is operating profit excluding share of results in associates and joint ventures, depreciation and amortisation, gains losses on the disposal of fixed assets, impairment losses, restructuring costs arising from discrete restructuring plans, other operating income and expense and significant items that are not considered by management to be reflective of the underlying performance of the Group.
We use adjusted EBITDA, in conjunction with other GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted EBIT, adjusted operating profit, operating profit and net profit, to assess our operating performance.
We believe that adjusted EBITDA is an operating performance measure, not a liquidity measure, as it includes non-cash changes in working capital and is reviewed by the Chief Executive to assess internal performance in conjunction with adjusted EBITDA margin, which is an alternative sales margin figure.
We believe it is both useful and necessary to report adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure as it enhances the comparability of profit across segments.
Because adjusted EBITDA does not take into account certain items that affect operations and performance, adjusted EBITDA has inherent limitations as a performance measure.
To compensate for these limitations, we analyse adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with other GAAP and non-GAAP operating performance measures.
Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for a GAAP measure of operating performance.
A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to the closest equivalent GAAP measure, operating profit, is provided in note 2 Segmental analysis to the consolidated financial statements and page 217 respectively.
Group adjusted EBIT, adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share Group adjusted EBIT and adjusted operating profit exclude impairment losses, restructuring costs arising from discrete restructuring plans, amortisation of customer bases and brand intangible assets, other operating income and expense and other significant one-off items.
Adjusted EBIT also excludes the share of results in associates and joint ventures.
Adjusted earnings per share also excludes certain foreign exchange rate differences, together with related tax effects.
We believe that it is both useful and necessary to report these measures as they are used for internal performance reporting, in setting director and management remuneration and in connection with discussions with the investment analyst community and debt rating agencies.
Adjusted EBIT is reconciled to the respective closest equivalent GAAP measure, operating profit, in the Our financial performance section on page 22.
A reconciliation of adjusted operating profit to the respective closest equivalent GAAP measure, operating profit, is provided in note 2 Segmental analysis to the consolidated financial statements.
A reconciliation of adjusted earnings per share to basic earnings per share is provided in the Our financial performance section on page 24.
Cash flow measures and capital additions In presenting and discussing our reported results, free cash flow pre-spectrum, free cash flow, capital additions and operating free cash flow are calculated and presented even though these measures are not recognised within IFRS.
We believe that it is both useful and necessary to communicate free cash flow to investors and other interested parties, for the following reasons: Free cash flow pre-spectrum and free cash flow allows us and external parties to evaluate our liquidity and the cash generated by our operations.
Free cash flow pre-spectrum and capital additions do not include payments for licences and spectrum included within intangible assets, items determined independently of the ongoing business, such as the level of dividends, and items which are deemed discretionary, such as cash flows relating to acquisitions and disposals or financing activities.
In addition, it does not necessarily reflect the amounts which we have an obligation to incur.
However, it does reflect the cash available for such discretionary activities, to strengthen the consolidated statement of financial position or to provide returns to shareholders in the form of dividends or share purchases: Free cash flow facilitates comparability of results with other companies, although our measure of free cash flow may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies: These measures are used by management for planning, reporting and incentive purposes: and These measures are useful in connection with discussion with the investment analyst community and debt rating agencies.

These guidance measures exclude the impact of licence and spectrum payments, material one-off tax-related payments, restructuring costs and any fundamental structural change to the Eurozone.
They also assume no material change to the current structure of the Group.
We believe it is both useful and necessary to report these guidance measures to give investors an indication of the Groups expected future performance, the Groups sensitivity to foreign exchange movements and to report actual performance against these guidance measures.

Organic growth and change at constant exchange rates All amounts in this document marked with an represent organic growth, which presents performance on a comparable basis in terms of merger and acquisition activity and foreign exchange rates.
Change at constant exchange rates presents performance on a comparable basis in terms of foreign exchange rates only.
Whilst neither of these measures are intended to be a substitute for reported growth, nor are they superior to reported growth, we believe that these measures provide useful and necessary information to investors and other interested parties for the following reasons: They provide additional information on underlying growth of the business without the effect of certain factors unrelated to its operating performance: They are used for internal performance analysis: and They facilitate comparability of underlying growth with other companies although the term organic is not a defined term under IFRS and may not, therefore, be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
The Groups organic growth rates for all periods exclude the results of Vodafone India excluding its 42% stake in Indus Towers, which are now reported in discontinued operations, and the results of Vodafone Netherlands following the disposal of its consumer fixed business and subsequent merger into VodafoneZiggo, as well as the results of VodafoneZiggo after the merger.
In addition, operating segment organic service revenue growth rates for the quarter ended 31 December 2017 and the quarter and year ended 31 March 2018 have been amended to exclude the adverse impact of changes to intercompany interconnect rates.
Overview Strategic Report Governance Financials Other information Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2018 209 For all periods during the year ended 31 March 2016, Group and operating segment organic growth rates were also adjusted to exclude the beneficial impact of settlements of historical interconnect rate dispute in the UK in both the year ended 31 March 2016 and 31 March 2015 and the beneficial impact of an upward revision to interconnect revenue in Egypt from a re-estimation by management of the appropriate historical mobile interconnection rate during the year ended 31 March 2015.
For all periods during the year ended 31 March 2017, Group and operating segment organic growth rates were also adjusted to exclude the beneficial impact of a settlement of historical interconnect rate dispute in the UK in the year ended 31 March 2016.
For all periods during the year ended 31 March 2018, operating segment organic service revenue growth rates have been adjusted to exclude the adverse impact of changes to intercompany interconnect rates.
We have not provided a comparative in respect of organic growth rates as the current rates describe the change between the beginning and end of the current year, with such changes being explained by the commentary in this news release.
If comparatives were provided, significant sections of the commentary from the news release for the prior year would also need to be included, reducing the usefulness and transparency of this document.
