The options vest and became exercisable, subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition, over 30 months, with one-ninth vesting six months after the date of grant and a further ninth vesting at each subsequent quarter.
The options lapse, if not exercised, on 2 February 2026.
The performance condition is comparator total shareholder return TSR of the Group against the FTSE 250.
Each ninth of the shares will have its TSR condition reviewed from the date of grant until the relevant testing date.
To the extent the TSR is not met at that time, it is tested again the following quarter and, if necessary, at the end of the 30-month vesting period.
In order to vest, the TSR of the Group must rank at median or above against the FTSE 250.
Note b: 2016 LTIP Scheme These equity settled awards were issued on the same basis as the awards in note a but at a higher exercise price which represents the market value of the shares as at the date the scheme became effective.
In order to compensate Lee Feldman for the higher exercise price, the Group agreed to pay him a cash bonus of 2.0m over the 30-month vesting period of the option, but only upon option vesting and satisfaction of the performance condition described above, and he has to reinvest 50% of this in GVC shares.
Note c: 2016 LTIP Scheme These awards were issued on completion of the acquisition of bwin.
The equity-settled options, which are not subject to a performance condition, vest and become exercisable over 24 months, with one-seventh vesting six months after the date of grant and a further seventh vesting at each subsequent quarter.

Note f: 2018 LTIP Scheme These equity settled awards were awarded to certain Directors and employees and vest over a three-year period from the date of grant.
The number of awards to vest are conditional on both cumulative three-year Earnings Per Share EPS exceeding 191p and TSR performance conditions being met which are split with equal weighting.
The charge to share based payments within the consolidated income statement in respect of these options in 2018 was 10.7m 2017: 15.5m of which 10.2m related to equity settled options 2017: 14.6m and 0.5m to cash settled options 2017: 0.9m.

Valuation of options The fair value of services received in return for share options granted are measured by reference to the fair value of share options granted.
The Group engaged third-party valuation specialists to provide a fair value for the options.
For the 2016 LTIP scheme, the expected volatilities have been calculated using historical prices for companies that were constituents of the FTSE 250 at the grant date.
These options accrue dividend credits and the yield was assumed to be nil for 2016 and 10% thereafter.
As the schemes vest on a staggered basis over a period of up to 30 months, the volatilities have been calculated over each relevant time period.
The fair value of each phase of the options has been calculated separately, shown as a range in the table below, and the cost of each phase is allocated across the vesting period for that phase.
The 2017 and 2018 LTIP plan was valued using both a Black Scholes valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation for the cumulative EPS and TSR conditions respectively.

The movement in the year arises from the charge of cash settled options of 0.5m 2017: 0.9m and the settlement of schemes relating to the 2016 LTIP and ASBP schemes.
