OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES 6 Intangible assets This note provides details of the non-physical assets used by the Group to generate revenues and profits.
These assets include items such as goodwill, and other intangible assets such as brands, customer relationships, computer software, in-process R&D and technology which have predominantly been acquired as part of business combinations.
These assets are initially measured at fair value, which is the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Goodwill represents the excess of the amount paid to acquire a business over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of that business at the acquisition date.
This section also explains the accounting policies applied and the specific judgements and estimates made by the Directors in arriving at the carrying value of these assets.
6.1 Goodwill Accounting policy Goodwill arising from the acquisition of a subsidiary represents the excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Groups total identifiable net assets acquired.
Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill previously written off directly to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1 October 1998 has not been reinstated and is not recycled to the income statement on the disposal of the business to which it relates.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and when circumstances indicate that it may be impaired.
Goodwill is assessed for the purpose of impairment testing, at either the individual CGU level or group of CGUs, consistent with the level at which goodwill is monitored internally.
Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of each CGU or group of CGUs to which the goodwill relates.
When the recoverable amount of the CGU or group of CGUs is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised.
At recognition, goodwill is allocated to those CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.

The grouping of CGUs has been updated in the year reflecting how the businesses are managed and the level at which goodwill is monitored.
Germany 2017: 38m, Switzerland 2017: 39m and Poland 2017: 7m are now monitored as a group of CGUs referred to as Central Europe.
Spain 2017: 128m and Portugal 2017: 6m are now monitored as a group of CGUs referred to as Iberia.
South Africa 2017: 30m and the Middle East 2017: nil are now monitored as a group of CGUs referred to as Africa and the Middle East.
Following the acquisition of Sage Intacct in 2017, an exercise has been performed to allocate the goodwill recognised on the acquisition of Sage Intacct to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from the acquisition.
The result of the allocation is to increase goodwill for the UK and Ireland CGU by 36m, Africa and the Middle East group of GCUs by 2m and Australia CGU by 4m with a decrease of 42m for the Sage Intacct GCU.
Annual goodwill impairment tests The recoverable amount of a CGU or group of CGUs is determined as the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.
In determining value in use, estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value.
The Group performed its annual test for impairment on 30 June 2018.
In all cases, the 2019 budget and the approved Group plan for the three years following the current financial year form the basis for the cash flow projections for a CGU or group of CGUs with an extension of a further seven years for the Sage Intacct CGU to reflect the planned growth following its acquisition in 2017.
Beyond the three-year Group plan period and additional seven-year period for the Sage Intacct CGU these projections are extrapolated using an estimated long-term growth rate.
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations are the average medium-term revenue growth rates and the longterm growth rates of net operating cash flows.
The average medium-term revenue growth rates represent the compound annual revenue growth for the first five 2017: five years.
The average medium-term revenue growth rate applied to CGUs reflects the specific rates for each territory.
Long-term growth rates of net operating cash flows are assumed to be equal to the long-term growth rate in the gross domestic product of the country in which the CGUs operations are undertaken reflecting the specific rates for each territory.
Range of rates used across the different CGUs 2018 2017 Average medium-term revenue growth rates 4%-22% 4%-13% Long-term growth rates to net operating cash flows 1%-4% 1%-4% Average medium-term revenue growth rate is calculated on value in use projections that exclude intercompany revenue.

These are deemed by management to be CGUs or groups of CGUs holding more than 10% of total goodwill.
The discount rate, average medium-term revenue growth rate and long-term growth rate assumptions used for the value in use calculation for these are shown below: Approximate Average local discount Long-term medium-term Local discount rate pre-tax growth revenue 2018 rate post-tax equivalent rate growth rate UKI 7.9% 9.1% 2.1% 4.5% France 7.7% 9.8% 1.7% 5.2% North America SBS 8.9% 11.6% 1.9% 5.8% North America Sage Intacct 10.5% 12.5% 1.9% 21.7% Approximate Average local discount medium-term Local discount rate pre-tax Long-term revenue 2017 rate post tax equivalent growth rate growth rate UKI 8.6% 10.0% 2.1% 6.8% France 8.1% 10.8% 1.7% 5.5% North America SBS 9.2% 14.4% 1.9% 6.4% North America Sage Intacct n a n a n a n a Average medium-term revenue growth rate is calculated on value in use projections that exclude intercompany revenue.
Sage Intacct was acquired subsequent to the annual impairment test on 30 June 2017.
Management concluded there was no trigging event or indicator that could have led to an impairment.
Discount rate The Group uses a discount rate based on a local Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC for each CGU or group of CGUs, applying local government yield bonds and tax rates to each CGU or group of CGUs on a geographical basis.
The discount rate applied to a CGU or group of CGUs represents a post-tax rate that reflects the market assessment of the time value of money as at 30 June 2018 and the risks specific to the CGU or group of CGUs.
The post-tax discount rates applied to CGUs or group of CGUs were in the range of 7.2% 2017: 6.9% to 15.3% 2017: 15.3%, reflecting the specific rates for each territory.
Sensitivity analysis A sensitivity analysis was performed for each of the significant CGUs or group of CGUs and other than for the Sage Intacct CGU management concluded that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the CGU or group of CGUs to exceed its recoverable amount.
For the Sage Intacct CGU, a reasonably possible change in the average medium-term revenue growth rate by 4% p. a. for the initial five years would reduce the value in use by 268m down to its carrying value.
The Group has concluded that no reasonably possible change in discount rate or long-term growth rate would reduce the recoverable amount to below its carrying value.
Impairment charge The Group performed its annual test for impairment on 30 June 2018.
The recoverable amount exceeded the carrying value for each CGU or group of CGUs.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 6.2 Other intangibles Accounting policy Intangible assets arising on business combinations are recognised initially at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Subsequently they are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment charges.
The main intangible assets recognised are brands, technology, in-process R&D, computer software and customer relationships.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Brand names 1 to 20 years Technology In process R&D IPR&D 3 to 7 years Customer relationships 4 to 15 years Computer software 2 to 7 years Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost, which is the assets purchase price and any directly attributable costs of preparing the asset for its intended use, less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses if applicable.
Software assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which do not exceed seven years.
The carrying value of intangibles is reviewed for impairment whenever events indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Internally-generated software development costs qualify for capitalisation when the Group can demonstrate all of the following: The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale: Its intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it: Its ability to use or sell the intangible asset: How the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits: The existence of a market or, if it is to be used internally, the usefulness of the intangible asset: The availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset: and Its ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during development.
Generally, commercial viability of new products is not proven until all high-risk development issues have been resolved through testing pre-launch versions of the product.
As a result, technical feasibility is proven only after completion of the detailed design phase and formal approval, which occurs just before the products are ready to go to market.
Accordingly, development costs have not been capitalised.
However, the Group continues to assess the eligibility of development costs for capitalisation on a project-by-project basis.
Costs which are incurred after the general release of internally-generated software or costs which are incurred in order to enhance existing products are expensed in the period in which they are incurred and included within research and development expense in the financial statements.
