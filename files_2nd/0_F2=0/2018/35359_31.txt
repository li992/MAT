Financials Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 30 JUNE 2018 1 Segmental reporting The Group has one reportable segment, in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments, which is the retail of homewares in the UK.
Customers access the Groups offer across multiple channels and often their journey involves more than one channel.
Therefore, internal reporting focuses on the Group as a whole and does not identify individual segments.
The Chief Operating Decision-Maker is the Executive Board of Directors of Dunelm Group plc.
Internal management reports are reviewed by them on a monthly basis.
Performance of the segment is assessed based on a number of financial and nonfinancial KPIs as well as on profit before taxation.
Management believe that these measures are the most relevant in evaluating the performance of the segment and for making resource allocation decisions.
All material operations of the reportable segment are carried out in the UK.
The Groups revenue is driven by the consolidation of individual small value transactions and as a result, Group revenue is not reliant on a major customer or group of customers.
2 Acquisitions and disposals In the prior year, on 28 November 2016 the Group acquired the whole of the trade and certain assets and liabilities of the Worldstores Group Worldstores Limited in administration, Kiddicare Limited in administration and Achica Limited in administration for a cash consideration of 1 through Globe Online Limited, a 100% owned subsidiary of Dunelm Limited.
The purchase has been accounted for as a business combination.
The fair value amounts recognised in respect of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are set out below.
As at 28 November 2016 m Intangible assets - software 5.2 Intangible assets - brands 2.2 Intangible assets - customer lists 0.1 Property, plant and equipment 0.8 Inventories 4.2 Trade and other receivables 2.9 Accruals and deferred income 6.5 Provisions 1.4 Amounts due to secured creditor 7.5 Total identifiable assets liabilities Cash consideration Goodwill As part of this acquisition, the Group acquired a subsidiary registered in Cyprus, Achica Brand Management Limited ABML, whose principal activity is to hold the Achica trademarks.
On 16th February 2018, the trade and assets of Achica were sold to BrandAlley UK Limited, a London-based flash sales business for a total consideration of 0.6m.
The transaction included the sale of trademarks and customer lists and resulted in an overall loss on disposal of 0.3m.

A review of the websites and other intangible IT assets of both the existing Dunelm business and the acquired business has been undertaken.
Decisions have been made to integrate the available assets, and as a result, certain assets have been written off and others useful economic lives have been reduced, resulting in accelerated amortisation.
During the period, management took the decision to develop Dunelms kids and nursery category under the Dunelm brand, rather than within the standalone Kiddicare brand.
As a result, the Kiddicare brand acquired as part of the Worldstores acquisition was deemed to be fully impaired and as such was written off.
As well as this, aged Kiddicare stock and various other intangible assets relating to the development of the Kiddicare website were also written off.
As outlined in note 2, certain costs relating to the sale and subsequent restructure of the business have been classified as exceptional.
These costs include the write-off of assets relating to Achica and onerous contracts.
The proceeds from the sale of the Achica business were 0.6m.
Other integration costs include professional advisory support, and costs associated with the transfer of the London head office to a new location.
The taxation credit for the period relating to exceptional items was 1.2m 2017: 3.1m.
Of the above exceptional cost items, 1.6m were cash outflows in the period.
We do not expect to report exceptional items in relation to the acquisition, integration or divestment of the Worldstores business in the next financial period.

For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential Ordinary Shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys Ordinary Shares during the period.

com Stock code: DNLM 132 Financials 18 Financial risk management The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
A formal process for reviewing and managing risk in the business is in place.
There are no changes to exposures to risk and how they arise and the Group objectives, policies and procedures for managing the risk and methods used to measure the risk from the previous period.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from the Groups deposits with banks and financial institutions as well as foreign exchange hedging agreements with its banking counterparties.
The Group only deals with creditworthy counterparties and uses publicly available financial information to rate its counterparties, and as such, credit risk is considered to be low.
Group policy is that surplus funds are placed on deposit with counterparties approved by the Board, with a minimum of A credit rating.
Credit limits with approved counterparties are limited to 25m for any individual party.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of financial assets.
No collateral is held 2017: none.
At the period end the maximum exposure is detailed in the table below.
2017 2018 m m Cash and cash equivalents 15.0 17.4 Trade and other receivables 4.6 4.7 Derivative financial instruments 4.2 1.1 Total financial assets 23.8 23.2 Trade and other receivables include rebates due back from suppliers.
The rebates are recovered through deductions from future payments to suppliers and therefore management is confident of the recoverability of these balances.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and extreme circumstances.
The Group manages this risk by continuously monitoring cash flow forecasts.
Further details of the Groups available facilities can be found in note 19.
The table below analyses estimated future contractual cash flows in respect of the Groups financial liabilities, according to the earliest date on which the Group could be required to settle the liability.
Floating rate interest payments are estimated based on market interest rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.

DUNELM GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 30 JUNE 2018 133 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements CONTINUED FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 30 JUNE 2018 18 Financial risk management continued Interest rate risk The Groups bank borrowings incur variable interest rate charges.
The Groups policy aims to manage the interest cost of the Group within the constraints of its financial covenants.
The Group will continue to monitor movements in the interest rate swap market.
At the period end, if Libor interest rates had been 10 basis points higher with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit would have been 0.1m lower 2017: 0.1m lower as a result of higher interest expense on floating rate borrowings.
Foreign currency risk All of the Groups revenues are in pounds sterling.
The majority of purchases are also in sterling, but some goods purchased direct from overseas suppliers are paid for in US dollars, accounting for just under 20% of stock purchases in the period ended 30 June 2018.
The Group uses various means to cover its exposure to US dollars: holding US dollar cash balances and taking out forward foreign exchange contracts for the purchase of US dollars.
All the Groups foreign exchange transactions are designed to satisfy US dollar denominated liabilities.
The maximum level of hedging coverage which will be undertaken is 100% of anticipated expenditure on a three-month horizon, stepping down to 75% on a four to 12-month horizon and 40% on a 13 to 18-month horizon.
Coverage beyond 18 months is minimal.
Cash flow hedges are in place to manage foreign exchange rate risk arising from forecast purchases denominated in US dollars.
At the balance sheet date, the fair value of US dollar foreign exchange forward contracts held in cash flow hedges was 3.5m asset 2017: 0.9m liability which relates to a commitment to purchase $164m 2017: $140m for a fixed sterling amount.
A fair value movement of 1.6m 2017: 1.4m was recognised in other comprehensive income and no ineffectiveness 2017: nil was noted on cash flow hedges during the period.
In the period, a loss of 2.6m 2017: 9.4m gain was recycled from the cash flow hedge reserve to inventory to offset foreign exchange movements on purchases.
The remaining hedge reserve balance will be recycled to the income statement to offset future purchases occurring after the balance sheet date, the majority of which expire in the next 12 months.
The outstanding US dollar liabilities at the period end were $0.3m 2017: $0.3m.
In the event of a significant adverse movement in the US dollar exchange rate, the Group could seek to minimise the impact on profitability by changing the selling price of goods, renegotiating terms with suppliers or sourcing from alternative markets.
At the period end, if GBP had strengthened by 10% against USD with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit would have been 0.4m higher 2017: 0.2m higher as a result of foreign exchange gains on translation of USD denominated trade payables compensated by foreign exchange losses on translation of USD cash and cash equivalents.
Other components of equity would have been 9.0m lower 2017: 7.7m lower as a result of a decrease in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges.
Conversely, if GBP had weakened by 10% against USD with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been 0.5m lower 2017: 0.2m lower and other components of equity would have been 11.0m higher 2017: 9.4m higher.
The US dollar period end exchange rate applied in the above analysis is 1.3152 2017: 1.3002. corporate.
com Stock code: DNLM 134 Financials 18 Financial risk management continued Capital management The Company considers equity plus debt as the capital.
There are no externally imposed capital requirements on the Company.
The Boards objective with respect to capital management is to ensure the Group continues as a going concern in order to optimise returns to shareholders.
The Boards policy is to retain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development.
The Board regularly monitors the level of capital in the Group to ensure that this can be achieved.
From time to time the Group purchases its own shares on the market.
The shares are intended to be used for issuing shares under the Groups share option programmes.
The Board has authorised a share purchase programme designed to ensure that all options expected to vest under share option schemes can be fulfilled out of treasury shares.
During the period, the Group amended and extended its syndicated Revolving Credit Facility RCF.
The RCF was increased to 165m and extended until 2023.
The optional accordion facility of 75m remains in place.
The terms of the RCF are unchanged and are consistent with normal practice and include covenants in respect of leverage net debt to be no greater than 2.5 EBITDA and fixed charge cover EBITDA to be no less than 1.75 fixed charges, both of which were met comfortably as at 30 June 2018.
In addition, the Group maintains 20m of uncommitted overdraft facilities with two syndicate partner banks.
The gearing ratio and net debt as a percentage of EBITDA was as follows: 2017 2018 m m Total borrowings note 19 140.0 140.0 Less: unamortised debt issue costs note 19 1.0 0.5 Less: cash and cash equivalents note 16 15.0 17.4 Net debt 124.0 122.1 Total equity 134.7 110.1 Total capital 258.7 232.2 Gearing ratio 48% 53% EBITDA before exceptional operating costs 139.6 142.2 Net debt as % of EBITDA 89% 86% Fair values The fair value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities are equal to their carrying value.
The fair value of foreign currency contracts are amounts required by the counterparties to cancel the contracts at the end of the period.
Fair value hierarchy Financial instruments carried at fair value are required to be measured by reference to the following levels: z Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: z Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and z Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs All derivative financial instruments carried at fair value have been measured by a Level 2 valuation method, based on observable market data.
