Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 185 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Section 1: Basis of preparation Overview This section sets out the Groups accounting policies that relate to the consolidated financial statements as a whole.
Where an accounting policy is specific to one note, the policy is described in the note to which it relates.
This section also shows new accounting standards, amendments and interpretations, relevant to the Group, and whether they are effective in 2018 or later years.
We explain how these changes are expected to impact the financial position and performance of the Group.
1.1 General information The Company is a public company limited by shares, incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act and registered in England and Wales.
The consolidated financial statements comprise those of the Company and its controlled entities, together the Group.
1.2 Basis of accounting The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of land and buildings, investment properties, financial assets available for sale and certain other financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1.3 Presentation of risk, offsetting and maturity disclosures Certain disclosures required under IFRS 7 Financial instruments: disclosures and IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements have been included within the audited sections of the Risk report.
Where information is marked as audited, it is incorporated into these financial statements by this cross reference and it is covered by the Independent auditors report.
1.4 Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are set out in the Strategic report.
In addition, the Risk report includes the Groups risk management objectives and the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital.
In assessing the Groups going concern position as at 30 September 2018, the Directors have considered a number of factors, including the current balance sheet position, the principal and emerging risks which could impact the performance of the Group, the Groups strategic and financial plan and the impact of the acquisition of Virgin Money.
The assessment concluded that, for the foreseeable future, the Group has sufficient capital to support its operations: has a funding and liquidity base which is strong, robust and well managed with future capacity: and has expectations that performance will continue to improve as the Groups strategy is executed.
As a result of the assessment, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and therefore believe that the Group is well placed to manage its risks successfully in line with its business model and strategic aims.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
1.5 Basis of consolidation Controlled entities are all entities including structured entities to which the Company is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
An assessment of control is performed on an ongoing basis.
Controlled entities are consolidated from the date on which control is established by the Group until the date that control ceases.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations other than those under common control.
A non-controlling interest is recognised by the Group in respect of any portion of the total assets less total liabilities of an acquired entity or entities that is not owned by the Group.
Post-acquisition, income received and expenses incurred by the entity or entities acquired are included in the consolidated income statement on a line by line basis in accordance with the accounting policies set out herein.
Balances and transactions between entities within the Group and any unrealised gains and losses arising from those transactions are eliminated in full upon consolidation.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared using uniform accounting policies.
186 CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements Section 1: Basis of preparation continued 1.6 Foreign currency Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling GBP, which is also the Groups presentation currency, rounded to the nearest million pounds sterling m unless otherwise stated.
Transactions and balances The Group records an asset, liability, expense or revenue arising from a transaction using the closing exchange rate between the functional and foreign currency on the transaction date.
At each subsequent reporting date, the Group translates foreign currency monetary items at the closing rate.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation or settlement of monetary items are recognised in the income statement during the year in which the gains or losses arise.
Foreign currency non-monetary items measured at historical cost are translated at the date of the transaction, with those measured at fair value translated at the date when the fair value is determined.
Foreign exchange differences are recognised directly in equity for non-monetary items where any component of associated gains or losses is recognised directly in equity.
Foreign exchange differences arising from non-monetary items, whereby the associated gains or losses are recognised in the income statement, are also recognised in the income statement.
1.7 Financial assets and liabilities Recognition and derecognition A financial asset or a financial liability is recognised on the balance sheet when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Purchases and sales of financial assets classified within fair value through profit or loss are recognised on trade date.
The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual cash flows from the asset expire or it transfers the right to receive contractual cash flows on the financial asset in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the Group has discharged its obligation to the contract, or the contract is cancelled or expires.
Offsetting This can only occur, and the net amount be presented on the balance sheet, when the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
1.8 Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosed amount of contingent liabilities.
Assumptions made at each balance sheet date are based on best estimates at that date.
Although the Group has internal control systems in place to ensure that estimates can be reliably measured, actual amounts may differ from those estimates.
The Group considers the most significant use of accounting estimates and judgements relate to the following areas: financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss note 3.3 : impairment provisions on credit exposures note 3.6 : deferred tax note 3.11 : PPI redress provision and other conduct related matters note 3.14 : and retirement benefit obligations note 3.16.
Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 187 1.9 New accounting standards and interpretations The Group has adopted the following International Accounting Standards Board IASB pronouncements in the current financial year.
Except where otherwise stated, these did not have a material impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements: amendments to IAS 12: Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses issued in January 2016 and effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2017.
The amendments clarify the requirements on the recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses: amendments to IAS 7: Disclosure initiative issued in January 2016 and effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2017.
The amendments to IAS 7: Statement of Cash Flows require disclosures that enable users of the financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from an entitys financing activities: and Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2014-2016 Cycle, issued December 2016 and effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2017.
The amendment relates to IFRS 12: Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities and clarifies the scope of the standard.
New accounting standards and interpretations not yet adopted IFRS 9 Financial Instruments issued July 2014 and IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers issued September 2015 are both effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
IFRS 16 Leases was issued in January 2016 and is effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
Separate updates on the Groups implementation of these new standards can be found at the end of this section.
There are a number of other standards, interpretations and amendments that have not been applied by the Group in preparing these financial statements as they are either not available for adoption in the EU or are not mandatory for the Group as at 30 September 2018.
The pronouncements, while relevant to the Group, are not anticipated to have a material impact and include: amendments to IFRS 2: Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions issued in June 2016 and effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
The amendments provide guidance on the effects of vesting and non-vesting conditions on the measurement of cash-settled share-based payments: classification of share-based payments with a net settlement feature for withholding tax obligations: and accounting for modifications to a share-based payment that change the classification from cash-settled to equity-settled: Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2014-2016 Cycle, issued December 2016 and effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
The amendment relates to IAS 28: Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures and the measurement of an associate or joint venture at fair value: IFRIC interpretation 22: Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration, issued December 2016 and effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
The new interpretation provides requirements on which exchange rate to use in reporting foreign currency transactions such as revenue transactions when payment is made or received in advance: amendments to IFRS 9: Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation issued in October 2017 and effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
The amendments allow companies to measure particular prepayable financial assets with so-called negative compensation at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income if a specified condition is met, instead of these being measured at fair value through profit or loss.
The Group expects to early adopt this amendment with effect from 1 October 2018 in line with the adoption of IFRS 9: IFRIC interpretation 23: Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments, issued June 2017 and effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
The new interpretation applies to any situation in which there is uncertainty as to whether an income tax treatment is acceptable under tax law and is not limited to actual ongoing disputes: 1 Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2015-2017 Cycle, issued December 2017 and effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
The IASB has made amendments to the following standards: IFRS 3 Business Combinations: IFRS 11 Joint arrangements: IAS 12 Income Taxes: and IAS 32 Borrowing Costs: 1 amendment to IAS 19: Plan amendment, curtailment or settlement issued in February 2018 and effective prospectively for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
The amendments clarify that after a plan event companies should use these updated assumptions to measure current service cost and net interest for the remainder of the reporting period: and 1 amendments to references to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards, issued in March 2018 and effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2020.
The amendments were issued following the IASBs publication of a revised version of its Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting and updates the references in IFRS standards to previous versions of the Conceptual Framework.

188 CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements Section 1: Basis of preparation continued 1.9 New accounting standards and interpretations continued Updates on the implementation of IFRS 9: Financial Instruments, IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 16: Leases IFRS 9 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments was issued by the IASB in July 2014 and endorsed for use in the EU in November 2016.
It is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement for the Group with effect from 1 October 2018.
In addition, the IASB also issued Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation Amendment to IFRS 9 in October 2017.
This is a narrow scope amendment that enables the use of the amortised cost classification for some financial assets with a prepayable option that could result in the options holder receiving compensation referred to as negative compensation for early termination.
It is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 with early adoption permitted and was endorsed for use in the EU in March 2018.
The Group will early adopt the amendment to IFRS 9 with effect from 1 October 2018, with no significant impact expected.
Classification and measurement The existing IAS 39 financial asset classification categories are replaced under IFRS 9 as follows: Financial assets categories IAS 39 IFRS 9 Loans and receivables at amortised cost Held to maturity HTM Available for sale AFS Fair value through profit or loss FVTPL Fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI IFRS 9 introduces a two-stage process for the classification of financial assets: 1.
The business model assessment Financial assets with a hold to collect contractual cash flows business model should be classified at amortised cost.
Where the business model is hold to collect and sell, the financial asset should be classified at fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI.
To be considered under the FVOCI category, the selling of financial instruments must be integral to the underlying business model.
Final classification is dependent on the financial asset passing the cash flow characteristics assessment.
If the financial asset is held in a business model that is neither hold to collect nor hold to collect and sell, it must be held at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL.
The option to classify a financial asset at FVTPL under certain circumstances that exists under IAS 39 is also retained in IFRS 9.
The cash flow characteristic assessment The second stage in classification is to assess whether the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise to cash flows which are consistent with that of solely payments of principal and interest SPPI.
IFRS 9 considers financial assets that meet the SPPI criteria as being consistent with a basic lending arrangement.
Any financial asset which fails the SPPI test must be held at FVTPL.
Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 189 The Group has assessed the financial assets that come under the scope of IFRS 9 and determined that they will transition to IFRS 9 on 1 October 2018 as follows: IAS 39 IFRS 9 Loans and Amortised Financial assets receivables FVTPL AFS cost FVTPL FVOCI Cash and balances with central banks Due from other banks Listed securities Unlisted securities Other financial assets Other financial assets at fair value Derivative financial instruments Loans and advance to customers Due from customers on acceptances The only significant change in classification will be for the Groups Treasury financial assets, which will move from the IAS 39 AFS category 1 to the new FVOCI category under IFRS 9.
Impairment The most significant impact of IFRS 9 is the change in credit loss methodology, which moves from the incurred loss basis under IAS 39 to an expected loss basis under IFRS 9.
The single impairment loss methodology for all financial assets held at either amortised cost or FVOCI requires the calculation of either a 12-month expected credit loss ECL allowance where the financial asset has not experienced a significant increase in credit risk since origination or a lifetime ECL calculation where this significant increase has been observed.
Loan commitments and financial guarantees not measured at fair value through profit or loss are also in scope for impairment.
IFRS 9 does not define what is meant by a significant increase in credit risk since origination, with the Group exercising judgement in determining how this should be interpreted.
The Group has developed a suite of both quantitative and qualitative factors that will determine whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since origination.
Portfolio specific factors are used within the Groups Retail and SME portfolios, with the treatment of customers in receipt of the Groups forbearance programmes being a common trigger in both portfolios that would indicate there has been a significant increase in credit risk since origination.
The Group will also utilise the 30 DPD backstop in moving to a lifetime ECL calculation, but expects other triggers to have moved a customer to a lifetime ECL calculation before this point.
The concepts of 12-month and lifetime ECL calculations are not a feature of IAS 39, which requires objective evidence of impairment on a financial asset or group of financial assets due to the identification of a loss event after initial recognition but before the balance sheet date for an impairment loss to be calculated.
The move to an expected loss basis will therefore have an initial impact and is generally expected to require an increase in the level of impairment provision held.
IFRS 9 also requires that the ECL calculation reflects an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes: the time value of money: and reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.
In meeting this requirement, the Group has incorporated a number of relevant economic parameters within the credit loss models such as base, inflation and unemployment rates.
These are included for the full forecast period and will vary between the three economic scenarios the Group will utilise for IFRS 9 purposes base case, upside and downside.
The economic parameters used and the relative weightings of the scenarios are validated internally by an economic scenarios panel which comprises representation from a number of 2 internal stakeholder functions.
Hedging While IFRS 9 introduces revised hedge accounting requirements, the IASB is still considering the approach to accounting for dynamic risk management.
Consequently, IFRS 9 includes an accounting policy option to continue hedge accounting under the requirements of IAS 39 until such time as the IASBs overall hedge accounting strategy is complete.
The Group will exercise the accounting policy option to continue hedge accounting under IAS 39 but will look to provide the new hedge accounting disclosures, where applicable, in the 2019 annual financial statements.
1 As with the AFS category, fair value movements in the FVOCI category will pass through a reserve account which can be recycled through profit or loss.
2 This is supplemented by a third-party supplier of economic data.
190 CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements Section 1: Basis of preparation continued 1.9 New accounting standards and interpretations continued IFRS 9 implementation strategy and transitional impact During 2018, the Group has continued the development and refinement of IFRS 9 compliant credit loss models.
These models adhere to the Groups internal model standards and policies and have been subject to review, challenge and approval from the Groups internal model governance pathway.
The IFRS 9 Project team has provided updates to the Boards Audit Committee on a regular basis throughout the year on the outputs from the parallel run process and the improvements in the reporting of the outputs over the same period.
The Group will continue to review and evaluate the credit loss model methodology and overall ECL calculation mechanics and related controls in advance of further IFRS 9 disclosure requirements in 2019.
While the Group has calculated the impairment impact of IFRS 9 based on the current view of forward-looking economic conditions and parameters, these are inherently difficult to predict with any great certainty and require an element of management judgement.
This is particularly relevant in relation to the eventual outcome of the UK Governments Brexit negotiations, which will not be finalised until March 2019.
Consequently, the Groups estimation of expected credit losses under IFRS 9 and the impact this has on results and other related disclosures remain subject to change until finalisation of the Groups results for the year ending 30 September 2019.
The change to the basis of impairment loss provisioning is currently expected to result in a transitional impact of 21m net of tax due to the increased level of credit impairments required under IFRS 9 compared with IAS 39.
As IFRS 9 does not require the restatement of comparative information, the transitional impact will result in a net decrease in the Groups total equity at 1 October 2018.
1 The transitional impact of IFRS 9 on the Groups reported CET1 ratio at 1 October 2018 will be a reduction of 14bps on a fully loaded 2 basis.
As a result of the transitional capital rules option, which the Group has already confirmed it will exercise, the effect on the 1 transitional CET1 ratio is negligible.
Transitional disclosures, required by IFRS 7, will be included within the Groups interim financial statements for the six months to 31 March 2019.
IFRS 15 IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014 and is endorsed for use in the EU.
It is effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and will be adopted by the Group with effect from 1 October 2018.
The core principle of IFRS 15 is that revenue reflects the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled.
The standard provides a principles based five-step model for recognition.
The majority of the Groups revenue is in the form of interest income from financial instruments, which is not in scope for IFRS 15.
Interest income from lease contracts is also not in scope.
Fees and commissions together with certain elements of non-interest income do fall within the scope of the standard.
In nearly all cases the Groups current accounting policy is consistent with the requirements of IFRS 15, accordingly there is no material impact in relation to the timing of when the Group recognises revenues.
IFRS 16 IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016 and is endorsed for use in the EU.
It is effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and will be adopted by the Group with effect from 1 October 2019.
For lessees, operating leases will be brought onto the Groups balance sheet with an asset recognised for the contractual right of use and a financial liability recognised for the contractual payments.
This change will mainly impact the properties that the Group currently accounts for as operating leases.
There are no substantial changes to the accounting for leases by lessors, nor for finance leases.
An implementation plan is in place and the Group continues to assess the impact of the standard.
2 This has the effect on phasing the Day 1 impact of the transition to IFRS 9 over five years for capital purposes, with 95% of the impact added back in the first year.
Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 191 Section 2: Results for the year 2.1 Segment information The Groups operating segments are operating units engaged in providing different products or services and whose operating results and overall performance are regularly reviewed by the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker, the Executive Leadership Team.
The Groups business is organised into two principal operating segments: SME banking and Retail banking.
In addition, Central Functions consist of the Groups back office support functions.
SME banking The Groups established regional SME franchise offers a full range of banking products and services to meet business customers banking needs across its small business, commercial, corporate and structured finance segments.
The Groups SME franchise comprises small businesses which the Group defines as businesses with lending of up to 0.5m but less than 2.0m in turnover and medium businesses which the Group defines as businesses with lending of more than 0.5m and greater than 2.0m in turnover.

Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 193 2.2 Net interest income Accounting policy Interest income is reflected in the income statement using the effective interest method which discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability.
When calculating the effective interest rate, cash flows are estimated considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument e. g. prepayment, call and similar options excluding future credit losses.
The calculation includes all amounts paid or received that are an integral part of the effective interest rate such as transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts.
Where it is not possible to reliably estimate the cash flows or the expected life of a financial instrument or group of financial instruments, the contractual cash flows over the full contractual term of the financial instrument or group of financial instruments are used.
Loan origination and commitment fees are recognised within the effective interest rate calculation.
Non-utilisation of a commitment fee is recognised as revenue upon expiry of the agreed commitment period.
Loan related administration and service fees are recognised as revenue over the period of service.
Interest income and interest expense on hedged assets and liabilities and financial assets and liabilities designated as fair value through profit or loss are also recognised as part of net interest income.
Where a trading derivative is economically hedging an interest-bearing financial asset or liability designated at fair value through profit or loss, the interest income and expense attributable to the derivative is recognised within net interest income in a manner consistent with hedging derivatives and not as part of the fair value movement of the trading derivative.

The fair value of these loans is derived from the future loan cash flows using appropriate discount rates and includes adjustments for credit risk and credit losses.
The valuation technique used is reflective of current market practice: and hedged assets, liabilities and derivatives designated in hedge relationships fair value movements are recognised on both the hedged item and hedging derivative in a fair value hedge relationship the net of which represents hedge ineffectiveness, and hedge ineffectiveness on cash flow hedge relationships note 3.4.

Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 195 2.4 Operating and administrative expenses Accounting policy Personnel expenses primarily consist of wages and salaries, accrued bonus and social security costs arising from services rendered by employees during the financial year.
The Group recognises bonus costs where it has a present obligation that can be reliably measured.
Bonus costs are recognised over the relevant service period required to entitle the employee to the reward.
The Groups accounting policies on pension expenses and equity based compensation are included in notes 3.16 and 4.2 respectively.

A past service credit of 88m was included in personnel expenses as a result of the closure of the Scheme to future accrual for the majority of members.
In addition, a curtailment gain of 13m was recognised in respect of redundancies which did not attract an enhancement entitlement and was offset against the related restructuring costs.
The average number of FTE employees of the Group during the year was made up as follows: 2018 2017 Number Number Managers 2,161 2,234 Clerical staff 3,608 3,806 5,769 6,040 The average monthly number of employees was 6,461 2017: 6,818.

The increase in the year is principally due to reporting accountant procedures in relation to the Virgin Money transaction.
In addition to the above, out of pocket expenses of 49k 2017: 48k were borne by the Group, principally related to reimbursement of travel expenses incurred by staff when performing the above services.
2.5 Taxation Accounting policy Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it is related to items recognised directly in equity, in which case the tax is also recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable profit or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.

A reconciliation from the expense implied by the standard rate to the actual tax expense is as follows: 2018 2017 m m Loss profit on ordinary activities before tax 164 268 Tax credit expense based on the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 19% 2017: 19.5% 31 52 Effects of: Disallowable expenses 42 9 Conduct indemnity adjustment 5 7 Deferred tax assets recognised 8 21 Impact of rate changes 9 34 Adjustments in respect of prior years 26 5 Tax credit expense for the year 19 86 The total amount of tax, current and deferred, recognised directly in equity during the year was a credit of 23m 2017: 1m.
Disallowable expenses represent, in the main, the Groups share of incremental conduct charges that are not deductible in computing taxable profits, and non-deductible transaction costs predominantly in relation to the acquisition of Virgin Money.
The prior year adjustment comprises movements in the deferred tax asset recognised for losses following the enactment of the Corporate Loss Restriction in Finance Act No.
These rules allowed, for the first time, certain losses to be relieved against the profits of group entities other than the one in which they arose, and also changed the order of precedence for relief of existing losses.
The consequence of this change was that historic losses which were previously derecognised are now brought onto the balance sheet in accordance with the Groups established methodology.
The remainder of the prior year adjustment relates to the revaluation of the conduct indemnity adjustment, and incorporates a fully offsetting movement between current and deferred tax.
The rate change charge arises on the revaluation of assets as a consequence of the UK mainstream rate of tax trending towards the enacted rate of 17%, and where deferred tax assets have been utilised at rates lower than initially forecast.
2.6 Earnings per share EPS Accounting policy Basic earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by taking the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the parent company and dividing this by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share This requires the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue to be adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
These arise from awards made under equity based compensation schemes.
Share awards with performance conditions attaching to them are not considered to be dilutive unless these conditions have been met at the reporting date.
The Group presents basic and diluted loss earnings per share data in relation to the ordinary shares of CYBG PLC.

3.2 Financial assets available for sale Accounting policy Available for sale financial assets are recognised on trade date and comprise listed and unlisted non-derivative financial assets not classified into any other financial asset category.
They are initially recognised at fair value including direct and incremental transaction costs, and subsequently measured at fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included as a separate component of equity until sale or impairment, at which point the cumulative gain or loss is transferred to the income statement.
All available for sale financial assets are continually monitored for evidence of any impairment, which would typically be deemed to have arisen where there is evidence of a significant or prolonged reduction in the fair value of the security below its cost.
Where such evidence of impairment exists, the cumulative net loss previously recognised directly in equity is transferred to the income statement.
In situations where evidence suggests a subsequent increase in value, reversals of impairment of previously impaired equity instruments are recognised directly in equity while reversals of impairment of debt instruments are recognised in the income statement.
Interest income, determined using the effective interest method, is recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses and translation differences on monetary items are recognised in the income statement within the year in which they arise.

Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 199 3.3 Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Accounting policy Financial assets and liabilities are designated at fair value through profit or loss, with gains and losses recognised in the income statement as they arise note 2.3, when this reduces an accounting mismatch or where the performance is evaluated on a fair value basis.
In such cases, transaction costs are recognised immediately in the income statement upon initial recognition of the financial asset and liability.
The derivatives related to the assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting and are accounted for as held for trading derivative financial instruments note 3.4.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements Where the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded on the balance sheet cannot be derived from active markets, they are determined using a variety of valuation techniques that include the use of mathematical models.
The inputs to these models are derived from observable market data where possible, but where such data is not available, judgement is required to establish fair values.
The judgements include considerations of liquidity and credit risk.
The most significant judgement is in relation to the Groups fair value loan portfolio.
The most significant unobservable input impacting the carrying value of the loans other than interest rates is the future expectation of credit losses.
If the lifetime expected losses were 20% greater than predicted, the carrying value of the loans would decrease by 2m and vice versa.
2018 2017 m m Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Loans and advances 362 477 Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Due to customers term deposits 15 26 Loans and advances Included in financial assets at fair value through profit or loss is a historical portfolio of loans sales ceased in 2012.
Interest rate risk associated with these loans is managed using interest rate derivative contracts and the loans are recorded at fair value to avoid an accounting mismatch.
The maximum credit exposure of the loans is 362m 2017: 477m including accrued interest receivable of 2m 2017: 2m.
The cumulative loss in the fair value of the loans attributable to changes in credit risk amounts to 8m 2017: 11m and the change for the current year is a decrease of 3m 2017: decrease of 13m, of which 3m 2017: 6m has been recognised in the income statement.
Due to customers term deposits Included in other financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are fixed rate deposits, the interest rate risk on which is hedged using interest rate derivative contracts.
The deposits are recorded at fair value to avoid an accounting mismatch.
The change in fair value attributable to changes in the Groups credit risk is Nil 2017: Nil.
The Group is contractually obligated to pay 0.3m 2017: 1m less than the carrying amount at maturity to the deposit holder.
200 CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements Section 3: Assets and liabilities continued 3.4 Derivative financial instruments Accounting policy All derivative instruments manage exposures to interest rates and foreign currency and are recognised on the balance sheet at fair value on trade date.
The carrying value of a derivative is measured at fair value throughout the life of the contract.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
The notional amount of a derivative contract is not recorded on the balance sheet but is disclosed as part of this note.
The method of recognising the fair value gain or loss on a derivative depends on whether it is designated as a hedging instrument and the nature of the item being hedged.
Certain derivatives are designated as either hedges of highly probable future cash flows attributable to a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction a cash flow hedge : or hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or firm commitments a fair value hedge.
Cash flow hedge The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in equity.
Specifically, the separate component of equity note 4.1 is adjusted to the lesser of the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument, and the cumulative change in fair value of the expected future cash flows on the hedged item from the inception of the hedge.
Any remaining gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement.
The carrying value of the hedged item is not adjusted.
Amounts accumulated in equity are transferred to the income statement in the period in which the hedged item affects profit or loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Fair value hedge The carrying value of the hedged item on initial designation is adjusted for the fair value attributable to the hedged risk.
Subsequently, changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
The movement in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is made as an adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged asset or liability.
Where the hedged item is derecognised from the balance sheet, the adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability is immediately transferred to the income statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item is amortised to the income statement on an effective interest basis over the remaining life of the asset or liability.
Hedge effectiveness The Group documents, at the inception of a transaction, the relationship between hedging instruments and the hedged items, and the Groups risk management objective and strategy for undertaking these hedge transactions.
The documentation covers how effectiveness will be measured throughout the life of the hedge relationship and its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
A hedge is expected to be highly effective if the changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk during the period for which the hedge is designated are expected to offset in a range of 80% to 125%.
Derivatives held for trading The Group uses derivatives for risk management purposes and does not have a trading book.
However, derivatives that do not meet the hedging criteria within IAS 39, or for which hedge accounting is not applied, are classified as held for trading.
Changes in value of held for trading derivatives are immediately recognised in the income statement note 2.3.

Loans and advances to customers are initially recognised at fair value including direct and incremental transaction costs.
They are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, adjusted for impairment losses.
They are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows have expired or the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
Leases entered into by the Group as lessor, where the Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, are classified as finance leases.
The leased asset is not held on the Group balance sheet: instead, a finance lease is recognised representing the minimum lease payments receivable under the terms of the lease, discounted at the rate of interest implicit in the lease.
Interest income is recognised in interest receivable, allocated to accounting periods to reflect a constant periodic rate of return.

Examples of loss events are i where there has been an actual breach of contract by the borrower such as a default or delinquency in payment of interest or principal: or ii the granting of a concession to the borrower that the Group would not otherwise consider.
The Group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists either individually for assets that are separately significant, or collectively for assets that are not separately significant.
If it is determined that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, the asset is included in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment collective provisions.
Collective provisions Collective provisions are generally established for homogeneous portfolios such as the Retail portfolios and the small business portfolio within the SME franchise.
Within the Groups Retail environment, past loss experience is a key factor in determining an appropriate collective provision level and takes into account a number of different elements including: the number of days past due: the realisable value of any security held: and the timing of any such security sale.
These and other factors will influence the probability that the customer defaults on the loan the PD.
In the event of a default occurrence, the Retail collective provision calculator provides the amount the Group expects to be irrecoverable from that customer the LGD.
The level and impact of LGD varies significantly between the Groups secured and unsecured lending portfolios.
Collective provisioning for the Groups SME portfolio is also based on the use of PD and LGD.
The assets are included in a group of financial assets with similar risk characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment.
The modelled collective assessment considers factors such as: credit quality: levels of arrears: credit utilisation: loan to collateral ratios: and other factors including the Groups internal customer rating system eCRS.
These characteristics are relevant to the estimation of future cash flows for groups of such assets as they are indicative of the borrowers ability to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the assets being evaluated.
Reliance is placed on the eCRS rating when assessing PD as these are directly mapped within the model.
Manual interventions to the eCRS rating, such as the placement on a watch list, will directly lead to an increase in PD and consequently the level of collective provision required.
LGD assumptions are driven by the level of security assigned to the customer within the collective provisioning model.
These are regularly monitored to ensure comparability with recent actual loss experience.
In addition, for both the Groups Retail and SME portfolios, experienced judgement is used to estimate the amount of an impairment loss.
This reflects a limited number of refinements that have been assessed as necessary to reflect specific and evolving circumstances that, by their nature, cannot be adequately captured in the models.
The use of judgements and supportable estimates is considered by management to be an essential part of the credit impairment process.
The methodology and assumptions used for estimating future cash flows are reviewed regularly to identify and reduce any significant differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience.
Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 205 Specific provision If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred on a loan, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows including the estimated realisable value of any security discounted at the assets original effective interest rate a specific provision.
Specific provision allowances are primarily established against the Groups commercial business within the SME franchise.
Assets are reviewed on a regular basis and those showing potential or actual vulnerability are placed onto a watch list where enhanced monitoring is undertaken.
Impairment When first recognised, the impairment allowance, which is a combination of both the collective and specific provision, is recognised in the income statement.
Following impairment, interest income is recognised using the original effective rate of interest which was used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed.
The amount of the reversal is recognised in the income statement.
When a loan is deemed uncollectable, and all necessary internal procedures have been completed, it is written off against the related impairment loss.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off reduce the expense in the income statement.
The Groups impairment policy for available for sale financial assets is included in note 3.2.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements In determining the required level of collective impairment provisions, the Group uses the output from various statistical models, with management judgement required to assess the modelled outputs and, where necessary, make appropriate adjustments.
The key assumptions within the Groups collective provisioning models which give rise to significant estimation uncertainty are the PD and the LGD.
Both measures are predicated on expectations of customer behaviour and performance, which requires management to form a judgement based on a wide range of historic and current evidence.
The actual amount of the future cash flows and their timing may differ significantly from the assumptions made for the purposes of determining the impairment allowances and consequently these allowances can be subject to variation as time progresses and the circumstances of the customer become clearer.
From an SME perspective, changes made to eCRS will have a direct impact as these are mapped to PDs.
Assumption changes on retail customer behaviour will also have an impact on the PDs used.
Within the Retail portfolio, the Groups collective provision is reflective of the fact that the majority of lending is concentrated on customer mortgages, where the available security is generally sufficient to cover the exposure.
This differs from the SME portfolio where the availability and strength of the security will have less of an impact on overall recoveries, leading to a potentially higher collective provision charge relative to the overall exposure.
Sensitivities within the collective provision There are interactions between the various assumptions within the provisioning models which mean that no single factor is likely to move independent of others: however, the sensitivities disclosed below assume all other assumptions remain unchanged.
If the PDs were to move by - 5% from those presently used within the Groups provisioning models, the impairment provision would increase decrease accordingly by 5m.
An important element to the PD is the loss emergence period LEP which represents the Groups assessment of the period from when a loss event occurs to eventual default.
The impact of the LEP differs between the Groups Retail and SME portfolios.
A two-month increase in the LEP would result in a further 2m impairment provision within the SME portfolio, and a further 3m being added to the Retail impairment provision.
To the extent that recovery rates improve from those presently used within each of the Groups provisioning models by 5%, the impairment provision on loans and advances would decrease by 14m.
Alternatively, if recovery rates deteriorate by 5%, the impairment provision on loans and advances would increase by 24m.
Provision in the SME portfolio is sensitive not only to default rates and severity of losses, but also to the assessment of risk and security.
If 10% of the SME portfolio were to fall by one notch, the impairment provision would increase by 2m.
In addition to modelled outputs, the impairment provision is further impacted by management judgements.
These include judgements that reflect elements which are not sufficiently sensitive to the current economic conditions, model risk reserves that are held to cover against a range of potential model limitations, and judgements made in respect of potential recoveries for specific provisions which also involve customer and economic specific conditions.
These management judgements do not allow for any meaningful sensitivity comparison.

3.7 Securitisation and covered bond programmes Accounting policy The Group sponsors the formation of structured entities, primarily for the purpose of facilitation of asset securitisation and covered bond transactions to accomplish certain narrow and well-defined objectives.
Although the Group has no shareholding in these entities, where it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entities and it has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity, they are regarded as controlled entities as described in note 1.5 and are consolidated in the Groups financial statements.
Securitisation The Group has securitised a portion of its retail mortgage loan portfolio under the Groups master trust securitisation programmes.
The securitised mortgage loans have been assigned at principal value to bankruptcy remote structured entities.
These structured entities have been funded through the issue of RMBS to third-party institutional debt investors.
The Group is entitled to any residual income from the vehicles after the debt obligations and senior expenses of the programmes have been met.
The securitised debt holders have no recourse to the Group other than the principal and interest including fees generated from the securitised mortgage loan portfolio.
The Group continues servicing these mortgage loans in return for an administration fee.
The mortgage loans do not qualify for derecognition because the Group remains exposed to the majority of the risks and rewards of the mortgage loan portfolio, principally the associated credit risk.
The securitisation structured entities are consolidated and the securitised mortgage loans retained on the Groups balance sheet.
A liability is recognised for the proceeds of the funding transaction.
The externally held securitised notes in issue are included within debt securities in issue note 3.15.
There are a number of notes held internally by the Group, not recognised on the balance sheet, which are used as collateral for repurchases and similar transactions or for credit enhancement purposes.
Covered bond A subset of the Groups retail mortgage loan portfolio has been ring fenced and assigned to a bankruptcy remote limited liability partnership, Clydesdale Covered Bond 2 LLP, associated with the covered bond programme, to provide a guarantee for the obligations payable on the covered bonds issued by the Group.
Similar to the securitisation programmes, the Group is entitled to any residual income after all payment obligations due under the terms of the covered bonds and senior programme expenses have been met.
The mortgage loans do not qualify for derecognition because the Group retains all of the risks and rewards of the mortgage loan portfolio.
The covered bond partnership is consolidated with the mortgage loans retained on the consolidated balance sheet and the covered bonds issued included within debt securities in issue.
The covered bond holders have dual recourse: firstly, to Clydesdale Bank PLC on an unsecured basis: and secondly, to the LLP under the Covered Bond Guarantee secured against the mortgage loans.
Significant restrictions Where the Group uses its financial assets to raise finance through securitisations and the sale of securities subject to repurchase agreements, this leads to the assets becoming encumbered.
Once encumbered, the assets are not available for transfer around the Group.
The assets and liabilities in relation to securitisation and covered bonds in issue at 30 September are as follows: Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 207 Covered Securitisation bonds Total 2018 m m m Liabilities At 1 October 2017 3,242 748 3,990 Issuance of debt 1,049 1,049 Repayments 1,372 1,372 Other movements 30 16 14 At 30 September 2018 2,949 732 3,681 Assets Securitised mortgage loans 6,412 1,389 7,801 Covered Securitisation bonds Total 2017 m m m Liabilities At 1 October 2016 3,208 797 4,005 Issuance of debt 750 750 Repayments 740 740 Other movements 24 49 25 At 30 September 2017 3,242 748 3,990 Assets Securitised mortgage loans 6,182 1,344 7,526 Other movements consist of exchange rate movements on currency denominated bonds and fair value hedge accounting adjustments.

The Group has contractual and non-contractual arrangements which may require it to provide financial support as follows: Securitisation programmes The Group provides credit support to the structured entities via reserve funds, which are partly funded through subordinated debt arrangements and by holding junior notes.
Exposures totalled 23m in subordinated debt 2017: 47m and 971m in junior notes held 2017: 856m.
The Group has a beneficial interest in the securitised mortgage portfolio held by the structured entities of 1,074m 2017: 711m.
Furthermore, the Group has an obligation to repurchase mortgage exposures if certain mortgage loans no longer meet the programme criteria.
Looking forward through future reporting periods there are a number of date based options on the notes issued by the structured entities which could be actioned by them as issuer.
These could require the Group, as sponsor, to provide additional liquidity support.
Covered bond programme The nominal level of  was 860m 2017: 681m of the outstanding covered bonds.
From time to time the obligations of the Group to provide  may increase due to the formal requirements of the programme.

Fair values are determined in accordance with guidance published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, including adjustments to observable market inputs reflecting any specific characteristics of the land and buildings.
Directors valuations are performed annually in July, with the independent valuations carried out on a three-year cycle on an open market basis.
The valuations are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as defined in note 3.18.
All other items of property, plant and equipment are carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to acquisition of the asset.
Impairment is assessed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
With the exception of freehold and long-term leasehold land, all items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated or amortised using the straight line method, at rates appropriate to their estimated useful life to the Group.
The annual rates of depreciation or amortisation are: Buildings 50 years Leases leasehold improvements the lower of the expected lease term or the assets remaining useful life Fixtures and equipment 310 years Residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed at each reporting date.
Depreciation is recognised within depreciation expense in the income statement.

210 CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements Section 3: Assets and liabilities continued 3.10 Intangible assets Accounting policy Capitalised software costs are stated at cost, less amortisation and any provision for impairment.
Identifiable and directly associated external and internal costs of acquiring and developing software are capitalised where the software is controlled by the Group, and where it is probable that future economic benefits that exceed its cost will flow from its use over more than one year.
Costs associated with maintaining software are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Capitalised computer software costs are amortised on a straight line basis over their expected useful lives, usually between three and 10 years.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, which typically arises when the benefits associated with the software were substantially reduced from what had originally been anticipated or the asset has been superseded by a subsequent investment.
In such situations, an impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal or its value in use.
Intangible assets which are fully amortised are reviewed annually to consider whether the assets remain in use.

Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 211 3.11 Deferred tax Accounting policy Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
A deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax losses and unused tax credits only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will arise against which those temporary differences and losses may be utilised.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The Group has deferred tax assets of 206m 2017: 154m : the increase from the previous balance sheet date is mainly due to increased loss recognition due to the implementation of the Corporate Loss Restriction, losses incurred in the year and additionally previously written off historic losses re-recognised in accordance with IAS 12.
The Group has assessed the recoverability of these deferred tax assets at 30 September 2018 and considers it probable that sufficient future taxable profits will be available against which the underlying deductible temporary differences can be utilised over the corporate planning horizon.
At 30 September 2018, the Group had an unrecognised deferred tax asset of 157m 2017: 180m representing trading losses with a gross value of 926m 2017: 1,058m.
Although there is no prescribed period after which losses expire, a deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these losses as the Directors have insufficient certainty over their recoverability in the foreseeable future.

In accordance with the appropriate accounting standard, these enacted rates are used to measure the value at which assets are expected to be realised and liabilities settled.
A prior year adjustment to claim capital allowances provisionally disclaimed at 30 September 2017 has resulted in an increase to the residual loss deferred tax asset of 14m and a decrease in the corresponding capital allowance deferred tax asset of 19m.
The difference between the two amounts, which arises because the two types of deferred tax assets are recognised at different rates, is taken to the income statement as part of the prior year credit set out in note 2.5.
The acquisition of Virgin Money on 15 October 2018 is not expected to have a material impact on the deferred tax asset recognition.

Provisions for liabilities and charges are not discounted to the present value of their expected net future cash flows except where the time value of money is considered material.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements PPI redress provision and other conduct related matters Management has exercised significant judgement around the key assumptions that underpin the estimates and used estimation techniques to quantify them.
Ongoing regulatory review and input, as well as rulings from the Financial Ombudsman Service over time, and the Groups internal reviews and assessments of customer complaints, will continue to impact upon the nature and extent of conduct related customer redress and associated costs for which the Group may ultimately become liable in future periods.
Significant judgement is required in determining the key assumptions used to estimate the quantum of the provision, including the level of future complaint volumes, uphold rates how many claims are, or may be, upheld in the customers favour, and redress costs the average payment made to customers.
The provision is therefore subject to inherent uncertainties as a result of the subjective nature of the assumptions used in quantifying the overall estimated position at 30 September 2018, consequently, the provision calculated may be subject to change in future years if outcomes differ to those currently assumed.
Sensitivity analysis indicating the impact of reasonably possible changes in key assumptions on the PPI provision is presented within this note.
There are similar uncertainties and judgements for other conduct risk related matters, however the level of liability is materially lower.

214 CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements Section 3: Assets and liabilities continued 3.14 Provision for liabilities and charges continued PPI redress In common with the wider UK retail banking sector, the Group continues to deal with complaints and redress issues arising out of historic sales of PPI.
During the year, the Group reassessed the level of provision that was considered appropriate to meet current and future expectations in relation to the mis-selling of PPI policies and concluded that a further charge of 500m was required incorporating the Groups estimate of the impact of heightened media coverage, the FCA advertising campaign and increased activity by claims management companies ahead of the August 2019 industry deadline.
It also incorporated a reassessment of the costs of processing cases and the impact of experience adjustments.
The impact on the Groups income statement 352m has been reduced by the remaining balance of the Capped Indemnity.
The total provision raised to date in respect of PPI is 2,640m 2017: 2,140m, with 275m 1 of this remaining 2017: 293m for customer initiated complaints including costs of administration.
The Group implemented a comprehensive new PPI complaint handling process from August 2014 which involved making a number of significant changes to the PPI operations and resulted in an increase in operational and administrative costs.
As reported previously, this involved the Group reopening complaints and reviewing the original decision reached in light of the new PPI complaint handling processes.
This process has been concluded during the year at an additional cost of 88m.
2 To 30 September 2018, the Group has received 483,000 complaints 2017: 361,000 and has allowed for 83,000 further walk in complaints 2017: 73,000.
This reflects an expectation that incoming complaints will reduce from current levels in aggregate reflecting the recently observed decline following the implementation of the fee cap.
The increase in provision has taken into account the above factors as well as a revision in the Groups expectation of new customer initiated complaints in light of current experience.
The overall provision is based on a number of assumptions derived from a combination of past experience, estimated future experience, industry comparison and the exercise of judgement in the key areas identified.
There remain risks and uncertainties in relation to these assumptions and consequently in relation to the ultimate costs of redress and related costs, including: i the number of PPI claims and the extent to which this is influenced by the activity of claims management companies, the application of a time bar, Plevin, and FCA advertising : ii the number of those claims that ultimately will be upheld: iii the amount that will be paid in respect of those claims: and iv the costs of administration.
As such, the factors discussed above mean there is a risk that existing provisions for PPI customer redress may not cover all potential costs.
In light of this, the eventual costs of PPI redress and complaint handling may therefore differ materially from that estimated and further provision could be required.
The table below sets out the key assumptions and the effect on the provision at 30 September 2018 of future, potential, changes in key assumptions: Assumptions Change in 3 assumption Sensitivity Number of expected future customer initiated complaints 83,000 new complaints -10% 24m Uphold rate -1% 3m 4 Average redress costs -1% 1m 1 Comparatives refer to the remaining provision for customer initiated complaints only, the balance being for the completion of the remediation exercise.
3 There are inter-dependencies between several of the key assumptions which add to the complexity of the judgements the Group has to make.
This means that no single factor is likely to move independently of others, however, the sensitivities disclosed above assume all other assumptions remain unchanged.
4 Sensitivity to a change in average redress across customer initiated complaints.
Customer redress and other provisions Other provisions include amounts in respect of a number of non-PPI conduct related matters, legal proceedings, and claims arising in the ordinary course of the Groups business.
Over the course of the year, the Group has raised further provisions of 44m for these matters, none of which was covered by the Capped Indemnity.
The ultimate cost to the Group of other customer redress matters is driven by a number of factors relating to offers of redress, compensation, offers of alternative products, consequential loss claims and administrative costs.
The matters are at varying stages of their life cycle and in certain circumstances, usually early in the life of a potential issue, elements of the potential exposure are contingent.
These factors could result in the total cost of review and redress varying materially from the Groups estimate.
The final amount required to settle the Groups potential liabilities in these matters is therefore uncertain and further provision could be required.
Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 215 Conduct Indemnity Deed The Groups economic exposure to the impact of historic conduct related liabilities was mitigated by a Capped Indemnity of 1.7bn from NAB.
The full amount of the remaining Capped Indemnity was drawn down in the current year.
The Company and NAB had an agreement under which NAB provided the Company with a Capped Indemnity to meet the costs of dealing with conduct matters related to products sold in the period prior to the date of the Groups Demerger the Conduct Indemnity Deed.
The legacy conduct matters covered by the Capped Indemnity are referred to as Relevant Conduct Matters.
The Capped Indemnity provided the Group with economic protection against certain costs and liabilities including financial penalties imposed by a regulator resulting from conduct issues relating to: a PPI, standalone interest rate hedging products, voluntary scope tailored business loans and fixed rate tailored business loans: and b other conduct matters, subject to certain limitations and minimum financial thresholds.
Amounts payable under the Capped Indemnity included, subject to certain limitations, payments to customers to satisfy, settle or discharge a Relevant Conduct Matter and the direct costs and expenses of satisfying, settling, discharging or administering such Relevant Conduct Matter.
It was agreed that NAB would meet 90.3% of Qualifying Conduct Costs claimed by the Company, up to the amount of the Capped Indemnity.
Claims under the Capped Indemnity have been recognised in the consolidated income statement simultaneously with the charge for Relevant Conduct Matters.
The conduct expense and associated reimbursement income have been presented net within Other operating and administrative expenses.
The provision expense and reimbursement income are disclosed above.
Now that the Qualifying Conduct Costs have exceeded the Capped Indemnity, any costs in excess of the amounts currently provided will be borne by the Group.
To the extent that tax relief is expected in relation to provisions for which reimbursement income is applicable, amounts may become repayable to NAB.
In the consolidated financial statements, deferred tax assets are only recognised in respect of the loss share proportion 9.7% of unused tax losses on Relevant Conduct Matters, on the basis that the Group does not obtain the economic benefit of the future tax relief which is repayable to NAB.
The utilisation of the Capped Indemnity is set out below: Conduct protection m Conduct protection provided by NAB 1,700 1 Capital injected into CYB Investments Limited CYBI prior to Demerger 120 2 Drawn in the period to 30 September 2017 1,432 Undrawn Conduct Indemnity as at 30 September 2017 148 Drawn in the year to 30 September 2018 148 Undrawn balance as at 30 September 2018 1 120m of the 670m of capital injected in CYBI on 24 September 2015 related to the Conduct Indemnity Deed.
2 465m of the 1,432m represented the pre-covered provision amount.
Restructuring provision Restructuring of the business is currently ongoing and a provision is held to cover redundancy payments, property vacation costs and associated enablement costs.
During the year 38m 2017: 67m was charged to the income statement, of which 23m 2017: 9m was charged directly to the income statement and 15m 2017: 58m was provided for in accordance with the requirements of IAS 37.
23m 2017: 61m of the total provision was utilised in the year.
Included within the restructuring provision is an amount for committed rental expense on surplus lease space consistent with the expected exposure on individual leases where the property is unoccupied.
This element of the provision will be utilised over the remaining life of the leases or until the leases are assigned, and is measured at present values by discounting anticipated future cash flows.

Debt securities are initially recognised at fair value, being the issue proceeds, net of transaction costs incurred.
These instruments are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method resulting in premiums, discounts and associated issue costs being recognised in the income statement over the life of the instrument.

218 CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements Section 3: Assets and liabilities continued 3.16 Retirement benefit obligations Accounting policy The Group makes contributions to both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes which entitle employees to benefits on retirement or disability.
Defined contribution pension scheme The Group recognises the obligation for contributions to the scheme as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payment is available.
Defined benefit pension scheme A liability or asset in respect of the defined benefit scheme is recognised on the balance sheet and is measured as the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of the defined benefit scheme assets at the reporting date.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation for the scheme is discounted by high quality corporate bond rates that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Groups defined benefit obligation.
Surpluses are only recognised to the extent that they are recoverable through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the scheme.
In assessing whether a surplus is recoverable, the Group considers its current right to obtain a refund or a reduction in future contributions and does not anticipate any future acts by other parties that could change the amount of the surplus that may be ultimately recovered.
Pension expense attributable to the Groups defined benefit scheme comprises current service cost, net interest on the net defined benefit obligation asset, past service cost resulting from a scheme amendment or curtailment, gains or losses on settlement and administrative costs incurred.
Where actuarial remeasurements arise, the Group recognises such amounts directly in equity through the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Actuarial remeasurements arise from experience adjustments the effects of differences between previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred and changes in actuarial assumptions.
The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements.
The Groups principal trading subsidiary, Clydesdale Bank PLC, is the sponsoring employer in one funded defined benefit pension scheme, the Yorkshire and Clydesdale Bank Pension Scheme the Scheme.
The Scheme was established under trust on 30 September 2009 as a result of the merger of the Clydesdale Bank Pension Scheme and the Yorkshire Bank Pension Fund.
The assets of the Scheme are held in a trustee administered fund, with the Trustee responsible for the operation and governance of the Scheme, including making decisions regarding the Schemes funding and investment strategy.
The Scheme is subject to the funding legislation outlined in the Pensions Act 2004 which came into force on 30 December 2005.
This, together with documents issued by the Pensions Regulator, sets out the framework for funding defined benefit occupational pension plans in the UK.
The Group also provides post-retirement health care under a defined benefit scheme for pensioners and their dependent relatives for which provision has been made on a basis consistent with the methodology applied to the defined benefit pension scheme.
This is a closed scheme and the provision will be utilised over the life of the remaining scheme members.
The following table provides a summary of the present value of the defined benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the Scheme: 2018 2017 m m Active members defined benefit obligation 24 807 1 Deferred members defined benefit obligation 2,131 1,549 Pensioner and dependant members defined benefit obligation 1,591 1,618 Total defined benefit obligation 3,746 3,974 Fair value of Scheme assets 3,958 4,181 Net defined benefit pension asset 212 207 Post-retirement medical benefits obligations 3 3 1 Deferred members defined benefit obligation includes employees who became deferred members on 1 August 2017 as part of the Scheme closure exercise.
Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 219 The Group has implemented a number of reforms to the Scheme to manage the liability.
It closed the Scheme to new members in 2004 and since April 2006 has determined benefits accruing on a career average revalued earnings basis.
On 1 August 2017, the Scheme was closed to future benefit accrual for the majority of current employees, with affected employees future pension benefits being provided through the existing defined contribution scheme, Total Pension.
The Total Pension income statement charge for the year is shown in note 2.4.
The last scheme funding valuation was at 30 September 2016 with a calculated deficit of 290m.
In the latest recovery plan dated 31 January 2018, the Group agreed to eliminate the deficit through the following scheduled contributions: a single contribution of 25m on 15 October 2018: thereafter, equal monthly contributions totalling 50m per annum until 31 March 2022: and 55m in the year to 31 March 2023.
On 26 October 2018 the High Court ruled on a landmark pensions case relating to the defined benefits pension schemes operated by Lloyds Banking Group.

Derivative holdings may lead to increased or decreased exposures to the physical asset categories disclosed above.
The Scheme is not invested in any of the Groups own financial instruments.
Through its defined benefit pension plan and post-employment medical plan, the Group is exposed to a number of risks.
The main risk to the Group is that additional contributions are required if the Schemes assets are not sufficient to pay for the benefits which will be influenced mainly by inflation and the longevity of members.
The level of asset returns will be a key factor in the overall investment return.
The investment portfolio is subject also to a range of risks typical of the assets held, in particular equity risk, credit risk on bonds and exposure to the property market.
The Trustee has implemented an investment structure including physical assets and derivatives that seeks to reduce the Schemes exposure to inflation and interest rate risks.
As at 30 September 2018, both the interest rate and inflation rate hedge ratios were around 60% of liabilities when measured on a self-sufficiency basis.
The estimated hedge ratios will be updated pending changes to the Trustees strategic asset allocation but it is expected these have both increased.
This strategy reflects the Schemes liability profile and the Trustees and the Groups attitude to risk.
The Trustee monitors the investment objectives and asset allocation policy on a regular basis.

The key areas of estimation uncertainty are: The discount rate applied.
The discount rate is required to be set with reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on high quality corporate bonds in the currency and with a term consistent with the Schemes obligations.
The average duration of the Schemes obligations is approximately 19 years.
The market for bonds with a similar duration is illiquid and, as a result, significant management judgement is required to determine an appropriate yield curve on which to base the discount rate.
Inflation is set with reference to market expectations of the RPI measure of inflation for a term consistent with the Schemes obligations, based on data published by the BoE.
Other measures of inflation such as CPI, or inflation measures subject to an annual cap are derived from this assumption.
The cost of the benefits payable by the Scheme will also depend upon the life expectancy of the members.
The assumptions for mortality rates are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future improvements in life expectancies.
The table below sets out the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation and pension cost to realistic changes in the key actuarial assumptions: Assumption change Impact on defined benefit obligation Impact on pension cost m m Discount rate 0.25% 169 6 -0.25% 182 5 Inflation 0.25% 115 3 -0.25% 113 3 Life expectancy 1 year 126 4 -1 year 120 3 The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
The discounted mean term of the defined benefit obligation at 30 September 2018 is 19 years 2017: 20 years.
The expected contributions for the year ending 30 September 2019 are 77m 2018: 33m and expected benefit payments for the year ending 30 September 2019 are 98m 2018: 100m.

When available, the Group measures the fair value of an instrument using quoted prices in an active market for that instrument.
Where no such active market exists for the particular asset or liability, the Group uses a valuation technique to arrive at the fair value, including the use of transaction prices obtained in recent arms length transactions where possible, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants.
In doing so, fair value is estimated using a valuation technique that makes maximum possible use of market inputs and that places minimal possible reliance upon entity-specific inputs.
The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is the transaction price, which represents the fair value of the consideration paid or received, unless the fair value of that instrument is evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument i. e. without modification or repackaging or based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable markets.
When such evidence exists, the Group recognises profits or losses on the transaction date.
In certain limited circumstances the Group applies the fair value measurement option to financial assets including loans and advances where the inherent market risks principally interest rate and option risk are individually hedged using appropriate interest rate derivatives.
The loan is designated as being carried at fair value through profit or loss to offset the movements in the fair value of the derivative within the income statement and therefore avoid an accounting mismatch.
When a loan is held at fair value, a statistical based calculation is used to estimate expected losses attributable to adverse movements in credit risk on the assets held.
This adjustment to the credit quality of the asset is then applied to the carrying amount of the loan to arrive at fair value and recognised in the income statement.
Analysis of the fair value disclosures uses a hierarchy that reflects the significance of inputs used in measuring fair value.
The level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement is categorised is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
The fair value hierarchy is as follows: Level 1 fair value measurements quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for an identical financial asset or liability: Level 2 fair value measurements inputs other than quoted prices within Level 1 that are observable for the financial asset or liability, either directly as prices or indirectly derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements inputs for the financial asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
For the purpose of reporting movements between levels of the fair value hierarchy, transfers are recognised at the beginning of the reporting period in which they occur.
a Fair value of financial instruments recognised on the balance sheet at amortised cost The tables overleaf show a comparison of the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost, as reported on the balance sheet, and their fair values where these are not approximately equal.
There are various limitations inherent in this fair value disclosure particularly where prices are derived from unobservable inputs due to some financial instruments not being traded in an active market.
The methodologies and assumptions used in the fair value estimates are therefore described in the notes to the tables.
The difference between carrying value and fair value is relevant in a trading environment, but is not relevant to assets such as loans and advances.

Contractual cash flows are then adjusted for expected credit losses and expectations of customer behaviour based on observed historic data.
The cash flows are then discounted using current market rates for instruments of similar terms and maturity to arrive at an estimate of their fair value.
Certain variable rate loan portfolios are discounted using market rates on similar loans offered by the Group at the valuation date.
b Due to other banks The fair value is determined from a discounted cash flow model using current market rates for instruments of similar terms and maturity.
c Due to customers The fair value of deposits is determined from a discounted cash flow model using current market rates for instruments of similar terms and maturity.
d Debt securities in issue The fair value is taken directly from quoted market prices where available or determined from a discounted cash flow model using current market rates for instruments of similar terms and maturity.
b Fair value of financial instruments recognised on the balance sheet at fair value The following tables provide an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, using the fair value hierarchy described above.

The preferred stock is convertible into Visa Inc. common stock or its equivalent at a future date, subject to potential reduction for certain litigation losses that may be incurred by Visa Europe.
The fair value of the preference shares has been calculated by taking the period end New York Stock Exchange share price for Visa Inc. and discounting for illiquidity and clawback related to contingent litigation.
For other unlisted equity and debt investments, the Groups share of the net asset value or the transaction price respectively are considered the best representation of the exit price and are the Groups best estimates of fair value.

The most significant input impacting the carrying value of the available for sale other asset is the Funds Under Management Attrition rate.
The Group currently assumes an annual 15% attrition rate.
If this rate was 20% the fair value would reduce by 1m: if it was 10% the fair value would increase by 2m.
Other than these significant Level 3 measurements, the Group has a limited remaining exposure to Level 3 fair value measurements, and changing one or more of the inputs for fair value measurements in Level 3 to reasonable alternative assumptions would not change the fair value significantly with respect to profit or loss, total assets, total liabilities or equity on these remaining Level 3 measurements.

3 Capital reorganisation reserve The capital reorganisation reserve of 839m was recognised on the issuance of CYBG PLC ordinary shares in February 2016 in exchange for the acquisition of the entire share capital of the Groups previous parent company, CYBI.
The reserve reflects the difference between the consideration for the issuance of CYBG PLC shares and CYBIs share capital and share premium.
4 Merger reserve A merger reserve of 633m was recognised on the issuance of CYBG PLC ordinary shares in February 2016 in exchange for the acquisition of the entire share capital of CYBI.
The merger reserve reflects the difference between the consideration for the issuance of CYBG PLC shares and the nominal value of the shares issued.
5.1 Asset revaluation reserve The asset revaluation reserve includes the gross revaluation increments and decrements arising from the revaluation of land and buildings.
5.2 Available for sale reserve The available for sale reserve records the gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of available for sale financial assets.
5.3 Cash flow hedge reserve The cash flow hedge reserve represents the cumulative post-tax gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments that will be recycled to the income statement when the hedged items affect profit or loss.
As at 30 September 2018, the cash flow hedge reserve reflected a cumulative loss of 39m 2017: 1m cumulative loss, all of which is in relation to ongoing hedges.
The fair value of derivatives in cash flow hedges decreased by 58m in the year 2017: 84m decrease, and a 3m loss 2017: 4m gain was recycled to interest income in line with hedged items affecting profit or loss.
A 6m loss 2017: 0.3m loss was transferred to non-interest income due to ineffectiveness arising from cash flow hedges.
These movements were offset by a deferred tax credit of 11m 2017: credit of 21m.
5.4 Equity-based compensation reserve The Groups equity based compensation reserve records the value of equity settled share based payment benefits provided to the Groups employees as part of their remuneration that has been charged through the income statement and adjusted for deferred tax.
4.2 Equity based compensation Accounting policy The Group operates a number of equity settled share based compensation plans in respect of services received from certain of its employees.
The fair value of the services received is recognised as an expense.
The total amount to be expensed is measured by reference to the fair value of the Companys shares, performance options or performance rights granted, including, where relevant, any market performance conditions and any non-vesting conditions.
The impacts of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions are not included in the fair value and instead are included in estimating the number of awards or options that are expected to vest.
The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied.
A corresponding credit is recognised in the equity based compensation reserve, adjusted for deferred tax.
In some circumstances employees may provide services in advance of the grant date and therefore the grant date fair value is estimated for the purposes of recognising the expense during the period between the start of the service period and the grant date.
At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimates of the number of shares, performance options and performance rights that are expected to vest based on the non-market and service vesting conditions.
The impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to the equity based compensation reserve.
The equity settled share based payment charge for the year is 9m 2017: 6m.

2 The year in which grants have been made under the relevant plan.
3 Grants made under the DEP are made the year following the financial year to which they relate.
Further detail on each plan is provided below: DEP Under the plan employees were awarded conditional rights to CYBG PLC shares.
The shares are subject to forfeiture conditions including forfeiture as a result of resignation, termination by the Group or failure to meet compliance requirements.
Awards include: The upfront and deferred elements of bonus awards where required to comply with the PRA Remuneration Code or the Groups deferral policy.
Buyout of equity from previous employment for senior new hires.
Demerger awards which are also subject to the achievement of performance conditions over a three-year period.
Details of the performance conditions are set out in the Directors remuneration report.
LTIP Under the plan employees were awarded conditional rights to CYBG PLC shares.
The performance conditions of the plan must be met over a three year period.
The measures reflect a balanced approach between financial and non-financial performance and are aligned to the organisations strategic goals.
Measures, relative weightings and the quantum for assessing performance are outlined in the Directors remuneration report section.
SIP Eligible employees at the date of the award, were awarded Group shares, which are held in the Share Incentive Plan Trust SIP Trust.
Awards are not subject to performance conditions and participants are the beneficial owners of the shares granted to them, but not the registered owners.
Voting rights over the shares are normally exercised by the registered owner at the direction of the participants.
For the 2015 Demerger award, leavers with the exception of gross misconduct retain their awards but they must withdraw their shares from the SIP Trust.
2 Shares withdrawn from SIP Trust on leaving the Group.
Determination of grant date fair values Participants of the DEP and LTIP plans are not entitled to dividends until the awards vest, but the number of shares which vest may be increased to reflect the value of dividends that would have been paid up to the end of the holding period for the awards, subject to the extent permitted under the relevant remuneration regulation.
Accordingly, the grant date fair value of the awards with only service conditions and or non-market performance conditions has been taken as the market value of the Companys ordinary shares at the grant date.
Where awards are subject to non-market performance conditions, an estimate is made of the number of awards expected to vest in order to determine the overall share-based payment charge to be recognised over the vesting period.
The Group has not issued awards under any CYBG plan with market performance conditions.
Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 231 Section 5: Other notes 5.1 Contingent liabilities and commitments Accounting policy Financial guarantees The Group provides guarantees in the normal course of business on behalf of its customers.
Guarantees written are conditional commitments issued by the Group to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party and are primarily issued to support direct financial obligations such as commercial bills or other debt instruments issued by a counterparty.
The rating of the Group as a guarantee provider enhances the marketability of the paper issued by the counterparty in these circumstances.
Financial guarantee contracts are initially recorded at fair value which is equal to the premium received, unless there is evidence to the contrary.
Operating lease commitments The leases entered into by the Group are primarily operating leases: with operating lease rentals charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
The Group discloses its obligations for future minimum payments under non-cancellable leases.
Contingent liabilities Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only by uncertain future events or present obligations where the transfer of economic benefit is uncertain or cannot be reliably measured.
Contingent liabilities are not recognised on the balance sheet but are disclosed unless they are remote.
The table below sets out the amounts of financial guarantees and commitments which are not recorded on the balance sheet.
Financial guarantees and commitments are credit-related instruments which include acceptances, letters of credit, guarantees and commitments to extend credit.
The amounts do not represent the amounts at risk at the balance sheet date but the amounts that would be at risk should the contracts be fully drawn upon and the customer defaults.
Since a significant portion of guarantees and commitments is expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total of the contract amounts is not representative of future liquidity requirements.

The final amount required to settle the Groups potential liabilities for these, and other conduct related matters, is materially uncertain.
Contingent liabilities include those matters where redress is likely to be paid and costs incurred but the amounts cannot currently be estimated.
The Group will continue to reassess the adequacy of provisions for these matters and the assumptions underlying the calculations at each reporting date based upon experience and other relevant factors at that time.
Legal claims The Group is named in and is defending a number of legal claims arising in the ordinary course of business.
No material adverse impact on the financial position of the Group is expected to arise from the ultimate resolution of these legal actions.

Acquisition On 15 October 2018, the Company acquired all the voting rights in Virgin Money by means of a scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the UK Companies Act 2006 for a purchase consideration of 1.6bn.
This comprised the fair value of approximately 541m new CYBG PLC ordinary shares in exchange for all Virgin Money shares at a ratio of 1.2125 CYBG shares for each Virgin Money share.
Following completion, Virgin Money shareholders owned approximately 38% of the Combined Group on a fully diluted basis.
The fair value of the shares issued was calculated using the market price of 286.4 pence per share, on the London Stock Exchange at its close of business on 12 October 2018.
In seeking to address the underlying trends of scale and adaptability within the banking industry, the combination will bring together the two challenger banks to create a national competitor to the large incumbent banks.
The combination will offer retail and SME customers an alternative to the status quo.
Due to the acquisition date of Virgin Money taking place on 15 October 2018, there has been insufficient time to complete the fair value exercise as required by IFRS 3: Business combinations.
Accordingly, the fair value of the net assets acquired and any resultant goodwill to be recognised as a result of the acquisition have not yet been determined.
Following completion, CB PLC subsequently acquired all the voting rights in Virgin Money for a consideration of 1.6bn.
Guaranteed minimum payments GMP equalisation On 26 October 2018 the High Court ruled on a landmark pensions case relating to the defined benefits pension schemes operated by Lloyds Banking Group.
The case dealt with GMP provided by schemes which were contracted-out of the State Earnings-Related Pension Scheme SERPS up until 5 April 1997, with the High Court ruling concluding that the associated benefits were inherently unequal between males and females because of their different state pension retirement ages.
The High Court has confirmed that it is necessary for schemes to equalise benefits, for those pensions accrued between 17 May 1990 and 6 April 1997, to address the inherent inequality of GMP between males and females.
There is no single prescribed solution in order to equalise following this judgment, and it is anticipated that significant discussion and guidance will be required as to the permissible equalisation method to be adopted in any particular case.
The Group is currently assessing the impact of this recent ruling on its defined benefit pension scheme, and will work with its key advisors to ensure compliance with the recent findings as appropriate.
Due to the early stage of this assessment and the complexity involved in such an exercise, it is not possible to quantify the extent of any additional financial obligation at this time.
