2 Summary of significant accounting policies The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all of the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of Hilton Food Group plc have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRS, IFRIC interpretations and theCompanies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis.
The reasons why the Directors consider thisbasis to be appropriate are set out in the Performance and financial review on page 22.
The financial statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand 000 except when otherwise indicated.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in note 4.
Basis of consolidation These consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Hilton Food Group plc the Company, its subsidiaries and its share of profit in joint ventures, together, the Group drawn up to 30 December 2018.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled, either directly or indirectly, by the Company, where control is the power to govern the financial andoperating policies of the entity.
All inter-company balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from inter-group transactions, are eliminated on consolidation.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange.
Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value ofthe Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Joint ventures are all entities which the Group exercises joint control and has an interest in the net assets of that entity.
Investments injoint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Under the equity method, the investment is initially recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the investors share of the profit or loss of theinvestee after the date of acquisition.
The Groups share of post-acquisition profit or loss is recognised in the income statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements inother comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment.

The adoption of the other accounting standard and amendments listed above has not had an impact on amounts recognised inpriorperiods or the current year.
b New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not yet effective, are subject to EUendorsement and not early adopted IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019 IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments 1 January 2019 Amendments to IFRS 9 Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation 1 January 2019 Amendments to IAS 28 Long-Term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures 1 January 2019 Amendments to IAS 19 Plan amendment, curtailment or settlement 1 January 2019 Amendments to IFRS 11 and IFRS 3 Previously held interest in a joint operation 1 January 2019 Amendments to IFRS 12 Income tax consequences of payments on financial instruments classified as equity 1 January 2019 Amendments to IAS 23 Borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation 1 January 2019 IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts 1 January 2021 Amendments to IFRS 3 Definition of a business 1 January 2020 Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 Definition of Material 1 January 2020 Not yet endorsed by the EU IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016.
It will result in almost all leases being recognised on the balance sheet by lessees, as the distinction between operating and finance leases is removed.
Under the new standard, an asset the right to use the leased item anda financial liability to pay rentals are recognised.
The only exceptions are short-term and low-value leases.
The Group has set up a project team which has reviewed all of the Groups leasing arrangements over the last year in light of the new lease accounting rules in IFRS 16.
The standard will affect primarily the accounting for the Groups operating leases.
As at the reporting date, the Group has  lease commitments of 100m, see note 28.
Short term and low value leases will continue to be recognisedona straight line basis as expense in profit or loss.
For the remaining lease commitments the Group expects to  assets and lease liabilities of approximately 94m-98m of which approximately 19m will be classified asacurrent liability.
The Group expects that for the lease portfolio at the date of transition the impact of the introduction of IFRS 16 on the results for the year ended 31 December 2019 will be: to increase depreciation by approximately 19m increase interest by approximately 3m reduce the annualised cost of operating leases charged to profit before tax by approximately 19m Profit before tax is therefore expected to reduce by 2m-3m in the 2019 financial year.
Operating cash flows will increase and financing cash flows decrease by approximately 19m as repayment of the principal portion ofthe lease liabilities will be classified as cash flows from financing activities.
Hilton Food Group plc | Annual report and financial statements 2018 84 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued The Group will apply the standard early for the 2019 accounting period that begins on 31 December 2018.
The Group intends to apply the simplified transition approach and will not restate comparative amounts for the year prior to adopting IFRS 16.
Right-of-use assets for all leases will be measured at the amount of the lease liability on adoption, and adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments relating to those leases and recognised in the balance sheet immediately before the date of initial application.
The Group intends to take advantage of exemptions available in IFRS 16 in relation to low value assets and short term leases.
In assessing the impact of IFRS 16 a number of estimates and judgements have been made, notably in respect of whether arrangements contain leases, the assessment of service compared to lease components within lease payments and in assessing the discount rates used to calculate the present value of lease payments.
There are no other IFRS or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group or Company.
Revenue recognition The Group sources raw materials often in conjunction with its customers.
The raw materials are then processed, packed and delivered to customers.
Revenue is recognised when control of the products has transferred, that is when the products have been delivered to the customers specified location or have been collected by the customer from the Groups facilities.
At that point the customers have obtained all benefits of the products and have full discretion over the channel and price to sell the products, and Hilton has nounfulfilled obligation that could affect the customers acceptance of the products.
Delivery occurs when the products have been shipped to the specific location or have been collected by the customer, the risks of obsolescence and loss have been transferred tothe customer, and either the customer has accepted the products in accordance with the sales contract, the acceptance provisions have lapsed or the Group has objective evidence that all criteria for acceptance have been satisfied.
The products are sold with discounts and rebates which are based on contractual arrangements.
Revenue from these sales is recognised based on the price specified in the contract, net of the estimated discounts or rebate.
Accumulated experience is used toestimate and provide for the discounts and rebates, using the expected value method, and revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur.
A payable is recognised for expected rebates and discounts are deducted from the amount receivable from the customer.
A receivable is recognised when the goods are delivered to the customers specified location or collected by the customer, since this is the point in time that the consideration is unconditional because only the passage of time is required before the payment is due.
Impact of introduction of IFRS 15 Prior year adjustment Following the adoption of IFRS 15 product licenses that had previously been recognised as intangible assets have been reclassified as contract balances and are included within other receivables.
These balances are amortised over the same period as previously butamortisation is now recognised as a reduction in revenue rather than an operating cost.
As a result prior year adjustments has been recognised to reduce both revenue and operating costs for the year ended 31 December 2017 by 2,237,000 with product licenses of 4,691,000 being reclassified to other receivables.
There is no impact on previously reported profit resulting from changes.
Segment reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker.
The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of operating segments, has been identified as the Groups Executive Directors.
Foreign currency translation a Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the Companys functional and the Groups presentation currency.
b Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
Hilton Food Group plc | Annual report and financial statements 2018 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements 85 c Group companies The results and financial position of all the Group entities none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy that have afunctional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet: income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions : and all resulting currency translation differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and disclosed as a separate component of equity in a foreign currency translation reserve.
When a foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold, exchange differences that were recorded in equity are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary or business comprises the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group.
The consideration transferred also includes any contingent consideration arrangement and any pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary measured at their fair values at the acquisition date.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are, with limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
The excess of a the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the b fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised.
All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight line method to allocate the cost of property, plant and equipment to their residual values over their estimated useful economic lives, as follows: Annual rate Leasehold buildings and improvements 4% 14% Plant and machinery 14% 33% Fixtures and fittings 14% 33% Motor vehicles 25% Land is not depreciated.
Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until commissioned.
The residual value and useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
An assets carrying value is written down to its recoverable amount if the assets carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
These impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Following the recognition of an impairment loss, the depreciation charge applicable to the asset is adjusted prospectively in order to systematically allocate the revised carrying amount, net of any residual value, over the remaining useful economic life.
Hilton Food Group plc | Annual report and financial statements 2018 86 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Intangible assets a Goodwill Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries and purchase of non-controlling interests is included in intangible assets, tested annually forimpairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition or purchase over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary or non-controlling interest at the date of acquisition.
b Computer software Acquired software licences are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred toacquire and bring to use the specific software.
These costs are amortised on a straight line basis over their useful economic lives ofthree to seven years.
Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Investments Investments in subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures are carried at cost less provision for impairment.
Impairment of non-financial assets Assets that have an indefinite useful economic life, for example goodwill, are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell, and value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash generating units.
Non-financial assets other than goodwill that have suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
Financial assets a Classification The Group classifies its financial assets as at amortised cost only if both of the following criteria are met: the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash flows: and the contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest.
These items are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They areincluded in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period.
These are classified asnon-current assets.
Such assets include, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents and other financial assets in the balance sheet.
b Recognition and measurement Financial assets are recognised initially at the amount of consideration that is unconditional, unless they contain a significant financing component, in which case they are recognised at fair value.
These assets are held with the objective of collecting the contractual cashflows, and so it measures them subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Financial assets are derecognised when a the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or are settled, or b substantially all the risks and rewards of the ownership of the asset are transferred to another party or c despite having retained some significant risks and rewards of ownership, control of the asset has been transferred to another party who has the practical ability to unilaterally sell the asset to an unrelated third party without imposing additional restrictions.
c Impairment of financial assets The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all financial assets.
Once the expected credit loss has been determined, this is deducted from the carrying value of the asset and recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is either determined on the first in first out basis or by theretail method depending on the subsidiary.
The retail method computes cost on the basis of selling price less the appropriate trading margin.
Cost comprises material costs, direct wages and other direct production costs together with a proportion of production overheads relevant to the stage of completion of work in progress and finished goods and excludes borrowing costs.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less costs to completion and appropriate selling and distribution costs.
Provision is made, where necessary, for slow moving, obsolete and defective inventories.
Hilton Food Group plc | Annual report and financial statements 2018 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements 87 Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business.
If collection is expected in one year or less they are classified as current assets.
If not, they are presented as non-current assets.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at the amount of consideration that is unconditional, unless they contain significant financing components, in which case they are recognised at fair value.
The Group holds the trade receivables with the objective of collecting the contractual cash flows, and so it measures them subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Details about the Groups impairment policies and the calculation of the loss allowance are provided in note 19.
The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit loss which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance forall trade receivables and contract assets.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and short term deposits with an original maturity of three months orless.
Bank overdrafts are shown on the balance sheet within borrowings in current liabilities.
Share capital and reserves Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
The share premium and employee share schemes reserve represents the premium on new shares issued in connection with and thefair value of share options outstanding under the Groups share schemes respectively.
The foreign currency translation reserve represents the cumulative currency differences arising on the translation of the Groups overseas subsidiaries.
The merger and reverse acquisition reserves arose during 2007 following the restructuring of the Group.
Trade and other payables Trade payables represent obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business fromsuppliers.
Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year.
If not, they are presented asnon-current liabilities.
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Borrowings All borrowings are recognised initially at fair value net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost: any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down.
In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs.
To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to an acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised as part of thecost of that asset.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Leases Assets acquired under a lease which transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group, are capitalised as property, plant and equipment at the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments and are depreciated over the shorter of their useful economic lives and their lease term with any impairment being recognised in accumulated depreciation.
Amounts payable under such leases finance leases, net of transaction costs, are classified as current and non-current liabilities based on the lease payment dates.
Lease payments are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements and the interest is charged to the income statement in proportion to the reducing capital element outstanding.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases.
The annual rentals under operating leases are charged to the income statement as incurred on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Hilton Food Group plc | Annual report and financial statements 2018 88 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Current and deferred income tax The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
In this case the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
The current income tax charge represents the expected tax payable or recoverable on the taxable profit for the year using tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
However, the deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that havebeen enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which thetemporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in theforeseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against currenttax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits The Group operates defined contribution schemes for certain employees in the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands, Denmark and Australia and contributes to a state administered money purchase scheme in Poland.
The Group pays contributions to publicly orprivately administered pension insurance plans and has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been made.
The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due.
In the Netherlands and Sweden the Group contributes to industry-wide pension schemes for its employees.
Although having somedefined benefit features, the Groups liability to these schemes is limited to the fixed contributions which are recognised asanexpense when they are due.
Accordingly the Group has accounted for these schemes as defined contribution schemes.
Share-based payments The Group operates a number of equity settled share-based compensation plans.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of options is recognised as an expense with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The total amount to beexpensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of anynon-market vesting conditions.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest.
At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on non-market vesting conditions.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
All adjustments to equity are recognised as a separate component of equity in an employee share scheme reserve.
When the options are exercised, the Company issues new shares.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium.
Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the consolidated financial statements in the period inwhich the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Hilton Food Group plc | Annual report and financial statements 2018 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements 89 3 Financial risk management Financial risk factors The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including price risk, foreign exchange risk and cash flow interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group by monitoring the foregoing risks.
a Market risk i Price risk The Group is not exposed to equity securities price risk as it holds no listed or other equity investments.
The Group is exposed to commodity price risk which is significantly mitigated through its customer agreements which are on a cost plus or agreed packing rate basis.
ii Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk in the normal course of business in its overseas operations, principally on transactions in Euros, Swedish Krona, Danish Krone, Polish Zloty and Australian Dollar, although such risk is mitigated as natural hedges exist ineach operation through matching local currency cash flows.
The Group regularly monitors foreign exchange exposure and to date has deemed it notappropriate to hedge its foreign exchange position.
iii Cash flow interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk arises from long term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The Group seeks to manage exposure to interest rate risk through interest rate caps over the majority of its long term borrowings.

The Group, whose only customers comprise blue chip international supermarket retailers, has implemented policies that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales are made and in relation to its banking partners.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is 253.1m 2017: 212.5m as stated in note 31. c Liquidity risk The Group monitors regular cash forecasts to ensure that it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs whilst maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities and without breaching its banking covenants.
The Group held significant cash and cash equivalents of 80.2m 2017: 70.9m and maintains a mix of long term and short term debt finance.
The Groups financial liabilities measured as the contractual undiscounted cash flows mature as follows: 2018 2017 Finance Trade and Finance Trade and other payables Borrowings leases other payables Borrowings leases 000 000 000 000 000 000 Less than one year 7,228 345 268,037 8,328 340 205,045 Between one and two years 16,078 345 6,996 340 Between two and five years 92,127 1,036 40,913 1,019 Over five years 258 679 Hilton Food Group plc | Annual report and financial statements 2018 90 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 3 Financial risk management continued Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital toshareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of a gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by EBITDA.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings including current and non-current borrowings as shown on the consolidated balance sheet less cash and cash equivalents.
EBITDA is calculated as operating profit before significant interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.
The gearing of the company was 37.9% as at the year end 2017: nil.
Fair value estimation The carrying value of trade receivables less impairment provisions and trade payables are assumed to approximate their fair values.
The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial instruments.
The Directors consider that there is a single level offair value measurement hierarchy for disclosure purposes.
4 Critical accounting estimates and judgements Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Long term supply contracts Some of Hiltons long term supply contracts are on a cost plus basis.
IFRIC 4 requires that such arrangements are reviewed to determine whether they contain a lease.
These cost plus agreements typically contain benchmarking clauses which allow our customers to obtain competitive pricing or to source its supply from a competitor.
Additionally product inputs and packaging are traded in active markets which are monitored by our customers and furthermore product selling prices are updated on a frequent basisthereby resulting in pricing that is, in substance, a market price.
On this basis the criteria in IFRIC 4 for determining whether these agreements contain a lease are not met.
Revenue recognition In July 2018 the Group took operational control of the joint venture facilities operated in Australia.
The joint venture continues to earn a processing fee based on the volume of retail packed meat delivered to stores.
The cost of production of this meat, other raw materials, indirect and direct overheads, are incurred by the Group and then recharged to the customer.
The assessment of whether the Group should recognise the costs and related recharges on a net basis or gross basis, with revenue and equal costs recognised separately, has required the exercise of significant judgement.
The joint venture board continues to have oversight of the operations and activities of these facilities and therefore, although the Group maintains day-to-day operational control, it does not have full control of them.
Equally, although the Group recognises its share of the joint ventures profits arising from receipt of the processing fee using equity accounting, it does not directly receive reward for the retail packing operations at these facilities.
Taking these key factors into account the Group has concluded that whilst the joint venture structure remains in place it is appropriate for the costs associated withretail packed meat production at the joint venture facilities and their subsequent recharge to be recognised on a net basis.
Goodwill impairment Goodwill is reviewed for impairment on at least an annual basis.
Details of the tests and carrying value of the assets are shown in note15.
An impairment review requires an estimation of the value-in-use of the cash generating units to which the goodwill is allocated.
Value-in-use calculations require assumptions to be made regarding the expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit andchoice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
If the actualcash flows are lower than estimated, future impairments may be necessary.
During 2018 and 2017 there were no critical other accounting estimates or judgements in relation to the application of the Groups accounting policies.
Hilton Food Group plc | Annual report and financial statements 2018 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements 91 5 Segment information Management have determined the operating segments based on the reports reviewed by the Executive Directors that are used to make strategic decisions.
The Executive Directors have considered the business from both a geographic and product perspective.
From a geographic perspective, the Executive Directors consider that the Group has eight operating segments: i United Kingdom: ii Netherlands: iii Republic of Ireland: iv Sweden: v Denmark: vi Central Europe including Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia: vii Portugal and viii Central costs and other including Australia Hilton Food Australia Pty Ltd and the share of profit from the joint venture.
The United Kingdom, Netherlands, Republic of Ireland, Sweden, Denmark and Portugal have been aggregated into one reportable segment Western Europe as they have similar economic characteristics as identified in IFRS 8.
Central Europe and Central costs and other comprise the other reportable segments.
From a product perspective the Executive Directors consider that the Group has only one identifiable product, wholesaling of food protein products including meat and fish.
The Executive Directors consider that no further segmentation is appropriate, as all of theGroups operations are subject to similar risks and returns and exhibit similar long term financial performance.
Revenue from external customers reported to the Executive Directors ismeasured in a manner consistent with that in the income statement.

12 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to owners of the parent by the weighted average number ofordinary shares in issue during the year.
Diluted earnings per share are calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Company has share options for which a calculation is done to determine thenumber of shares that could have been acquired at fair value determined as the average annual market share price of the Companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share options.
The number of shares calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise oftheshare options.

Goodwill Impairment Testing Goodwill recognised by the Group relates entirely to the acquisition of the Seachill business in 2017.
The recoverable amount of the Seachill cash generating unit was determined on a value-in-use basis, using cash flow projections based on one-year budgets approved by the board and longer term financial projections, and exceeded the carrying amount.
The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are projected EBITDA, the pre-tax discount rate and the growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the projected period.
EBITDA is based on past experience adjusted to take account of the impact of expected changes to sales prices, volumes, business mix and margin.
Cash flows are discounted at 10% and a growth rate of 2% has been used to extrapolate cash flows.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions The calculation is most sensitive to changes in the assumptions used for projected cash flow, the pre-tax discount rate and the growthrate.
Management considers that reasonably possible changes in assumptions would be an increase in discount rate of onepercentage point, a reduction in growth rate of one percentage point or a 10% reduction in budgeted cash flow.
As an indication ofsensitivity, when applied to the value-in-use calculation neither a 1% reduction in growth rate, a 10% reduction in budgeted cashflow, nor a 1% increase in the discount rate would have resulted in an impairment of goodwill in the year.
No indicators of impairment were identified in respect of other, amortised, intangible assets and therefore no impairment review hasbeen undertaken.

The values of other currentassets and liabilities have been adjusted to amounts to be realised or paid respectively.
Brand intangibles have been recognised primarily relating to its Saucy Fish Co brand for which trademarks have been secured over a wide geographic area.
The brand is sold by our retailer customers and is also directly marketed to consumers.
Brand recognition is one of the key drivers of success in this market.
Customer relationship intangibles have been recognised which relate to the supply agreements that the business has in place with its customers.
The fair values of brand and customer relationship intangibles of 21.9m have been aggregated as it is considered that they are inextricably linked with their value each dependent on the other.
These intangibles are being amortised over a useful economic life of 9-10 years.
Trade and other receivables acquired included trade receivables all of which are expected to be collected and therefore the fair value recognised is 11.9m.

In determining the expected credit loss, the Group has given due consideration to the historic credit losses arising in prior years and ofcurrent and forward looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables.
To measure the expected credit loss, trade receivables and contract assets have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due.
The Group has concluded that the expected credit loss results in a provision being recognised of349,000 2017: 402,000.
Trade receivables and contract assets are written off where there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.
Impairment losses on trade receivables and contract assets are presented as net impairment losses within operating profit.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the same line item.
Due to the nature of the receivables and contract assets held by the Group, there has been no material difference in the provision recognised under IFRS 9 when compared to the Groups previous policy under IAS 39.
