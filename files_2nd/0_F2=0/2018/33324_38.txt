Impairment tests for goodwill and brands For impairment testing, goodwill and brands are allocated to the cash-generating unit CGU representing the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
The aggregate carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to each CGU are: Customer Goodwill Brands relationships Total At 27 January 2018 m m m m Rubicon operating unit 21.0 43.0 0.2 64.2 Funkin operating unit 15.7 6.8 0.2 22.7 Strathmore operating unit 1.9 7.0 8.9 Total 38.6 56.8 0.4 95.8 Customer Goodwill Brands relationships Total At 28 January 2017 m m m m Rubicon operating unit 21.0 43.0 0.4 64.4 Funkin operating unit 15.7 6.8 0.3 22.8 Strathmore operating unit 1.9 7.0 8.9 Total 38.6 56.8 0.7 96.1 108 A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Accounts The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value in use calculations.
These calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management which cover a three year period.
Cash flows beyond the three years are extrapolated using the growth rates and other key assumptions as stated below: Key assumptions 2018 2017 Gross margin Growth rate Discount rate Gross margin Growth rate Discount rate % % % % % % Rubicon operating unit 39.1 2.3 11.1 30.2 2.3 12.3 Funkin operating unit 51.6 2.3 11.1 48.5 2.3 12.3 Strathmore operating unit 30.7 2.3 11.1 37.3 2.3 12.3 The budgeted gross margin is based on past performance and managements expectation of market development.
The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports.
The discount rate used in the prior year was the post-tax rate.
Disclosed above for both years presented is the pre-tax rate.
This is consistent with the cash flows applied.
The discount rate reflects managements estimate of pre-tax cost of capital adjusted for the specific risks impacting on each operating unit.
The estimated pre-tax cost of capital is a market participant benchmark provided by an independent third party to the Group.
Advertising and promotional costs are included in the analysis, using latest annual budgets for the year to 26 January 2019 and projected costs thereafter.
Sensitivity analysis was carried out on the above calculations to review possible levels of impairment after adjusting discount rates.
At a pre-tax rate of 15%, none of the CGUs were impaired.
Whilst cash flow projections used within the impairment reviews are subject to inherent uncertainty, changes within reason to the key assumptions applied in assessing the value in use calculation would not result in a change in the impairment conclusions reached.
