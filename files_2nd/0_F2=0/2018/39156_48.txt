Taxation continued The Group continues to believe that it has made adequate provision for the liabilities likely to arise from periods that are open and not yet agreed by tax authorities.
The ultimate liability for such matters may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of agreements with relevant tax authorities.
In assessing these income tax uncertainties, management is required to make judgements in the determination of the unit of account, the evaluation of the circumstances, facts and other relevant information in respect of the tax position taken together with estimates of amounts that may be required to be paid in ultimate settlement with the tax authorities.

Original estimates are always refined as additional information becomes known.
