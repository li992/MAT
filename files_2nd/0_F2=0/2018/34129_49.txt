TAXATION The Group converted to a REIT in January 2007.
As a result the Group does not pay UK corporation tax on the profits and gains from its qualifying rental business in the UK provided that it meets certain conditions.
Non-qualifying profits and gains of the Group are subject to corporation tax as normal.
The Group monitors its compliance with the REIT conditions.
There have been no breaches of the conditions to date.
2 Bill 2015 provides that the rate of corporation tax for the 2017 Financial Year commencing 1 April 2017 would be 19% and that the rate from 1 April 2020 will be 18%.
At Budget 2016, the government announced a further reduction to the Corporation Tax main rate for all profits except ring fence profits for the year starting 1 April 2020, setting the rate at 17%.
This rate was incorporated in Finance Act 2016 which was fully enacted on 15 September 2016.
