B1.2 Short-term fluctuations in investment returns on shareholder-backed business 2018 m 2017 m note i Asia operations 512 1 note ii US operations 100 1,568 note iii UK and Europe operations 34 14 note iv Other operations 20 20 Total 558 1,563 Notes i Asia operations In Asia, the negative short-term fluctuations of 512 million 2017: negative 1 million principally reflect net value movements on assets and related liabilities following increases in bond yields and falls in equity markets during the year, especially in those countries where policyholder liabilities use a valuation interest rate which does not reflect all movements in interest rates in the period.
ii US operations The short-term fluctuations in investment returns for US insurance operations are reported net of the related charge for amortisation of deferred acquisition costs of 114 million as shown in note C5.2 a 2017: credit of 462 million and comprise amounts in respect of the following items: 2018 m 2017 m note a Net equity hedge result 58 1,490 note b Other than equity-related derivatives 64 36 note c Debt securities 31 73 Equity-type investments: actual less longer-term return 38 12 Other items 15 19 Total 100 1,568 Notes a Net equity hedge result The net equity hedge result relates to the accounting effect of market movements on both the value of guarantees in Jacksons variable annuity and fixed index annuity products and on the related derivatives used to manage the exposures inherent in these guarantees.
The level of fees recognised in non-operating profit is determined by reference to that allowed for within the reserving basis.
The variable annuity guarantees are valued in accordance with either Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures formerly FAS 157 or ASC Topic 944, Financial Services Insurance formerly SOP 03-01 depending on the type of guarantee.
Both approaches require an entity to determine the total fee the fee assessment that is expected to fund future projected benefit payments arising using the assumptions applicable for that method.
The method under FAS 157 requires this fee assessment to be fixed at the time of issue.
As the fees included within the initial fee assessment are earned, they are included in non-operating profit to match the corresponding movement in the guarantee liability.
As the Group applies US GAAP for the measured value of the product guarantees this item also includes asymmetric impacts where the measurement bases of the liabilities and associated derivatives used to manage the Jackson annuity business differ as described in note B1.3 c below.
The net equity hedge result therefore includes significant accounting mismatches and other factors that do not represent the economic result.
These other factors include: The variable annuity guarantees and fixed index annuity embedded options being only partially fair valued under grandfathered US GAAP as described in note B1.3 c : The interest rate exposure being managed through the other than equity-related derivative programme explained in note b below: and Jacksons management of its economic exposures for a number of other factors that are treated differently in the accounting frameworks such as future fees and assumed volatility levels.

co. uk 01 Groupoverview 02 Strategicreport 03 Governance 04  05 Financialstatements 06  EEV basisresults 07  The net equity hedge result net of related DAC amortisation in accordance with the policy that DAC is amortised in line with emergence of margins can be summarised as follows: 2018 m 2017 m Fair value movements on equity hedge instruments 299 1,871 Accounting value movements on the variable and fixed index annuity guarantee liabilities 894 99 Fee assessments net of claim payments 537 480 Total 58 1,490 Held to manage equity exposures of the variable annuity guarantees and fixed index annuity options.
The accounting value movements on the variable and fixed index annuity guarantee liabilities reflect the impact of market movements and changes in economic and actuarial assumptions.
Actuarial assumptions include consideration of persistency, mortality and the expected utilisation of certain features attaching to variable annuity contracts.
Assumptions are updated annually via a comparison to experience and after applying expert judgement for how experience may change in the future.
Routine updates in 2018 reduced profit before tax after allowing related changed to DAC amortisation by 143 million 2017: 382 million.
b Other than equity-related derivatives The fluctuations for this item comprise the net effect of: Fair value movements on free-standing, other than equity-related derivatives: Fair value movements on the Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit GMIB reinsurance asset that are not matched by movements in the underlying GMIB liability, which is not fair valued as explained in note B1.3: and Related amortisation of DAC.
The free-standing, other than equity-related derivatives are held to manage interest rate exposures and durations within the general account and the variable annuity guarantees and fixed index annuity embedded options described in note a above.
Accounting mismatches arise because of differences between the measurement basis and presentation of the derivatives, which are fair valued with movements recorded in the income statement, and the exposures they are intended to manage.

Realised gains and losses are recorded in the income statement with normalised returns included in adjusted IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns with variations from year to year included in the short-term fluctuations category.
The risk margin reserve charge for longer-term credit-related losses included in adjusted IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns of Jackson for 2018 is based on an average annual risk margin reserve of 18 basis points 2017: 21 basis points on average book values of US$57.1 billion 2017: US$55.3 billion as shown below: 2018 2017 Average Average book Annual book Annual value RMR expected loss value RMR expected loss Moodys rating category or equivalent under NAIC ratings of mortgage-backed securities US$m % US$m m US$m % US$m m A3 or higher 29,982 0.10 31 23 27,277 0.12 33 25 Baa1, 2 or 3 25,814 0.21 55 40 26,626 0.22 58 45 Ba1, 2 or 3 1,042 0.98 10 8 1,046 1.03 11 8 B1, 2 or 3 289 2.64 8 6 318 2.70 9 7 Below B3 11 3.69 23 3.78 1 1 Total 57,138 0.18 104 77 55,290 0.21 112 86 Related amortisation of deferred acquisition 22 15 21 15 costs see below Risk margin reserve charge to adjusted IFRS operating profit for longer-term credit- 82 62 91 71 related losses Consistent with the basis of measurement of insurance assets and liabilities for Jacksons IFRS results, the charges and credits to adjusted IFRS operating profits based on longer-term investment returns are partially offset by related amortisation of deferred acquisition costs.
In addition to the accounting for realised gains and losses described above for Jackson general account debt securities, included within the statement of other c omprehensive income is a pre-tax charge of 1,371 million for net unrealised losses on debt securities classified as available-for-sale net of related amortisation of deferred acquisition costs 2017: credit of 541 million.
Temporary market value movements do not reflect defaults or impairments.
Additional details of the movement in the value of the Jackson portfolio are included in note C3.2 b. iii UK and Europe operations The positive short-term fluctuations in investment returns for the UK and Europe operations of 34 million 2017: negative 14 million mainly arises from unrealised gains on equity options held to hedge the value of future shareholder transfers from the with-profits fund partially offset by losses on corporate bonds backing capital to support the remaining annuity business, given the increase in interest rates and credit spreads in 2018. iv Other operations The positive short-term fluctuations in investment returns for other operations of 20 million 2017: positive 20 million include unrealised value movements on financial instruments held outside of the main life operations.
co. uk Annual Report 2018 Prudential plc 195 B Earnings performance continued B1 Analysis of performance by segment continued B1.3 Determining operating segments and performance measure of operating segments Operating segments The Groups operating segments for financial reporting are defined and presented in accordance with IFRS 8, Operating Segments, on the basis of the management reporting structure and its financial management information.
Under the Groups management and reporting structure its chief operating decision maker is the Group Executive Committee GEC.
In the management structure, responsibility is delegated to the Chief Executive Officers of Prudential Corporation Asia, the North American Business Unit and M&GPrudential for the day-to-day management of their business units within the framework set out in the Group Governance Manual.
Financial management information used by the GEC aligns with these three business segments.
These operating segments derive revenue from both long-term insurance and asset management activities.
Operations which do not form part of any business unit are reported as Unallocated to a segment.
These include Group Head Office and Asia Regional Head Office costs.
Prudential Capital and Africa operations do not form part of any operating segment under the structure, and their assets and liabilities and profit or loss before tax are not material to the overall financial position of the Group.
Prudential Capital and Africa operations are therefore reported as Unallocated to a segment.
Performance measure The performance measure of operating segments utilised by the Company is adjusted IFRS operating profit attributable to shareholders based on longer-term investment returns, as described below.
This measurement basis distinguishes adjusted IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns from other constituents of the total profit as follows: Short-term fluctuations in investment returns on shareholder-backed business.
This includes the impact of short-term market effects on the carrying value of Jacksons guarantee liabilities and related derivatives as explained below: Amortisation of acquisition accounting adjustments arising on the purchase of business.
This comprises principally the charge for the adjustments arising on the purchase of REALIC in 2012: and Gain or loss on corporate transactions, such as disposals undertaken in the year.
Determination of adjusted IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns for investment and liability movements: a Generalprinciples i UK-style with-profits business The adjusted IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns reflects the statutory transfer gross of attributable tax.
Value movements in the underlying assets of the with-profits funds do not affect directly the determination of adjusted IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns.
ii Unit-linked business The policyholder unit liabilities are directly reflective of the underlying asset value movements.
Accordingly, the adjusted IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns reflect the current period value movements in both the unit liabilities and the backing assets.
iii US variable annuity and fixed index annuity business This business has guarantee liabilities which are measured on a combination of fair value and other US GAAP derived principles.
These liabilities are subject to an extensive derivative programme to manage equity and interest rate exposures whose fair value movements pass through the income statement each period.
The principles for determination of the adjusted IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns and short-term fluctuations are as discussed in section c below.
iv Business where policyholder liabilities are sensitive to market conditions Under IFRS, the degree to which the carrying values of liabilities to policyholders are sensitive to current market conditions varies between business units depending upon the nature of the grandfathered measurement basis.
In general, in those instances where the liabilities are particularly sensitive to routine changes in market conditions, the accounting basis is such that the impact of market movements on the assets and liabilities is broadly equivalent in the income statement, and adjusted IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns is not distorted.
In these circumstances, there is no need for the movement in the liability to be bifurcated between the elements that relate to longer-term market conditions and short-term effects.
However, movements in liabilities for some types of business do require bifurcation to ensure that at the net level ie after allocated investment return and charge for policyholder benefits the adjusted IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns reflects longer-term market returns.
Examples of where such bifurcation is necessary are in Hong Kong and for UK shareholder-backed annuity business, as explained in sections b i and d i, respectively.
For other types of Asias non-participating business, expected longer-term investment returns are used to determine the movement in policyholder liabilities for determining adjusted IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns.
196 Prudential plc Annual Report 2018 www.
co. uk 01 Groupoverview 02 Strategicreport 03 Governance 04  05 Financialstatements 06  EEV basisresults 07  v Other shareholder-financed business For long-term insurance business, where assets and liabilities are held for the long term, the accounting basis for insurance liabilities under current IFRS can lead to profits that include the effects of short-term fluctuations in market conditions, which may not be representative of trends in underlying performance.
Therefore, the following key elements are applied to the results of the Groups shareholder-financed businesses to determine adjusted IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns.
Except in the case of assets backing liabilities which are directly matched such as unit-linked business or closely correlated with value movements as discussed below adjusted IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns for shareholder-financed business is determined on the basis of expected longer-term investment returns.
Longer-term investment returns comprise actual income receivable for the period interest dividend income and for both debt and equity-type securities longer-term capital returns.
Debt securities and loans In principle, for debt securities and loans, the longer-term capital returns comprise two elements: Risk margin reserve based charge for the expected level of defaults for the period, which is determined by reference to the credit quality of the portfolio.
The difference between impairment losses in the reporting period and the risk margin reserve charge to the adjusted IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns is reflected in short-term fluctuations in investment returns: and The amortisation of interest-related realised gains and losses to adjusted IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns to the date when sold bonds would have otherwise matured.
At 31 December 2018, the level of unamortised interest-related realised gains and losses related to previously sold bonds for the Group was a net gain of 629 million 2017: 855 million.
Equity-type securities For equity-type securities, the longer-term rates of return are estimates of the long-term trend investment returns for income and capital having regard to past performance, current trends and future expectations.
Equity-type securities held for shareholder-financed businesses other than the UK annuity business, unit-linked and US variable annuity separate accounts are principally relevant for the US and Asia insurance operations.
Different rates apply to different categories of equity-type securities.
Derivative value movements Generally, derivative value movements are excluded from adjusted IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns.
The exception is where the derivative value movements broadly offset changes in the accounting value of other assets and liabilities included in adjusted IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns.
The principal example of derivatives whose value movements are excluded from adjusted IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns arises in Jackson, as discussed below in section c. b  i Business where policyholder liabilities are sensitive to market conditions For certain Asia non-participating business, for example in Hong Kong, the economic features are more akin to asset management products with policyholder liabilities reflecting asset shares over the contract term.
Consequently, for these products, the charge for policyholder benefits in the adjusted IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns reflects the asset share feature rather than volatile movements that would otherwise be reflected if the local regulatory basis also applied for IFRS basis was used.
For certain other types of non-participating business expected longer-term investment returns are used to determine the movement in policyholder liabilities for determining adjusted IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns.
ii Other Asia shareholder-financed business Debt securities For this business, the realised gains and losses are principally interest related.
Accordingly, all realised gains and losses to date for these operations are amortised over the period to the date those securities would otherwise have matured, with no explicit risk margin reserve charge.
Equity-type securities For Asia insurance operations, investments in equity securities held for non-linked shareholder-backed business amounted to 2,146 million as at 31 December 2018 31 December 2017: 1,759 million.
The rates of return applied in 2018 ranged from 5.3 per cent to 17.6 per cent 2017: 4.3 per cent to 17.2 per cent with the rates applied varying by business unit.
These rates are broadly stable from period to period but may be different between countries reflecting, for example, differing expectations of inflation in each business unit.
The assumptions are for the returns expected to apply in equilibrium conditions.
The assumed rates of return do not reflect any cyclical variability in economic performance and are not set by reference to prevailing asset valuations.
The longer-term investment returns for the Asia insurance joint ventures accounted for using the equity method are determined on a similar basis as the other Asia insurance operations described above.
co. uk Annual Report 2018 Prudential plc 197 B Earnings performance continued B1 Analysis of performance by segment continued B1.3 Determining operating segments and performance measure of operating segments continued c  i Separate account business For such business the policyholder unit liabilities are directly reflective of the asset value movements.
Accordingly, the adjusted IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns reflect the current period value movements in unit liabilities and the backing assets.
ii US variable and fixed index annuity business The following value movements for Jacksons variable and fixed index annuity business are excluded from adjusted IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns.
See note B1.2 note ii : Fair value movements for equity-based derivatives: Fair value movements for guaranteed benefit options for the not for life portion of Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit GMWB and fixed index annuity business, and Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit GMIB reinsurance see below : Movements in the accounts carrying value of Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit GMDB, GMIB and the for life portion of GMWB liabilities, see below for which, under the grandfathered US GAAP applied under IFRS for Jacksons insurance assets and liabilities, the measurement basis gives rise to a muted impact of current period market movements ie they are relatively insensitive to the effect of current period equity market and interest rate changes : A portion of the fee assessments as well as claim payments, in respect of guarantee liabilities: and Related amortisation of deferred acquisition costs for each of the above items.
Guaranteed benefit options for the not for life portion of GMWB and equity index options for the fixed index annuity business The not for life portion of GMWB guaranteed benefit option liabilities is measured under the US GAAP basis applied for IFRS in a manner consistent with IAS 39 under which the projected future growth rate of the account balance is based on current swap rates rather than expected rates of return with only a portion of the expected future guarantee fees included.
Reserve value movements on these liabilities are sensitive to changes to levels of equity markets, implied volatility and interest rates.
The equity index option for fixed index annuity business is measured under the US GAAP basis applied for IFRS in a manner consistent with IAS 39 under which the projected future growth is based on current swap rates.
Guaranteed benefit option for variable annuity guarantee minimum income benefit The GMIB liability, which is substantially reinsured, subject to a deductible and annual claim limits, is accounted for using grandfathered US GAAP.
This accounting basis substantially does not recognise the effects of market movements.
The corresponding reinsurance asset is measured under the grandfathered US GAAP basis applied for IFRS in a manner consistent with IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, and the asset is therefore recognised at fair value.
As the GMIB is economically reinsured, the mark to market element of the reinsurance asset is included as a component of short-term fluctuations in investment returns.
iii Other derivative value movements The principal example of non-equity based derivatives for example, interest rate swaps and swaptions whose value movements are excluded from adjusted IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns, arises in Jackson.
Non-equity based derivatives are primarily held by Jackson as part of a broadly-based hedging programme for features of Jacksons bond portfolio for which value movements are booked in the statement of other comprehensive income rather than the income statement, product liabilities for which US GAAP accounting as grandfathered under IFRS 4 does not fully reflect the economic features being hedged, and the interest rate exposure attaching to equity-based product options.
198 Prudential plc Annual Report 2018 www.
co. uk 01 Groupoverview 02 Strategicreport 03 Governance 04  05 Financialstatements 06  EEV basisresults 07  iv Other US shareholder-financed business Debt securities The distinction between impairment losses and interest-related realised gains and losses is of particular relevance to Jackson.
Jackson has used the ratings by Nationally Recognised Statistical Ratings Organisations NRSRO or ratings resulting from the regulatory ratings detail issued by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC to determine the average annual risk margin reserve to apply to debt securities held to back general account business.
Debt securities held to back separate account and reinsurance funds withheld are not subject to risk margin reserve charge.
Further details of the risk margin reserve charge, as well as the amortisation of interest-related realised gains and losses, for Jackson are shown in note B1.2 note ii c. Equity-type securities As at 31 December 2018, the equity-type securities for US insurance non-separate account operations amounted to 1,359 million 31 December 2017: 946 million.
For these operations, the longer-term rates of return for income and capital applied in the years indicated, which reflect the combination of the average risk-free rates over the year and appropriate risk premiums are as follows: 2018 2017 Equity-type securities such as common and preferred stock and portfolio holdings in mutual funds 6.7% to 7.2% 6.1% to 6.5% Other equity-type securities such as investments in limited partnerships and private equity funds 8.7% to 9.2% 8.1% to 8.5% d  i Shareholder-backed annuity business For this business, policyholder liabilities are determined by reference to current interest rates.
The value movements of the assets covering liabilities are closely correlated with the related change in liabilities.
Accordingly, asset value movements are recorded within the adjusted IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns.
Policyholder liabilities include a margin for credit risk.
Variations between actual and best estimate expected impairments are recorded as a component of short-term fluctuations in investment returns.
The adjusted IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns reflects the impact of value movements on policyholder liabilities for shareholder-backed annuity business within The Prudential Assurance Company Limited PAC after adjustments to allocate the following elements of the movement to the category of short-term fluctuations in investment returns: The impact on credit risk provisioning of actual upgrades and downgrades during the period: Credit experience compared with assumptions: and Short-term value movements on assets backing the capital of the business.
Credit experience reflects the impact of defaults and other similar experience, such as asset exchanges arising from debt restructuring by issuers that include effectively an element of permanent impairment of the security held.
Positive or negative experience compared with assumptions is included within short-term fluctuations in investment returns without further adjustment.
The effects of other changes to credit risk provisioning are included in the adjusted IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns, as is the net effect of changes to the valuation rate of interest due to portfolio rebalancing to align more closely with management benchmark.
ii Non-linked shareholder-financed business For debt securities backing non-linked shareholder-financed business of the UK and Europe insurance operations other than the annuity business the realised gains and losses are principally interest related.
Accordingly, all realised gains and losses to date for these operations are being amortised over the period to the date those securities would otherwise have matured, with no explicit risk margin reserve charge.
e  For these businesses, the particular features applicable for life assurance noted above do not apply and therefore the adjusted IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns is not determined on the basis described above.
Instead, realised gains and losses are generally included in adjusted IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns with temporary unrealised gains and losses being included in short-term fluctuations.
