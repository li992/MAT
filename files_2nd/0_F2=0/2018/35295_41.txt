120 DIAGEO ANNUAL REPORT 2018 Financial statements of the group: Operating assets and liabilities This section describes the assets used to generate the groups Operating performance and the liabilities incurred.
Liabilities relating to the groups financing activities are included in section Risk management and assets and capital structure and balance sheet information in respect of associates, joint ventures and taxation are covered in section Results for the year.
liabilities This section also provides detailed disclosures on the groups recent acquisitions and disposals, performance and financial position of its Introduction defined benefit post employment plans.
Acquisition and sale of businesses and purchase of non-controlling interests Accounting policies The consolidated financial statements include the results of the company and its subsidiaries together with the groups attributable share of the results of associates and joint ventures.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold are included in the income statement from, or up to, the date that control passes.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
Identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired are measured at fair value at acquisition date.
The consideration payable is measured at fair value and includes the fair value of any contingent consideration.
On the acquisition of a business, or of an interest in an associate or joint venture, fair values, reflecting conditions at the date of acquisition, are attributed to the net assets including identifiable intangible assets and contingent liabilities acquired.
Directly attributable acquisition costs in respect of subsidiary companies acquired are recognised in other external charges as incurred.
The non-controlling interests on the date of acquisition can be measured either at the fair value or at the non-controlling shareholders proportion of the net fair value of the identifiable assets assumed.
This choice is made separately for each acquisition.
Where the group has issued a put option over shares held by a non-controlling interest, the group derecognises the non-controlling interests and instead recognises a contingent deferred consideration liability for the estimated amount likely to be paid to the non-controlling interest on the exercise of those options.
Movements in the estimated liability in respect of put options are recognised in retained earnings.
Transactions with non-controlling interests are recorded directly in retained earnings.
For all entities in which the company, directly or indirectly, owns equity a judgement is made to determine whether the investor controls the investee and therefore should fully consolidate the investee.
An assessment is carried out to determine whether the group has the exposure or rights to the variable returns of the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
To establish control an analysis is carried out of the substantive and protective rights that the group and the other investors hold.
This assessment is dependent on the activities and purpose of the investee and the rights of the other shareholders, such as which party controls the board, executive committee and material policies of the investee.
Determining whether the rights that the group holds are substantive requires management judgement.
Where less than 50% of the equity of an investee is held, and the group holds significantly more voting rights than any other vote holder or organised group of vote holders this may be an indicator of fide facto control.
An assessment is needed to determine all the factors relevant to the relationship with the investee to ascertain whether control has been established and whether the investee should be consolidated as a subsidiary.
Where voting power and returns from an investment are split equally between two entities then the arrangement is accounted for as a joint venture.
On an acquisition fair values are attributed to the assets and liabilities acquired.
This may involve material judgement to determine these values.

Casamigos contributed 55 million to sales, 49 million to net sales, 4 million to operating profit net of transaction costs of 4 million and 3 million profit after tax in the year ended 30 June 2018.
It is expected that the goodwill will be deductible for tax purposes.
The net present value of the contingent consideration payable was $221 million 172 million at the date of acquisition and is expected to be paid in tranches over the next ten years.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of Casamigos represents expected revenue and cost synergies and the acquired workforce.
Other On 14 March 2018 Diageo completed the acquisition of Belsazar GmbH, a premium aperitif from Germanys Black Forest.
On 2 May 2018 Diageo acquired 100% of the intellectual property of Pierde Almas, an ultra premium mezcal.

Intangible assets Accounting policies Acquired intangible assets are held on the consolidated balance sheet at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Acquired brands and other intangible assets are initially recognised at fair value when they are controlled through contractual or other legal rights, or are separable from the rest of the business, and the fair value can be reliably measured.
Where these assets are regarded as having indefinite useful economic lives, they are not amortised.
Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the value of any non-controlling interests and the fair value of any previously held equity interest in the subsidiary acquired over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 July 1998 was eliminated against reserves, and this goodwill has not been reinstated.
Goodwill arising subsequent to 1 July 1998 has been capitalised.
Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets is based on their useful economic lives and are amortised on a straight-line basis over those lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Goodwill and intangible assets that are regarded as having indefinite useful economic lives are not amortised and are reviewed for impairment at least annually or when there is an indication that the assets may be impaired.
Impairment reviews compare the net carrying value with the recoverable amount where recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less cost to sell and value in use.
Amortisation and any impairment write downs are charged to other operating expenses in the income statement.
Computer software is amortised on a straight-line basis to estimated residual value over its expected useful life.
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed each year.
Subject to these reviews, the estimated useful lives are up to eight years.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements Assessment of the recoverable amount of an intangible asset, the useful economic life of an asset, or that an asset has an indefinite life, requires management judgement.
Impairment reviews are carried out to ensure that intangible assets, including brands, are not carried at above their recoverable amounts.
The tests are dependent on managements estimates in respect of the forecasting of future cash flows.
Judgement is required in determining the cash-generating units, the discount rates applicable to the future cash flows and what expected growth rates are reasonable.
Such estimates and judgements are subject to change as a result of changing economic conditions and actual cash flows may differ from forecasts.

Property, plant and equipment Accounting policies Land and buildings are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Leaseholds are generally depreciated over the unexpired period of the lease.
Other property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis to estimated residual values over their expected useful lives, and these values and lives are reviewed each year.
Subject to these reviews, the estimated useful lives fall within the following ranges: buildings 10 to 50 years: within plant and equipment casks and containers 15 to 50 years: other plant and equipment 5 to 25 years: fixtures and fittings 5 to 10 years: and returnable bottles and crates 5 to 10 years.
Reviews are carried out if there is an indication that assets may be impaired, to ensure that property, plant and equipment are not carried at above their recoverable amounts.
Government grants Government grants are not recognised until there is reasonable assurance that the group will comply with the conditions pursuant to which they have been granted and that the grants will be received.
Government grants in respect of property, plant and equipment are deducted from the asset that they relate to, reducing the depreciation expense charged to the income statement.
Leases Where the group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset subject to a lease, the lease is treated as a finance lease.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the group at their fair value at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in other financial liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.
Lease payments are apportioned between interest expense and a reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Other leases are treated as operating leases, with payments and receipts taken to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.

Higher inflation will lead to increased liabilities which is partially offset by the plans holding inflation linked gilts, swaps and caps against the level of inflationary increases.
Interest rate The plan liabilities are determined using discount rates derived from yields on AA-rated corporate bonds.
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities though this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the bonds held by the post employment plans.
Mortality The majority of the obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the members and their partners, so any increase in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans liabilities.
Asset returns Assets held by the pension plans are invested in a diversified portfolio of equities, bonds and other assets.
Volatility in asset values will lead to movements in the net deficit surplus reported in the consolidated balance sheet for post employment plans which in addition will also impact the post employment expense in the consolidated income statement.
The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine the groups deficit surplus in the main post employment plans at 30 June in the relevant year.
The assumptions used to calculate the charge credit in the consolidated income statement for the year ended 30 June are based on the assumptions disclosed as at the previous 30 June.

1 The sensitivity analyses above have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions and may not be representative of the actual change.
Each sensitivity is calculated on a change in the key assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
The sensitivity to inflation includes the impact on all inflation linked assumptions e. g. pension increases and salary increases where appropriate.

They are in respect of benefits that have accrued at the balance sheet date and make no allowance for any benefits accrued subsequently.
f Related party disclosures Information on transactions between the group and its pension plans is given in note 20.
Working capital Accounting policies Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes raw materials, direct labour and expenses, an appropriate proportion of production and other overheads, but not borrowing costs.
Cost is calculated at the weighted average cost incurred in acquiring inventories.
Maturing inventories which are retained for more than one year are classified as current assets, as they are expected to be realised in the normal operating cycle.
Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value less transaction costs and subsequently carried at amortised cost less any allowance for discounts and doubtful debts.
Trade receivables arise from contracts with customers, and are recognised when performance obligations are satisfied, and the consideration due is unconditional as only the passage of time is required before the payment is received.
Allowance losses are calculated by reviewing lifetime expected credit losses using historic and forward-looking data on credit risk.
Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value including transaction costs and subsequently carried at amortised costs.
Provisions are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount.
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are calculated on a discounted basis.
The carrying amounts of provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.
