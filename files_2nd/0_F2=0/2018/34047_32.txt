BBA Aviation Annual Report 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements 175 Notes to the Company Financial Statements Deferred tax Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheetliability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from theinitial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted orsubstantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the profit and loss account, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income.
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Company intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Current tax and deferred tax for the year Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly inequity respectively.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the application of the Companys accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements other than those involving estimations that have a significant impact on the amounts recognised and to make estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Management has concluded that for 2018 there are no critical accounting judgements or key sources of estimation uncertainty that have asignificant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities with the next financial year.

Share-based payments Details of share-based payments are provided within note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Pension and other post-retirement benefits The Company operates a defined benefit pension scheme in the United Kingdom.
Assets are held in a separate trustee-administered fund.
Contributions to the scheme are made and pension cost is assessed using the projected unit method.
During the first half of 2014, the Group agreed a new long-term funding package with the Trustee of the IPP, following the sale of APPH Limited.
This new funding package replaced the deficit contributions agreed with the Trustee as part of the 2012 triennial valuation of the IPP.
As part of this funding package, an Asset-Backed Funding ABF structure was put in place.
In accordance with theimplementation steps of the structure the Company made a capital contribution to a newly formed partnership of 33 million.
This hasbeen classified as aprepayment following the adoption of FRS 101.
This asset will unwind over the life of the ABF structure ascontributions to the plan reduce the Plan deficit.
The final cash contribution will be made by the ABF structure to the Plan in March 2034, at which point the prepayment will befully unwound.
Details of the UK scheme are provided within note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The High Court ruled on 26 October 2018 in the landmark Lloyds Banking Group case on Guaranteed Minimum Pensions GMPs.
The judgment requires equalisation between men and women for the effect of unequal GMPs accrued between 1990 and 1997 i. e. for defined benefit pension schemes that were contracted out between May 1990 and April 1997 and describes the applicable ways in which the benefit entitlements should be equalised.
The ruling means the IPP recognised a 8.4 million increase to the defined benefit obligation through the profit and loss account as at 26 October 2018.
Contingent liabilities Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, theCompany considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make apayment under the guarantee.
