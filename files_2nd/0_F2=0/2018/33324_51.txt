Retirement benefit obligations During the year the Company operated two pension schemes, the A. G. BARR p. l. c. 2005 Defined Contribution Scheme and the A. G. BARR p. l. c. 2008 Pension and Life Assurance Scheme.
The latter is a funded defined benefit scheme based on final salary which also includes a defined contribution section for the pension provision of new executive entrants.
Under the defined benefit scheme, the employees are entitled to retirement benefits based on final pensionable pay.
No other post-retirement benefits are provided.
Defined benefit scheme: actuarial valuation The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Company and are invested in managed funds.
A full valuation of the defined benefit scheme was conducted as at 5 April 2017 using the attained age method.
The triennial valuation was signed after the balance sheet date on 8 March 2018, as detailed in Note 32.
A deficit of 4.8m was determined at the valuation date.
The defined benefit scheme exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as longevity risk, interest rate risk and market investment risk.
Responsibility for governance of the plans, including investment decisions and contribution schedules, lies jointly with the Company and the board of trustees.
The board of trustees is composed of representatives from the Company scheme members as set out in the plans rules.
Defined benefit scheme: IAS 19 information The full actuarial valuation carried out at 5 April 2017 was updated to 27 January 2018 by a qualified independent actuary.
The valuation used for the defined benefit schemes has been based on market conditions as at the Company year end.
The amounts recognised in the statement of financial position are as follows: Group Company Restated 2018 2017 2018 2017 Group and Company m m m m Present value of funded obligations 120.5 139.2 120.5 139.2 Fair value of scheme assets 105.3 111.8 105.3 111.8 Deficit recognised under IAS 19 15.2 27.4 15.2 27.4 Company contribution made to pension scheme in the year to 26 January 2014 18.6 19.1 Deficit surplus recognised in the statement of financial position 15.2 27.4 3.4 8.3 Following discussion with our auditor, we have changed our accounting policy treatment of a payment made to the pension scheme for the rental of the property that was transferred from the Company into the scheme as part of the asset backed funding arrangement.
Previously accounted for as a prepayment, this is now included as a reduction in the carrying value of the retirement benefit obligation.

On 1 May 2016 the A. G. BARR p. l. c. 2008 Pension and Life Assurance Scheme was closed to future accrual following a negotiated agreement between the Company and the board of trustees.
A curtailment gain of 7.0m arose on the closure to future accrual.
A past service cost of 1.3m was also recognised as active members were awarded one years further service as part of the negotiated closure.
Following the closure the Company incurred a further 0.2m of costs in relation to the closure of the Scheme to future accrual.
These three items were treated as exceptional items in the year to 28 January 2017 Note 7.
At the 2014 actuarial valuation, executive members of the Scheme were assumed to retire from active service at age 60 with an unreduced pension.
However following the closure of the Scheme to future accrual in the year ended 28 January 2017 there are no longer any active members in the Scheme.
All executives are now deferred members with an assumed retirement age of 65, in line with the Scheme rules.
Under the Scheme rules, the Trustees have discretion as to whether to fund deferred members receiving unreduced benefits before their normal retirement age of 65.
As such, the gain resulting from the change in this assumption has been included in the changes in demographic assumptions of 13.8m for the year ended 27 January 2018.
126 A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Accounts The Company made a 1.0m contribution to the scheme in May 2016 and May 2017, and will make a further contribution of 1.0m in May 2018.
The movement in the defined benefit obligation in the year to 28 January 2017 was as follows: Present Fair value of value plan assets of obligation Total Group and Company m m m At 30 January 2016 107.3 120.2 12.9 Current service cost 0.4 0.4 Past service cost 1.3 1.3 Curtailment gain 7.0 7.0 Interest income expense 3.9 4.4 0.5 Total cost recognised in income statement 3.9 0.9 4.8 Remeasurements changes in demographic assumptions 5.7 5.7 changes in financial assumptions 19.7 19.7 actuarial return on assets excluding amounts recognised in net interest 3.5 3.5 Total remeasurements recognised in other comprehensive income 3.5 25.4 21.9 Cashflows Employer contributions 2.6 2.6 Benefits paid 5.5 5.5 Premiums paid Total cash outflow 2.9 5.5 2.6 At 28 January 2017 111.8 139.2 27.4 This table excludes the Company contribution made to the pension scheme through the asset backed funding arrangement as described below and reconciled in the table above.
Asset backed funding arrangement During the year to 26 January 2014 the Company established the A. G. BARR Scottish Limited Partnership the Partnership and through the Partnership has entered into a long term pension funding arrangement with the Pension Scheme.
Under this arrangement certain property assets were transferred into the Partnership and are being leased back to A. G. BARR p. l. c. under a 21year lease agreement, generating an income stream of 1.1m per annum for the pension scheme, increasing annually in line with inflation.
The Partnership is controlled by A. G. BARR p. l. c. and its results are consolidated by the Group.
The value of the properties transferred into the Partnership remains included on the Groups and Companys balance sheet at carrying values at the date of transfer with the Group and Company retaining full operational control over these properties.
At the end of the term of the relevant lease, or earlier if the Scheme becomes fully funded to the extent that the members benefits can be secured with an insurance company, the Company has the option to repurchase the properties in the Partnership for an agreed fixed price.
A structured entity is an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when any voting rights relate only to administrative tasks and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements.
As outlined above, during a prior year, certain freehold properties were transferred to a limited partnership a structured entity established by the Group, the main purpose of which is to lease these properties to a Group company and, as a result, to provide the Groups pension scheme with a distribution of the profits of the Partnership.
A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2018 127 Notes to the Accounts continued 26.
Retirement benefit obligations continued Asset backed funding arrangement continued The distribution is subject to discretion exercisable by the Group in certain circumstances however, given that the Group has the ability to control the limited Partnership by making an additional contribution into the Scheme, it is the view of the directors that the Group controls the limited Partnership and therefore it is treated as a consolidated entity.
The carrying value of the properties sold to the Partnership and leased back to the Company remain included on the Groups and Companys balance sheet and continue to be depreciated in line with the Groups and Companys accounting policies with the Group and Company retaining full operational control over these properties.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption conferred by Regulation 7 of the Partnerships Accounts Regulations 2008 and has, therefore, not appended the accounts of this qualifying Partnership to these financial statements.
Separate accounts for the Partnership are not required to be, and have not been, filed at UK Companies House.
As part of the funding arrangement the Company made a one-off payment to the Pension Scheme of 20.4m to allow it to invest in the Partnership and in prior years this has been treated as a prepayment of pension contributions.
Following a review of the accounting policy with the auditor the Company is changing its accounting policy in relation to the prepayment and including this as a reduction in the carrying value of the retirement benefit obligation.
This treatment is in line with treatment adopted by other companies which have entered into an asset backed funding arrangement.
Full disclosure of the impact on the Company accounts is made in Note 1.
As the Partnership results are consolidated within the Group results no balances are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position.

This assumes that the expected age at death for males is 88 to 90 and for females is 90 to 92 depending on their age at 27 January 2018.

128 A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Accounts Sensitivity review The sensitivity of the overall pension liability to changes in the principal assumptions is: Year ended 27 January 2018 Change in assumption Impact on overall liabilities Discount rate Increase decrease by 0.5% Decreases increases liabilities by 11.9m Rate of inflation Increase decrease by 0.5% Increases decreases liabilities by 4.2m Life expectancy Increase decrease by 1 year Increases decreases liabilities by 4.9m Year ended 28 January 2017 Change in assumption Impact on overall liabilities Discount rate Increase decrease by 0.1% Decreases increases liabilities by 2.3m Rate of inflation Increase decrease by 0.1% Increases decreases liabilities by 2.0m Life expectancy Increase decrease by 1 year Increases decreases liabilities by 5.6m Methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analyses The sensitivities disclosed were calculated using approximate methods taking into account the duration of the Schemes liabilities.
They have been calculated consistently with last periods disclosures, however these change over time with financial conditions and assumptions.
Risks to which the Scheme exposes the Company The nature of the Scheme exposes the Company to the risk of paying unanticipated additional contributions to the Scheme in times of adverse experience.
The most financially significant risks are likely to be: Asset volatility The Schemes liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields in line with the requirements of IAS 19R.
If the Scheme assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit.
The plan holds investments in a portfolio of equity and bonds which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term but provide volatility and risk in the short term.
The Trustees have made a number of steps to control the level of investment risk within the Scheme.
The Trustee and the Company agreed in April 2016 to purchase an annuity policy with Canada Life to cover all future pension payments to certain members of the Scheme.
This policy was purchased at a cost of 34.7m and secures the total amount of future pension payments for 100 of the Schemes pensioner members.
The Trustees will continue to review the risk exposures in light of the longer term objectives of the Scheme.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities.
In the event of a reduction in the corporate bond yields there will be an increase in the value of the Schemes bond holdings.
Inflation risk The Group pension obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
The majority of the Schemes assets are either unaffected by inflation fixed interest bonds or loosely correlated with inflation equities, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
Life expectancy The Schemes obligation is to provide benefits for the life of the members.
An increase in life expectancy will result in an increase in the Schemes liabilities.
Policy for recognising gains and losses The Company recognises actuarial gains and losses immediately, through the remeasurement of the net defined benefit liability.
Asset-liability matching strategies used by the Scheme or the Company The Scheme does not currently use any specific asset-liability matching strategies.
The Trustees current investment strategy, having consulted with the Company, is to invest circa 40% of the Schemes assets in a mix of equities and diversifying return seeking assets, with the balance in long dated gilts and corporate bonds, in order to strike a balance between: maximising the returns on the Schemes assets: and minimising the risks associated with the lower than expected returns on the Schemes assets.
