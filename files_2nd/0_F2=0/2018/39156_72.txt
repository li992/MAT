Executive Share Option Scheme Prior to the adoption by the Company of the Performance Share Plan in 2008, Executive Directors and certain other senior executives were generally eligible for the grant of options under the PZ Cussons Plc Executive Share Option Scheme.
Under this scheme options are exercisable at a price equal to the average quoted market price of the Companys shares on the dealing day before the option is granted.
Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group for any reason outside of the scheme rules.
Options under the scheme are exercisable in a period beginning no earlier than three years from the date of grant and are subject to performance conditions.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the date of grant is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model according to the relevant measures of performance.
The model includes adjustments, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of exercise restrictions, behavioural considerations and expected dividend payments.
The option life is derived by the models based on these assumptions and other assumptions identified below.
The total expense included within operating profit in respect of the share option scheme was nil 2017: nil.
No options have been granted during the current or prior year under the Executive Share Option Scheme and it is not expected that any further awards will be made.
