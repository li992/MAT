This is often referred to as Debt at Par Value.
The current replacement or market value of the debt, which assumes it is repaid and renegotiated under current market conditions, is often referred to as the Debt at Fair Value.
This fair value is explained in note 22 d on page 66.
The difference between fair and par value of the debt is subtracted from the NAV to derive the NAV with debt at fair value.
The fair value of the 13 billion senior secured loan notes issued by the Company has been calculated using discount cash flow techniques, using the yield from a similar dated gilt plus a margin based on the five year average for the AA Barclays Yen Corporate Bond spread.
Benchmark return Total return on the benchmark, on a closing-market value to closing-market value basis, assuming that all dividends received were reinvested, without transaction costs, in the shares of the underlying companies at the time the shares were quoted ex-dividend.
The benchmark is a recognised index of stocks which should not be taken as wholly representative of the Company's investment universe.
The Company's investment strategy does not 'track' this index and consequently, there may be some divergence between the Company's performance and that of the benchmark.

The opposite of a discount is a premium.
It is more common for an investment trusts' shares to trade at a discount than at a premium see page5.
