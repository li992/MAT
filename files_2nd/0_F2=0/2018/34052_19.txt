Intangible assets Intangible assets consist of goodwill on acquisitions of $62.0m 2017: $62.0m, purchased syndicate capacity of $10.7m 2017: $10.7m, US admitted licences of $9.3m 2017: $9.3m, renewal rights of $25.2m 2017: $35.2m and capitalised expenditure on IT projects of $19.3m 2017: $16.3m.
Reinsurance assets Reinsurance assets represent recoveries from reinsurers in respect of incurred claims of $951.7m 2017: $993.2m, and the unearned reinsurance premiums reserve of $241.1m 2017: $237.9m.
The reinsurance receivables from reinsurers are split between recoveries on claims paid or notified of $231.9m 2017: $219.4m and an actuarial estimate of recoveries on claims that have not yet been reported of $719.8m 2017: $773.8m.
The groups exposure to reinsurers is managed through: minimising risk through selection of reinsurers who meet strict financial criteria e. g. minimum net assets, minimum A rating by S&P.
These criteria vary by type of business short vs medium tail.
The chart on page 47 shows the profile of these assets based on their S&P rating at the end of 2018: timely calculation and issuance of reinsurance collection notes from our ceded reinsurance team: and regular monitoring of the outstanding debtor position by our reinsurance security committee and credit control committee.
We continue to provide against impairment of reinsurance recoveries, and at the end of 2018 our provision in respect of reinsurance recoveries totalled $12.2m 2017: $13.2m.
Insurance receivables Insurance receivables are amounts receivable from brokers in respect of premiums written.
com Annual report 2018 Beazley 47 Other assets Other assets are analysed separately in the notes to the financial statements.
The items included comprise: deferred acquisition costs of $307.4m 2017: $281.4m : profit commissions of $5.9m 2017: $10.1m : and deferred tax assets available for use against future taxes payable of $28.9m 2017: $6.9m.
Judgement is required in determining the policy for deferring acquisition costs.
Beazleys policy assumes that variable reward paid to underwriters relates to prior years business and is not an acquisition cost.
As a result, the quantum of costs classified as acquisition is towards the lower end of the possible range seen across the insurance market.
Costs identified as related to acquisition are then deferred in line with premium earnings.
Insurance liabilities Insurance liabilities of $5,456.2m 2017: $5,167.8m consist of two main elements, being the unearned premium reserve UPR and gross insurance claims liabilities.
The majority of the UPR balance relates to current year premiums that have been deferred and will be earned in future periods.
Current indicators are that this business is profitable.
Gross insurance claims reserves are made up of claims which have been notified to us but not yet paid of $1,171.2m 2017: $1,056.3m and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported IBNR of $2,869.5m 2017: $2,852.3m.
These are estimated as part of the quarterly reserving process involving the underwriters and group actuary.
Gross insurance claims reserves have increased 3% from 2017 to $4,040.7m 2017: $3,908.6m.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities comprise borrowings and derivative financial liabilities.
The group utilises two long term debt facilities: during September 2012 we issued a sterling denominated 5.375% retail bond under a 250m euro medium term note programme which raised 75m for the group and is due in 2019.
This diversified the source and maturity profile of the groups debt financing: and in November 2016, Beazley Insurance dac issued $250m of 5.875% subordinated tier 2 notes due in 2026.
In October 2018, the group exercised its call option and redeemed the full nominal amount of $18.0m subordinated debt issued in 2004.
A syndicated short term banking facility led by Lloyds Banking Group plc provides potential borrowings up to $225m.
Under the facility $225m may be drawn as letters of credit to support underwriting at Lloyds.
Of this, 100% may be advanced as cash under a revolving facility.
The cost of the facility is based on a commitment fee of 0.385% per annum and any amounts drawn are charged at a margin of 1.1% per annum.
The cash element of the facility will expire on 31 July 2019, whilst letters of credit issued under the facility can be used to provide support for the 2017, 2018 and 2019 underwriting years.
The facility is currently unutilised.
