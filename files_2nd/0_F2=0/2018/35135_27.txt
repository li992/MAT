The Group measures the amount of capital it requires and holds by applying the Capital Requirements Directive and Regulation CRD IV as implemented in the UK by the PRA and supplemented through additional regulation under the PRA Rulebook.
The table below summarises the amount of capital in relation to RWAs the Group is currently required to hold, excluding any PRA Buffer.
These ratios apply at the consolidated Group level.
As at 30 Sep 2018 Minimum requirements CET1 Total Capital 1 Pillar 1 4.5% 8.0% 2 Pillar 2A 2.5% 4.5% Individual capital guidance 7.0% 12.5% 3 Capital conservation buffer 1.9% 1.9% 4 UK countercyclical capital buffer 0.5% 0.5% 5 Total excluding PRA buffer 9.4% 14.9% 1 The minimum amount of total capital under Pillar 1 of the regulatory framework is determined as 8% of RWAs, of which at least 4.5% of RWAs is required to be covered by CET1 capital.
2 Growth in RWAs at CYBG PLC has meant that at 30 September 2018 the Groups Pillar 2A total capital requirement, as set by the PRAs Individual Capital Guidance ICG, has reduced from 4.6% to 4.5%.
At least 56.25% of this needs to be met with CET1, equating to approximately 2.5% of RWAs.
3 The capital conservation buffer CCB is being phased in over the period from 1 January 2016 to 1 January 2019.
The CCB has been set at 2.5% of RWAs, with 1.875% applicable for 2018.
4 The UK countercyclical capital buffer CCyB may be set between 0% and 2.5%.
On 27 June 2018 the UK CCyB increased from 0% to 0.5% and the FPC reaffirmed that it expects to increase the UK CCyB from 0.5% to 1% from 28 November 2018.
The FPC will conduct a comprehensive assessment of the resilience of the UK banking system in the 2018 stress test and review the adequacy of the 1.0% CCyB rate.
5 The Group may be subject to a PRA buffer as set by the PRA but is not permitted to disclose the level of any buffer.
A PRA buffer can consist of two components: A risk management and governance buffer that is set as a scalar of the Pillar 1 and Pillar 2A requirements.
A buffer relating to the results of the BoE stress tests.
Underlying capital generation post AT1 distribution was 63bps before the net impact of charges associated with the acquisition of Virgin Money, restructuring, separation from our former parent and legacy conduct issues.
While the Groups CET1 ratio of 10.5% is below our guidance range of 12-13%, we continue to maintain a significant buffer to our transitional CRD IV minimum requirement of 9.4%, being a buffer of 221m.
150 CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Risk report Balance sheet and prudential regulation risks Pro forma IRB RWAs and Capital ratios As announced on 11 October 2018, the Group has received IRB accreditation for both its mortgage and SME corporate portfolios.
The Groups estimated IRB RWAs and capital ratios, as at 30 September 2018, are as follows: 2018 Capital position and CET1 unaudited m RWA Retail mortgages 4,460 Business lending 6,598 Other retail lending 981 Other lending 109 Other 609 Credit risk 12,757 Credit valuation adjustment 218 Operational risk 1,655 Counterparty risk 125 Total RWAs 14,755 Capital ratios CET1 ratio 14.0% Tier 1 ratio 17.1% Total capital ratio 21.3% The Groups credit RWAs on an IRB basis would have been c. 4.5bn lower in the mortgage portfolio and c. 0.8bn lower in the SME Corporate portfolio.
These reductions would have resulted in a pro forma increase in CYBGs CET1 ratio of approximately 350 basis points to c. 14.0% as at 30 September 2018.
The Basel Committee published their final Basel III framework in December 2017.
A key objective of the revisions is to reduce excessive variability of current RWAs and improve the comparability of banks capital ratios.
Implementation dates range from 2022 to 2027 and the Committee has introduced transitional arrangements to ensure an orderly and timely implementation.
The Groups initial analysis suggests that the new requirements will not have a material impact on the total amount of capital it is required to hold.
Dividend As announced in the Strategic report the Board has recommended a 3.1p per share dividend.
The dividend would equate to approximately 44m of CET1 equivalent to 22bps of CET1 based on RWAs as at 30 September 2018.

The Group is currently excluded from the full reporting requirements of the UK leverage ratio framework.
The leverage ratio is monitored against a Board set RAS with the responsibility for managing the ratio delegated to ALCO, which monitors it on a monthly basis.
Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 151 The leverage ratio is the ratio of Tier 1 capital to total exposure, defined as: capital: Tier 1 capital defined according to CRD IV on an end point basis assuming the full impact of CRD IV requirements on Tier 1 capital were in force with no transitional provisions : and exposures: total onand off-balance sheet exposures subject to credit conversion factors as defined in the delegated act amending CRR article 429 Calculation of the Leverage Ratio, which includes deductions applied to Tier 1 capital.
Other regulatory adjustments consist of adjustments that are required under CRD IV to be deducted from Tier 1 capital.
The removal of these from the exposure measure ensures consistency is maintained between the capital and exposure components of the ratio.
The Groups leverage ratio is 5.6% which exceeds the Basel Committees proposed minimum of 3%, applicable from 2018.
The UK leverage ratio framework, which came into force on 1 January 2016, is relevant to PRA regulated banks and building societies with consolidated retail deposits equal to or greater than 50bn.
As at 30 September 2018 the Group was currently excluded from these requirements.
On 3 October 2017, the PRA published a policy statement UK Leverage Ratio treatment of claims on central banks.
The PRA Rulebook has been amended to: align with its July 2016 modification by consent to exclude central bank claims matched by deposits in the same currency and of identical or longer maturity from the definition of the total leverage exposure measure in the UK leverage ratio framework: increase the minimum leverage ratio requirement from 3% to 3.25% of total exposures: and align the UK leverage ratio reporting and disclosure requirements to the proposed definition of the total exposure measure and 3.25% minimum leverage ratio requirement.
If these modifications are applied to the Group, this results in an increase in the leverage ratio from 5.6% under CRD IV to 6.5% on the PRA modified basis as a result of the Groups significant exposures to central banks within its liquid asset portfolio and Note cover.
On 14 November 2018, the PRA published a policy statement UK leverage ratio: Applying the framework to systemic ring-fenced bodies and reflecting the systemic risk buffer, confirming that from 1 January 2019 the UK leverage ratio framework will apply on a sub-consolidated basis to ring-fenced bodies in scope.
The Groups pro forma CRD IV leverage ratio, including the estimated impact of IRB accreditation at CYBG PLC, at 30 September 2018 was 5.5%.
Impact of acquisition of Virgin Money Following the successful completion of the acquisition of Virgin Money the estimated Combined Groups new total capital requirement, including the estimated impact of IRB accreditation at CYBG PLC as described above, was set by the PRA as follows excluding any PRA buffer : 1 Minimum requirements CET1 Total Capital Pillar 1 4.5% 8.0% Pillar 2A 3.6% 6.4% Total capital requirement 8.1% 14.4% Capital conservation buffer 1.9% 1.9% UK countercyclical capital buffer 0.5% 0.5% Total excluding PRA buffer 10.5% 16.8% 1 Estimated Combined Group capital ratios have been calculated by adding the Risk Weighted Assets of CYBG PLC and Virgin Money at 30 September 2018 and applying the PRAs requirements which applied from 15 October 2018.
The increase in the percentage Pillar 2A requirement incorporates the reduction in RWAs as a result of IRB accreditation at CYBG PLC as described above.
Furthermore, this component also reflects perceived risks relating to the integration of the two businesses.
The Group expects that this will no longer be required once integration is complete.
For comparison, the Pillar 2A total capital requirements for CB Solo Consolidated and Virgin Money are not impacted by this risk and were 5.7% and 5.4% respectively on a post IRB basis.
152 CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Risk report Balance sheet and prudential regulation risks The estimated Combined Groups capital ratios, including the estimated impact of IRB accreditation at CYBG PLC, as described above, at 30 September were well in excess of the CRD IV requirements as follows: 1 Capital Ratio Estimated Combined Group CET1 15.2% Total Capital 21.6% 2 Leverage Ratio 4.7% 1 The unaudited estimated Combined Group financial information, which has been produced for illustrative purposes only, by its nature addresses a hypothetical situation and, therefore, does not represent the CYBG Groups actual financial position or results.
Estimated Combined Group capital ratios are calculated using the weighted average of the requirements of CYBG PLC and Virgin Money based on their respective Risk Weighted Assets and Capital held at 30 September 2018.
Capital held for the estimated Combined Group has been adjusted for the value of consideration of shares issued at the scheme record date.
The Risk Weighted Assets and capital held for CYBG PLC have been adjusted to incorporate the estimated impact of IRB accreditation that was received in October 2018.
The figures exclude any impact of acquisition accounting that will be completed during Q1 FY19.

Estimated Combined Group leverage ratio is calculated using the weighted average of the requirements of CYBG PLC and Virgin Money based on their respective Total Leverage Exposures and Tier 1 Capital held at 30 September 2018.
Capital held for CYBG PLC has been adjusted to incorporate the estimated impact of IRB accreditation that was received in October 2018.
The BoE has not yet advised the Combined Groups Final Minimum Requirement for Own Funds and Eligible Liabilities MREL.
The Group continues to expect that from 1 January 2020 until 31 December 2021 the Group will be required to hold 18% of risk-weighted assets in the form of MREL.
From 1 January 2022, the Group will be subject to an end state MREL of two times Pillar 1 and Pillar 2A capital.
Funding and liquidity risk Funding risk relates to the impact on the Groups strategy of being unable to raise funds from customers and the wholesale markets of sufficient quantity and of appropriate mix and tenor.
An inability to raise sufficient funds may lead to a reduction in lending growth or a requirement to raise the price paid for deposits, both outcomes having an adverse effect on shareholder value.
Where funding risk manifests itself in an adverse effect on mix and tenor, for example, a high proportion of short-term wholesale deposits, there is an increased liquidity risk to the Group.
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is unable to meet its current and future financial obligations as they fall due at acceptable cost.
These obligations include the repayment of deposits on demand or at their contractual maturity dates, the repayment of borrowings and loan capital as they mature, the payment of operating expenses and tax, the payment of dividends and the ability to fund new and existing loan commitments.
Risk assessment The framework for the Groups approach to funding risk leads to the development of a Group funding plan that is subject to approval by the Board and is consistent with risk appetite and the Groups strategic objectives.
The development of the Groups funding plan is informed by the requirements of the Groups Balance Sheet Risk Policy Standards.
Liquidity risk exposures are subject to assessment under both regulatory and internal requirements.
Exposures relate to the outflow of funds under a series of stress scenarios less the impact of inflows from assets, liquidation of high-quality liquid assets or through other actions instigated by the Group.
Liquidity within the Group is managed in accordance with the ILAAP that is approved by the Board.
The Treasury function is responsible for the development and execution of strategy subject to oversight from the Risk Management function.
In relation to funding and liquidity risk, the primary management committee is ALCO.
The Group continues to maintain its strong funding and liquidity position and seeks to achieve an appropriate balance between profitability, liquidity risk and capital optimisation.
Funding is predominantly provided by Retail and SME customers and this is supported by medium-term secured funding issuance e. g. the Groups Lanark securitisation programme, its Regulated Covered Bond platform and unsecured medium-term notes the Group also raised funds through the TFS prior to the Schemes closure to new drawings in early 2018.
These funding programmes are a source of strength for the Group and leverage the Groups high-quality mortgage book as a source of collateral for secured funding.
Monitoring Funding and Liquidity risks are subject to a range of measures contained within the Groups RAS and a series of limits agreed by ALCO.
These measures provide a view of risks both under normal and stressed conditions with a focus on: cash outflows and inflows under stress: concentration risks: refinancing risks: readiness of mitigating action: and provide a short and long-term view of risks.
An early warning framework is also operated to ensure quick escalation of any issues see Contingency Funding Plan section below.
The Group operates a Funds Transfer Pricing FTP system.
A key purpose of FTP is to ensure that liquidity risk is a factor in the pricing of loans and deposits.
Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 153 Mitigation The Group has several sources of funding which are well diversified in terms of the type of instrument and product, counterparty, term structure and market.
Refinancing risks are carefully managed and are subject to controls overseen by ALCO.
The Group holds a portfolio of High Quality Liquid Assets HQLA that can be utilised to raise funding in times of stress.
The size of the HQLA portfolio is calibrated based on a view of potential outflows under both systemic and idiosyncratic stress events.
In addition, the Group can use the repo market to generate funds and can also participate in BoE operations through the Sterling Monetary Framework.
Contingency Funding Plan A Contingency Funding Plan has been established for management of an escalated liquidity requirement if the Group experiences either restricted access to wholesale funding or a significant increase in the withdrawal of funds.
The plan identifies triggers for escalation, details the action required, allocates the key tasks to individuals, provides a timeframe and defines a management committee to manage the action plan.
Sources of funding audited The table below provides an overview of the Groups sources of funding as at 30 September.

On 7 December 2017, Moodys upgraded the long-term deposit rating of Clydesdale Bank PLC by one notch to Baa1.
This reflected Moodys view on the improvement in the Banks management and risk and compliance frameworks, together with the delivery of the strategic plan and return to profitability.
As part of the same rating action, Moodys revised the outlook on Clydesdale Bank PLCs long-term deposit rating to positive in anticipation of ongoing senior unsecured issuance from CYBG PLC to meet MREL.
In November 2017, S&P revised their view of UK economic risk for the UK banking sector, which led to the outlooks for Clydesdale Bank PLC and CYBG PLC being revised from negative to stable.
On 23 March 2018, S&P affirmed the ratings of Clydesdale Bank PLC and CYBG PLC with a stable outlook.
In June 2018, following the announcement of the Groups offer for Virgin Money, all three rating agencies released updates relating to the Group Baseline Credit Assessment.
S&P and Fitch affirmed the Groups rating and outlook whilst Moodys placed Clydesdale Bank PLCs Adjusted Baseline Credit Assessment of Baa2, on review for upgrade, and its long-term Deposit Rating of Baa1, on review for downgrade.
At the same time, Moodys placed Virgin Moneys Baa2 long-term local-currency deposit ratings and Baa2 long-term issuer ratings on review for upgrade, as well as its Baa2 Baseline Credit Assessment and adjusted Baseline Credit Assessment.
Moodys noted that The review for upgrade on both banks Baseline Credit Assessments is driven by i the substantial potential for cost savings: ii the two banks complementary business mixes, providing new revenue opportunities: and iii Moodys expectations that the combined entity will retain a strong capital position and stable funding profile.
As at 26 November 2018, there have been no changes to the enlarged Groups long-term credit ratings or outlooks since the report date.
Additional collateral to be provided in the event of a notch downgrade The Group monitors the movements in its credit ratings and the related requirement to post collateral for payment systems and clearing houses.
These figures are not considered material compared to the volume of unencumbered liquid assets.
Liquid assets The quantity and quality of the Groups liquid assets are calibrated to the Boards view of liquidity risk appetite and remain at a prudent level above regulatory requirements.
The Group was compliant with all internal and regulatory liquidity metrics at 30 September 2018.
The liquid asset portfolio provides a buffer against sudden and potentially sharp outflows of funds and liquid assets must therefore be of a high quality so they can be realised for cash and cannot be encumbered for any other purpose e. g. to provide collateral for payments systems.
Details on encumbered assets are provided in the following section.
The liquid asset portfolio is primarily comprised of cash at the BoE, UK Government Securities Gilts and listed securities e. g. bonds issued by supra-nationals and AAA rated covered bonds.

Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 159 Market risk Market risk is the risk associated with adverse changes in the fair value, or accrual income and expense, of assets and liabilities held by the Group as a result of movements in market factors such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, volatility and credit spreads.
The Groups balance sheet is predominantly UK based and is denominated in GBP, therefore foreign exchange risk is not a major part of the Groups risk profile.
Structural interest rate risk comprises the sensitivity of the Groups current and future net interest income and economic value to movements in market interest rates.
The major contributors to interest rate risk are: the investment of non-interest bearing deposits and equity into interest-bearing assets: the mismatch between repricing dates of interest-bearing assets and liabilities: basis risk, for example, the inability of the pricing basis for customer asset and liability products to be replicated in the financial markets or the risk arising from changing relationships between different interest rate yield curves: and customer optionality, e. g. the right to repay borrowing in advance of contract maturity dates.
Exposures The focus of the Groups activity is to provide high-quality banking services to its customers.
These services include the provision of foreign exchange products and derivative products to enable customers to manage risks within their businesses.
As a result of these activities, the Group may be exposed to forms of market risk that would arise from movements in price on these products.
Controls include the hedging of these products as and when they arise.
Measurement Interest rate risk in the banking book IRRBB is measured, monitored, and managed from both an internal management and regulatory perspective.
The RMF incorporates both market valuation and earnings-based approaches.
In accordance with the Group IRRBB Policy Standard risk measurement techniques include: basis point sensitivity value at risk VaR, earnings at risk EaR, interest rate risk stress testing, repricing analysis, cash flow analysis, and scenario analysis.
The key features of the internal interest rate risk management model are: the use of basis point sensitivity analysis: VaR and EaR are measured on a statistical basis: 99% confidence level with appropriate holding periods depending on varying risk types: historical simulation approach utilising instantaneous interest rate shocks including parallel rate movements and twists in the yield curve to explore risks around exposures to movements in shortor long-term interest rates: static balance sheet i. e. any new business is assumed to be matched, hedged or subject to immediate repricing : investment term for capital is modelled with a benchmark term agreed by ALCO: investment term for core non-interest bearing assets and liabilities is modelled on a behavioural basis with a benchmark term agreed by ALCO: and assumptions covering the behavioural life of products and customer behaviour for optionality are reviewed and approved by ALCO.
Foreign exchange risk is assessed based on the absolute exposure in each currency.
160 CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Risk report Balance sheet and prudential regulation risks Mitigation measures Market risks are overseen by ALCO with delegation for day-to-day management given to Treasury.
Treasury use a number of techniques and products to manage market risks including interest rate swaps, cash flow netting and foreign exchange.
Basis risk is managed through a combination of wholesale market basis risk management products, pricing strategies and product innovation.
Fair value hedges The Group hedges part of its existing interest rate risk, resulting from potential movements in the fair value of fixed rate assets and liabilities.
The fair value of these swaps is disclosed in note 3.18.
There were no transactions for which fair value hedge accounting had to be discontinued in the year.
Cash flow hedges The Group hedges a portion of the variability in future cash flows attributable to interest rate and foreign currency risk.
The interest and foreign currency risk arise from variable interest rate assets and liabilities which are hedged using cross currency and interest rate swaps, and material non-GBP denominated assets which are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts.
There were no transactions for which cash flow hedge accounting had to be discontinued in the period as a result of the highly probable cash flows no longer being expected to occur.
The fair value of derivatives is disclosed in note 3.18.
Monitoring Model parameters and assumptions are reviewed and updated on at least an annual basis.
Material changes require the approval of ALCO.
Oversight of market risk is conducted by the Groups balance sheet and liquidity risk oversight team that is independent of the Treasury function.
The Board and Executive Risk Committee, through ALCOs oversight, monitors risk to ensure it remains within approved policy limits and Board requirements.
The VaR and EaR calculation parameters were changed effective from 31 March 2018 onwards.
The changes improved the modelling and measurement and did not represent a change in the Groups risk appetite for Interest Rate Risk.
The changes consisted of three main elements: 1 changes to the modelling methodology of rate movements in a low rate environment: 2 history set revised from eight years to two years so that the measure is more responsive to recent rate movements: and 3 revisions to assumptions for interest rate yield curves used for valuing liquid asset securities to better capture asset swap spread risk.
