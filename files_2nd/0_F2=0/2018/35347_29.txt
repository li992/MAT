SECTION 4: FINANCING AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE This section provides further information about the Groups capital structure equity and debt financing and cash generated from operations during the year.
4.1 RECONCILIATION OF NET DEBT Net debt is calculated by taking our borrowings note 4.3 and subtracting cash and cash equivalents note 4.2.
The table below reconciles net debt in terms of changes in these balances across the year.
Years ended 31 December 2018 2017 m m Net debt at 1 January 367.4 93.5 Increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents 65.6 4.0 Decrease increase in borrowings 4.2 267.8 Effect of changes in foreign exchange rates 21.5 2.1 Net debt at 31 December 319.1 367.4 Borrowings includes listed bonds, bank debt, revolving credit facilities and finance leases, net of any deferred finance costs.
A reconciliation of the increase in borrowings during the year is set out in the table on page 143.
Borrowings at 31 December 2018 does not include the acquisition bridge facility that was drawn down after the balance sheet date on 2 January 2019, see note 4.3.
During 2018, the Group entered into a cross-currency interest rate swap, fixing the sterling value of the principal repayments in respect of the Groups US dollar denominated debt see note 4.3.
If US dollar balances are translated at the hedged rate, rather than the rate prevailing at the balance sheet date, net debt would be reduced by 22.0 million 2017: nil.
The corresponding value of the hedging instrument is recognised at its fair value as a derivative financial instrument, see note 7.2.
4.2 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents include cash held in current and other deposit accounts that is accessible on demand.
It is our policy to invest available cash on hand in short-term, low-risk bank accounts or deposit accounts.
As at 31 December 2018 2017 m m Cash and cash equivalents 289.0 222.3 4.3 BORROWINGS Accounting policy The Group measures all debt instruments whether financial assets or financial liabilities initially at fair value, which equates to the principal value of the consideration paid or received.
Subsequent to initial measurement, debt instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Transaction costs any such costs incremental and directly attributable to the issue of the financial instrument are included in the calculation of the effective interest rate and are amortised over the life of the instrument.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down.
Where this is the case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs.
Debt instruments denominated in foreign currencies are revalued using period end exchange rates, with exchange gains and losses arising recognised as a component of net interest charges in the period they arise.
The Group hedges foreign currency risk in accordance with the policy set out in note 7.1.
Where hedging instruments are used to fix cash flows associated with debt instruments, the debt instrument and the hedging instrument are measured and presented separately on the balance sheet.
Post-balance sheet events On 16 October 2018, the Group entered into a 725 million acquisition bridge facility the Facility to finance the acquisition of ScottishPower Generation Limited see note 5.1.
The Group incurred 3.8 million of costs establishing the Facility during the year, which were deferred on the balance sheet at 31 December 2018.
On 2 January 2019, the Group settled the initial consideration due in respect of the acquisition of 687 million, which was part-funded by 550 million drawn from the Facility.
The balance of the consideration was funded from existing cash reserves.

The notes have a fixed interest rate of 6.625% and mature in 2025.
The proceeds of the issue were used to repay 200 million floating rate loan notes issued in 2017.
Costs associated with the repayment of these loan notes have been classified as exceptional.
The purpose of the new loan notes is to extend the maturity date of the Groups senior debt and reduce exposure to interest rate volatility.
The Group has taken out a cross-currency interest rate swap see note 7.1 to hedge the sterling cash flows associated with the USD loan notes.
In addition to fixing the sterling value of interest payments over a five year period, this instrument fixes the sterling repayment of principal at 213.3 million in 2023, the impact of which would reduce borrowings by 22.0 million.
The $25 million revolving 30 day facility remains available to the Group, but was undrawn at 31 December 2018.

The Group has no other undrawn debt facilities, although it has access to certain non-recourse trade receivable finance facilities and payment facilities, as described in note 4.4, which are utilised to accelerate working capital cash inflows and defer cash outflows.

The table below makes adjustments for any non-cash accounting items to reconcile our net profit for the year to the amount of cash we have generated from our operations.

As these contracts were designated into hedge accounting relationships under IFRS 9, the benefit is being recognised in the income statement when the hedged transaction occurs.
2 T he prior year has been restated due to the initial application of IFRS 9 see note 8.3.
The B2B Energy Supply business has access to a facility which enables it to accelerate cash flows associated with trade receivables on a non-recourse basis, which generated a net cash inflow of 24 million in the year ended 31 December 2018, reflected as a reduction in receivables in the table above 2017: inflow of 34 million.
The facility terms were amended during the year, increasing the facility size to 150 million and bringing more of the receivables balance into its scope, further improving the Groups overall liquidity and risk profile.
Cash from ROCs is typically realised several months after the ROC is earned: however, through standard ROC sales and purchase arrangements we are able to accelerate cash flows over a proportion of these assets.
The net impact of ROC purchases and sales on operating cash flows was a 10.5 million outflow 2017: 161.0 million inflow.
We also have access to facilities enabling us to sell ROC trade receivables on a non-recourse basis.
These facilities were unused at the period end 2017: Nil.
The Group entered into a number of payment facilities in 2018 to leverage scale and efficiencies in transaction processing, whilst providing a working capital benefit for the Group, for which 87.0 million was outstanding at 31 December 2018 2017: Nil.
The amounts fall due between 4 and 60 days from the end of the year.
The Group has sought to normalise payment across its supplier base resulting in certain suppliers extending payment terms and some reducing terms.
Suppliers are able to access a supply chain finance facility provided by a bank, for which funds can be accelerated in advance of the normal payment terms.
The facility does not affect our working capital, as payment terms remain unaltered with the Group.
At 31 December 2018, amounts utilised were not material.
