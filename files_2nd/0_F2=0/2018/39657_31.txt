RESULTS FOR THE YEAR 2 Segment information This note shows how Group revenue and Group operating profit are generated across the three reportable segments in which we operate, being Northern Europe, Central and Southern Europe and North America.
The Groups operations in Africa and the Middle East, Asia including Australia and Latin America do not meet the quantitative thresholds for disclosure as reportable segments under IFRS 8, and so are presented together in the analyses and described as International.
This is explained further below.
For each geographical region, revenue and operating profit are compared to prior year in order to understand the movements in the year.
This comparison is provided for statutory, underlying and organic revenue and statutory and underlying operating profit.
Statutory results reflect the Groups results prepared in accordance with the requirements of IFRS.
Underlying and underlying as reported are non-GAAP measures.
Adjustments are made to statutory results to arrive at an underlying result which is in line with how the business is managed and measured on a day-to-day basis.
Adjustments are made for items that are individually important in order to understand the financial performance.
If included, these items could distort understanding of the performance for the year and the comparability between periods.
Management applies judgement in determining which items should be excluded from underlying performance.
See note 3.6 for details of these adjustments.
In addition, the prior year underlying amounts are translated at current year exchange rates, so that exchange rate impacts do not distort comparisons.
Prior year underlying amounts at prior year exchange rates are underlying as reported: prior year and current year amounts at current year exchange rates are underlying.
The contributions from discontinued operations, disposals and assets held for sale of standalone businesses in the current and prior period are removed so that results can be compared to the prior year on a like-for-like basis.
Results from acquired businesses are excluded in the year of acquisition.
Adjustments are made to the comparative period to present prior period acquired businesses as if these had been part of the Group throughout the prior period.
Acquisitions and disposals which occurred close to the start of the opening comparative period where the contribution impact would be immaterial are not adjusted.
In addition, the following reconciliations are made in this note.
Revenue per segment reconciled to the profit for the year as per the income statement.
Statutory operating profit reconciled to underlying operating profit per segment detailing the adjustments made.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Accounting policy In accordance with IFRS 8, Operating Segments, information for the Groups operating segments has been derived using the information used by the chief operating decision maker.
The Groups Executive Committee has been identified as the chief operating decision maker in accordance with their designated responsibility for the allocation of resources to operating segments and assessing their performance, through the Quarterly Business Reviews chaired by the President and Chief Financial Officer.
The Executive Committee uses organic and underlying data to monitor business performance.
Operating segments are reported in a manner which is consistent with the operating segments produced for internal management reporting.
The Group is organised into nine key operating segments: Northern Europe UK and Ireland, Central Europe Germany, Austria and Switzerland, France, Iberia Spain and Portugal, North America excluding Intacct US and Canada, North America Intacct, Africa and the Middle East, Asia including Australia and Latin America.
With effect from 1 October 2017, the previous operating segment of Southern Europe was split into two key operating segments, France and Iberia, as part of the continued focus to get closer to customers.
For reporting under IFRS 8, the Group is divided into three reportable segments.
These segments are as follows: Northern Europe Central and Southern Europe Central Europe, France and Iberia North America North America excluding Intacct and North America Intacct The remaining operating segments of Africa and the Middle East, Asia including Australia and Latin America do not meet the quantitative thresholds for presentation as separate reportable segments under IFRS 8, and so are presented together and described as International.
They include the Groups operations in South Africa, UAE, Australia, Singapore, Malaysia and Brazil.
The reportable segments reflect the aggregation of the operating segments for Central Europe, France and Iberia, and also of those for North America excluding Intacct and North America Intacct.
In each case, the aggregated operating segments are considered to share similar economic characteristics because they have similar long-term gross margins and operate in similar markets.
Central Europe, France and Iberia operate principally within the EU and the majority of their businesses are in countries within the Euro area.
North America excluding Intacct and North America Intacct share the same North American geographical market and therefore share the same economic characteristics.
The UK is the home country of the parent.
Segment reporting The tables overleaf show a segmental analysis of the results for continuing operations.
The revenue analysis in the table overleaf is based on the location of the customer which is not materially different from the location where the order is received and where the assets are located.
Revenue categories are defined in note 3.1.
