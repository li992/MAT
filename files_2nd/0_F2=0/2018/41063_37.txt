No changes have been made to asset lives during the year.
As in previous years, fully depreciated assets are retained in the Groups fixed asset register.
In order to provide greater understanding of the Groups annual depreciation charge, assets which have been fully depreciated in the year have been removed from both cost and accumulated depreciation.
During June 2017, the Group sold the land and buildings of its customer fulfilment centre CFC at Dordon to a third party for cash consideration of 92m.
The disposal is included within the disposals during the 53 weeks ended 4 February 2018.
The disposal resulted in a profit of 14m.
This profit has been included in profit loss on disposal and exit of properties as an adjustment to underlying earnings see note 1.4.
81 Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 18 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 53 weeks ended 4 February 2018 3 Operating assets continued 3.3 Property, plant and equipment continued Included within the table on page 81 are leasehold land and buildings held under finance lease with a cost of 293m 2017: 294m and accumulated depreciation of 75m 2017: 72m.
The cost of financing property developments prior to their opening date has been included in the cost of the asset.
The cumulative amount of interest capitalised in the total cost above amounts to 199m 2017: 198m.
Impairment The Group considers that each store is a separate cash generating unit CGU and therefore considers every store for an indication of impairment annually.
The Group calculates each stores recoverable amount and compares this amount to its book value.
The recoverable amount is determined as the higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal.
If the recoverable amount is less than the book value, an impairment charge is recognised based on the following methodology: Value in use is calculated by projecting individual store pre-tax cash flows over the remaining useful life of the store, based on forecasting assumptions.
The methodology used for calculating future cash flows is to: use the actual cash flows for each store in the current year: allocate a proportion of the Groups central costs to each store on an appropriate basis: project each stores cash flows over the next five years by applying forecast sales and cost growth assumptions: project cash flows beyond year five for the remaining useful life of each store by applying a long-term growth rate: and discount the cash flows using a pre-tax rate of 9.0% 2017: 9.0%.
The discount rate takes into account the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
Fair value less costs of disposal is estimated by the Directors based on their knowledge of individual stores and the markets they serve and likely demand from grocers or other retailers.
The Directors also obtain valuations by store prepared by independent valuers and consider these in carrying out their estimate of fair value less cost of disposal for the purposes of testing for impairment.
In determining their valuation, the independent valuers assume an expected rent and yield for each store based on the quality of the asset, local catchment and the store being occupied by a supermarket tenant with a similar covenant to Morrisons.
In order to reflect specific local market conditions, in particular the continued low demand from major grocery retailers for supermarket space, the Directors consider it appropriate for the purpose of testing for impairment to revise downwards the rent and yield assumptions in the independent valuation to reflect the following factors on a store by store basis: whether a major grocery operator might buy the store, taking into consideration whether they are already located near the store, and whether the store size is appropriate for their business model, and then if not: assessing whether a smaller store operator might buy the store, in which case the value has been updated to reflect the Directors assessment of the yield which would be achievable if such an operator acquired the store, and then if not: and assessing whether a non-food operator might buy the store, in which case the value has been updated to reflect the Directors assessment of the yield which would be achievable if such an operator acquired the store.
Having applied the above methodology and assumptions, the Group has recognised a net impairment reversal of 8m 126m impairment reversal offset by 118m impairment charge during the year in respect of property, plant and equipment 2017: 44m: 191m impairment reversal offset by 147m impairment charge.
This movement reflects fluctuations from store level trading performance and local market conditions.
At 4 February 2018, the key assumption to which the value in use calculation is most sensitive to is the discount rate.
Specific sensitivity analysis with regard to this assumption shows that an increase of 1% in the discount rate would result in an additional impairment charge of 96m.
