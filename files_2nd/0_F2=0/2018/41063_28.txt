The Group is required to determine and present its operating segments based on the way in which financial information is organised and reported to the chief operating decision-maker CODM.
The CODM has been identified as the Executive Committee as this makes the key operating decisions of the Group and is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance.
Key internal reports received by the CODM, primarily the management accounts, focus on the performance of the Group as a whole.
The operations of all elements of the business are driven by the retail sales environment and hence have fundamentally the same economic characteristics.
All operational decisions made are focused on the performance and growth of the retail outlets and the ability of the business to meet the supply demands of the stores.
The Group has considered the overriding core principles of IFRS 8 Operating segments as well as its internal reporting framework, management and operating structure.
In particular, the Group considered its retail outlets, the fuel sale operation, the manufacturing entities and online operations.
The Directors conclusion is that the Group has one operating segment, that of retailing.
Reconciliations of reportable segment revenues, profit or loss, assets and liabilities and other material items Performance is measured by the CODM based on underlying profit before tax as reported in the management accounts.
Management believes that this underlying profit measure is the most relevant in evaluating the results of the Group.
This information and the reconciliation to the statutory position can be found in note 1.4.
In addition, the management accounts present a Group balance sheet containing assets and liabilities.
