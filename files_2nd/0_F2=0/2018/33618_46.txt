Monetary assets and liabilities, including amounts due from or to subsidiaries, denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are retranslated at year-end exchange rates.
Gains and losses on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the year.
B REVENUE RECOGNITION Dividends proposed by subsidiaries are recognised as income by the Company when they represent a present obligation of the subsidiaries, in the period in which they are formally approved for payment.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
C DIVIDENDS PAYABLE Dividends proposed are recognised when they represent a present obligation, in the period in which they are formally approved for payment.
Accordingly, an interim dividend is recognised when paid and a final dividend is recognised when approved by shareholders.
D INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES Investments in subsidiaries represent equity holdings in subsidiaries and long-term amounts owed by subsidiaries.

Investments are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
The recoverable amount of the investment is the higher of fair value less cost to dispose and value in use.
As explained in Note 36D, amounts owed by subsidiaries due in currencies other than the functional currency are translated at year-end rates of exchange with any exchange differences taken to the profit and loss account.
E CURRENT ASSET INVESTMENTS AND CASH AT BANK AND IN HAND Current asset investments comprise highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value, typically maturing within 12 months.

The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest rate method.

This is considered to be a useful and relevant measure as it is a standard industry measure applied by most major copper mining companies which reflects the direct costs involved in producing each pound of copper.
It therefore allows a straightforward comparison of the unit production cost of different mines, and allows an assessment of the position of a mine on the industry cost curve.
It also provides a simple indication of the profitability of a mine when compared against the price of copper per lb.
