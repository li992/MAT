FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Foreign currency risk Although a substantial proportion of the Groups revenue and profit is earned outside the UK, operating companies generally only trade in their own currency.
The Group is therefore not subject to any significant foreign exchange transactional exposure within these subsidiaries.
The Groups principal exposure to foreign currency lies in the translation of overseas profits into sterling: this exposure is not hedged.
The Groups external Euro denominated borrowings and a proportion of its US Dollar borrowings are designated as a hedge of the net investment in its subsidiaries in the US and Eurozone.
The foreign exchange movements on translation of the borrowings into sterling have therefore been recognised in the translation reserve.
Certain of the Groups intercompany balances have been identified as part of the Groups net investment in foreign operations.
Foreign exchange effects on these balances that remain on consolidation are also reflected in the translation reserve.
The Groups other currency exposures comprise those currency gains and losses recognised in the income statement, reflecting other monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the functional currency of the entity involved.
At 30 September 2018 and 30 September 2017, these exposures were immaterial to the Group.
15 Equity This note analyses the movements recorded through shareholders equity that are not explained elsewhere in the financial statements, being changes in the amount which shareholders have invested in the Group.
The Group utilises share award schemes as part of its employee remuneration package.
Share option schemes for our employees include The Sage Group Performance Share Plan for Directors and senior executives and The Sage Group Savings-related Share Option Plan the SAYE Plan for all qualifying employees.
The Group incurs costs in respect of these schemes in the income statement, which is set out below along with a detailed description of each scheme and the number of options outstanding.
This note also shows the dividends paid in the year and any dividends that are to be proposed and paid post-year end.
Dividends are paid as an amount per ordinary share held.
15.1 Ordinary shares Accounting policy Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where any Group company purchases the Companys equity share capital treasury shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes, is deducted from equity attributable to the owners of the Company until the shares are cancelled or reissued.
