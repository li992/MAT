Employee share schemes GSK operates several employee share schemes, including the Share Value Plan, whereby awards are granted to employees to acquire shares or ADS in GlaxoSmithKline plc at no cost after a three year vesting period and the Performance Share Plan, whereby awards are granted to employees to acquire shares or ADS in GlaxoSmithKline plc at no cost, subject to the achievement by the Group of specified performance targets.
The granting of these restricted share awards has replaced the granting of options to employees as the cost of the schemes more readily equates to the potential gain to be made by the employee.
The Group also operates savings related share option schemes, whereby options are granted to employees to acquire shares in GlaxoSmithKline plc at a discounted price.
Grants of restricted share awards are normally exercisable at the end of the three-year vesting or performance period.
Awards are normally granted to employees to acquire shares or ADS in GlaxoSmithKline plc but in some circumstances may be settled in cash.
Grants under savings-related share option schemes are normally exercisable after three years saving.
In accordance with UK practice, the majority of options under the savings-related share option schemes are granted at a price 20% below the market price ruling at the date of grant.
Options under historical share option schemes were granted at the market price ruling at the date of grant.
The total charge for share-based incentive plans in 2018 was 393 million 2017 347 million: 2016 338 million.
Of this amount, 304 million 2017 276 million: 2016 271 million arose from the Share Value Plan.
See Note 9, Employee Costs for further details.
GlaxoSmithKline share award schemes Share Value Plan Under the Share Value Plan, share awards are granted to certain employees at no cost.
The awards vest after two and a half to three years and there are no performance criteria attached.
The fair value of these awards is determined based on the closing share price on the day of grant, after deducting the expected future dividend yield of 4.8% 2017 4.8%: 2016 4.5% over the duration of the award.

The percentage of each award that vests is based upon the performance of the Group over a defined measurement period with dividends reinvested during the same period.
For awards granted from 2015, the performance conditions are based on three equally weighted measures over a three-year performance period.
These are adjusted free cash flow, TSR and R&D new product performance.
The fair value of the awards is determined based on the closing share price on the day of grant.
For TSR performance elements, this is adjusted by the likelihood of that condition being met, as assessed at the time of grant.
During 2018, awards were made of 4.7 million shares at a weighted fair value of 10.46 and 1.3 million ADS at a weighted fair value of $29.43.
At 31 December 2018, there were outstanding awards over 13.1 million shares and 3.4 million ADS.

Employee share schemes continued Share options and savings-related options For the purposes of valuing savings-related options to arrive at the share-based payment charge, a Black-Scholes option pricing model has been used.
The assumptions used in the model are as follows: 2018 Grant 2017 Grant 2016 Grant Risk-free interest rate 0.76% 0.54% 0.32% Dividend yield 5.3% 5.9% 4.9% Volatility 21% 23% 23% Expected life 3 years 3 years 3 years Savings-related options grant price including 20% discount 12.09 10.86 12.95 Share option Share option Savings-related Options outstanding schemes shares schemes ADS share option schemes Weighted Weighted Weighted Number exercise Number exercise Number exercise 000 price 000 price 000 price At 31 December 2018 1,796 11.96 1,216 $36.19 5,929 11.70 Range of exercise prices on options outstanding at year end 11.60 12.21 $33.42 $38.14 10.13 12.95 Weighted average market price on exercise during year 14.43 $39.77 15.13 Weighted average remaining contractual life 0.9 years 0.9 years 2.6 years Options over 2.9 million shares were granted during the year under the savings-related share option scheme at a weighted average fair value of 2.40.
