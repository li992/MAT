As explained in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the definition of adjusted earnings has been changed to include software amortisation.
The accounting policies have otherwise been consistently applied to all the years presented.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations as adopted by the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the European Union IAS Regulation, and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.

All values are rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand 0.1m except where otherwise indicated.

This report therefore sets out the Groups results for the period from 30 April 2017 to 28 April 2018.

New standards and interpretations not applied The International Accounting Standards Board IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with an effective date for financial years beginning on or after the dates disclosed below and therefore after the date of these financial statements: Effective for annual periods International Accounting Standards and Interpretations beginning on or after Amendments to IAS 19 Plan amendment, curtailment or settlement 1 January 2019 Amendments to IAS 28 Long-term interests in associates and joint ventures 1 January 2019 Amendments to IFRS 2 Clarification of classification and measurement of share based payment transactions 1 January 2018 Amendments to IFRS 9 Prepayment features with negative compensation 1 January 2019 Amendments to IFRS 4 and IFRS 9 Amendments regarding the interaction of IFRS 4 and IFRS 9 1 January 2018 IFRS 9 Financial instruments 1 January 2018 IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers 1 January 2018 IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019 IFRS 17 Insurance contracts 1 January 2021 Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014-2016 Cycle 1 January 2018 Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2015-2017 Cycle 1 January 2019 Amendments to IAS 40 Amendments to clarify transfers of property to, or from, investment property 1 January 2018 IFRIC 22 Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration 1 January 2018 IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments 1 January 2019 Amendments to references to conceptual framework in IFRS 1 January 2020 Not yet adopted for use in the European Union.
i IFRS 9 Financial Instruments effective for year beginning on 29 April 2018 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments is the IASBs replacement of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
The standard includes requirements for recognition and measurement, impairment, derecognition and general hedge accounting.
The Directors believe that the Groups current hedge relationships will continue to qualify as continuing hedges upon adopting the new standard and there will not be a significant change to the carrying value of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group.
As part of our impact assessment, we have updated our internal policy documentation where appropriate to ensure compliance with IFRS 9.
Implementing IFRS 9 is not anticipated to have a significant impact on the Groups financial statements.
Under IFRS 9, the Group will elect to recognise its available for sale investments at fair value through other comprehensive income.
At 28 April 2018, the carrying value was 2.7m.
IFRS 9 introduces expanded disclosure requirements.
These are expected to change the extent of the Groups disclosures about its financial instruments, particularly in the year of adoption of the new standard.
ii IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers effective for year beginning on 29 April 2018 The core principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity will recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration payment to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
In both our rail and bus divisions, performance obligations are clear and transaction prices are even over the period to which they relate and are time apportioned.
During the year ended 28 April 2018, we have performed an impact assessment, which has included reviewing submissions from each Stagecoach Group plc | page 81
