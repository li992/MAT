Group financial statements continued Presentation of consolidated financial statements The Groups significant accounting policies are included at the beginning of the relevant notes to the consolidated financial statements.
This section sets out the basis of preparation, a summary of the Groups critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying accounting policies, and other significant accounting policies which have been applied to the financial statements as a whole.
a Basis of preparation These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB as endorsed by the European Union EU, with interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRICs, and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of investment property, owner occupied property, available-for-sale financial assets, and financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL.
The principal accounting policies set out in these consolidated financial statements have been consistently applied to all financial reporting periods presented.
a i New standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards that have been adopted by the Group The Group has adopted the following new International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs, International Accounting Standards IASs, interpretations and amendments to existing standards, which are effective by EU endorsement for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018: IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 replaces IAS 18 Revenue and provides a new five-step revenue recognition model for determining recognition and measurement of revenue from contracts with customers.
The Groups revenue generated from the following contracts is exempt from this standard: Lease contracts within the scope of IAS 17 Leases Insurance contracts within the scope of IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts Financial instruments within the scope of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement or IFRS 9 Financial Instruments The adoption of this standard has had no significant impact on the timing of revenue recognition of the Group and therefore no restatement of prior periods was required.
The Group did not use any of the practical expedients permitted under IFRS 15.
The Groups accounting policy for revenue within the scope of IFRS 15 has been updated to state that revenue is recognised as performance obligations are satisfied.
The standard introduces a number of new disclosure requirements which are provided in Note 4 of these financial statements.
These include disclosures around: The nature of the performance obligations within contracts with customers Disaggregated revenue and its relationship with revenue reported for each reportable segment Contract asset and liabilities There are no judgements that significantly affect the determination of the amount and timing of revenue from contracts with customers.
Revenue from contracts with customers from continuing operations for the year ended 31 December 2017 consists of 1,479m which was previously presented as fee income, and 7m that was previously presented as other income on the face of the consolidated income statement.
The standard requires the incremental cost of obtaining contracts with customers to be recognised as an asset where it is expected that these costs will be recovered.
These costs have been included as an intangible asset and are shown in Note 14.
Amendments to IFRS 4 Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts The amendments address the consequences of the different effective dates of IFRS 9 and the new insurance contracts standard, IFRS 17.
Insurers are permitted to defer implementation of IFRS 9 until periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021 which is expected to be amended to 1 January 2022 if they satisfy criteria regarding the predominance of their insurance activities, or to apply an overlay approach to remove incremental volatility from the income statement.
At 31 December 2015 the Groups liabilities arising from contracts within the scope of IFRS 4 and liabilities connected with insurance as a percentage of total liabilities were 32% and in excess of 96% respectively: Liabilities connected Liabilities in 31 12 2015 to insurance scope of IFRS 4 m m m Non-participating insurance contract liabilities 21,206 21,206 21,206 Non-participating investment contract liabilities 92,894 92,894 Participating contract liabilities 29,654 29,654 29,654 Deposits received from reinsurers 5,134 5,134 5,134 Third party interest in consolidated funds 17,196 17,196 Other liabilities 6,289 Total liabilities 172,373 55,994 166,084 32% 96% 124 Standard Life Aberdeen 2018 FINANCIAL INFORMATION Therefore the Group was eligible to defer the implementation of IFRS 9.
Following the merger with Aberdeen Asset Management PLC, the predominance of insurances activities was reassessed as at 31 December 2017.
The Group remained eligible to defer and has opted to defer implementation of IFRS 9 in these consolidated financial statements.
Further disclosures required as a result of this deferral are set out in Note 16 and Note 19.
Interpretations and amendments to other standards IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advanced Consideration Amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based payment: Classification and Measurement of Share-based payment transactions Amendments to IAS 40 Investment Property: Transfers of Investment Property Annual Improvements 2014-2016 cycle The Groups accounting policies have been updated to reflect these.
Management considers the implementation of the above interpretations and amendments to existing standards has had no significant impact on the Groups financial statements.
a ii Standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group Certain new standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for the Groups annual accounting periods beginning after 1 January 2018.
The Group has not early adopted the standards, amendments and interpretations described below: IFRS 16 Leases effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 IFRS 16 replaces IAS 17 Leases and introduces a new single accounting approach for lessees for all leases with limited exceptions.
As a result there is no longer a distinction between operating leases and finance leases, and lessees will recognise a liability to make lease payments and an asset representing the right to use the underlying asset during the lease term.
The accounting for leases by lessors remains largely unchanged.
The Group has adopted IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019, and will use the cumulative catch up approach.
The Group intends to use the practical expedients available to apply the new standard solely to leases previously identified in accordance with IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease, to not recognise leases with a low value or whose term ends within 12 months of the date of initial application 1 January 2019, to apply a single discount rate to leases with similar characteristics and the use of IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets relating to onerous leases.
As a result of IFRS 16, assets leased by the Group will be brought onto the statement of financial position at inception of a lease.
The right of use asset will be depreciated over the life of the lease and the interest expense on the lease liability recognised in the income statement.
The present value of the lease liability takes into account prepayments and incentives and will be measured using the incremental borrowing rate.
The main impact on the Group of the standard will be for property that the Group leases for use as office space which is currently classified as operating leases.
The Group estimates that for this property portfolio it will recognise additional right of use assets of approximately 194m and additional lease liabilities of approximately 223m as at 1 January 2019.
The cumulative effect of adopting IFRS 16 will be recognised as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at 1 January 2019, with no restatement of comparative information.
No significant profit impact is expected.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 for the Group IFRS 9 replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
IFRS 9 allows two measurement categories for financial assets in the statement of financial position: amortised cost and fair value.
All equity instruments and derivative instruments are measured at fair value.
A debt instrument is measured at amortised cost only if it is held to collect contractual cash flows and the cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, otherwise it is classified at fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI or fair value through profit or loss FVTPL depending on the business model it is held within or whether the option to adopt FVTPL has been applied.
Changes in value of all equity instruments and derivative instruments are recognised in profit or loss unless an OCI presentation election is made at initial recognition for an equity instrument or a derivative instrument is designated as a hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge.
IFRS 9 also introduces a new impairment model, an expected credit loss model which will replace the current incurred loss model in IAS 39.
An impairment loss will now be recognised prior to a loss event occurring.
Accounting for financial liabilities remains the same as under IAS 39 except that for financial liabilities designated as at FVTPL, changes in the fair value due to changes in the liabilitys credit risk are recognised in OCI.
Additionally IFRS 9 amends the current requirements for assessing hedge effectiveness in IAS 39 and also amends what qualifies as a hedged item and some of the restrictions on what qualifies as a hedging instrument.
The accounting and presentation requirements for designated hedging relationships remain largely unchanged.
IFRS 9 contains an election to continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39.
As well as presentation and measurement changes, IFRS 9 also introduces additional disclosure requirements.
As noted in a i above, the Group was eligible to defer and has opted to defer implementation of IFRS 9 in these consolidated financial statements.
On 31 August 2018, the Group disposed of the UK and European insurance business refer Note 1 for further details.
Following the sale, the Group no longer has significant liabilities within the scope of IFRS 4 and is required to adopt IFRS 9 on or before 1 January 2020.
The Group has adopted IFRS 9 on 1 January 2019.
The Group has elected to continue applying the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39.
At 31 December 2018, the Group has available-for-sale debt securities with a fair value of 862m with a corresponding available-for-sale financial assets reserve balance of 7m and deferred tax liability of 1m.
On adoption of IFRS 9, these debt securities will be recognised at 1 January 2019 at their amortised cost less expected credit losses of 854m.
The available-for-sale financial assets reserve balance and the related deferred tax liability will no longer be recognised.
The expected credit losses at 1 January 2019 are less than 1m.
Group financial statements continued At 31 December 2018, the Group also had subordinated liabilities of 1,081m.
Under IFRS 9, where the terms of a financial liability are modified and the modification does not result in the derecognition of the liability, the liability is adjusted to the net present value of the future cash flows less transaction costs with a modification gain or loss recognised in the income statement.
During the year ended 31 December 2018, the terms of the 4.25% US Dollar fixed rate subordinated notes were modified refer Note 34.
Consequently, on adoption of IFRS 9, these subordinated liabilities will be recognised at 1 January 2019 at a revised amortised cost of 1,086m.
The impact on retained earnings will be 5m.
The adoption of IFRS 9 will not significantly impact the other financial assets and liabilities which are currently measured at FVTPL or amortised cost in accordance with IAS 39, and will have no significant impact on profit.
The Company and a number of subsidiaries adopted IFRS 9 at 1 January 2018 for their separate financial statements.
The Companys financial statements can be found in Section 9.
The financial statements of UK subsidiaries which have adopted IFRS 9 including Standard Life Investments Limited, Aberdeen Asset Management PLC and Standard Life Savings Limited will be available from Companies House.
IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021, expected to be amended to 1 January 2022 IFRS 17 was issued in May 2017 and will replace IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts.
IFRS 4 is an interim standard which permits the continued application of accounting policies, for insurance contracts and contracts with discretionary participation features, which were being used at transition to IFRS except where a change satisfies criteria set out in IFRS 4.
IFRS 17 introduces new required measurement and presentation accounting policies for such contracts which reflect the view that these contracts combine features of a financial instrument and a service contract.
IFRS 17s measurement model, which applies to groups of contracts, combines a risk-adjusted present value of future cash flows and an amount representing unearned profit.
On transition retrospective application is required unless impracticable, in which case either a modified retrospective approach or a fair value approach is required.
IFRS 17 introduces a new approach to presentation in the income statement and statement of comprehensive income.
Following the sale of the UK and European insurance business, the Group has limited direct exposure to insurance contracts and contracts with discretionary participating features which will be impacted by the adoption of IFRS 17.
However, the results of the Groups insurance associates, Phoenix and HDFC Life, are expected to be significantly impacted by IFRS 17.
The standard has not yet been endorsed by the EU.
Other IFRIC 23: Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 IFRIC 23 clarifies how to apply the recognition and measurement requirements in IAS 12 Income Taxes.
The Interpretation addresses issues relating to uncertain tax treatments.
An uncertain tax treatment is a tax treatment for which there is uncertainty over whether the relevant tax authority will accept the tax treatment under tax law.
A tax treatment is the treatment used or planned to be used in an entities income tax filings.
The Group adopted IFRIC 23 on 1 January 2019.
The clarifications set out in IFRIC 23 have not had a material impact on the Groups financial statements.
There are no other new standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards that have been published that are expected to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
a iii Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying accounting policies The preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise judgements in applying accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses arising during the year.
Judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty are continually evaluated and based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The areas where judgements have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements are as follows: Financial statement area Critical judgements in applying accounting policies Related note Defined benefit pension plans Assessment of whether the Group has an unconditional right to a refund of the Note 35 surplus Treatment of tax relating to the surplus Investments in associates Determining whether the investment in Phoenix should be classified as an Note 16 associate Identification, valuation and determination of useful lives for equity accounting purposes, of the Groups share of its associates intangible assets at the date of acquisition of an investment in the associate Intangible assets Identification and valuation of intangible assets arising from business Note 14 combinations Determining the group of cash-generating units to which goodwill acquired in a business combination should be allocated Provisions Determining whether a provision is required for separation costs Note 38 126 Standard Life Aberdeen 2018 FINANCIAL INFORMATION During the year to 31 December 2018 the following changes have been made to critical judgements in applying accounting policies: We have identified critical judgements in applying accounting policies for investments in associates, for determining the cash-generating units to which goodwill acquired in a business combination should be allocated and for determining whether a provision should be recognised for separation costs As a result of the disposal of the UK and European insurance business the judgements in applying the accounting policies for the classification of insurance, reinsurance and investment contracts and for the assessment of control or significant influence of structured entities are no longer considered to be critical judgements as these judgements only impact the presentation of amounts within discontinued operations.
The assessment of whether the group has a contingent liability in relation to conduct matters is no longer considered to be a critical judgement.
There are no other changes to critical judgements from the prior year.
The areas where assumptions and other sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are as follows: Financial statement area Critical accounting estimates and assumptions Related note Financial instruments at fair value through Determination of the fair value of contingent consideration assets and Notes 19, 37 and profit or loss liabilities 41 Defined benefit pension plans Determination of principal UK pension plan assumptions for mortality, Note 35 discount rate and inflation Intangible assets Determination of useful lives Note 14 Determination of the recoverable amount in relation to impairment assessment of goodwill, customer relationships and investment management contract intangibles Investments in associates Determination of the recoverable amount in relation to the impairment Note 16 assessment of investments in associates The following changes have been made to critical accounting estimates and assumptions as a result of the disposal of the UK and European insurance business and the acquisition of an interest in Phoenix: We have identified estimates used in relation to the recoverable amount of investments in associates accounted for using the equity method as a critical area of estimation uncertainty We have also identified the valuation of contingent consideration assets and liabilities relating to the disposal as a critical area of estimation uncertainty We have removed the critical estimates and assumptions related to the valuation of participating contracts, non-participating contracts and reinsurance contracts, investment property, level 3 private equity investments and debt securities, and the measurement of the provision for annuity sales practices.
These assumptions and estimates have been removed as they primarily related to the UK and European insurance business.
All other critical accounting estimates and assumptions are the same as the prior year.
Further detail on critical accounting estimates and assumptions is provided in the relevant note.
Group financial statements continued a iv Foreign currency translation The consolidated financial statements are presented in million pounds Sterling.
The statements of financial position of Group entities, including associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method, that have a different functional currency than the Groups presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency at the year end exchange rate and their income statements and cash flows are translated at average exchange rates for the year.
All resulting exchange differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income and the foreign currency translation reserve in equity.
On disposal of a Group entity the cumulative amount of any such exchange differences recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction.
Gains and losses arising from such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the relevant line in the consolidated income statement.
Translation differences on non-monetary items, such as equity securities held at fair value through profit or loss, are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss within net investment return in the consolidated income statement.
Translation differences on financial assets and liabilities held at amortised cost are included in the relevant line in the consolidated income statement.
The income statements and cash flows, and statements of financial position of Group entities that have a different functional currency from the Groups presentation currency have been translated using the following principal exchange rates: 2018 2017 Income statement and Statement of financial Income statement and cash Statement of financial cash flows average rate position closing rate flows average rate position closing rate Euro 1.129 1.114 1.145 1.126 US Dollar 1.333 1.274 1.297 1.353 Indian Rupee 90.711 88.913 84.474 86.341 Chinese Renminbi 8.818 8.744 8.753 8.809 Hong Kong Dollar 10.444 9.971 10.104 10.575 Singapore Dollar 1.795 1.736 1.787 1.808 b Basis of consolidation The Groups financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are all entities including investment vehicles over which the Group has control.
Control arises when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
For operating entities this generally accompanies a shareholding of 50% or more in the entity.
For investment vehicles, including structured entities, the control assessment also considers the removal rights of other investors and whether the Group acts as principal or agent in assessing the link between power and variable returns.
In determining whether the Group acts as principal, and therefore controls the entity, the removal rights of other investors and the magnitude of the variability associated with the returns are also taken into account.
As a result, the Group often is considered to control investment vehicles in which its shareholding is less than 50%.
Where the Group is considered to control an investment vehicle, such as an open-ended investment company, a unit trust or a limited partnership, and it is therefore consolidated, the interests of parties other than the Group are assessed to determine whether they should be classified as liabilities or as non-controlling interests.
The liabilities are recognised in the third party interest in consolidated funds line in the consolidated statement of financial position and any movements are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
The financial liability is designated at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL as it is implicitly managed on a fair value basis as its value is directly linked to the market value of the underlying portfolio of assets.
The interests of parties other than the Group in all other types of entities are recorded as non-controlling interests.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in full.
The Group uses the acquisition method to account for acquisitions of businesses.
At the acquisition date the assets and liabilities of the business acquired and any non-controlling interests are identified and initially measured at fair value on the consolidated statement of financial position.
When the Group acquires or disposes of a subsidiary, the profits and losses of the subsidiary are included from the date on which control was transferred to the Group until the date on which it ceases, with consistent accounting policies applied across all entities throughout.
When the Group sells a subsidiary to an associate, the gain on sale of the subsidiary is recognised in full, with no elimination being made for the continuing interest in the subsidiary.

A full list of the Companys subsidiaries is provided in Note 49. b Acquisitions b i Subsidiaries On 27 April 2018, Aberdeen Asset Management Inc. purchased the US business of specialist commodity exchange traded product provider ETF Securities by purchasing the entire members interests of ETF Securities USA LLC, ETF Securities US LLC and ETF Securities Advisers LLC.
The acquisition broadens Aberdeen Standard Investments suite of investment capabilities with the addition of a range of commodity-based Exchange Traded Funds.
It also provides the platform and expertise to enable Aberdeen Standard Investments to grow its existing Smart Beta capability by launching strategies within an Exchange Traded Fund vehicle structure.
At the acquisition date the consideration, net assets acquired and resulting goodwill from the ETF Securities acquisition were as follows: 1 27 April 2018 m Cash 27 Fair value of earn-out payment 8 Consideration 35 Fair value of net assets acquired Customer-related intangible assets 28 Receivables and other financial assets 1 Cash and cash equivalents 1 Total assets 30 Other financial liabilities 2 Total liabilities 2 Goodwill 7 1 The fair value of the earn-out payment of 8m has been calculated by reference to revenue retention and increases in assets under management and could range from nil to 10m.
Customer-related intangible assets relate to the existing customer relationships in place at the acquisition date.
The full amount of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
The amounts of revenue from contracts with customers and profit contributed to the Groups consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 December 2018 from the acquired ETF Securities business were 5m and nil respectively.
The profit contributed excludes amortisation of intangible assets acquired through business combinations.

Other presentation differences generally relate to items included in administrative expenses which are borne by policyholders, for example investment property management expenses, or are directly related to fee income.
Other presentation differences also include Aberdeen Standard Investments commission expenses which are presented in expenses in the consolidated income statement but are netted against adjusted operating income in the analysis of Group adjusted profit by segment.

Investment return Gains and losses resulting from changes in both market value and foreign exchange on investments classified at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in the consolidated income statement in the period in which they occur.
The gains and losses include investment income received such as interest payments but exclude dividend income.
Dividend income is separately recognised in the consolidated income statement when the right to receive payment is established.
Interest income on financial instruments classified as available-for-sale or loans and receivables is separately recognised in the consolidated income statement using the effective interest rate method.
The effective interest rate method allocates interest and other finance costs at a constant rate over the expected life of the financial instrument, or where appropriate a shorter period, by using as the interest rate the rate that exactly discounts the future cash receipts over the expected life to the net carrying value of the instrument.
Rental income from investment property is recognised in the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives granted such as rent free periods are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income and are spread over the term of the lease.

Group financial statements continued Asset management Through a number of its subsidiaries, the Group provides asset management to its customers.
This performance obligation is performed over time with the revenue recognised as the obligation is performed.
The Group generally receives asset management fees based on the percentage of the assets under management.
The percentage varies depending on the level and nature of assets under management.
Asset management fees are either deducted from assets or invoiced.
Deducted fees are generally calculated, recognised and collected on a daily basis.
Other asset management fees are invoiced to the customer either monthly or quarterly with receivables recognised for unpaid invoices.
The payment terms for invoiced revenue vary but are typically 30 days from receipt of invoice.
Accrued income is recognised to account for income earned but not yet invoiced.
There is also limited use of performance fees.
Performance fees are only recognised once it is highly probable that the revenue will be received.
Fund platforms Through a number of its subsidiaries, the Group offers customers access to fund platforms.
The platforms give customers the ongoing functionality to manage and administer their investments.
Customers pay a platform charge which is generally calculated as a percentage of their assets.
The percentage varies depending on the level of assets on the specific platform.
The main platform charges are calculated either daily or monthly and are collected and recognised monthly.
The charges are collected directly from assets on the platform.
There are no significant payment terms.

Restructuring and corporate transaction expenses Total restructuring and corporate transaction expenses incurred from continuing operations during the year were 231m 2017: 162m.
The 2018 expenses mainly relate to integration and merger related costs of 191m 2017: 109m and a number of other business unit restructuring programmes.
Deal costs relating to acquisitions included in restructuring and corporate transaction expenses for the year ended 31 December 2018 were 1m 2017: 38m.

For the purposes of determining adjusted profit from continuing operations, an additional 8m was recognised in 2018 relating to our share of insurance associate restructuring and corporate transaction expenses 2017: nil.
Restructuring and corporate transaction expenses of 264m 2017: 11m are used to determine adjusted profit before tax from discontinued operations.
In 2018 these expenses mainly relate to the sale of the UK and European insurance business discussed in Note 1.
This includes separation costs of 53m 2017: nil and 198m 2017: nil in relation to the redemption of Tier 1 subordinated bonds.
A further 80m of separation costs have been included in the gain on sale relating to contractual obligations arising from the transaction.
In 2017, an additional 3m of restructuring and corporate transaction expenses were incurred by the Heritage With Profits Fund.

Taxation The Groups tax expense comprises both current tax and deferred tax expense.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on taxable profit for the year.
A deferred tax asset represents a tax deduction that is expected to arise in a future period.
It is only recognised to the extent that there is expected to be future taxable profit or investment return to offset the tax deduction.
A deferred tax liability represents taxes which will become payable in a future period as a result of a current or prior year transaction.
Where local tax law allows, deferred tax assets and liabilities are netted off on the statement of financial position.
The tax rates used to determine deferred tax are those enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries and associates unless the timing of the reversal is in our control and it is expected that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Current tax and deferred tax is recognised in the consolidated income statement except when it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case it is credited or charged to other comprehensive income or directly to equity respectively.

The share of associates and joint ventures tax expense is 40m 2017: 41m and is included in profit before tax in the consolidated income statement in Share of profit from associates and joint ventures.
In 2018 unrecognised tax losses from previous years were used to reduce the current tax expense by 4m 2017: 3m.
Unrecognised tax losses and timing differences were used to reduce the deferred tax expense by nil 2017: 3m.
Current tax recoverable and current tax liabilities at 31 December 2018 were 6m 2017: 192m and 23m 2017: 166m respectively.
Current tax assets and liabilities at 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017 are expected to be recoverable or payable in less than 12 months.

Group financial statements continued The standard UK corporation tax rate for the accounting period is 19%.
The UK corporation tax rate will reduce to 17% from 1 April 2020.
This change has been taken into account in the calculation of the UK deferred tax balance at 31 December 2018.
The accounting for certain items in the consolidated income statement results in certain reconciling items in the table above, the values of which vary from year to year depending upon the underlying accounting values: Details of significant reconciling items are as follows: Permanent differences in 2018 include expenses and accounting losses which are not tax deductible for tax purposes.
It also includes the difference between the tax basis and accounting value for employee share-based awards and non-deductible contributions to the Irish pension scheme.
In 2017, there were a number of non-recurring items including non-taxable gains arising from the IPO of HDFC Life, a tax deductible donation made to Standard Life Foundation offset by expenses relating to the acquisition of Aberdeen which were not tax deductible.
The share of profit from associates and joint ventures is presented net of tax in the consolidated income statement and therefore gives rise to a reconciling item The impairment of the goodwill intangible asset is not tax deductible Impairment of investment in associates is not tax deductible Different tax rates will vary according to the level of profit subject to tax at rates different from the UK corporation tax rate such as in our Asian business and in 2018 mainly comprises a non-recurring reconciling item from the gain on sale made on the IPO of HDFC AMC.
This arose as the Indian rate of tax on capital gains is less than the UK corporate tax rate.
The ability to value tax losses and other tax assets also affects the tax charge.
There is a non-recurring tax credit of 12m attributable to the deferred tax liability relating to intangible assets recognised from the Aberdeen merger in 2017.
We have also not recognised a deferred tax asset of 10m on tax losses arising in the year due to uncertainty as to when these losses will be utilised.
The Group operates in a large number of territories and during the normal course of business will be subject to audit or enquiry by local tax authorities.
At any point in time the Group will also be engaged in commercial transactions the tax outcome of which may be uncertain due to their complexity or uncertain application of tax law.
Tax provisions, therefore, are subject to a level of estimation and judgement and may result in the Group recognising provisions for uncertain tax positions.
Management will provide for uncertain tax positions where they judge that it is probable there will be a future outflow of economic benefits from the Group to settle the obligation.
In assessing uncertain tax positions management considers each issue on its own merits using their judgement as to the estimate of the most likely outcome.
Where the final outcome differs from the amount provided this difference will impact the tax charge in future periods.
Management re-assesses provisions at each reporting date based upon latest available information.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that the losses will be capable of being offset against taxable profits and gains in future periods.
The value attributed to them takes into account the certainty or otherwise of their recoverability.
Their recoverability is measured against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and anticipated taxable profits and gains based on business plans.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled after more than 12 months.
e Unrecognised deferred tax Due to uncertainty regarding recoverability, deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of the following: Cumulative losses carried forward of 74m in the UK and 268m overseas 2017: 90m, 293m respectively Tax reserves of the German branch of SLAL of nil 2017: 102m Loss relating to Irish pension scheme deficit nil 2017: 42m Of these unrecognised deferred tax assets, certain losses have expiry dates as follows: US losses of 169m with expiry dates between 2027-2037 Other overseas losses of 11m with expiry dates before 2023 Other overseas losses of 3m with expiry dates between 2024 and 2028 Standard Life Aberdeen 2018 141 8.
Discontinued operations The Group classifies as discontinued operations areas of business which have been disposed of or are classified as held for sale at the year end and which either, represent a separate major line of business or geographical area, or are part of a plan to dispose of one.
The results of discontinued operations are shown separately on the face of the consolidated income statement from the results of the remaining continuing parts of the Groups business.
Discontinued operations relate solely to the UK and European insurance business.
The sale completed on 31 August 2018 refer Note 1.

Revenue from contracts with customers is shown net of elimination of intra-group revenue which will continue post completion.
The Group provides additional disclosure in relation to the total tax expense for discontinued operations.
Certain products are subject to tax on policyholders investment returns.
This tax, policyholder tax, is accounted for as an element of income tax.
To make the tax expense disclosure more meaningful, we disclose policyholder tax and tax payable on equity holders profits separately.
The policyholder tax expense is the amount payable in the period plus the movement of amounts expected to be payable in future periods by policyholders on their investment return.
The remainder of the tax expense is attributed to equity holders as tax payable on equity holders profit.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing profit attributable to ordinary equity holders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding shares owned by the employee trusts that have not vested unconditionally to employees.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year to assume the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, such as share options granted to employees.
Adjusted earnings per share is calculated on adjusted profit after tax attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Company i. e. adjusted profit net of dividends paid on preference shares.
Basic earnings per share was 29.1p 2017: 29.8p and diluted earnings per share was 29.1p 2017: 29.6p for the year ended 31 December 2018.
The following table shows details of basic, diluted and adjusted earnings per share.

In accordance with IAS 33, no share options and awards were treated as dilutive for the year ended 31 December 2018 due to the loss attributable to equity holders of the Company from continuing operations in the year.
This results in the adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations and the total diluted earnings per share including discontinued operations being calculated using a weighted average number of ordinary shares of 2,848 million.
As discussed in Note 26 the Company undertook a share consolidation during the year followed by a return of capital to shareholders.
In accordance with IAS 33, earnings per share have not been restated following the share consolidation as there was an overall corresponding change in resources due to the redemption of the B shares.
As a result of the share consolidation and share buyback, earnings per share from continuing operations for the year ended 31 December 2018 is not directly comparable with the prior year.

Adjusted profit and adjusting items Adjusted profit before tax is the Groups key alternative performance measure.
Adjusted profit excludes the impact of the following items: Restructuring costs and corporate transaction expenses.
Restructuring includes the impact of major regulatory change.
Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and through the purchase of customer contracts Profit or loss arising on the disposal of a subsidiary, joint venture or associate Fair value movements in contingent consideration Items which are one-off and, due to their size or nature, are not indicative of the long-term operating performance of the Group Adjusted profit also excludes impacts arising from investment return variances formerly called short-term fluctuations in investment return and economic assumption changes in the Groups insurance entities.
It is calculated based on expected returns on investments backing equity holder funds, with consistent allowance for the corresponding expected movements in equity holder liabilities.
Impacts arising from the difference between the expected return and actual return on investments, and the corresponding impact on equity holder liabilities except where they are directly related to a significant management action, are excluded from adjusted profit and are presented within profit before tax.
The impact of certain changes in economic assumptions is also excluded from adjusted profit and is presented within profit before tax.
Coupons payable on perpetual notes classified as non-controlling interests for which interest is accrued are included in adjusted profit before tax.
For IFRS purposes, these are recognised directly in equity.
This gave rise to an adjusting item in 2017, prior to the reclassification of such instruments to subordinated liabilities on 18 December 2017.
Dividends payable on preference shares classified as non-controlling interests are excluded from adjusted profit in line with the treatment of ordinary shares.
Similarly to preference shares, our share of interest payable on Tier 1 debt instruments held by associates, for which interest is only accounted for when paid, is excluded from adjusted profit.
a Investment return variances and economic assumptions changes insurance entities Wholly owned insurance entities The Groups UK and European insurance business was sold during the year and is classified as discontinued operations.
The Groups other wholly owned insurance business, SL Asia, is classified as held for sale see Note 24.
The components of IFRS profit attributable to market movements and interest rate changes which give rise to variances between actual and expected returns on investments backing equity holder funds, with consistent allowance for the corresponding expected movement in equity holder liabilities, as well as the impact of changes in economic assumptions on equity holder liabilities, are excluded from adjusted profit for the Groups wholly owned insurance entities.
Investments backing equity holder funds include investments backing annuities and subordinated debt, and investments from surplus capital in insurance companies.
For annuities this means that all fluctuations in liabilities and the assets backing those liabilities due to market interest rate including credit risk movements over the year are excluded from adjusted profit.
The expected rates of return for debt securities and equity securities are determined separately.
The expected rates of return for equity securities are determined based on the gilt spot rates of an appropriate duration plus an equity risk premium of 3% 2017: 3%.
Investments in pooled investment funds which target equity returns over the longer term, including absolute return funds, also use an expected rate of return determined based on the gilt spot rates of an appropriate duration plus a risk premium of 3% 2017: 3%.
In respect of debt securities at fair value through profit or loss, the expected rate of return is determined based on the average prospective yields for the debt securities actually held.
The expected rates of return used for both the assets backing subordinated liabilities and the subordinated liabilities themselves include a discount for expected credit defaults.
This means that the interest expense included in adjusted profit for subordinated liabilities is after deducting a margin for own credit risk.
Additionally, the effect of the accounting mismatch, where subordinated liabilities are measured at amortised cost and certain assets backing the liabilities are measured at fair value, is also excluded from adjusted profit.
There have been no actual defaults or impairments of assets backing subordinated liabilities during the year ended 31 December 2018 or 31 December 2017.
If these were to arise they would be excluded from adjusted profit.
Gains and losses on foreign exchange are deemed to represent investment return variances and economic assumption changes and thus are excluded from adjusted profit.
Investment return variances and economic assumption changes for the year ended 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017 relate principally to the impact of interest rate changes on UK annuity liabilities and the assets backing those liabilities.
Group financial statements continued Associates and joint ventures insurance entities Where associates and joint ventures have a policy for determining investment return variances and economic assumption changes, the Group uses the policy of the associate or joint venture for including their results in the Groups adjusted profit.
This currently applies only to the Groups investment in Phoenix.
The Phoenix policy is similar to that used by the wholly owned insurance entities as described above.
The main differences are as follows: Phoenix investment return variances, including those relating to owners funds, include gains and losses on derivatives held to hedge life company Solvency II surplus positions.
Such hedging positions were not previously held outside with profit funds by wholly owned insurance entities.
Phoenix recognise charges on unit linked business based on expected investment returns, whereas wholly owned insurance entities use actual investment returns.
Phoenix include the impact of strategic asset allocation activities, such as investment in higher yielding illiquid assets, as investment variances.
Wholly owned subsidiaries treat these within adjusted profit where they are directly related to a significant management action.
b Other In the reconciliation of consolidated adjusted profit before tax to profit for the period the Other adjusting item sub-total includes 2m 2017: 24m in relation to the impairment of a disposal group classified as held for sale and 3m 2017: 1m net fair value movements in contingent consideration.
The Other adjusting item in 2018 relating to discontinued operations includes a held for sale accounting adjustment relating to the amortisation of intangible assets primarily deferred acquisition costs and depreciation of tangible assets of 44m.
Following the classification of the UK and European insurance business as held for sale on the announcement of the proposed transaction on 23 February 2018, no amortisation or depreciation was recognised.
This increase to profit has been recognised as an adjusting item.
Dividends on ordinary shares Dividends are distributions of profit to holders of Standard Life Aberdeen plcs share capital and as a result are recognised as a deduction in equity.
Final dividends are announced with the Annual report and accounts and are recognised when they have been approved by shareholders.
Interim dividends are announced with the Half year results and are recognised when they are paid.

The final recommended dividend will be paid on 21 May 2019 to shareholders on the Companys register as at 12 April 2019, subject to approval at the 2019 Annual General Meeting.
After the current year final recommended dividend, the total dividend in respect of the year ended 31 December 2018 is 21.60p 2017: 21.30p.
In addition to the dividend distribution on ordinary shares, the Group returned 33.99 pence per ordinary share 1,000m to shareholders through a B share scheme as discussed in Note 26.
Intangible assets Goodwill is created when the Group acquires a business and the consideration exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired.
In determining the net assets acquired in business combinations, intangible assets are recognised where they are separable or arise from contractual or legal rights.
Intangible assets acquired by the Group through business combinations consist mainly of customer relationships, technology and brands.
Any remaining value that cannot be identified as a separate intangible asset on acquisition forms part of goodwill.
In addition to intangibles acquired through business combinations, the Group recognises as intangible assets software which has been developed internally and other purchased technology which is used in managing and executing our business.
Costs to develop software internally are capitalised after the research phase and when it has been established that the project is technically feasible and the Group has both the intention and ability to use the completed asset.
Intangible assets are recognised at cost and amortisation is charged to the income statement over the length of time the Group expects to derive benefits from the asset.
The allocation of the income statement charge to each reporting period is dependent on the expected pattern over which future benefits are expected to be derived.
Where this pattern cannot be determined reliably the charge is allocated on a straightline basis.
Goodwill is not charged to the income statement unless it becomes impaired.
The Group also recognises the cost of obtaining customer contracts see Note 4 as an intangible asset.
For the cost of obtaining customer contracts, the intangible asset is amortised on the same basis as the transfer to the customer of the services to which the intangible asset relates.

2 Included in goodwill impairment losses recognised of 891m 2017: 5m is an impairment of 880m 2017: nil recognised on the goodwill primarily arising from the acquisition of Aberdeen and 11m 2017: 5m included in other administrative expenses in Note 5.
The Groups goodwill has been acquired through a series of business combinations, most recently through the acquisitions discussed in Note 1.
Of the Groups goodwill of 2,532m 2017: 3,427m at 31 December 2018, 2,483m 2017: 3,354m is attributed to the Aberdeen Standard Investments group of cash-generating units, which comprises the Groups asset management business excluding HDFC AMC, in the Asset management and platforms segment.
The remaining goodwill of 49m 2017: 73m is attributable to a number of smaller cash-generating units in the Asset management and platforms segment.
Acquisition of Aberdeen in 2017 The additions to goodwill and intangible assets acquired through business combinations during the year to 31 December 2017 related solely to the acquisition of Aberdeen.
On the acquisition of Aberdeen, we identified intangible assets in relation to customer relationships, brand and technology as being separable from goodwill.
Identification and valuation of intangible assets acquired in business combinations is a key judgement.
Goodwill Goodwill of 3,209m was attributed to the Aberdeen Standard Investments group of cash-generating units in relation to the acquisition of Aberdeen.
In attributing the goodwill relating to the acquisition of Aberdeen to a group of cash-generating units we considered the existing cashgenerating units which are expected to benefit from the synergies from the combination.
As the benefit is expected to arise across Aberdeen Standard Investments a combination of Aberdeen and Standard Life Investments now managed and reported together within the Asset management and platforms segment we judged it was appropriate to allocate goodwill to this group of cash-generating units.
This is the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
The goodwill arising on acquisition of Aberdeen was mainly attributable to expected cash flows from new customers and significant synergies which are expected to be realised.
Synergies expected to be available to all market participants which impact the cash flows relating to existing Aberdeen customer relationships were included in the valuation of the customer relationships discussed below, with additional synergies forming part of goodwill.
Group financial statements continued Customer relationships The customer relationships acquired through Aberdeen were grouped where the customer groups have similar economic characteristics and similar useful economic lives.
This gave rise to three separate intangible assets which we have termed Lloyds Banking Group, open ended funds, and segregated and similar.
In relation to the open ended funds we considered that it was most appropriate to recognise an intangible asset relating to customer relationships between Aberdeen and open ended fund customers, rather than an intangible asset relating to investment management agreements between Aberdeen and Aberdeens open ended funds.
Our judgement was that the value associated with the open ended fund assets under management was predominantly derived from the underlying customer relationships, taking into account that a significant proportion of these assets under management are from institutional clients.
The description of the three separate intangible assets including their estimated useful life at the acquisition date was as follows: Customer relationship Useful life at Fair value on Carrying intangible asset Description acquisition date acquisition date value m m Lloyds Banking Group Customer relationship with Lloyds Banking Group, including 4 years 78 4 Scottish Widows Group.
Open ended funds Separate vehicle group open ended investment vehicles.
11 years 223 138 Segregated and similar All other vehicle groups dominated by segregated mandates 12 years 427 338 which represent 75% of this group.
Measuring the fair value of intangible assets acquired in business combinations required further assumptions and judgements.
Customer relationships were valued using discounted cash flow projections.
The key assumptions in measuring the fair value of the customer relationships at the acquisition date were as follows: Net attrition net attrition represents the expected rate of outflows of assets under management net of inflows from existing customers.
This assumption is primarily based on recent experience.
Market growth a market growth adjustment has been applied based on the asset class Operating margin this assumption is consistent with forecast margins and includes the impact of synergies that would be expected by any market participant and impact the Aberdeen customer relationship cash flows Discount rate this assumption is based on the internal rate of return IRR of the transaction and is consistent with a market participant discount rate The above assumptions, and in particular the net attrition assumption, were also used to determine the useful economic life at the acquisition date of each asset used for amortisation.
The reducing balance method of amortisation is considered appropriate for these intangibles, consistent with the attrition pattern on customer relationships which means that the economic benefits delivered from the existing customer base will reduce disproportionately over time.
148 Standard Life Aberdeen 2018 FINANCIAL INFORMATION Estimates and assumptions The key estimates and assumptions in relation to intangible assets are: Determination of the recoverable amount of goodwill and customer intangibles Determination of useful lives Determination of the recoverable amount of goodwill and customer intangibles Goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually by comparing the recoverable amount of each cash-generating-unit to which goodwill has been allocated with its carrying value.
For all intangible assets, an assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is an indication that the goodwill or intangible asset has become impaired.
If any indication of impairment exists and the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount then the carrying value is written down to the recoverable amount.
The recoverable amounts are defined as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use where the value in use is based on the present value of future cashflows.
In assessing value in use, expected future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate.
Judgement is required in assessing both the expected cash flows and an appropriate discount rate which is based on current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks associated with the asset.
Goodwill The impairment of goodwill in 2018 includes 880m 2017: nil relating to an impairment of the Aberdeen Standard Investments group of  which is in the Asset management and platforms segment.
The impairment resulted from the impact of markets and flows on future earnings expectations.
The recoverable amount of this group of , which is based on value in use, at 31 December 2018 is 4,111m.
This was calculated using a terminal growth rate of 2.2% based on global GDP and a pre-tax discount rate of 11.1% based on the group cost of equity adjusted for forecasting risk.
Cash flow projections for three years to end 2021 were based on management approved forecasts adjusted to market conditions at 31 December 2018.
The impairment has been included within administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement.
The recoverable amount in the prior year was based on fair value less costs of disposal.
The following table shows the consequence of downside sensitivities of key assumptions on the carrying amount of the goodwill balance at 31 December 2018.
Goodwill m Reduction in growth rate of 0.2% 93 Discount rate increased by 0.5% 231 Forecast cash flows reduced by 5% 206 Customer intangibles The recoverable amount for customer intangible assets is value in use.
The 2018 impairment of 35m relates to the open-ended funds customer relationship intangible asset which is in the Asset management and platforms segment and which was recognised on the acquisition of Aberdeen.
The recoverable amount of this asset which is its value in use is 138m and was calculated using a pre-tax discount rate of 13.1%.
The remaining useful life as at 31 December 2018 is 9.7 years.
Group financial statements continued In relation to customer relationships acquired in business combinations, the most significant judgements relate to assumptions for the openended intangible assets acquired through the acquisition of Aberdeen.
The following table shows the consequence of downside sensitivities of key assumptions to the carrying amounts at 31 December 2018: Open-ended m 20% increase in net attrition 16 10% one-off decrease in AUM at 1 January 2019 14 Operating margin percentage decreased by 2.5% 19 Discount rate percentage increased by 2% 8 The carrying value of the life company customer relationships contracts acquired through Ignis at 31 December 2018 is 42m 2017: 50m.
The remaining amortisation period of the life contracts is 9.5 years.
As at 31 December 2018, increasing the discount rate by 2%, decreasing the operating margin by 2.5% or decreasing the AUM by 10% would not result in an impairment loss and therefore would have no impact on carrying value.
In February 2018 Lloyds Banking Group LBG and Scottish Widows informed the Group that Scottish Widows and LBG's Wealth business intended to review their long term asset management arrangements including those services that are currently undertaken by certain legacy Aberdeen entities.
The impairment of customer relationship and investment management contracts intangible assets in 2017 of 40m related to this announcement and was an impairment of the Lloyds Banking Group customer relationship intangible asset in the Asset management and platforms segment.
The recoverable amount of this asset, which is its value in use, at 31 December 2017 was 26m and was calculated using a pre-tax discount rate of 13%.
The remaining useful live was 1.1 years.
The other key assumptions used to measure the value in use calculation as at 31 December 2017 were consistent with those used in the acquisition date valuation set out on page 148.
Determination of useful lives The determination of useful lives requires judgement in respect of the length of time that the Group expects to derive benefits from the asset and considers for example expected duration of customer relationships and when technology is expected to become obsolete for technology based assets.
The amortisation period and method for each of the Groups intangible asset categories is as follows: Customer relationships acquired through business combinations generally between 7 and 12 years, generally reducing balance method Investment management contracts acquired through business combinations between 10 and 17 years, straight-line Brand acquired through business combinations 5 years, straight-line Technology acquired through business combinations between 3 and 6 years, straight line Internally developed software between 2 and 6 years.
Amortisation is on a straight-line basis and commences once the asset is available for use Purchased software between 2 and 6 years, straight-line Costs of obtaining customer contracts - between 3 and 9 years, generally reducing balance method Internally developed software The determination of amounts to be recognised as internally developed software requires judgement and assumptions in respect of whether assets are capable of being separated and the extent to which development costs form part of the separable asset.
Additionally judgement is required to determine which costs have been incurred in relation to the research phase, which are not capitalised, and which have been incurred in relation to the development phase of a project, which are capitalised.
We consider that costs are directly attributable to the software asset and can therefore be capitalised, where they would not have been incurred if the software development had not taken place.
The impairment of internally generated software recognised during the year to 31 December 2017 included 31m relating to discontinuation of part of an IT transformation project in the UK and European insurance segment classified as discontinued.
150 Standard Life Aberdeen 2018 FINANCIAL INFORMATION 15.
Deferred acquisition costs The Group incurs costs to obtain and process new business.
These are accounted for as follows: Insurance and participating investment contracts Acquisition costs incurred in issuing insurance or participating investment contracts are not deferred where such costs are borne by a with profits fund that was subject to the Prudential Regulation Authority PRA realistic capital regime.
For other participating investment contracts, incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of the contracts are deferred.
For other insurance contracts both incremental acquisition costs and other indirect costs of acquiring and processing new business are deferred.
Deferred acquisition costs are amortised in proportion to projected margins over the period the relevant contracts are expected to remain inforce.
After initial recognition, deferred acquisition costs are reviewed by category of business and written off to the extent that they are no longer considered to be recoverable.
Non-participating investment contracts Incremental costs directly attributable to securing rights to receive fees from non-participating investment contracts are deferred.
Where such costs are borne by a with profits fund that was subject to the PRAs realistic capital regime, deferral is limited to the level of any related deferred income.
Deferred acquisition costs are amortised over the life of the contracts as the related revenue is recognised.
After initial recognition, deferred acquisition costs are reviewed by category of business and are written off to the extent that they are no longer considered to be recoverable.
Trail or renewal commission on non-participating investment contracts where the Group does not have an unconditional legal right to avoid payment is deferred at inception of the contract and an offsetting liability for contingent commission is established.

The amortisation charge for deferred origination costs relating to contracts with customers from continuing operations for the year was 2m 2017: 2m.
Investments in associates and joint ventures Associates are entities where the Group can significantly influence decisions made relating to the financial and operating policies of the entity but does not control the entity.
For entities where voting rights exist, significant influence is presumed where the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.
Joint ventures are strategic investments where the Group has agreed to share control of an entitys financial and operating policies through a shareholders agreement and decisions can only be taken with unanimous consent.
Associates, other than those accounted for at fair value through profit or loss, and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method from the date that significant influence or shared control, respectively, commences until the date this ceases with consistent accounting policies applied throughout.
Under the equity method, direct investments in associates and joint ventures are initially recognised at cost.
When an interest is acquired at fair value from a third party, the value of the Groups share of the investees identifiable assets and liabilities is determined applying the same valuation criteria as for a business combination at the acquisition date.
This is compared to the cost of the investment in the investee.
Where cost is higher the difference is identified as goodwill and the investee is initially recognised at cost which includes this component of goodwill.
Where cost is lower a bargain purchase has arisen and the investee is initially recognised at the Groups share of the investees identifiable assets and liabilities unless the recoverable amount for the purpose of assessing impairment is lower, in which case the investee is initially recognised at the recoverable amount.
Subsequently the carrying value is adjusted for the Groups share of post-acquisition profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associate or joint venture, which are recognised in the consolidated income statement and other comprehensive income respectively.
The Groups share of post-acquisition profit or loss includes amortisation charges based on the valuation exercise at acquisition.
The carrying value is also adjusted for any impairment losses.
Where the Group has an investment in an associate, a portion of which is held by, or is held indirectly through, a mutual fund, unit trust or similar entity, including investment-linked insurance funds, that portion of the investment is measured at FVTPL.
During the year ended 31 December 2017 we changed our judgement in determining when the Group has significant influence over investment vehicles managed by the Group.
In general, investment vehicles which are not subsidiaries are now considered to be associates where the Group holds more than 20% of the voting rights.
Previously our judgement was that the Group had significant influence over all investment vehicles where, through its role as investment manager, it had power over the investment decisions of the vehicle.
As a result previously the Group classified all Group managed investment vehicles which were not subsidiaries and in which the Group held an investment as associates.
The reason for the change in accounting policy was to make the financial statements more relevant to users as it is more consistent with peers.
This change in accounting policy only impacted the breakdown of Equities and investments in pooled investment vehicles, between amounts relating to investments in associates at FVTPL and other interests in pooled investment vehicles.
This breakdown is disclosed in Note 40.
A full list of the Groups associates and joint ventures is included in Note 49.
The level of future dividend payments and other transfers of funds to the Group from associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method could be restricted by the regulatory solvency and capital requirements of the associate or joint venture, and certain local foreign currency transaction restrictions.

Phoenix Phoenix is the largest life and pensions consolidator in Europe.
Our investment in Phoenix supports our strategic partnership.
On 23 February 2018, the Group announced the proposed sale of the UK and European insurance business to Phoenix the Sale, implemented by selling the entire issued share capital of Standard Life Assurance Limited SLAL.
Refer Note 1 for further details.
Following the completion of the Sale in August 2018, as part of the total consideration, the Group was issued with new Phoenix shares representing 19.98% of the issued share capital of Phoenix.
Our judgement was that taking into account our representation on Phoenixs board and the significant transactions between the Group and Phoenix, Phoenix should be classified as an associate.
Group financial statements continued At acquisition the value of the Groups share of Phoenixs identifiable assets and liabilities was determined.
This value was determined using the same valuation bases as required for a business combination under which most of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the enlarged Phoenix group including SLAL were measured at fair value.
The most significant assets that were not measured at fair value were Phoenixs defined benefit pension schemes which were measured at their IAS 19 value.
A key judgement was the identification, valuation and determination of useful lives, of the Groups share of Phoenixs intangible assets at the date of acquisition.
The main intangible assets identified were the acquired present value of in-force business AVIF for both SLAL and other Phoenix entities.
AVIF comprises the difference between the fair value and IFRS carrying value of insurance contracts together with the fair value of future profits expected to arise on investment contracts.
The valuation of the AVIF has been determined using the application of present value techniques to the best estimate cash flows expected to arise from policies that were in-force at the acquisition date, adjusted to reflect the price of bearing the uncertainty inherent in those cash flows.
This approach incorporates a number of judgements and assumptions which have impacted on the resultant valuation, the most significant of which are mortality rates, expected policy lapses, the expenses associated with servicing the policies, future investment returns, the discount rate and the risk adjustment for uncertainty, determined using a cost of capital approach.
The Groups share of profit after acquisition under the equity method reflects the amortisation of these intangible assets.
This differs from the amortisation recognised in Phoenixs own IFRS financial statements due to the revaluation of the existing Phoenix intangible assets at August 2018 for equity method purposes.
The amortisation method reflects the expected emergence of economic benefits which results in higher amortisation in earlier periods.
Useful life at Fair value at Groups share at acquisition date acquisition date acquisition date Years m m Intangible asset: SLAL AVIF 24 2,931 586 Existing Phoenix AVIF 15 1,503 300 The cost of the Groups investment in Phoenix was equal to the fair value of its 19.98% interest at the date of acquisition, being 1,023m.
The Groups share of the value of the identifiable net assets of the enlarged Phoenix group exceeded the cost of the Groups investment in Phoenix resulting in a bargain purchase gain of 15m which was offset by an impairment loss as described below.
Estimates and assumptions At 31 December 2018 the market value of the Groups interest in Phoenix was 812m which was significantly below the carrying value.
We considered this to be an indicator of impairment and therefore an impairment review was performed.
A key area of estimation was determining the recoverable amount of Phoenix on a value in use basis for the purpose of assessing impairment.
Given that the fair value was significantly below the carrying value, we considered that under IAS 28 the market value of Phoenix represented the best estimate of the present value of future dividends and therefore this market value of 812m was used as the value in use.
As the value in use was based on the market value, a discount rate was not determined.
An impairment loss of 243m has been recognised of which 15m arose at acquisition and has been offset against the bargain purchase gain.
This has resulted in a difference between the Groups share of net assets of Phoenix and the carrying value at 31 December 2018.
Phoenix has taken advantage of the temporary exemption granted to insurers in IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts from applying IFRS 9 as a result of meeting the exemption criteria as at 31 December 2015.
As at that date Phoenixs activities were considered to be predominantly connected with insurance as the percentage of the carrying amount of its liabilities in relation to insurance relative to the total carrying amounts of all its liabilities was greater than 90%.
The table below separately identifies financial assets with contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest excluding those held for trading or managed on a fair value basis and all other financial assets, measured at fair value through profit and loss.

HDFC Life HDFC Life is one of Indias leading life insurance companies.
On 17 November 2017, HDFC Life listed on the National Stock Exchange of India Limited and the Bombay Stock Exchange Limited following completion of an IPO in which the Group reduced its interest to 29.3%.
The difference between the carrying value of this associate and the Groups current share of net assets is due primarily to goodwill of 104m arising from additional investments being made at fair value rather than book value.
The year end date for HDFC Life is 31 March which is different from the Groups year end date of 31 December.
For the purposes of the preparation of the Groups consolidated financial statements, financial information as at and for the 12 months ended 31 December is used for HDFC Life.
154 Standard Life Aberdeen 2018 FINANCIAL INFORMATION At 31 March 2016 HDFC Life had significant insurance liabilities and its liabilities arising from contracts within the scope of IFRS 4 and liabilities connected with insurance were 97% of its total liabilities.
Therefore HDFC Life was eligible to defer the implementation of IFRS 9 for equity accounting purposes.
The fair value of HDFC Lifes financial assets at 31 December 2018 that remain under IAS 39 for equity accounting purposes and the change in fair value during the year ended 31 December 2018 are as follows: Fair value as at 31 December 2018 m Financial assets with contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest SPPI 1 excluding those held for trading or managed on a fair value basis 5,662 2 Financial assets other than those above 7,596 Total 13,258 1 Financial assets that are SPPI excluding those held for trading or managed on a fair value basis are predominantly AAA debt instruments including central and state government securities.
Their carrying value at 31 December 2018 is 5,642m.
Securities with fair value and carrying value of 10m are rated below BBB.
2 The change in fair value in the year to 31 December 2018 for financial assets that are SPPI excluding those held for trading or managed on a fair value basis is a gain of 385m.
The change in fair value for all other financial assets is a gain of 116m.
HDFC AMC HDFC AMC manages a range of mutual funds and provides portfolio management and advisory services.
On 6 August 2018, HDFC AMC listed on the National Stock Exchange of India Limited and the Bombay Stock Exchange Limited following completion of an IPO.
As a result of the planned IPO, a portion of the equity share capital of the associate was classified as held for sale as at 31 December 2017.
Refer Note 24 for further details.
The difference between the carrying value of this associate and the Groups share of net assets is due primarily to goodwill arising on the buyback of shares by HDFC AMC from employees.
The year end date for HDFC AMC is 31 March which is different from the Groups year end date of 31 December.
For the purposes of the preparation of the Groups consolidated financial statements, financial information as at and for the 12 months ended 30 September is used for HDFC AMC.

Depreciation, being the difference between the carrying amount and the residual value of each significant part of a building, is charged to the consolidated income statement over its useful life.
The useful life of each significant part of a building is estimated as being between 30 and 50 years.
A revaluation surplus is recognised in other comprehensive income unless it reverses a revaluation deficit which has been recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Equipment is subsequently measured at cost less depreciation.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement over 2 to 15 years depending on the length of time the Group expects to derive benefit from the asset.

If owner occupied property was measured using the cost model, the historical cost before impairment would be 2m 2017: 112m.
As the expected residual value of owner occupied property is in line with the current fair value, no depreciation is currently charged.
Financial investments Management determines the classification of financial investments at initial recognition.
Financial investments which are not derivatives and are not designated at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL are classified as either available-for-sale AFS or loans and receivables.
The classification of derivatives is set out in Note 21.
The majority of the Groups debt securities and all equity securities and interests in pooled investment funds are designated at FVTPL as they are part of groups of assets which are managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis.
These investments are recognised at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in investment return in the consolidated income statement.
Commercial real estate loans are included within debt securities designated at fair value.
All other debt securities are classified as AFS and are recognised at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in other comprehensive income.
Interest is credited to the consolidated income statement using the effective interest rate method.
On disposal of an AFS security any gains or losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income are recognised in the consolidated income statement recycling.
The accounting policies for other financial investments are detailed in the separate related notes indicated below.

Due to the nature of equity securities and interests in pooled investment funds, there is no fixed term associated with these securities.
Following application of the temporary exemption granted in IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts from applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, the table below separately identifies financial assets with contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest excluding those held for trading or managed on a fair value basis and all other financial assets.

Estimates and assumptions Determination of the fair value of contingent consideration assets included in receivables and other financial assets is a key estimate.
The methods and assumptions used to determine fair value of these assets are discussed in Note 41.
Loans Loans are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.

Derivative financial instruments A derivative is a financial instrument that is typically used to manage risk and whose value moves in response to an underlying variable such as interest or foreign exchange rates.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments in order to match contractual liabilities, to reduce the risk from potential movements in foreign exchange rates, equity indices, property indices and interest rates, to reduce credit risk or to achieve efficient portfolio management.
Certain consolidated investment vehicles also use derivatives to take and alter market exposure, with the objective of enhancing performance and controlling risk.
Management determines the classification of derivatives at initial recognition.
All derivative instruments are classified as held for trading except those designated as part of a hedging relationship.
Held for trading derivatives are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Using derivatives to manage a particular exposure is referred to as hedging.
For a derivative to be considered as part of a hedging relationship its purpose must be formally documented at inception.
In addition, the effectiveness of the hedge must be initially high and be able to be reliably measured on a regular basis.
Derivatives used to hedge variability in future cash flows such as coupons payable on subordinated liabilities or revenue receivable in a foreign currency are designated as cash flow hedges, while derivatives used to hedge currency risk on investments in foreign operations are designated as net investment hedges.
Where a derivative qualifies as a cash flow or net investment hedge, hedge accounting is applied.
The effective part of any gain or loss resulting from the change in fair value is recognised in other comprehensive income, and in the cash flow or net investment hedge reserve in equity, while any ineffective part is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.
If a derivative ceases to meet the relevant hedging criteria, hedge accounting is discontinued.
For cash flow hedges, the amount recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve is transferred to the consolidated income statement recycled in the same period or periods during which the hedged item affects profit or loss and is transferred immediately if the cash flow is no longer expected to occur.
For net investment hedges, the amount recognised in the net investment hedge reserve is transferred to the consolidated income statement on disposal of the investment.

Derivative liabilities of nil 2017: 318m are expected to be settled after more than 12 months.
a Cash flow hedges On 18 October 2017, the Group issued subordinated notes with a principal amount of US$750m.
In order to manage the foreign exchange risk relating to the principal and coupons payable on these notes the Group entered into a cross-currency swap which is designated as a cash flow hedge.
The cross-currency swap has a fair value asset position of 13m 2017: 33m liability.
During the year ended 31 December 2018 fair value gains of 54m 2017: 33m losses were recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to the cross-currency swap.
Gains of 35m 2017: 13m losses and 6m 2017: gains of less than 1m were transferred from other comprehensive income to Investment return and Finance costs respectively in the consolidated income statement in relation to the cross-currency swap during the year.
In addition, at 31 December 2017, foreign exchange contracts with an aggregate notional principal amount of 8m and a net fair value liability position of less than 1m were also designated as hedges of future cash flows arising from revenue receivable in foreign currency.
There were no foreign exchange contracts designated as hedges of future cash flows arising from revenue receivable in foreign currency at 31 December 2018.
The cash flows from these instruments are expected to be reported in the consolidated income statement for the following year.
In 2018 and 2017, the ineffectiveness recognised in the consolidated income statement arising from cash flow hedges was less than 1m.
b Net investment hedges Forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional principal amount of 6m 2017: 6m and a net fair value liability position of less than 1m 2017: net fair value asset position of less than 1m were designated as net investment hedges and gave rise to losses for the year of less than 1m 2017: gains of less than 1m, which have been deferred in the net investment hedge translation reserve.
The effectiveness of hedges of net investments in foreign operations is measured with reference to changes in the spot exchange rates.
Any ineffectiveness, together with any difference in value attributable to forward points, is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
In 2018, the losses recognised in the consolidated income statement were less than 1m 2017: less than 1m.
160 Standard Life Aberdeen 2018 FINANCIAL INFORMATION c Held for trading Derivative financial instruments classified as held for trading include those that the Group holds as economic hedges of financial instruments that are measured at fair value.
Held for trading derivative financial instruments are also held by the Group to match contractual liabilities that are measured at fair value or to achieve efficient portfolio management in respect of instruments measured at fair value.

Assets and liabilities held for sale Assets and liabilities held for sale are presented separately in the consolidated statement of financial position and consist of operations and individual non-current assets whose carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction expected within one year and not through continuing use.
Operations held for sale, being disposal groups, and investments in associates accounted for using the equity method are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and their fair value less disposal costs.
No depreciation or amortisation is charged on assets in a disposal group once it has been classified as held for sale.
Operations held for sale include newly established investment vehicles which the Group has seeded but is actively seeking to divest from.
For these investment funds, which do not have significant liabilities or non-financial assets, financial assets continue to be measured based on the accounting policies that applied before they were classified as held for sale.
The Group classifies seeded operations as held for sale where the intention is to dispose of the investment vehicle in a single transaction.
Where disposal of a seeded investment vehicle will be in more than one tranche the operations are not classified as held for sale in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Certain amounts seeded into funds are classified as investments in associates at FVTPL.
Investment property and owner occupied property held for sale relates to property for which contracts have been exchanged but the sale had not completed during the current financial year.
Investments in associates at FVTPL and investment property held for sale continue to be measured based on the accounting policies that applied before they were classified as held for sale.

Issued share capital and share premium Shares are classified as equity instruments when there is no contractual obligation to deliver cash or other assets to another entity on terms that may be unfavourable.
The Companys share capital consists of the number of ordinary shares in issue multiplied by their nominal value.
The difference between the proceeds received on issue of the shares and the nominal value of the shares issued is recorded in share premium.

164 Standard Life Aberdeen 2018 FINANCIAL INFORMATION On 22 October 2018, the Company undertook a share consolidation of the Companys share capital.
7 new ordinary shares of 13 61 63 pence each were issued for each holding of 8 existing ordinary shares of 12 2 9 pence each.
As a result, the number of shares in issue reduced from 2,941,738,848 to 2,574,021,492.
On 25 June 2018, a share buyback of up to 750m through on-market purchases was approved by shareholders.
As at 31 December 2018, the Company has bought back and cancelled 82,593,085 shares for a consideration including transaction costs of 238m.
This consideration has resulted in a reduction in retained earnings of 238m.
An amount of 11m has been credited to the capital redemption reserve relating to the nominal value of the shares cancelled.
Shares issued in respect of business combinations during 2017 related solely to the Aberdeen merger as discussed in Note 1.
The Company can issue shares to satisfy awards granted under employee incentive plans which have been approved by shareholders.
Details of the Groups employee plans are provided in Note 45. b Return of capital 2,941,738,848 B shares were issued for nil consideration with a nominal value of 33.99 pence each on 22 October 2018, resulting in a total of 1,000m being credited to the B share capital account.
At the same time 1,000m was deducted from the merger reserve.
On 24 October 2018 the B shares were redeemed at 33.99 pence each.
An amount of 1,000m was deducted from the B share capital account and 1,000m was transferred from retained earnings to the capital redemption reserve.
The costs of the B share scheme of 2m were recognised directly in equity.

Shares held by trusts Shares held by trusts relates to shares in Standard Life Aberdeen plc that are held by the Employee Share Trust EST, the Aberdeen Asset Management Employee Benefit Trust 2003 EBT and the Unclaimed Asset Trust UAT.
The EST and EBT purchase shares in the Company for delivery to employees under employee incentive plans.
Purchased shares are recognised as a deduction from equity at the price paid for them.
Where new shares are issued to the EST or EBT the price paid is the nominal value of the shares.
When shares are distributed from the trust their corresponding value is released to retained earnings.
In July 2006 Standard Life Group demutualised and former members of the mutual company were allocated shares in the new listed Company.
Some former members were yet to claim their shares and the UAT held these on their behalf.
There was an off-setting obligation to deliver these shares which was also recognised in the shares held by trust reserve.
The shares and the off-setting obligation were both measured at nil.
The claim entitlement period for the UAT expired on 9 July 2016.
Shares remaining in the UAT after 9 July 2016 continue to be measured at nil.
The number of shares held by trusts at 31 December 2018 was as follows: 2018 2017 Number of shares held by trusts Employee Share Trust 31,589,855 16,031,679 Aberdeen Asset Management Employee Benefit Trust 2003 20,327,295 23,704,305 Unclaimed Asset Trust 153,020 180,766 On completion of the merger on 14 August 2017, 31,483,948 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC shares held by the EBT were exchanged for 23,833,349 Standard Life Aberdeen plc shares at a total nominal value of 3m.
On expiry of the claim period on 9 July 2016, the entitlement to the unclaimed shares remaining in the UAT transferred to the Company.
During the year ended 31 December 2017, 11,719,073 shares were transferred from the UAT to the EST for nil consideration.
An amount equivalent to the fair value of the shares as at the date of transfer was donated by the Company to the Standard Life Foundation.

Movements in other reserves In July 2006 Standard Life Group demutualised and during this process the merger reserve, the reserve arising on Group reconstruction and the special reserve were created.
Merger reserve: the merger reserve consists of two components.
Firstly at demutualisation in July 2006 the Company issued shares to former members of the mutual company.
The difference between the nominal value of these shares and their issue value was recognised in the merger reserve.
The reserve includes components attaching to each subsidiary that was transferred to the Company at demutualisation based on their fair value at that date.
Secondly following the completion of the merger of Standard Life plc and Aberdeen Asset Management PLC on 14 August 2017, an additional amount was recognised in the merger reserve representing the difference between the nominal value of shares issued to shareholders of Aberdeen Asset Management PLC and their fair value at that date.
On disposal or impairment of a subsidiary any related component of the merger reserve is released to retained earnings.
Reserve arising on Group reconstruction: The value of the shares issued at demutualisation was equal to the fair value of the business at that date.
The businesss assets and liabilities were recognised at their book value at the time of demutualisation.
The difference between the book value of the businesss net assets and its fair value was recognised in the reserve arising on Group reconstruction.
The reserve comprises components attaching to each subsidiary that was transferred to the Company at demutualisation.
On disposal of such a subsidiary any related component of the reserve arising on Group reconstruction is released to retained earnings.
Special reserve: Immediately following demutualisation and the related initial public offering, the Company reduced its share premium reserve by court order giving rise to the special reserve.
Dividends can be paid out of this reserve.
Capital redemption reserve: In August 2018, as part of the return of capital and share buyback refer Note 26 the capital redemption reserve was created.

Non-controlling interests owned 44% of the voting rights of SLPET at 31 December 2017.
SLPET ceased to be a subsidiary on the completion of the sale of the UK and European insurance business on 31 August 2018.
The profit allocated to non-controlling interests of SLPET for the year ended 31 December 2018 is 5m 2017: 24m.
Dividends paid to non-controlling interests of SLPET during the year ended 31 December 2018 were 8m 2017: 7m.

The profit attributable to non-controlling interests from continuing operations for the year ended 31 December 2018 totalled 5m 2017: 8m being 5m 2017: nil in respect of the preference shares and nil 2017: 8m in respect of perpetual debt instruments.
The profit attributable to non-controlling interests from discontinued operations for the year ended 31 December 2018 totalled 33m 2017: 25m being 5m 2017: 25m in respect of ordinary shares and 28m 2017: nil in respect of perpetual debt instruments.
b i Preference shares The preference shares have no fixed redemption date, except at the sole discretion of the issuer after the fifth anniversary from issue.
Preference share dividends are discretionary and where declared, are paid in arrears in two tranches at a rate of 5% per annum and are non-cumulative.
No interest accrues on any cancelled or unpaid dividends.
During the year ended 31 December 2018 preference share dividends of 5m 2017: nil were paid.
The preference shares can be converted irrevocably into a fixed number of ordinary shares of Aberdeen Asset Management PLC in the event of the conversion trigger.
The conversion trigger occurs if Aberdeen Asset Management PLCs Common Equity Tier 1 CET1 capital ratio falls below 5.125%.
Group financial statements continued b ii Perpetual debt instruments 6.75% Sterling fixed rate perpetual subordinated guaranteed bonds and 6.546% Sterling fixed rate perpetual Mutual Assurance Capital Securities From the date of the repayment of a 100 internal subordinated loan note issued by Standard Life Assurance Limited SLAL to the Company on 30 August 2018, the perpetual subordinated guaranteed bonds and Mutual Assurance Capital Securities MACS issued by the Company were reclassified to equity from subordinated liabilities see Note 34.
The perpetual subordinated guaranteed bonds and MACS were recognised in equity at their fair value of the subordinated debt liabilities at 30 August 2018 of 672m and 334m respectively.
The Group recognised a fair value loss of 198m on the reclassification which is included in Restructuring and corporate transaction expenses from discontinued operations see Note 8.
The prior classification as liabilities was determined by the interaction of these perpetual debt instruments with the 100 internal subordinated loan note.
There was no fixed redemption date for the internal loan note, but interest payments could not be deferred and had to be paid on the date they became due and payable.
Under the terms for the guaranteed bonds and MACS any interest deferred on these instruments would have become immediately due and payable on the date of an interest payment in respect of the internal loan note.
The existence of the internal loan note therefore removed the discretionary nature of the interest payments on the subordinated guaranteed bonds and MACS, and resulted in their classification as liabilities.
Following a tender and mandatory redemption process which completed on 25 October 2018, the Company repurchased redeemed the guaranteed bonds and MACS for 703m and 336m respectively including accrued interest and fees.
The difference between the carrying value of the guaranteed bonds and MACS and the cost of the repurchase and mandatory redemption of 21m net of tax was recognised directly as profit attributable to non-controlling interests.
The guaranteed bonds bore interest on their principal amount at 6.75% per annum payable annually in arrears on 12 July.
The MACS bore interest on their principal amount at 6.546% per annum payable annually in arrears on 4 November.
The coupons payable on the guaranteed bonds and MACS were tax deductible.
During the year ended 31 December 2018 7m net of tax 2017: nil was recognised directly in equity as profit attributable to non-controlling interests in relation to the coupons payable on the guaranteed bonds and MACS.
7.0% US Dollar fixed rate perpetual capital notes Until 18 December 2017, the perpetual capital notes were classified as equity.
On this date Aberdeen Asset Management PLC notified the trustees of the perpetual capital notes of its irrevocable intention to redeem the notes on the first call date, 1 March 2018.
Following notification to the trustees the perpetual capital notes were reclassified as subordinated liabilities as an obligation to deliver cash was created.
The liabilities were recognised at fair value of 380m on 18 December 2017 with fair value movements since acquisition of 17m being transferred to retained earnings at this date.
On reclassification 2m in relation to tax allocated to non-controlling interests was also transferred to retained earnings.
The perpetual capital notes were redeemed on 1 March 2018.
The perpetual capital notes bore interest on their principal amount at 7.0% per annum, the discretionary coupons were payable quarterly in arrears on 1 March, 1 June, 1 September and 1 December in each year.
Interest accrued on any deferred payments.
The coupons payable on perpetual notes were tax deductible.
During the year ended 31 December 2018 nil 2017: 8m net of tax was recognised directly in equity as profit contributable to non-controlling interests in relation to the coupons payable on the perpetual capital notes.
170 Standard Life Aberdeen 2018 FINANCIAL INFORMATION 31.
Insurance contracts, investment contracts and reinsurance contracts i Classification of insurance and investment contracts The measurement basis of assets and liabilities arising from life and pensions business contracts is dependent upon the classification of those contracts as either insurance or investment contracts.
Insurance contracts A contract is classified as an insurance contract only if it transfers significant insurance risk.
Insurance risk is significant if an insured event could cause an insurer to pay significant additional benefits to those payable if no insured event occurred, excluding scenarios that lack commercial substance.
Our judgement is that where death benefits exceed maturity benefits by 10% or more a contract is classified as an insurance contract, by 5% or less it is not an insurance contract.
There are no material contracts within the 5% to 10% range.
A contract that is classified as an insurance contract remains an insurance contract until all rights and obligations are extinguished or expire.
Investment contracts Life and pensions business contracts that are not classified as insurance contracts are classified as investment contracts.
Participating contracts The Group has written insurance and investment contracts which contain discretionary participating features e. g. with profits business.
These contracts provide a contractual right to receive additional benefits as a supplement to guaranteed benefits.
These additional benefits are based on the performance of with profits funds and their amount and timing is at the discretion of the Group.
These contracts are referred to as participating insurance contracts if they contain a feature that transfers significant insurance risk and otherwise as participating investment contracts.
Hybrid contracts Generally, life and pensions business product classes are sufficiently homogeneous to permit a single classification at the level of the product class.
However, in some cases, a product class may contain individual contracts that fall across multiple classifications hybrid contracts.
For certain significant hybrid contracts our judgement is that it is appropriate to separate the product class into the insurance element, a nonparticipating investment element and a participating investment element, so that each element is accounted for separately.
Embedded derivatives Where a contract contains a feature that meets the definition of both an insurance contract and a derivative, the contract is classified in its entirety as an insurance contract.
ii Income statement presentation insurance and participating investment contracts For insurance contracts and participating investment contracts, IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts permits the continued application, for income statement presentation purposes, of accounting policies that were being used at the date of transition to IFRS, except where a change is deemed to make the financial statements more relevant to the economic decision-making needs of users and no less reliable, or more reliable, and no less relevant to those needs.
Therefore the Group applies accounting policies based on the Association of British Insurers Statement of Recommended Practice issued in 2005 ABI SORP as described below.
Premiums received on insurance contracts and participating investment contracts are recognised as revenue in the consolidated income statement when due for payment, except for unit linked premiums which are accounted for when the corresponding liabilities are recognised.
For single premium business, this is the date from which the policy is effective.
For regular and recurring premium contracts, receivables are established at the date when payments are due.
Claims paid on insurance contracts and participating investment contracts are recognised as expenses in the consolidated income statement.
Maturity claims and annuities are accounted for when due for payment.
Surrenders are accounted for when paid or, if earlier, on the date when the policy ceases to be included within the calculation of the insurance liability.
Death claims and all other claims are accounted for when notified.
When a policyholder exercises an option within an investment contract to utilise withdrawal proceeds from the investment contract to secure future benefits which contain significant insurance risk, the related investment contract liability is derecognised and an insurance contract liability is recognised.
The withdrawal proceeds which are used to secure the insurance contract are recognised as premium income.
Claims payable include the direct costs of settlement.
Reinsurance recoveries are accounted for in the same period as the related claim.
The change in insurance and participating investment contract liabilities, comprising the full movement in the corresponding liabilities during the period, is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
This also includes the movement in unallocated divisible surplus UDS in the period.
However, where movements in assets and liabilities which are attributable to participating policyholders are recognised in other comprehensive income, the change in UDS arising from these movements is not recognised in the consolidated income statement as it is also recognised in other comprehensive income.
iii Measurement insurance and participating investment contract liabilities For insurance contracts and participating investment contracts, IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts permits the continued application, for measurement purposes, of accounting policies that were being used at the date of transition to IFRS, except where a change is deemed to make the financial statements more relevant to the economic decision-making needs of users and no less reliable, or more reliable, and no less relevant to those needs.
Therefore the Group applies accounting policies based on the ABI SORP as described below.
As was permitted under the ABI SORP, the Group adopts local regulatory valuation methods, adjusted for consistency with asset measurement policies, for the measurement of liabilities under insurance contracts and participating investment contracts issued by overseas subsidiaries and associates.
Group financial statements continued iv Measurement participating contract liabilities Participating contract liabilities are analysed into the following components: Participating insurance contract liabilities Participating investment contract liabilities Present value of future profits on non-participating contracts, which is treated as a deduction from gross participating contract liabilities Unallocated divisible surplus The policy for measuring each component is noted below.
Participating insurance and investment contract liabilities Participating contract liabilities arising under contracts issued by with profits funds which were within the scope of the Prudential Regulation Authority PRA realistic capital regime prior to the introduction of Solvency II are measured on the PRA realistic basis that was used in the PRA realistic capital regime.
Under this approach, the value of participating insurance and participating investment contract liabilities in each with profits fund is calculated as: With profits benefits reserves WPBR for the fund as determined under the PRA realistic basis, plus Future policy related liabilities FPRL for the fund as determined under the PRA realistic basis, less Any amounts due to equity holders included in FPRL, less The portion of future profits on non-participating contracts included in FPRL not due to equity holders, where this portion can be separately identified The WPBR is primarily based on the retrospective calculation of accumulated asset shares.
The aggregate value of individual policy asset shares reflects the actual premium, expense and charge history of each policy.
The net investment return credited to the asset shares is consistent with the return achieved on the assets notionally backing participating business.
Any mortality deductions are based on published mortality tables adjusted where necessary for experience variations.
For those asset shares on an expense basis, the allowance for expenses attributed to the asset share is, as far as practical, the appropriate share of the actual expenses incurred or charged to the fund.
For those on a charges basis, the allowance is consistent with the charges for an equivalent unit linked policy.
The FPRL comprises other components such as a market consistent stochastic valuation of the cost of options and guarantees.
Prior to the sale of Standard Life Assurance Limited SLAL to Phoenix Group Holdings Plc Phoenix, the Groups principal with profits fund was the Heritage With Profits Fund HWPF.
The application to the HWPF of the Groups accounting policy for participating insurance and investment contract liabilities is described below.
This policy for the HWPF now applies, for equity accounting purposes, to the Groups associate Phoenix.
The participating contracts held in the HWPF were issued by a with profits fund that fell within the scope of the PRA realistic capital regime.
Under the Scheme of Demutualisation the Scheme, the residual estate of the HWPF exists to meet amounts which may be charged to the HWPF under the Scheme.
However, to the extent that SLALs board is satisfied that there is an excess residual estate, it shall be distributed over time as an enhancement to final bonuses payable on the remaining eligible policies invested in the HWPF.
This planned enhancement to the benefits under with profits contracts held in the HWPF is included in the FPRL under the PRA realistic basis, resulting in a realistic surplus of nil.
Applying the policy noted above, this planned enhancement is therefore included within the measurement of participating contract liabilities.
The Scheme provides that certain defined cash flows recourse cash flows arising in the HWPF on specified blocks of UK and Ireland business, both participating and non-participating, may be transferred out of that fund when they emerge, being transferred to the Shareholder Fund SHF or the Proprietary Business Fund PBF of SLAL, and thus accrue to the ultimate benefit of equity holders of the company.
Under the Scheme, such transfers are subject to certain constraints in order to protect policyholders.
The Scheme also provides for additional expenses to be charged by the PBF to the HWPF in respect of Germany branch business in SLAL.
Under the PRA realistic basis, the discounted value of expected future cash flows on participating contracts not reflected in the WPBR is included in FPRL as a reduction in FPRL where future cash flows were expected to be positive.
The discounted value of expected future cash flows on non-participating contracts not reflected in the measure on non-participating liabilities is recognised as a separate asset where future cash flows are expected to be positive.
The Scheme requirement to transfer future recourse cash flows out of the HWPF is recognised as an addition to FPRL.
The discounted value of expected future cash flows on non-participating contracts can be apportioned between those included in the recourse cash flows and those retained in the HWPF for the benefit of policyholders.
Applying the policy noted above: The value of participating insurance and participating investment contract liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial position is reduced by future expected net positive cash flows arising on participating contracts Future expected cash flows on non-participating contracts are not recognised as an asset of the HWPF on the consolidated statement of financial position.
However, future expected cash flows on non-participating contracts that are not recourse cash flows under the Scheme are used to adjust the value of participating insurance and participating investment contract liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial position.
Some participating contract liabilities arise under contracts issued by a non-participating fund with a with profits investment element then transferred to a with profits fund within SLAL that fell within the scope of the PRAs realistic capital regime.
The with profits investment element of such contracts was measured as described above.
Any liability for insurance features retained in the non-participating fund was measured using the gross premium method applicable to non-participating contracts see Section v. 172 Standard Life Aberdeen 2018 FINANCIAL INFORMATION Present value of future profits PVFP on non-participating contracts held in a with profits fund An amount is recognised for the PVFP on non-participating contracts held in the HWPF since the determination of the realistic value of liabilities for with profits contracts in the HWPF takes account of this value.
The amount is recognised as a deduction from liabilities.
As this amount can be apportioned between an amount recognised in the realistic value of with profits contract liabilities and an amount recognised in UDS, the apportioned amounts are reflected in the measurement of participating contract liabilities and UDS respectively.
Unallocated divisible surplus UDS The UDS comprises the difference between the assets and all other recognised liabilities in with profits funds.
This amount is recognised as a liability when it is not considered to be allocated to shareholders due to uncertainty regarding transfers from these funds to equity holders.
In relation to the HWPF, amounts are considered to be allocated to equity holders when they emerge as recourse cash flows within the HWPF.
As a result of the policies for measuring the HWPFs assets and all its other recognised liabilities: The UDS of the HWPF comprises the value of future recourse cash flows on participating contracts but not the value of future recourse cash flows on non-participating contracts, the value of future additional expenses to be charged on Germany branch business and the effect of any measurement differences between the Realistic Balance Sheet value and IFRS accounting policy value of all assets and all liabilities other than participating contract liabilities recognised in the HWPF The recourse cash flows are recognised as they emerge as an addition to equity holders profits if positive or as a deduction if negative.
As the additional expenses are charged in respect of the Germany branch business, they are recognised as an addition to equity holders profits.
v Measurement non-participating insurance contract liabilities Measurement for UK business is based on a best estimate with a margin for prudence.
UK and European insurance business The liability for annuity in payment contracts was measured by discounting the expected future annuity payments together with an appropriate estimate of future expenses at an assumed rate of interest derived from yields on the underlying assets.
Other non-participating insurance contracts are measured using the gross premium method.
In general terms, a gross premium valuation basis is one in which the premiums brought into account are the full amounts receivable under the contract.
The method includes explicit estimates of premiums, expected claims and costs of maintaining contracts.
Cash flows are discounted at the valuation rate of interest determined to reflect conditions at the reporting date in accordance with Prudential Regulation Authority PRA requirements that existed at 31 December 2015.
UK Associates Phoenix Non-participating insurance contract liabilities are measured, for equity accounting purposes, at best estimate with an explicit margin for prudence with the process used to determine assumptions based on Solvency II data.
The valuation interest rate is a risk free rate swap curve plus 10 bps with an explicit adjustment for illiquidity in respect of assets backing illiquid liabilities.
Demographic assumptions are based on a best estimate with an explicit margin for demographic risks.
Standard Life Asia Limited The Groups policy for measuring liabilities for non-participating insurance contracts issued by overseas subsidiaries is to apply the valuation technique used in the issuing entitys local statutory or regulatory reporting.
vi Measurement liability adequacy test The Group applies a liability adequacy test at each reporting date to ensure that the insurance and participating contract liabilities less related deferred acquisition costs are adequate in the light of the estimated future cash flows.
This test is performed by comparing the carrying value of the liability and the discounted projections of future cash flows.
If a deficiency is found in the liability i. e. the carrying value amount of its insurance liabilities is less than the future expected cash flows, that deficiency is provided for in full.
The deficiency is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
vii Reinsurance contracts Contracts with reinsurers are assessed to determine whether they contain significant insurance risk.
Contracts that did not give rise to a significant transfer of insurance risk to the reinsurer are considered financial reinsurance and are accounted for in a manner consistent with financial instruments.
Contracts that gave rise to a significant transfer of insurance risk to the reinsurer are assessed to determine whether they contained an element that did not transfer significant insurance risk and which could be measured separately from the insurance component.
Where such elements are present, they are accounted for separately with any deposit element being accounted for in a manner consistent with financial instruments.
The remaining elements, or where no such separate elements are identified, the entire contracts, are classified as reinsurance contracts.
Reinsurance contracts are measured using valuation techniques and assumptions that are consistent with the valuation techniques and assumptions used in measuring the underlying policy benefits and taking into account the terms of the reinsurance contract.
Reinsurance recoveries due from reinsurers and reinsurance premiums due to reinsurers under reinsurance contracts that are contractually due at the reporting date are separately recognised in receivables and other financial assets and other financial liabilities respectively unless a right of offset exists, in which case the net amount is reported on the consolidated statement of financial position.
Expenses, including interest, arising under elements of contracts with reinsurers that do not transfer significant insurance risk are recognised on an accruals basis in the consolidated income statement as expenses under arrangements with reinsurers.

Reinsurance contracts are generally structured to match liabilities on a class of business basis.
This has a mixture of terms.
The reinsurance assets are therefore broadly expected to be realised in line with the settlement of liabilities as per the terms of the particular treaty within a reinsured class of business.
Non-participating investment contracts Unit linked non-participating investment contracts are separated into two components being an investment management services component and a financial liability.
All fees and related administrative expenses are deemed to be associated with the investment management services component refer Note 4, Note 15 and Note 36.
The financial liability component is designated at FVTPL as it is implicitly managed on a fair value basis as its value is directly linked to the market value of the underlying portfolio of assets.
Contributions received on non-participating investment contracts are treated as policyholder deposits and not reported as revenue in the consolidated income statement.
Withdrawals paid out to policyholders on non-participating investment contracts are treated as a reduction to policyholder deposits and not recognised as expenses in the consolidated income statement.
Investment return and related benefits credited in respect of non-participating investment contracts are recognised in the consolidated income statement as changes in investment contract liabilities.
The change in non-participating investment contract liabilities was as follows: 2018 2017 Notes m m At 1 January 105,769 102,063 Reclassified as held for sale during the year 104,174 68 Acquired through business combinations 1,411 Contributions 183 9,579 Account balances paid on surrender and other terminations in the year 235 15,903 Change in non-participating investment contract liabilities recognised in the 1 consolidated income statement 72 8,954 Recurring management charges 3 490 Foreign exchange adjustment 223 At 31 December 33 1,468 105,769 1 Change in non-participating investment contract liabilities recognised in the consolidated income statement in the table above excludes 6m 2017: 9m in relation to nonparticipating investment contract liabilities classified as held for sale.
Financial liabilities Management determines the classification of financial liabilities at initial recognition.
Financial liabilities are designated as at FVTPL when they are managed and their performance evaluated on a fair value basis.
The methods and assumptions used to determine fair value of financial liabilities designated at FVTPL are discussed in Note 41.

Subordinated liabilities Subordinated liabilities are debt instruments issued by the Company which rank below its other obligations in the event of liquidation but above the share capital.
Subordinated liabilities are initially recognised at the value of proceeds received after deduction of issue expenses.
Subsequent measurement is at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

Pension and other post-retirement benefit provisions The Group operates two types of pension plans: Defined benefit plans which provide pension payments upon retirement to members as defined by the plan rules.
All of the Groups defined benefit plans, with the exception of a small plan in Ireland, are closed to future service accrual.
Defined contribution plans where the Group makes contributions to a members pension plan but has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid The Groups liabilities in relation to its defined benefit plans are valued by at least annual actuarial calculations.
The Group has funded these liabilities in relation to its UK and Ireland defined benefit plans by ring-fencing assets in trustee-administered funds.
The Group has further smaller defined benefit plans some of which are unfunded.
The statement of financial position reflects a net asset or net liability for each defined benefit pension plan.
The liability recognised is the present value of the defined benefit obligation estimated future cash flows are discounted using the yields on high quality corporate bonds less the fair value of plan assets, if any.
If the fair value of the plan assets exceeds the defined benefit obligation, a pension surplus is only recognised if the Group considers that it has an unconditional right to a refund of the surplus from the plan.
The amount of surplus recognised will be limited by tax and expenses.
Our judgement is that, in the UK, an authorised surplus tax charge is not an income tax.
Consequently, the surplus is recognised net of this tax charge rather than the tax charge being included within deferred taxation.
For the principal defined benefit plan UK Standard Life Group plan, the Group considers that it has an unconditional right to a refund of a surplus, assuming the gradual settlement of the plan liabilities over time until all members have left the plan.
The plan trustees can purchase annuities to insure member benefits and can, for the majority of benefits, transfer these annuities to members.
The trustees cannot unconditionally wind up the plan or use the surplus to enhance member benefits without employer consent.
Our judgement is that these trustee rights do not prevent us from recognising an unconditional right to a refund and therefore a surplus.
Net interest income if a plan is in surplus or interest expense if a plan is in deficit is calculated using yields on high quality corporate bonds and recognised in the consolidated income statement.
A current service cost is also recognised which represents the expected present value of the defined benefit pension entitlement earned by members in the period.
A past service cost is also recognised which represents the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation for service in prior periods, resulting from an amendment or curtailment to a plan.
Remeasurements, which include gains and losses as a result of changes in actuarial assumptions, the effect of the limit on the plan surplus and returns on plan assets other than amounts included in net interest are recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Remeasurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.
For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to separately administered pension plans.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised in current service cost in the consolidated income statement as staff costs and other employee-related costs when they are due.
178 Standard Life Aberdeen 2018 FINANCIAL INFORMATION Defined contribution plans The defined contribution plans comprise a mixture of arrangements depending on the employing entity and other factors.
Some of these plans are located within the same legal vehicles as defined benefit plans.
The Group contributes a percentage of pensionable salary to each employees plan.
The contribution levels vary by employing entity and other factors.
Defined benefit plans UK plans These plans are governed by trustee boards, which comprise employer and employee nominated trustees and an independent trustee.
The plans are subject to the statutory funding objective requirements of the Pensions Act 2004, which require that plans be funded to at least the level of their technical provisions an actuarial estimate of the assets needed to provide for benefits already built-up under the plan.
The trustees perform regular valuations to check that the plans meet the statutory funding objective.
While the IAS 19 valuation reflects a best estimate of the financial position of the plan, the funding valuation reflects a prudent estimate.
There is no material difference in how assets are measured.
The funding measure of liabilities technical provisions and the IAS 19 measure are materially different.
The key differences are the discount rate and inflation assumptions.
While IAS 19 requires that the discount rate reflect corporate bond yields, the funding measure discount rate reflects a prudent estimate of future investment returns based on the actual investment strategy.
The funding valuation adopts a market consistent measure of inflation without any adjustment.
The IAS 19 assumption incorporates an adjustment to remove the inflation risk premium believed to exist within market prices.
The trustees set the plan investment strategy to protect the ratio of plan assets to the trustees measure of technical provisions.
This investment strategy does not aim to protect the IAS 19 surplus or the ratio of plan assets to the IAS 19 measure of liabilities.
After consulting the relevant employers, the trustees prepare statements of funding and investment principles and set a schedule of contributions.
If necessary, this schedule includes a recovery plan that aims to restore the funding level to the level of the technical provisions.
UK Standard This is the Groups principal defined benefit plan.
The plan closed to new membership in 2004 and changed from a final Life Group salary basis to a revalued career average salary basis in 2008.
Accrual ceased in April 2016. plan The transfer of employees to Phoenix, in connection with the sale of our UK and European insurance business, caused a principal curtailment in this plan that reduced plan liabilities by 42m.
However, a plan amendment was agreed that reduced this plan fall in liabilities to 18m.
These movements are recognised within past service cost, together with the associated movement in the asset ceiling.
Following a High Court ruling against a third partys pension scheme, that requires that scheme to address the inequalities in the statutory benefits paid to men and women, an allowance for assumed equalisation has been introduced for our principal defined benefit plan at 31 December 2018.
The estimated impact is recognised as a past service cost, though is not material.
The funding of the plan depends on the statutory valuation performed by the trustees, and the relevant employers, with the assistance of the scheme actuary i. e. not the IAS 19 valuation.
The funding valuation was last completed as at 31 December 2016, and measured plan assets and liabilities to be 4.9bn and 4.2bn respectively.
This corresponds to a surplus of 0.7bn and funding level of 117%.
As there is currently no deficit, no recovery plan is required.
Other UK The Group also operates two UK defined benefit plans as a result of the merger with Aberdeen.
These plans are final plans salary based, with benefits depending on members length of service and salary prior to retirement.
At the last statutory valuation date, these plans were in deficit and the Group agreed funding plans which aimed to eliminate the deficits, with the plans trustees.
At 31 December 2018, one of the two schemes is now in surplus on an IAS 19 basis.
Other plans Ireland In December 2009 this plan closed to new membership and changed from a final salary basis to a career average Standard Life revalued earnings CARE basis.
Following the sale of the UK and European insurance business, there remains less than plan 10 employees that continue to accrue benefits under this plan.
The transfer of employees to Phoenix, in connection with the sale of our UK and European insurance business, caused a curtailment in this plan that reduced plan liabilities by 4m.
This movement is recognised in past service cost.
At the last trustee valuation, effective 1 January 2016, the plan was 70% funded on an ongoing basis.
Other The Group operates smaller funded and unfunded defined benefit plans in other countries.
Plan regulations The plans are administered according to local laws and regulations in each country.
Responsibility for the governance of the plans rests with the relevant trustee boards or equivalent.
Group financial statements continued a Analysis of amounts recognised in the consolidated income statement The amounts recognised in the consolidated income statement for defined contribution and defined benefit plans are as follows: 2017 1 2018 restated m m Current service cost 67 46 Past service cost 15 Net interest income 27 28 Administrative expenses 2 3 Expense from continuing operations recognised in the consolidated income statement 27 21 1 Comparatives for 2017 have been restated to reflect the classification of the UK and European insurance business as discontinued operations.
Contributions made to defined contribution plans are included within current service cost, with the balance attributed to the Groups defined benefit plans.
Contributions to defined benefit plans in the year ended 31 December 2018 were 37m 2017: 12m.
Expected contributions to defined benefit plans in 2019 are 18m and are not expected to materially change over the next three to five years.
These include 33m in 2018 and 15m contributions expected in 2019 to Aberdeen UK plans and the Ireland Standard Life plan in respect of deficit funding agreed with the trustees.
The current deficit on these plans is 35m.

Group financial statements continued d Defined benefit plan assets Investment strategy is directed by the trustee boards where relevant who pursue different strategies according to the characteristics and maturity profile of each plans liabilities.
Assets and liabilities are managed holistically to create a portfolio with the dual objectives of return generation and liability management.
In the principal plan this is achieved through a diversified multi-asset absolute return strategy seeking consistent positive returns, and hedging techniques which protect liabilities against movements arising from changes in interest rates and inflation expectations.
Derivative financial instruments support both of these objectives and may lead to increased or decreased exposures to the physical asset categories disclosed below.
To provide more information on the approach used to determine and measure the fair value of the plan assets, the fair value hierarchy has been used as defined in Note 41.
Those assets which cannot be classified as level 1 have been presented together as level 2 or 3.
The distribution of the fair value of the assets of the Groups funded defined benefit plans is as follows: Principal plan Other Total 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 m m m m m m Assets measured at fair value based on level 1 inputs Derivatives 9 33 1 1 10 34 Equity securities 81 81 Interests in pooled investment funds Debt 308 372 308 372 Equity 26 29 26 29 Property 115 62 9 20 124 82 Absolute return 60 64 109 102 169 166 Cash 297 339 36 333 339 Debt securities 2,494 2,841 31 32 2,525 2,873 Total assets measured at fair value based on level 1 inputs 3,364 3,711 212 184 3,576 3,895 Assets measured at fair value based on level 2 or 3 inputs Derivatives 289 334 6 283 334 Equity securities 102 197 102 197 Interests in pooled investment funds Debt 249 100 249 100 Debt securities 163 76 163 76 Qualifying insurance policies 5 5 64 75 69 80 Total assets measured at fair value based on level 2 or 3 inputs 808 712 58 75 866 787 Cash and cash equivalents 381 446 6 17 387 463 Liability in respect of collateral held 300 339 300 339 Other 2 2 Total 4,251 4,530 276 276 4,527 4,806 Further information on risks is provided in Section g of this note.

Of the remaining 66m 2017: 91m debt securities, 42m 2017: 75m are investment grade corporate bonds or certificates of deposit.
In 2015, the trustees of one of the Aberdeen UK plans purchased an insurance policy to protect the plan against future investment and actuarial risks.
The 64m 2017: 75m qualifying insurance asset has been calculated by valuing the estimated benefits that will be paid by the insurer using the reporting date IAS 19 assumptions and the same approach used to value the year end liabilities.

The fair value of this derivative is nil at 31 December 2018 2017: nil.
182 Standard Life Aberdeen 2018 FINANCIAL INFORMATION e Estimates and assumptions Determination of the valuation of principal plan liabilities is a key estimate as a result of the assumptions made relating to both economic and non-economic factors.
The key economic assumptions for the principal plan, which are based in part on current market conditions, are shown below: 2018 2017 % % Discount rate 2.85 2.60 Rates of inflation Consumer Price Index CPI 2.20 2.20 Retail Price Index RPI 3.20 3.20 The changes in economic assumptions over the period reflect changes in both corporate bond prices and market implied inflation.
The most significant non-economic assumption for the principal plan is post-retirement longevity which is inherently uncertain.
The assumptions along with sample expectations of life are illustrated below: Expectation of life from NRA Male age today Female age today Normal Retirement 2018 Table Improvements Age NRA NRA 40 NRA 40 Advanced parameterisation of CMI 2013 60 30 32 32 34 Plan specific basis mortality improvements model adjusted to calibrated by Club Vita assume that improvements continue to reflecting membership increase in the short term before declining demographics toward an ultimate long-term rate of 1.375% Expectation of life from NRA Male age today Female age today Normal Retirement 2017 Table Improvements Age NRA NRA 40 NRA 40 Advanced parameterisation of CMI 2013 60 30 32 31 34 Plan specific basis mortality improvements model adjusted to calibrated by Club Vita assume that improvements continue to reflecting membership increase in the short term before declining demographics toward an ultimate long-term rate of 1.375% These assumptions reflect a cautious allowance for the recently observed slowdown in longevity improvements.

Group financial statements continued g Risk g i Risks and mitigating actions The Groups consolidated statement of financial position is exposed to movements in the defined benefit plans net asset.
In particular, the consolidated statement of financial position could be materially sensitive to reasonably likely movements in the principal assumptions for the principal plan.
By offering post-retirement defined benefit pension plans the Group is exposed to a number of risks.
An explanation of the key risks and mitigating actions in place for the principal plan is given below.
Asset volatility Investment strategy risks include underperformance of the absolute return strategy and underperformance of the liability hedging strategy.
As the trustees set investment strategy to protect their own view of plan strength not the IAS 19 position, changes in the IAS 19 liabilities e. g. due to movements in corporate bond prices may not always result in a similar movement in plan assets.
Failure of the asset strategy to keep pace with changes in plan liabilities would expose the plan to the risk of a deficit developing, which could increase funding requirements for the Group.
Yields discount rate Falls in yields would in isolation be expected to increase the defined benefit plan liabilities.
The principal plan uses both bonds and derivatives to hedge out yield risks on the plans funding basis, rather than the IAS 19 basis, which is expected to minimise the plans need to rely on support from the Group.
Inflation Increases in inflation expectations would in isolation be expected to increase the defined benefit plan liabilities.
The principal plan uses both bonds and derivatives to hedge out inflation risks on the plans funding basis, rather than the IAS 19 basis, which is expected to minimise the plans need to rely on support from the Group.
In the principal plan pensions in payment are generally linked to CPI, however inflationary risks are hedged using RPI instruments due to lack of availability of CPI linked instruments.
Therefore, the plan is exposed to movements in the actual and expected long-term gap between RPI and CPI.
Life expectancy Increases in life expectancy beyond those currently assumed will lead to an increase in plan liabilities.
Regular reviews of longevity assumptions are performed to ensure assumptions remain appropriate.
g ii Sensitivity to key assumptions The sensitivity of the principal plans obligation and assets to the key assumptions is disclosed below.

Provisions and other liabilities Provisions are obligations of the Group which are of uncertain timing or amount.
They are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that a loss will be incurred in settling the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made.

Refer Note 1 and Note 8 for further details.
We announced in the Sale Circular on 30 May 2018 that we expected to incur one-off costs relating to the separation of the business sold of approximately 250m, and there has been no change to this estimate.
Costs of 53m were incurred in the period to 31 December 2018.
Our judgement is that a provision should be recognised for costs for which the Group will not derive ongoing benefits such as those relating to the fide-coupling and decommissioning of systems and data but that a provision should not be recognised for costs related to the development of replacement systems and services as these will give future benefits.
The costs covered by the provision are expected to be incurred in the three years to 2021.
The amount of provisions expected to be settled after more than 12 months is 72m 2017: 102m.

Risk management a Overview a i Application of the Enterprise Risk Management ERM framework Effective risk management is an essential part of delivering our corporate strategy.
Our approach is predicated on strong risk awareness and risk accountability across all lines of defence in our business.
We believe that this delivers long-term value for our clients, customers and shareholders and protects their interests.
We aim to ensure that: Our decision making is attentive to both risk and reward in pursuit of our business plan objectives and strong client outcomes Our responsibilities to clients and customers are prioritised Capital is appropriately rewarded for the risks that are taken The ERM framework ensures that risk is assessed, monitored, controlled and appropriately governed based on a common taxonomy and methodology.
The major components of the ERM framework can be grouped into four areas related to how we govern, assess, monitor and control risks.
Most risks arise in the business first line and that is where they should be managed.
The second line oversees business risk assessments and provides advice and challenge where necessary.
For the purposes of managing risks to the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities, the Group considers the following categories: Risk Definition Market The risk of financial loss as a result of adverse financial market movements.
Credit The risk of financial loss as a result of the failure of a counterparty, issuer or borrower to meet their obligations or perform them in a timely manner.
Liquidity The risk that the Group is unable to settle its financial obligations when they fall due, as a result of having insufficient liquid resources or being unable to realise investments and other assets other than at excessive costs.
Operational The risk that people, processes, systems, or external events impede the Groups ability to meet its strategic objectives.
This risk is a function of internal controls, process efficiency, employee conduct, third party oversight, physical security, integrity of data and business resiliency.
Operational risk also includes the breakdown of processes to comply with laws, regulations or directives.
Conduct The risk that through our behaviours, strategies, decisions and actions the Group delivers unfair outcomes to our customers clients and or poor market conduct.
Regulatory & The risk of regulatory or legal sanction, reputational damage or financial consequences as a result of a failure to legal comply with, or adequately allow for changes in, all applicable laws and legislation, contractual requirements or regulations in any of the countries in which the Group operates.
Strategic Risks which threaten the achievement of the strategy through poor strategic decision-making, implementation or response to changing circumstances.
There are a range of sources of risk affecting these risk categories and the principal risks and uncertainties that affect the business model are set out in detail in the Risk management section of the Strategic report.
Risk segments The assets and liabilities on the Groups consolidated statement of financial position can be split into three categories risk segments which give the shareholder different exposures to the risks listed previously.
These categories are: Shareholder business Shareholder business refers to the assets and liabilities to which the shareholder is directly exposed.
For the purposes of this note, the shareholder refers to the equity holders of the Company and the preference shareholders.
Unit linked funds Unit linked funds refers to the assets and liabilities of the unit linked funds of the life operations of the Group.
It does not include the cash flows such as asset management charges or investment expenses arising from the unit linked fund contracts.
Such cash flows are included in shareholder business.
Third party interest in consolidated funds and non-controlling interests Third party interest in consolidated funds and non-controlling interests refers to the assets and liabilities recorded on the Groups consolidated statement of financial position which belong to third parties.
The Group controls the entities which own the assets and liabilities but the Group does not own 100% of the equity or units of the relevant entities.
Prior to the sale of the UK and European insurance business the Group also had a participating business risk segment.
Participating business referred to the assets and liabilities of the participating funds of SLAL.
186 Standard Life Aberdeen 2018 FINANCIAL INFORMATION The following table sets out the link between the reportable segments set out in Note 2 and the risk segments.

Prior to the sale of the UK and European insurance business, the Group had significant direct exposure to demographic risks, in particular persistency risk and longevity risk.
Following the sale, the Groups exposure to demographic risk is largely limited to its defined benefit pension plans and is no longer considered a key risk.
The risks relating to the Groups defined benefit pension plans are explained in Note 35.
The shareholder is exposed to operational, conduct, regulatory and legal, and strategic risks arising across the three risk segments and any losses incurred are typically borne by the shareholder.
a ii Consolidated financial position by risk segment The table that follows provides an analysis of the consolidated statement of financial position showing the Groups assets and liabilities by risk segment.
This categorisation has been used to present the information in this note.
Following the sale of the UK and European insurance business the Group no longer has a participating business risk segment and the financial instrument exposures in the shareholder business, unit linked funds, and third party interest in consolidated funds and non-controlling interests risk segments have significantly reduced.
2 Net assets of the shareholder business comprises equity attributable to equity holders of Standard Life Aberdeen plc of 7,438m 2017: 8,604m and equity attributable to preference shareholders of 99m 2017: 99m.
Group financial statements continued b Market risk As described in the table on page 188, the shareholder is exposed to market risk and as a result the following quantitative market risk disclosures are provided in respect of the financial assets of the shareholder business.
Quantitative market risk disclosures are not provided in respect of the assets of the unit linked funds since the shareholder is not directly exposed to market risks from these assets.
The shareholders exposure to market risk on these assets is limited to variations in the value of future fee based revenue earned on the contracts as fees are based on a percentage of the fund value.
The shareholder is also not exposed to the market risk from the assets held by third party interest in consolidated funds and non-controlling interests and therefore they have been excluded from the following quantitative disclosures.
The Group manages market risks through the use of a number of controls and techniques which are discussed in the following section.
Shareholder business Market risk exposures in the Asset management and platforms segment primarily arise as a result of holdings in newly established investment vehicles which the Group has seeded.
Seed capital is classified as held for sale when it is the intention to dispose of the vehicle in a single transaction and within one year.
The shareholder balance sheet includes the following amounts in respect of seed capital.
2018 2017 Seed capital Notes m m Equity securities and interests in pooled investment funds at FVTPL 76 96 Debt securities 22 34 Assets held for sale 24 81 63 Total 179 193 Seed capital is typically invested in quoted funds.
The Group sets limits for investing in seed capital and co-investment activity and regularly monitors exposures arising from these investments.
The Group will consider hedging its exposure to market and currency risk in respect of seed capital investments where it is appropriate and efficient to do so.
The Group will also consider hedging its exposure to currency risk in respect of co-investments where it is appropriate and efficient to do so.
Other market risks associated with co-investments are not hedged given the need for the Groups economic interests to be aligned with those of the co-investors.
Market risk exposure also arises to the extent that the market value of assets held to back debt issued does not move in line with the market value of the liabilities being backed.
This risk is controlled through having robust processes in place to limit the use of proceeds from debt issuance and includes the use of investment constraints and portfolio limits.
b i Elements of market risk The main elements of market risk to which the Group is exposed are equity risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency risk, which are discussed on the following pages.
Information on the methods used to determine fair values for each major category of financial instrument measured at fair value is presented in Note 41. b i i Group exposure to equity risk The Group is exposed to the risk of adverse equity market movements which could result in losses.
This applies to daily changes in the market values and returns on the holdings in its equity securities portfolio.
The Groups shareholders are exposed to the following sources of equity risk: Direct equity shareholdings in the shareholder business and the Groups defined benefit pension plans The indirect impact from changes in the value of equities held in funds from which management charges are taken Exposures to equity securities are primarily controlled through the limits imposed on the amount of seed capital and co-investment activity that may be undertaken.
190 Standard Life Aberdeen 2018 FINANCIAL INFORMATION The table below shows the direct shareholder businesses exposure to equity markets.
Equity securities are analysed by country based on the ultimate parent country of risk.
Shareholder business 2018 2017 m m UK 24 50 Belgium 1 Denmark 2 Finland 1 France 8 Germany 7 Ireland 1 Italy 5 Japan 1 Malaysia 3 2 Netherlands 4 Russia 1 Spain 6 Sweden 2 Switzerland 4 Taiwan 7 2 US 11 Other 3 19 Total 37 127 In addition to the equity securities analysed above, the shareholder business has interests in pooled investment funds of 464m 2017: 204m.
The shareholder exposure to interests in pooled investment funds primarily relates to: Co-investment holdings in property and infrastructure funds of 37m 2017: 56m Investments in certain Aberdeen managed funds to hedge against liabilities from variable pay awards that are deferred and settled in cash by reference to the share price of those funds of 53m 2017: 57m Seed capital in funds which are not consolidated of 57m 2017: 73m Holdings in cash funds which are not consolidated of 30m 2017: 5m Corporate funds held in absolute return funds which are not consolidated of 252m 2017: nil b i ii Group exposure to interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that arises from exposures to changes in the shape and level of yield curves which could result in losses due to the value of financial assets and liabilities, or the cash flows relating to these, fluctuating by different amounts.
The main financial assets held by the Group which give rise to interest rate risk are debt securities and cash and cash equivalents.
The main financial liabilities giving rise to interest rate risk principally comprise subordinated liabilities.
Derivative financial instruments held by the Group also give rise to interest rate risk.
Shareholder business Under the Groups ERM framework, Group companies are required to manage their interest rate exposures in line with the Groups Boards risk appetite.
Group companies typically use a combination of cash flow and duration matching techniques to manage their interest rate risk at an entity level.
The sensitivity of profit after tax to changes in interest rates for the shareholder business is included in the profit after tax sensitivity to market risk table, shown in Section b ii.
b i iii Group exposure to foreign currency risk The Groups financial assets are generally held in the local currency of its operational geographic locations, principally to assist with the matching of liabilities.
However, foreign currency risk arises where adverse movements in currency exchange rates impact the value of revenues received from, and the value of assets and liabilities held in, currencies other than the local currency.
The Group manages this risk through the use of limits on the amount of foreign currency risk that is permitted.
The table below summarise the shareholder businesses exposure to foreign currency risks in Sterling.
The table exclude inter-segment assets and liabilities.
The principal source of foreign currency risk for shareholders arises from the Group's investments in overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates accounted for using the equity method.
On 18 October 2017, the Group issued US dollar subordinated notes with a principal amount of US$750m.
The related cash flows expose the Group to foreign currency risk on the principal and coupons payable.
The Group manages the foreign exchange risk with a cross-currency swap which is designated as a cash flow hedge.
Non designated derivatives relate to foreign exchange forward contracts that are not designated as cash flow hedges or net investment hedges.
During 2018 the Group reaffirmed its strategy for hedging foreign currency risks, providing a consistent approach to managing these risks.
The Group generally does not hedge the currency exposure relating to revenue and expenditure, nor does it hedge translation of overseas profits in the income statement.
Where appropriate, the Group may use derivative contracts to reduce or eliminate currency risk arising from individual transactions or seed capital and co-investment activity.
b ii Sensitivity of financial instruments to market risk analysis The Groups profit after tax and equity are sensitive to variations in respect of the Groups market risk exposures and a sensitivity analysis is presented below.
The analysis has been performed by calculating the sensitivity of profit after tax and equity to changes in equity security prices price risk and to changes in interest rates interest rate risk as at the reporting date applied to assets and liabilities other than those classified as held for sale.
There is no impact in 2018 on profit after tax to changes in property prices.
Unit linked funds Changes in equity security and property prices and or fluctuations in interest rates will affect unit linked liabilities and the associated assets by the same amount.
Therefore, the change in unit linked liabilities and the corresponding asset movement has not been presented.
Limitations The sensitivity of the Groups profit after tax and equity is non-linear and larger or smaller impacts should not be derived from these results.
The sensitivity analysis represents the impact on profit at year end that the changes in market conditions can have.
The sensitivity will vary with time, both due to changes in market conditions and changes in the actual asset mix, and this mix is being actively managed.
The results of the sensitivity analysis may also have been different from those illustrated had the sensitivity factors been applied at a date other than the reporting date.
For each sensitivity test, the impact of a reasonably possible change in a single sensitivity factor is presented, while the other sensitivity factors remain unchanged.
Correlations between the different risks and or other factors may mean that experience would differ from that expected if more than one risk event occurred simultaneously.
These sensitivities concern only the impact on financial instruments and exclude indirect impacts of the variable on fee income and certain costs which may be affected by the changes in market conditions.
Profit after tax and equity sensitivity to price risk.
The impact of the following price risk assumptions on profit and equity, net of tax, are as follows: 1 Impact on profit after tax and on equity 2018 2017 m m Change in equity security prices 10% 16 13 -10% 16 13 20% 32 26 -20% 32 26 1 A positive number for impact on profit after tax represents a credit to the consolidated income statement.
The sensitivity of the Groups total equity to variations in equity securities prices is the same as the sensitivity of the Groups profit after tax.
192 Standard Life Aberdeen 2018 FINANCIAL INFORMATION Profit after tax and equity sensitivity to interest rate risk.
The impact of the following interest rate assumptions on profit and equity, net of tax, are as follows: 1 Impact on profit after tax Impact on equity 2018 2017 2018 2017 m m m m Change in interest rates 2 1% 7 24 4 31 2 -1% 7 28 4 33 1 A positive number for impact on profit after tax represents a credit to the consolidated income statement.
2 The interest rate sensitivity is a parallel shift subject to a floor of -30bps.
The impact of interest rate changes on profit after tax in 2018 primarily relates to cash and cash equivalents, while the impact in 2017 primarily relates to assets and insurance contract liabilities of the UK and European insurance business.
The Groups financial instruments include certain debt securities classified as available-for-sale.
These debt securities are measured at fair value.
Interest is calculated using the effective interest method and recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Other changes in fair value and the related tax are recognised in other comprehensive income.
As a result, the sensitivity of the Group's equity to variations in interest rate risk exposures differs from the sensitivity of the Group's profit after tax to variations in interest rate risk exposures.
c Credit risk As described in the table on page 188, the shareholder is exposed to credit risk and as a result the following quantitative credit risk disclosures are provided in respect of the financial assets held.
Quantitative credit risk disclosures are not provided in respect of the assets of the unit linked funds since the shareholder is not directly exposed to credit risk from these assets.
The shareholder is also not exposed to the credit risk from the assets held by third party interest in consolidated funds and non-controlling interests and therefore these have been excluded from the following quantitative disclosures.
The Groups credit risk exposure mainly arises from its holdings in financial instruments.
Exposures to credit risk and concentrations of credit risk are managed by setting exposure limits for different types of financial instruments and counterparties.
The limits are established using the following controls: Financial instrument with credit risk exposure Control Cash and cash equivalents Maximum counterparty exposure limits are set with reference to internal credit assessments.
Derivative financial instruments Maximum counterparty exposure limits, net of collateral, are set with reference to internal credit assessments.
The forms of collateral that may be accepted are also specified and minimum transfer amounts in respect of collateral transfers are documented.
Refer to Section c ii for further details on collateral.
Debt securities The Groups policy is to set exposure limits by name of issuer, sector and credit rating.
Other financial instruments Appropriate limits are set for other financial instruments to which the Group may have exposure at certain times, for example commission terms paid to intermediaries.
Individual business units are responsible for implementing processes to ensure that credit exposures are managed within any limits that have been established.
Group Treasury perform central monitoring of exposures against limits and are responsible for the escalation of any limit breaches to the Chief Risk Officer.
The tables that follow provide an analysis of the quality of financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired at the reporting date and are exposed to credit risk.
For those financial assets with credit ratings assigned by external rating agencies, classification is within the range of AAA to BBB.
AAA is the highest possible rating and rated financial assets that fall outside the range of AAA to BBB have been classified as below BBB with rules followed for determining the credit rating to be disclosed when different credit ratings are assigned by different external rating agencies.
For those financial assets that do not have credit ratings assigned by external rating agencies but where the Group has assigned internal ratings for use in managing and monitoring credit risk, the assets have been classified in the analysis that follows as internally rated.
If a financial asset is neither rated by an external agency nor internally rated, it is classified as not rated.
The total amounts presented represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date without taking into account any collateral held.
The analysis also provides information on the concentration of credit risk.
c i Credit exposure Assets are deemed to be past due when a counterparty has failed to make a payment when contractually due.
The objective evidence that is taken into account in determining whether any impairment of debt securities has occurred includes: A default against the terms of the instrument has occurred The issuer is subject to bankruptcy proceedings or is seeking protection from creditors through bankruptcy, individual voluntary arrangements or similar process The following tables show the shareholder businesses exposure to credit risk from financial assets analysed by credit rating and country.
Group financial statements continued Shareholder business An analysis of financial and reinsurance assets by credit rating is as follows: Receivables and Reinsurance Derivative other financial Cash and cash assets Loans financial assets Debt securities assets equivalents Total 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 m m m m m m m m m m m m m m Neither past due nor impaired: AAA 36 475 162 612 198 1,087 AA 30 262 1,719 567 947 829 2,696 A 14 12 10 1,121 3,782 350 849 1,483 4,655 BBB 1 113 1,271 20 22 133 1,294 Below BBB 16 155 3 1 19 156 Not rated 6 10 22 51 669 673 8 2 705 736 Internally rated 1,184 1,184 Past due 26 24 26 24 Impaired Total 44 18 21 1,570 8,637 695 697 1,110 2,433 3,393 11,832 At 31 December 2018, receivables and other financial assets of 21m 2017: 19m were past due by less than three months and 1m 2017: 2m were past due by three to six months and 4m 2017: 3m were past due by six to twelve months.
2 This balance primarily consists of securities held in supranationals.
194 Standard Life Aberdeen 2018 FINANCIAL INFORMATION c ii Collateral accepted and pledged in respect of financial instruments Collateral in respect of bilateral over-the-counter OTC derivative financial instruments and bilateral repurchase agreements is accepted from and provided to certain market counterparties to mitigate counterparty risk in the event of default.
The use of collateral in respect of these instruments is governed by formal bilateral agreements between the parties.
For OTC derivatives the amount of collateral required by either party is determined by the daily bilateral OTC exposure calculations in accordance with these agreements and collateral is moved on a daily basis to ensure there is full collateralisation.
Under the terms of these agreements, collateral is posted with the ownership captured under title transfer of the contract.
With regard to either collateral pledged or accepted, the Group may request the return of, or be required to return, collateral to the extent it differs from that required under the daily bilateral OTC exposure calculations.
Where there is an event of default under the terms of the agreements, any collateral balances will be included in the close-out calculation of net counterparty exposure.
At 31 December 2018, the Group had pledged 8m 2017: 46m of cash and nil 2017: 103m of securities as collateral for derivative financial liabilities.
At 31 December 2018, the Group had accepted 21m 2017: 1,501m of cash and 50m 2017: 947m of securities as collateral for derivatives financial assets and reverse repurchase agreements.
None of the securities were sold or repledged at the year end.
c iii Offsetting financial assets and liabilities Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported on the consolidated statement of financial position only when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Other than cash and cash equivalents disclosed in Note 25, the Group does not offset financial assets and liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial position, as there are no unconditional rights to set off.
Consequently, the gross amount of other financial instruments presented on the consolidated statement of financial position is the net amount.
The Groups bilateral OTC derivatives are all subject to an International Swaps and Derivative Association ISDA master agreement.
ISDA master agreements and reverse repurchase agreements entered into by the Group are considered master netting agreements as they provide a right of set off that is enforceable only in the event of default, insolvency, or bankruptcy.
The Group does not hold any other financial instruments which are subject to master netting agreements or similar arrangements.
The following table presents the effect of master netting agreements and similar arrangements.
Related amounts not offset on the consolidated statement of financial position Gross amounts of financial instruments as presented on the consolidated statement Financial collateral of financial position Financial instruments pledged received Net position As at 31 December 2018 m m m m Financial assets 1 Derivatives 20 1 14 5 Reverse repurchase agreements 50 50 Total financial assets 70 1 64 5 Financial liabilities 1 Derivatives 5 1 3 1 Total financial liabilities 5 1 3 1 Related amounts not offset on the consolidated statement of financial position Gross amounts of financial instruments as presented on the consolidated statement Financial collateral of financial position Financial instruments pledged received Net position As at 31 December 2017 m m m m Financial assets 1 Derivatives 2,043 465 1,508 70 Reverse repurchase agreements 900 899 1 Total financial assets 2,943 465 2,407 71 Financial liabilities 1 Derivatives 647 465 95 87 Total financial liabilities 647 465 95 87 1 Only OTC derivatives subject to master netting agreements have been included above.
Group financial statements continued c iv Credit risk on financial liabilities designated as at fair value through profit or loss The Group has designated unit linked non-participating investment contract liabilities as at FVTPL.
As the fair value of the liability is based on the value of the underlying portfolio of assets, the movement, during the period and cumulatively, in the fair value of the unit linked non-participating investment contract liabilities, is only attributable to market risk.
d Liquidity risk As described in the table on page 188, the shareholder is exposed to liquidity risk from shareholder business and unit linked funds and, as a result, the following quantitative liquidity risk disclosures are provided in respect of the financial liabilities of these categories.
The shareholder is not exposed to the liquidity risk from the assets held by third party interests in consolidated funds and non-controlling interests and therefore these have been excluded from the following quantitative disclosures.
Business units employ risk management techniques relevant to their product types with the objective of mitigating exposures to liquidity risk.
For the unit linked business, liquidity risk is primarily managed by holding a range of diversified instruments which are assessed against estimated cash flow and funding requirements.
For non-participating unit linked contracts, a core portfolio of assets is maintained and invested in accordance with the mandates of the relevant unit linked funds.
Policyholder behaviour and the trading position of asset classes are actively monitored.
The unit price and value of any associated contracts would reflect the proceeds of any sales of assets.
If considered necessary, deferral terms within the policy conditions applying to the majority of the Groups contracts are invoked.
Periodic investigations are undertaken into liquidity requirements, which include consideration of cash flows in normal conditions, as well as investigation of scenarios where cash flows differ markedly from those expected.
All business units are required to monitor, assess, manage and control liquidity risk in accordance with the relevant principles within the Groups policy framework.
Oversight is provided both at a Group level and within the business unit.
In addition, all business units benefit from membership of a Group to the extent that, centrally, the Group: Coordinates strategic planning and funding requirements Monitors and manages risk, capital requirements and available capital on a group-wide basis Maintains a portfolio of committed bank facilities The Groups committed bank facilities are currently undrawn.
Liquidity risk is managed by each business unit in consultation with the Group Treasury function and each business unit is responsible for the definition and management of its contingency funding plan.
As a result of the policies and processes established to manage risk, the Group expects to be able to manage liquidity risk on an ongoing basis.
We recognise there are a number of scenarios that can impact the liquid resources of a business as discussed in the Risk management section of the Strategic report.
d i Maturity analysis The analysis that follows presents the undiscounted cash flows payable by remaining contractual maturity at the reporting date for all financial liabilities, including non-participating investment contract liabilities.
Given that unit linked policyholders can usually choose to surrender, in part or in full, their unit linked contracts at any time, the non-participating investment contract unit linked liabilities presented in the table below have been designated as payable within one year.
Such surrenders would be matched in practice, if necessary, by sales of underlying assets.
The Group can delay settling liabilities to unit linked policyholders to ensure fairness between those remaining in the fund and those leaving the fund.
The length of any such delay is dependent on the underlying financial assets.
In this analysis, the maturity within one year includes liabilities that are repayable on demand.
Comparatives exclude financial liabilities of the participating business.
Refer Note 21 for the maturity profile of undiscounted cash flows of derivative financial instruments.
The Group also had unrecognised commitments in respect of financial instruments as at 31 December 2018 with a contractual maturity of within one year and between one and five years of 9m and 28m respectively 2017: 411m and 36m.
e Operational risk The Group defines operational risk as the risk that people, processes, systems, or external events impede the Groups ability to meet its strategic objectives.
The Group conduct and operational risk policy framework is used to support the management of operational risks.
Business units adopt the relevant minimum standards contained within these policies and are required to manage risk in accordance with the policies, taking mitigating action as appropriate to operate within appetites.
The types of operational risk to which the Group is exposed are identified using the following operational risk categories: Process execution and trade errors People Technology Business resilience and continuity Fraud and financial crime Change management Supplier risk Financial management process Activities undertaken to ensure the practical operation of controls over financial risks, that is, market, credit and liquidity, are treated as an operational risk.
Operational risk exposures are controlled using one or a combination of the following: modifying operations to mitigate the exposure to the risk: accepting exposure to the risk: or accepting exposure to the risk and controlling the exposure by risk transfer or risk treatment.
The factors on which the level of control and nature of the controls implemented are based include: The potential cause and impact of the risk The likelihood of the risk being realised in the absence of any controls The ease with which the risk could be insured against The cost of implementing controls to reduce the likelihood of the risk being realised Operational risk appetite Risk Control Self Assessment RCSA is a monitoring activity where business managers assess the operation of the controls for which they are responsible and the adequacy of these controls to manage key operational risks and associated business processes.
The assessment completed by business managers is validated and challenged on a risk basis by the Risk and Compliance function in its role of second line of defence.
Independent assurance as to the effectiveness of the RCSA process is provided by Group Internal Audit in its role of third line of defence.
The results of RCSA are reported through the risk governance structure.
The assessment of operational risk exposures is performed on a qualitative basis using a combination of impact and likelihood, and on a quantitative basis using objective and verifiable measures.
The maximum amount of operational risk the Group is willing to tolerate is defined using risk appetite statements and Board approved tolerances.
The operational risks faced by each business unit and its exposure to these risks forms its operational risk profile.
Each business unit is required to understand and review its profile based on a combination of the estimated impact and likelihood of risk events occurring in the future, the results of RCSA and a review of risk exposures relative to approved limits.
The impact of a new product, a significant change, or any one-off transaction on the operational risk profile of each business unit is assessed and managed in accordance with established guidelines or standards.
Group financial statements continued f Conduct risk The Group defines conduct risk as the risk that through our behaviours, strategies, decisions and actions the Group delivers unfair outcomes to our customers clients and or poor market conduct.
Conduct risk can occur across multiple areas and from multiple sources, including the crystallisation of an operational risk.
The Group has a single conduct and operational risk framework that utilises the tools, such as RCSAs, outlined under operational risk e to ensure the appropriate identification and management of conduct risk.
Business units adopt the relevant minimum standards contained within the conduct risk policy and are required to manage risk in accordance with this and other policies that have an impact on the overall conduct risk, taking mitigating action as appropriate to operate within appetites.
The following conduct risk policy standards have defined outcomes against which conduct risk is assessed within the Group: Culture Proposition design Communication and information Advice and distribution Service Barriers Proposition performance Market integrity g Regulatory and legal risk The Group defines regulatory and legal risk as the risk of regulatory or legal sanction, reputational damage or financial consequences as a result of a failure to comply with, or adequately allow for changes in, all applicable laws and legislation, contractual requirements or regulations in any of the countries in which the Group operates.
Business units must have in place procedures to identify, report and analyse all regulatory compliance breaches to the relevant business unit compliance function.
Additionally, business units are required to have procedures in place to identify, assess and monitor the impact of changes to laws, regulations and rules, prescribed practices and external regulatory events in jurisdictions where they choose to carry on regulated financial services activity.
h Strategic risk The Group defines strategic risk as those risks which threaten the achievement of the strategy through poor strategic decision-making, implementation or response to changing circumstances.
Strategic risks are considered across the Group through the business planning process.
The strategic risks to which the Group is exposed are reviewed on a regular basis.

Structured entities A structured entity is an entity that is structured in such a way that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity.
The Group has interests in structured entities through investments in a range of investment vehicles including: Pooled investment funds managed internally and externally, including OEICs, SICAVs, unit trusts and limited partnerships Debt securitisation vehicles which issue asset-backed securities The Group consolidates structured entities which it controls.
Where the Group has an investment in, but not control over these types of entities, the investment is classified as an investment in associate when the Group has significant influence.
The Group also has interests in structured entities through asset management fees and other fees received from these entities.
a Consolidated structured entities As at 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017, the Group has not provided any non-contractual financial or other support to any consolidated structured entity and there are no current intentions to do so.
b Unconsolidated structured entities As at 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017, the Group has not provided any non-contractual financial or other support to any unconsolidated structured entities and there are no current intentions to do so.
b i Investments in unconsolidated structured entities The following table shows the carrying value of the Groups investments in unconsolidated structured entities by line item in the consolidated statement of financial position and by risk segment as defined in Note 39.
Equity securities and interests in pooled investment funds includes 610m 2017: 11,146m of unconsolidated structured entities which are managed by the Group and in which the Group has a direct investment of which 34m 2017: 5,936m relates to investments in associates measured at FVTPL.
The asset value of these unconsolidated structured entities, net of cross holdings, is 21,020m 2017: 62,741m of which 20m 2017: 19,219m relates to investments in associates measured at FVTPL.
The total fees recognised in respect of these assets under management during the year to 31 December 2018 were 44m 2017: 254m of which nil 2017: 31m relates to structured entities where the Groups holding is classified as an investment in an associate measured at FVTPL.
The total issuance balance relating to unconsolidated structured debt securitisation vehicles in which the Group has an investment is 1,000m 2017: 59,169m.
The Groups maximum exposure to loss in respect of its investments in unconsolidated structured entities is the carrying value of the Groups investment and, where the structured entity is managed by the Group, loss of future fees.
As noted in Note 39, the shareholder is not exposed to market or credit risk in respect of investments held in the unit linked funds, and third party interest in consolidated funds and non-controlling interests risk segments.
Additional information on how the Group manages its exposure to risk can be found in Note 39. b ii Other interests in unconsolidated structured entities For those structured entities which the Group receives asset management or other fees from but has no direct investment, the maximum exposure to loss is loss of future fees.
Total assets under management of structured entities in which the Group has no direct investments but has other interests in are 136,047m at 31 December 2018 2017: 80,454m.
The fees recognised in respect of these assets under management during the year to 31 December 2018 were 813m 2017: 305m.
Fair value of assets and liabilities The Group uses fair value to measure many of its assets and liabilities.
Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable willing parties in an arms length transaction.
Estimates and assumptions Determination of the fair value of contingent consideration assets and liabilities is a key estimate.
Further details on the methods and assumptions used to value these assets and liabilities, and sensitivities to those assumptions, are set out in Section d below.
a Determination of fair value hierarchy To provide further information on the approach used to determine and measure the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, the following fair value hierarchy categorisation has been used: Level 1: Fair values measured using quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
An active market exists where transactions take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
Level 2: Fair values measured using inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices Level 3: Fair values measured using inputs that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs b Financial investments and financial liabilities An analysis of the Groups financial investments and financial liabilities in accordance with the categories of financial instrument set out in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement is presented in Notes 19 and 33 and includes those financial assets and liabilities held at fair value.
c Non-financial investments An analysis of the Groups investment property and owner occupied property within property, plant and equipment in accordance with IAS 40 Investment property and IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment is presented in Notes 17 and 18 respectively and includes those assets held at fair value.
d Methods and assumptions used to determine fair value of assets and liabilities including those held for sale Information on the methods and assumptions used to determine fair values for each major category of instrument measured at fair value is given below.
These methods and assumptions include those used to fair value assets and liabilities held for sale, including the individual assets and liabilities of operations held for sale.
Investments in associates at FVTPL, equity securities and interests in pooled investment funds and amounts seeded into funds classified as held for sale Investments in associates at FVTPL are valued in the same manner as the Groups equity securities and interests in pooled investment funds.
Equity instruments listed on a recognised exchange are valued using prices sourced from the primary exchange on which they are listed.
These instruments are generally considered to be quoted in an active market and are therefore categorised as level 1 instruments within the fair value hierarchy.
Unlisted equities are valued using an adjusted net asset value.
The Groups exposure to unlisted equity securities primarily relates to private equity investments, real estate funds and infrastructure funds.
The majority of the Groups private equity investments are carried out through European fund of funds structures, where the Group receives valuations from the investment managers of the underlying funds.
The valuations received from investment managers of the underlying funds are reviewed and where appropriate adjustments are made to reflect the impact of changes in market conditions between the date of the valuation and the end of the reporting period.
The fair value of infrastructure funds is based on the phase of individual projects forming the overall investment and discounted cash flow techniques based on project earnings.
The fair value of real estate funds is based on valuations provided by independent professional valuers.
The valuation of these securities is therefore largely based on inputs that are not based on observable market data, and accordingly these instruments are categorised as level 3 instruments within the fair value hierarchy.
Where appropriate, reference is made to observable market data.
Where pooled investment funds have been seeded and the investment in the funds have been classified as held for sale, the costs to sell are assumed to be negligible.
The fair value of pooled investment funds including those held for sale is calculated as equal to the observable unit price.
Investment property and owner occupied property The fair value of investment property and all owner occupied property is based on valuations provided by external property valuation experts.
The fair value of investment property is measured based on each propertys highest and best use from a market participants perspective and considers the potential uses of the property that are physically possible, legally permissible and financially feasible.
No adjustment has been made for vacant possession for the Groups owner occupied property.
200 Standard Life Aberdeen 2018 FINANCIAL INFORMATION In the UK and Europe, valuations are completed in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS valuation standards.
These are predominantly produced using an income capitalisation approach.
The income capitalisation approach is based on capitalising an annual net income stream using an appropriate yield.
The annual net income is based on both current and estimated future net income.
The yield and future net income used is determined by considering recent transactions involving property with similar characteristics to the property being valued.
Where it is not possible to use an income capitalisation approach, for example on property with no rental income, a market comparison approach is used by considering recent transactions involving property with similar characteristics to the property being valued.
In both approaches where appropriate, adjustments will be made by the valuer to reflect differences between the characteristics of the property being valued and the recent market transactions considered.
As income capitalisation and market comparison valuations generally include significant unobservable inputs including unobservable adjustments to recent market transactions, these assets are categorised as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.
Derivative financial assets and derivative financial liabilities The majority of the Groups derivatives are over-the-counter derivatives which are measured at fair value using a range of valuation models including discounting future cash flows and option valuation techniques.
The inputs are observable market data and over-the-counter derivatives are therefore categorised as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
Exchange traded derivatives are valued using prices sourced from the relevant exchange.
They are considered to be instruments quoted in an active market and are therefore categorised as level 1 instruments within the fair value hierarchy.
Non-performance risk arising from the credit risk of each counterparty has been considered on a net exposure basis in line with the Groups risk management policies.
At 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017, the residual credit risk is considered immaterial and no credit risk adjustment has been made.
Debt securities For debt securities, the Group has determined a hierarchy of pricing sources.
The hierarchy consists of reputable external pricing providers who generally use observable market data.
If prices are not available from these providers or are considered to be stale, the Group has established procedures to arrive at an internal assessment of the fair value.
These procedures are based largely on inputs that are not based on observable market data.
A further analysis by category of debt security is as follows: Government, including provincial and municipal, and supranational institution bonds These instruments are valued using prices received from external pricing providers who generally base the price on quotes received from a number of market participants.
They are categorised as level 1 or level 2 instruments within the fair value hierarchy depending upon the nature of the underlying pricing information used for valuation purposes.
Corporate bonds listed or quoted in an established over-the-counter market including asset-backed securities These instruments are generally valued using prices received from external pricing providers who generally consolidate quotes received from a panel of banks into a composite price.
As the market becomes less active the quotes provided by some banks may be based on modelled prices rather than on actual transactions.
These sources are based largely on observable market data, and therefore these instruments are categorised as level 2 instruments within the fair value hierarchy.
When prices received from external pricing providers are based on a single broker indicative quote, the instruments are categorised as level 3 instruments.
For instruments for which prices are either not available from external pricing providers or the prices provided are considered to be stale, the Group performs its own assessment of the fair value of these instruments.
This assessment is largely based on inputs that are not based on observable market data, principally single broker indicative quotes, and accordingly these instruments are categorised as level 3 instruments within the fair value hierarchy.
Other corporate bonds including unquoted bonds, commercial paper and certificates of deposit These instruments are valued using models.
For unquoted bonds the model uses inputs from comparable bonds and includes credit spreads which are obtained from brokers or estimated internally.
Commercial paper and certificates of deposit are valued using standard valuation formulas.
The categorisation of these instruments within the fair value hierarchy will be either level 2 or 3 depending upon the nature of the underlying pricing information used for valuation purposes.
Commercial mortgages These instruments are valued using models.
The models use a discount rate adjustment technique which is an income approach.
The key inputs for the valuation models are contractual future cash flows, which are discounted using a discount rate that is determined by adding a spread to the current base rate.
The spread is derived from a pricing matrix which incorporates data on current spreads for similar assets and which may include an internal underwriting rating.
These inputs are generally observable with the exception of the spread adjustment arising from the internal underwriting rating.
The classification of these instruments within the fair value hierarchy will be either level 2 or 3 depending on whether the spread is adjusted by an internal underwriting rating.
Income strips Income strips are transactions where an owner-occupier of a property has sold a freehold or long leasehold interest to the Group, and has signed a long lease typically 30-45 years or a ground lease typically 45-175 years and retains the right to repurchase the property at the end of the lease for a nominal sum usually 1.
The valuation technique used by the Group to value these instruments is an income capitalisation approach, where the annual rental income is capitalised using an appropriate yield.
The yield is determined by considering recent transactions involving similar income strips.
Unlike, investment properties which typically are leased on shorter lease terms, the estimated rental value is not a significant unobservable input.
This is due to the length of the lease together with the nature of the rent reviews where the annual rental increases over the term of the lease in line with inflation or fixed increases.
As the income capitalisation valuations generally include significant unobservable inputs including unobservable adjustments to the yield observed in other income strip transactions, these assets are categorised as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
Group financial statements continued Contingent consideration assets and contingent consideration liabilities Contingent consideration assets and liabilities have been recognised in respect of acquisitions and disposals.
Generally valuations are based on unobservable assumptions regarding the probability weighted cash flows and, where relevant, discount rate and therefore the assets and liabilities are classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
Significant contingent consideration arises under the terms of the sale of SLAL to Phoenix in August 2018.
The terms include a number of indemnities that give rise to contingent consideration.
The indemnities that have the most significant impact on the fair value of this contingent consideration are as follows: Annuity sales practices: The annuity sales practices indemnity primarily relates to enhanced annuities.
At the request of the FCA, SLAL is conducting a review of non-advised annuity sales with a purchase price above a minimum threshold to customers eligible to receive an enhanced annuity from 1 July 2008 until 31 May 2016.
The purpose of this review is to identify whether these customers received sufficient information about enhanced annuities to make the right decisions about their purchase, and, where appropriate, provide redress to customers who have suffered loss as a result of not having received sufficient information.
SLAL continues to work with the FCA regarding the process for conducting this past business review.
Under the indemnity if SLAL suffers a loss in excess of the provision it recognised at 31 December 2017 of 248m in relation to annuity sales practices, the Group will pay the excess to Phoenix subject to a 120m cap.
If that provision is not fully utilised Phoenix will pay the Group the unutilised amount.
In addition SLAL shall pay to the Group any recovery received under the related insurance policies.
SLAL had sought for up to 100m of the financial impact to be mitigated by insurance and an update is provided on this insurance recovery on page 205.
If SLAL is subject to an FCA-levied financial penalty relating to the review, the Group shall pay an equivalent amount to Phoenix, subject to a 35m cap.
The technique used to value this element of the contingent consideration is to assess the likelihood of an over or under utilisation of the 31 December 2017 provision.
The likelihood of a receipt of recoveries from the related insurance policies is also considered.
Finally the likelihood of a payment related to any financial penalty has been considered.
Refer 41 d iv for further details.
Persistency: If SLAL suffers adverse lapse experience relating to certain UK unit linked products but excluding unit linked products written in a with profits fund prior to 31 December 2019, the Group shall make a payment to Phoenix, based on the difference between expected and actual lapse experience, subject to a 75m cap.
The technique used to value this element of the contingent consideration is based on a statistical model used for the Groups Solvency II reporting at 31 December 2017, with each possible outcome weighted by the likelihood of that outcome.
Brexit recapitalisation: The Group shall pay to Phoenix an amount related to any additional capital, in excess of an agreed amount, that is required to be contributed to Standard Life International Designated Activity Company SLIDAC in respect of the transfer of certain German and Irish branch businesses of SLAL to SLIDAC pursuant to Brexit-related transfers.
This payment is subject to a cap of 50m.
The technique used to value this element of the contingent consideration determines the range of potential payments under the indemnity with possible outcomes weighted by the likelihood of the outcome.
Non-participating investment contract liabilities The fair value of the non-participating investment contract liabilities is calculated equal to the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities in the funds.
Thus, the value of these liabilities is dependent on the methods and assumptions set out above in relation to the underlying assets and liabilities in which these funds are invested.
The underlying assets and liabilities are predominately categorised as level 1 or 2 and as such, the inputs into the valuation of the liabilities are observable.
Therefore, the liabilities are categorised within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Liabilities in respect of third party interest in consolidated funds The fair value of liabilities in respect of third party interest in consolidated funds is calculated equal to the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities in the funds.
Thus, the value of these liabilities is dependent on the methods and assumptions set out above in relation to the underlying assets in which these funds are invested.
When the underlying assets and liabilities are valued using readily available market information the liabilities in respect of third party interest in consolidated funds are treated as level 2.
Where the underlying assets and liabilities are not valued using readily available market information the liabilities in respect of third party interest in consolidated funds are treated as level 3. d i Fair value hierarchy for assets measured at fair value in the statement of financial position The table below presents the Group's assets measured at fair value by level of the fair value hierarchy.

These amounts are recognised in investment return.
Transfers of equity securities and interests in pooled investment funds and debt securities into level 3 generally arise when external pricing providers stop providing a price or where the price provided is considered stale.
Transfers of equity securities and interests in pooled investment funds and debt securities out of level 3 arise when acceptable prices become available from external pricing providers.
d iv Significant unobservable inputs in level 3 instrument valuations The table below identifies the significant unobservable inputs used in determining the fair value of level 3 instruments at 31 December 2018: Fair value 2018 m Unobservable input Input used Equity securities and interests in 59 This comprises holdings in approximately 80 separate funds, N A pooled investment funds predominantly by value being interests in real estate, infrastructure and private equity funds.
Given the numerous unobservable inputs pertaining to the valuation of the underlying assets in the funds no individual unobservable inputs are considered significant.
Contingent consideration assets 21 Unobservable inputs relate to probability weighted cash flows and liabilities and, where relevant, discount rates.
The most significant unobservable inputs relate to assumptions used to value the contingent consideration related to the sale of SLAL to Phoenix, in particular those related to: See below SLALs annuity sales practices provision including the likelihood and value of annuity sales practices insurance recoveries and any FCA-levied penalty Statistical distribution used Future lapse rates on relevant UK unit linked products of SLAL in the Groups Solvency II internal model at 31 December 2017 204 Standard Life Aberdeen 2018 FINANCIAL INFORMATION Estimates and assumptions The contingent consideration related to the annuity sales practices indemnity is considered to be an item for which assumptions and other sources of estimation uncertainty within the valuation technique at the end of the reporting period have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
The valuation of the contingent consideration in relation to this indemnity takes into account our view of the need for any changes in the provision held by SLAL.
At 31 December 2018 SLAL has not increased or released any element of the provision that it recognised at 31 December 2017.
This reflects the view that the overall level of the provision at 31 December 2017 remains appropriate and therefore that the fair value of this component of the contingent consideration, before considering insurance recoveries and potential FCA-levied penalties, is not material.
The valuation technique and underpinning assumptions are as follows: The key assumptions underlying the provision for annuity sales practices relating to enhanced annuities are: The number of customers entitled to redress The amount of redress payable per customer The costs of conducting the review The number of customers entitled to redress has been estimated based on: The number of customers in the review population The estimated percentage of these customers eligible for an enhanced annuity The estimated percentage of these eligible customers that did not receive sufficient information from SLAL about enhanced annuities The FCA thematic review noted that between 39% and 48% of customers who bought a standard annuity may potentially have been eligible for an enhanced annuity.
The provision assumes 40% of customers were eligible for an enhanced annuity based on observed experience from SLALs review.
The FCA thematic review noted, for the industry as a whole, a plausible range of lost income for customers who were entitled to enhanced annuities but purchased standard annuities to be between 120 and 240 per annum for an average annuity purchase price of 25,000.
The lost income for customers who were entitled to enhanced annuities, for an average purchase price of 25,000, is assumed to be 300 per annum.
This assumption is based on expected experience from SLALs review utilising the redress calculator provided by the FCA in early 2018.
This assumption is unchanged from that used at end 2017.
Assumptions relating to future annuity payments are consistent with SLALs other annuity reserving assumptions.
The costs of conducting the review relate to administrative expenses per case and wider project costs.
The costs are based on SLALs project planning.
Sensitivities are provided in the table below.
Consequential change in contingent Assumption Change in assumption consideration valuation Percentage of customers eligible for an Percentage changed by -5 e. g. 40% enhanced annuity increased to 45% - 18m Percentage of eligible customers that did not receive sufficient information from SLAL about enhanced annuities Percentage changed by -5 - 9m Lost income per annum for an average annuity purchase of 25,000 - 50 - 28m Costs per case of conducting the review - 20% of the cost per case - 5m In addition, the fair value of the contingent consideration has taken into account that substantially all of the 100m being sought by SLAL under insurance policies to mitigate the financial impact was received by the Group in January 2019 and has been based on an assessment of the likelihood of a financial penalty and the FCAs methodology for calculating such penalties.
Group financial statements continued The table below identifies the significant unobservable inputs used in determining the fair value of level 3 instruments at 31 December 2017 and quantifies the range of these inputs used in the valuation at that reporting date: Fair value 2017 m Valuation technique Unobservable input Range weighted average Investment property and owner occupied 9,571 Income capitalisation Equivalent yield 3.3% to 9.0% 5.2% property Estimated rental value 32 to 1,716 326 per square metre per annum Investment property 402 Income capitalisation Equivalent yield 3.8% to 6.6% 5.1% hotels Estimated rental value per 995 to 10,000 5,841 room per annum Investment property and owner occupied 68 Market comparison Estimated value per square 2 to 10,932 3,451 property metre Equity securities and interests in pooled 997 Adjusted net asset value Adjustment to net asset N A 1 investment funds value Debt securities 379 Discounted cash flow Credit spread 1.9% to 2.6% 2.2% commercial mortgages Debt securities 520 Income capitalisation Equivalent yield 4.1% to 6.5% 5.1% income strips Debt securities 506 Discounted cash flow Credit spread 0.7% to 2.1% 1.6% unquoted corporate bonds Debt securities 39 Discounted cash flow Credit spread 1.9% to 2.6% 2.3% infrastructure loans 1 An adjustment is made to the valuations of private equity investments received from the investment managers of the underlying funds to estimate the effect of changes in market conditions between the date of their valuations and the end of the reporting period using market indices.
The adjustment made at 31 December 2018 was nil 2017: nil.
d v Sensitivity of the fair value of level 3 instruments to changes in key assumptions At 31 December 2018 the shareholder is directly exposed to movements in the value of all level 3 instruments since none are held in the Groups unit linked funds or in consolidated structured entities.
Estimates, assumptions and sensitivities relating to contingent consideration assets and liabilities are discussed in Section d iv.
Changing unobservable inputs in the measurement of the fair value of other level 3 financial assets and financial liabilities to reasonably possible alternative assumptions would not have a significant impact on profit attributable to equity holders or on total assets.
Prior to the disposal of SLAL the shareholder was directly exposed to movements in the value of level 3 instruments held by the shareholder business to the extent they were offset by opposite movements in investment and insurance contract liabilities.
Movements in level 3 instruments held by the participating business and unit linked funds risk segments were offset by an opposite movement in investment and insurance contract liabilities and therefore the shareholder was not directly exposed to such movements unless they were sufficiently severe to cause the assets of the participating business to be insufficient to meet the obligations to policyholders.
Movements in level 3 instruments held in the TPICF and NCI risk segment were offset by opposite movements in the liabilities in respect of third party interest in consolidated funds and in equity attributable to non-controlling interest and therefore the shareholder was not directly exposed to such movements.
e Assets and liabilities not carried at fair value The table below presents estimated fair values by level of the fair value hierarchy of assets and liabilities whose carrying value does not approximate fair value.
Fair values of assets and liabilities are based on observable market inputs where available, or are estimated using other valuation techniques.

The estimated fair values of the other instruments detailed above are calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at current market rates.
The carrying value of all other financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost approximates their fair value.

Contingent liabilities and contingent assets Contingent liabilities are possible obligations of the Group of which timing and amount are subject to significant uncertainty.
Contingent liabilities are not recognised on the consolidated statement of financial position but are disclosed, unless they are considered remote.
If such an obligation becomes probable and the amount can be measured reliably it is no longer considered contingent and is recognised as a liability.
Conversely, contingent assets are possible benefits to the Group.
Contingent assets are only disclosed if it is probable that the Group will receive the benefit.
If such a benefit becomes virtually certain it is no longer considered contingent and is recognised as an asset.
Legal proceedings, complaints and regulations The Group is subject to regulation in all of the territories in which it operates insurance and investment businesses.
In the UK, where the Group primarily operates, the FCA has broad powers, including powers to investigate marketing and sales practices.
The Group, like other financial organisations, is subject to legal proceedings, complaints and regulatory discussions, reviews and challenges in the normal course of its business.
All such material matters are periodically reassessed, with the assistance of external professional advisers where appropriate, to determine the likelihood of the Group incurring a liability.
Where it is concluded that it is more likely than not that a material outflow will be made a provision is established based on managements best estimate of the amount that will be payable.
In some cases it will not be possible to form a view, for example because the facts are unclear or because further time is needed to properly investigate, and no provisions are held for such matters.
It is not possible to predict with certainty the extent and timing of the financial impact of legal proceedings, complaints and related regulatory matters.
Commitments The Group has contractual commitments in respect of expenditure on investment property, funding arrangements and leases which will be payable in future periods.
These commitments are not recognised on the Groups statement of financial position at the year end but are disclosed to give an indication of the Groups future committed cash flows.
All Group leases are operating leases, being leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of the ownership of the leased asset.
a Capital commitments The Groups investment property was sold in the year so there are no capital commitments in respect of investment property as at 31 December 2018.
As at 31 December 2017, capital expenditure that was authorised and contracted for, but not provided and incurred was 167m in respect of investment property and income strips discussed in Note 41.
Of this amount, 147m related to the contractual obligations to purchase, construct, or develop property and 20m related to repair, maintain or enhance property respectively.
b Unrecognised financial instruments The Group has committed 37m 2017: 447m in respect of unrecognised financial instruments to customers and third parties.
Of this amount nil 2017: 360m is committed by consolidated private equity funds.
These commitments will be funded through contractually agreed additional investments both by the Group, through its controlling interests, and the funds non-controlling interests.
The level of funding provided by each will not necessarily be in line with the current ownership profile of the funds.
c Operating lease commitments The Group has entered into commercial non-cancellable leases on certain property, plant and equipment where it is not in the best interest of the Group to purchase these assets.
Such leases have varying terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights.
The future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: 2017 1 2018 restated m m Not later than one year 39 37 Later than one year and no later than five years 109 90 Later than five years 102 61 250 188 Total operating lease commitments 1 Comparatives for 2017 have been restated to reflect the classification of the UK and European insurance business as discontinued operations.
Refer Note 1. d Customer contracts At 31 December 2017 the Group had contractual commitments in place to acquire Customer contracts for 74m.
These acquisitions were completed in 2018.

Employee share-based payments and deferred fund awards The Group operates share incentive plans for its employees.
These generally take the form of an award of options or shares in Standard Life Aberdeen plc equity-settled share-based payments but can also take the form of a cash award based on the share price of Standard Life Aberdeen plc cash-settled share-based payments.
Aberdeen Asset Management PLC and its subsidiaries also incentivise certain employees through the award of units in Group managed funds deferred fund awards which are cash-settled.
All the Groups incentive plans have conditions attached before the employee becomes entitled to the award.
These can be performance and or service conditions vesting conditions or the requirement of employees to save in the save-as-you-earn scheme non-vesting condition.
The period over which all vesting conditions are satisfied is the vesting period and the awards vest at the end of this period.
For all share-based payments services received for the incentive granted are measured at fair value.
For cash-settled share-based payment and deferred fund awards transactions, services received are measured at the fair value of the liability.
The fair value of the liability is remeasured at each reporting date and any changes in fair value are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
For equity-settled share-based payment transactions, the fair value of services received is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date.
The fair value of the number of instruments expected to vest is charged to the income statement over the vesting period with a corresponding credit to the equity compensation reserve in equity.
At each period end the Group reassesses the number of equity instruments expected to vest and recognises any difference between the revised and original estimate in the consolidated income statement with a corresponding adjustment to the equity compensation reserve.
Replacement share-based payment awards granted in a business combination are included in determining the consideration transferred.
The amount included is calculated by reference to the pre-combination service and the market-measure of the replaced awards.
At the time the equity instruments vest, the amount recognised in the equity compensation reserve in respect of those equity instruments is transferred to retained earnings.

The shares can be purchased at the end of the savings period at a predetermined price.
Employees are granted a predetermined number of options based on the monthly savings amount and duration of their contract.
The conditions attached to the options are that the employee remains in employment for three years after the grant date of the options and that the employee satisfies the monthly savings requirement.
Settlement is made in the form of shares.
Other share plans i Annual bonus deferred share awards The Group operates the following deferred bonus plan which awards conditional shares.

ii Share incentive plan The Group operates a share incentive plan, allowing employees the opportunity to buy shares from their salary each month.
The maximum purchase that an employee can make in any year is 1,800.
The Group offers to match the number of shares bought up to a value of 50 each month.
The matching shares awarded under the share incentive plan are granted at the end of each month.
The matching shares are generally subject to a three year service period.
Employees may forfeit some or all of share options or awards made under any of the above share-based payment schemes if they leave the Group prior to the end of the awards vesting periods.
Replacement awards On the acquisition of Aberdeen on 14 August 2017, the outstanding options and awards for Aberdeen Asset Management PLC shares under the Aberdeen Asset Management DSP 2009 and Aberdeen Asset Management USA DSAP were replaced with equivalent options and awards for Standard Life Aberdeen plc shares.
Aberdeen also operated a long-term incentive plan which was fully vested prior to acquisition and replaced awards were also issued for the remaining unexercised options.
At the same date, options and awards for Standard Life Aberdeen plc shares were made to relevant Aberdeen employees by the plan in respect of pre-acquisition bonus.
The exercise price for options granted under all long-term and deferred bonus schemes is nil.
The fair value of options granted under the Groups incentive schemes is determined using a relevant valuation technique, such as the Black Scholes option pricing model.
The following table shows the weighted average assumptions that were considered in determining the fair value of options granted during the year and the share price at exercise of options exercised during the year.

The options granted on deferred bonus plans also included 1,026,174 options which related to prior year awards which could only be granted in February 2018 due to market restrictions.
The fair value of the awards was determined based on the share price at the date that the awards would have been made if the market restrictions had not been in place rather than the share price at the date the awards were granted.
The weighted average fair value of these options was 404p with an option term of 3.75 years.
No departures from share option schemes are expected at grant date, with any leavers being accounted for on departure.
In determining the fair value of options granted under the Sharesave scheme the historic volatility of the share price over a period of up to five years and a risk free rate determined by reference to swap rates was also considered.
Group financial statements continued The following table shows the range of exercise prices of options outstanding at 31 December 2018.

Capital management a Capital and risk management policies and objectives Managing capital is the ongoing process of determining and maintaining the quantity and quality of capital appropriate for the Group and ensuring capital is deployed in a manner consistent with the expectations of our stakeholders.
For these purposes, the Board considers our key stakeholders to be our clients, the providers of capital our equity holders and holders of our subordinated liabilities and the Financial Conduct Authority FCA as the lead prudential supervisor for the Group.
There are two primary objectives of capital management within the Group.
The first objective is to ensure that capital is, and will continue to be, adequate to maintain the required level of financial stability of the Group and hence to provide an appropriate degree of security to our stakeholders.
The second objective is to create equity holder value by driving profit attributable to equity holders.
The liquidity and capital management policy forms one element of the Groups overall management framework.
Most notably, it operates alongside and complements the strategic investment policy and the Group risk policies.
Integrating policies in this way enables the Group to have a capital management framework that robustly links the process of capital allocation, value creation and risk management.
Capital requirements are forecast on a periodic basis and assessed against the forecast available capital resources.
In addition, internal rates of return achieved on capital invested are assessed against hurdle rates, which are intended to represent the minimum acceptable return given the risks associated with each investment.
The capital planning process is the responsibility of the Chief Financial Officer.
Capital plans are ultimately subject to approval by the Board.
The formal procedures for identifying and assessing risks that could affect the capital position of the Group are described in the risk management policies set out in Note 39.
Group financial statements continued b Regulatory capital b i Regulatory capital framework From 31 August 2018, following the sale of the UK and European insurance business to Phoenix, the Group is supervised under the CRD IV regulatory regime for group prudential supervisory purposes and therefore measures and monitors its capital on that basis.
Previously, the Group was subject to the Solvency II SII regulatory regime.
The Groups regulatory capital position under CRD IV is determined by consolidating the eligible capital and reserves of the Group subject to a number of deductions to derive regulatory capital resources, and comparing this to the Groups regulatory capital requirements.
Stress testing is completed to determine the appropriate level of regulatory capital and liquidity that the Group must hold, with results shared with the FCA at least annually.
In addition, the Group monitors a range of capital and liquidity statistics on a daily, monthly or less frequent basis as required.
Surplus capital levels are forecast, taking account of projected dividends and investment requirements, to ensure that appropriate levels of capital resources are maintained.
The Group is required to hold capital resources to cover both Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 capital requirements, described below.
Pillar 1 minimum requirement for capital Pillar 1 focuses on fixed overhead requirements and the Groups exposure to credit and market risks in respect of risk-weighted assets, and sets a minimum requirement for capital based on these measures.
At 31 December 2018, the Groups draft Pillar 1 minimum requirement for capital was 0.3bn.
Pillar 2 ICAAP and supervisory review and evaluation process Pillar 2 supplements the Pillar 1 minimum requirement via the ICAAP, which is the means by which the Group assesses the level of capital that adequately supports all of the relevant current and future risks in its business.
The ICAAP focuses on the principal risks to the consolidated financial position and examines each risk category to identify exposures that could put the Groups capital at risk.
The results of the Groups ICAAP process will be subject to periodic review by the FCA under the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process SREP.

Events after the reporting date On 11 March 2019, Standard Life Mauritius Holdings 2006 Limited informed the National Stock Exchange of India Limited and BSE Limited that it intends to Offer for Sale OFS up to 70,000,000 shares in HDFC Life, with an option to additionally sell up to 29,500,000 shares through the OFS, at a floor price of Rs 357.5 per share.
Collectively this represents 4.93% of the total paid up equity share capital of HDFC Life.
Should the full 4.93% be sold through the OFS and at the floor price, it is estimated that the Group would receive a total consideration net of taxes and expenses of approximately Rs.
Assuming full subscription in the OFS at the floor price, the gain on sale is estimated to be approximately 325m after tax.
Following the sale assuming full subscription, HDFC Life would remain an associate of the Group and the Groups shareholding subsequent to the OFS would be 490,126,265 equity shares or 24.30% of the issued share capital of HDFC Life.
