Employee Saveshare Plans Under an HMRC-approved savings-related share option plan, employees save on a monthly basis, over a three or five-year period, towards the purchase of shares of BT Group plc at a fixed price determined when the option is granted.
This price is usually set at a 20% discount to the market price for five-year plans and 10% for three-year plans.
The options must be exercised within six months of maturity of the savings contract, otherwise they lapse.
Similar plans operate for our overseas employees.
Incentive Share Plan ISP Under the ISP, participants are only entitled to these shares of BT Group plc in full at the end of a three-year period if BT Group plc has met the relevant pre-determined corporate performance measures and if the participants are still employed by the group.
For ISP awards granted in 2017 18, 2016 17 and 2015 16: 40% of each award is linked to a total shareholder return TSR target for a comparator group of companies from the beginning of the relevant performance period: 40% is linked to a three-year cumulative normalised free cash flow measure: and 20% to growth in underlying revenue excluding transit.
Deferred Bonus Plan DBP Under the DBP, awards are granted annually to selected employees.
Shares in BT Group plc are transferred to participants at the end of three years if they continue to be employed by the group throughout that period.
Retention Share Plan RSP Under the RSP, awards are granted to selected employees.
Shares of BT Group plc are transferred to participants at the end of a specified retention period if they continue to be employed by the group throughout that period.
Under the terms of the ISP, DBP and RSP, dividends or dividend equivalents earned on shares of BT Group plc during the conditional periods are reinvested in company shares for the potential benefit of the participants.

Awards under the ISP are valued using Monte Carlo simulations.
TSRs are generated for BT and the comparator group at the end of the three-year performance period, using each companys volatility and the cross correlation between pairs of stocks.
Volatility has been determined by reference to BT Group plcs historical volatility which is expected to reflect the BT Group plcs share price in the future.
An expected life of three months after vesting date is assumed for Employee Saveshare options.
For all other awards the expected life is equal to the vesting period.
The risk-free interest rate is based on the UK gilt curve in effect at the time of the grant, for the expected life of the option or award.
The fair values for the DBP and RSP were determined using the market price of the shares at the grant date.
