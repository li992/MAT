Notes on the EEV basis results continued 16 Impact of US tax reform On 22 December 2017, The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the US was enacted into law effective from 1 January 2018.
The tax reform package as a whole, which included a reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35 per cent to 21 per cent and a number of specific measures affecting US life insurers, resulted in a 390 million benefit in non-operating profit reflected within the 2017 results.
The positive impact on an EEV basis represented the benefit of future profits being taxed at a lower rate, partially offset by a reduction in the net deferred tax asset held in the balance sheet to reflect remeasurement at the new lower tax rate, together with a reduction in the benefit from the dividend received deduction on taxable profits from variable annuity business.
In June 2018, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC formally approved changes to RBC capital factors that reflected the December 2017 US tax reform and the 2018 EEV results reflect these changes as shown in notes 6 and 9.
