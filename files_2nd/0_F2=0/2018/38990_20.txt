Polar Capital Technology Trust plc 88 Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 30 April 2018 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 30 April 2018 1.
GENERAL INFORMATION Polar Capital Technology Trust plc is a public limited company registered in England and Wales whose shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The principal activity of the Company is that of an investment trust company within the meaning of Section 1158 1159 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 and its investment approach is detailed in the Strategic Report.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, which comprise standards and interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and International Accounting Standards Committee IASC, as adopted by the European Union and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS and IFRIC guidance.
The Company's presentational currency is Pounds Sterling.
All figures are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds '000 except as otherwise stated.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES The principal accounting policies, which have been applied consistently for all years presented are set out below: a Basis of Preparation The Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, as modified by the inclusion of investments and derivative financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss.
Where presentational guidance set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP for investment trusts issued by the Association of Investment Companies AIC in November 2014 and updated in February 2018 is consistent with the requirements of IFRS, the directors have sought to prepare the Financial Statements on a basis compliant with the recommendations of the SORP.
The financial position of the Company as at 30 April 2018 is shown in the balance sheet on page 86.
As at 30 April 2018 the Companys total assets exceeded its total liabilities by a multiple of over 30.
The assets of the Company consist mainly of securities that are held in accordance with the Companys investment policy, as set out on pages 37 and 38 and these securities are readily realisable.
The Directors consider that the Company has adequate financial resources to enable it to continue in operational existence.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Companys accounts.
b Presentation of Statement of Comprehensive Income In order to reflect better the activities of an investment trust company and in accordance with the guidance set out by the AIC, supplementary information which analyses the Statement of Comprehensive Income between items of a revenue and capital nature has been presented alongside the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The results presented in the revenue return column is the measure the directors believe appropriate in assessing the Company's compliance with certain requirements set out in section 1158 of the Corporation Taxes Act 2010.
Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 89 c Income Dividends receivable from equity shares are taken to the revenue return column of the Statement of Comprehensive Income on an ex-dividend basis.
Special dividends are recognised on an ex-dividend basis and may be considered to be either revenue or capital items.
The facts and circumstances are considered on a case by case basis before a conclusion on appropriate allocation is reached.
Where the Company has received dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised in the revenue return column of the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Any excess in value of shares received over the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised in the capital return column of the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Unfranked income includes the taxes deducted at source.
Bank interest and other income receivable are accounted for on an accruals basis and is recognised in the period in which it was earned.
Interest outstanding at the year end is calculated on a time apportioned basis using the market rates of interest.
d Expenses and Finance Costs All expenses, including finance costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis.
All indirect expenses have been presented as revenue items per the non-allocation method except as follows: any performance fees payable are allocated wholly to capital, reflecting the fact that, although they are calculated on a total return basis, they are expected to be attributable largely, if not wholly, to capital performance.
transaction costs incurred on the acquisition or disposal of investments are expensed either as part of the unrealised gain loss on investments for acquisition costs or as a deduction from the proceeds of sale for disposal costs.
Finance costs are calculated using the effective interest rate method and are accounted for on an accruals basis.
e Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the overseas withholding tax deducted from investment income, tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Statement of Comprehensive Income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Companys liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Polar Capital Technology Trust plc 90 Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 30 April 2018 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED for the year ended 30 April 2018 2.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED e Taxation continued In line with the recommendations of the SORP, the allocation method used to calculate tax relief on expenses presented against capital returns in the supplementary information in the Statement of Comprehensive Income is the marginal basis.
Under this basis, if taxable income is capable of being offset entirely by expenses presented in the revenue return column of the Statement of Comprehensive Income, then no tax relief is transferred to the capital return column.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the Financial Statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Investment trusts which have approval as such under section 1158 of the Corporation Taxes Act 2010 are not liable for taxation on capital gains.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
f Investments Held at Fair Value Through Profit or loss When a purchase or sale is made under contract, the terms of which require delivery within the timeframe of the relevant market, the investments concerned are recognised or derecognised on the trade date and are initially measured at fair value.
On initial recognition the Company has designated all of its investments as held at fair value through profit or loss as defined by IFRS.
All investments are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value, which is either the bid price or the last traded price, depending on the convention of the exchange on which the investment is quoted.
Investments in unit trusts or OEICs are valued at the closing price, the bid price or the single price as appropriate, as released by the relevant investment manager.
Fair values for unquoted investments, or for investments for which there is only an inactive market, are established by using various valuation techniques.
These may include recent arms length market transactions, the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing models.
Where there is a valuation technique commonly used by market participants to price the instrument and that technique has been demonstrated to provide reliable estimates of prices obtained in actual market transactions, that technique is utilised.
Where no reliable fair value can be estimated for such instruments, they are carried at cost, subject to any provision for impairment.
Changes in fair value of all investments held at fair value and realised gains and losses on disposal are recognised in the capital return column of the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 91 g Receivables Receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Receivables do not carry any interest and are short-term in nature and are accordingly stated at their nominal value amortised cost as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
h Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits.
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.
In the Balance Sheet bank overdrafts are shown within current liabilities.
i Payables Payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at their nominal value amortised cost.
j Bank Loans Interest bearing bank loans are initially recognised at cost, being the proceeds received net of direct issue costs, and subsequently at amortised cost.
The amounts falling due for repayment within one year are included under current liabilities in the Balance Sheet.
k Derivative Financial Instruments The Company's activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in market prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
Derivative transactions which the Company may enter into comprise forward exchange contracts, the purpose of which is to manage the currency risks arising from the Company's investing activities, quoted options on shares held within the portfolio, or on indices appropriate to sections of the portfolio, the purpose of which is to provide additional capital return.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Company's policies as approved by the Board, which has set written principles for the use of financial derivatives.
A derivative instrument is considered to be used for hedging purposes when it alters the market risk profile of an existing underlying exposure of the Company.
The use of financial derivatives by the Company does not qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS.
As a result changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as they arise.
If capital in nature, associated change in value is presented in the capital return column of the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
l Rates of Exchange Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of each transaction.
Monetary assets, monetary liabilities and equity investments in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling on that date.
Realised profits or losses on exchange, together with differences arising on the translation of foreign currency assets or liabilities, are taken to the capital return column of the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Foreign exchange gains and losses arising on investments held at fair value are included within changes in fair value.
m Share Capital Represents the nominal value of authorised and allocated, called-up and fully paid shares issued.
Polar Capital Technology Trust plc 92 Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 30 April 2018 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED for the year ended 30 April 2018 2.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED n Capital Reserves Capital reserves gains losses on disposal includes: gains losses on disposal of investments exchange differences on currency balances and on settlement of loan balances cost of own shares bought back other capital charges and credits charged to this account in accordance with the accounting policies above Capital reserve revaluation on investments held includes: increases and decreases in the valuation of investments and loans held at the year end.
All of the above are accounted for in the Statement of Comprehensive Income except the cost of own shares bought back or issued which are accounted for in the Statement of Changes in Equity.
o Segmental Reporting Under IFRS 8, 'Operating Segments', operating segments are considered to be the components of an entity about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Manager with oversight from the Board.
The Board is of the opinion that the Company is engaged in a single segment of business, namely by investing in a diversified portfolio of technology companies from around the world in accordance with the Company's Investment Objective, and consequently no segmental analysis is provided.
In line with IFRS 8, additional disclosure by geographical segment has been provided in note 27.
Further analyses of expenses, investment gains or losses, profit and other assets and liabilities by country have not been given as either it is not possible to prepare such information in a meaningful way or the results are not considered to be significant.
p Key Estimates and Judgements Estimates and assumptions used in preparing the financial statements are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The results of these estimates and assumptions form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The majority of the Company's investments are in US Dollars, however the Board considers the functional currency to be Sterling.
In arriving at this conclusion the Board considered that Sterling is most relevant to the majority of the Company's shareholders and creditors and the currency in which the majority of the Company's operating expenses are paid.
The only estimates and assumptions that may cause material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities relate to the valuation of unquoted investments and investments for which there is an inactive market.
These are valued in accordance with the techniques set out in note 1 f. At the year end, such investments represent less than 0.01% of net assets and consequently, the Board does not believe these to represent an area of significant judgement or estimation.
Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 93 q New and revised accounting Standards There were no new IFRSs or amendments to IFRSs applicable to the current year which had any significant impact on the Company's accounts.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following new and amended IFRSs are in issue but are not yet effective and have not been applied in these accounts: IFRS 9 2014 Financial Instruments, effective 1 January 2018.
The requirements of IFRS9 and its application to the assets and liabilities held by the Company were considered ahead of its adoption on 1 January 2018.
All assets and liabilities held by the Company are currently recorded as fair value through profit and loss.
The classification of all assets and liabilities remains unchanged under IFRS 9 and all figures will be directly comparable to the existing basis of valuation.
IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, effective 1 January 2018.
Given the nature of the Companys revenue streams from financial instruments, the provisions of this standard are not expected to have a material impact.
IFRS 2 amended Classification and Measurement of Share-based payment transactions, effective 1 January 2018.
IFRIC22 Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration, effective 1 January 2018.
Annual Improvement Cycles 2015-2017, effective 1 January 2019.
IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments effective 1 January 2019.
IAS 19 amended Employee Benefits effective 1 January 2019.
IAS 28 amended Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures effective 1 January 2019.
The Directors expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will have either no impact or that any impact will not be material on the Financial Statements of the Company in future periods.

The quarterly investment management fee is calculated on the net assets on the last day of the prior quarter.
The increase in the management fee for the year ended 30 April 2018 is due to the 24% increase in net assets which took place over the year to 30 April 2018.

The deferred tax asset is based on a prospective corporation tax rate of 17% 2017: 17%, which was substantively enacted in September 2016 and is effective from 1 April 2020.
It is unlikely that the Company will generate sufficient taxable profits in the future to utilise these expenses and deficits and therefore no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
Due to the Companys tax status as an investment trust and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval of such status in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided tax on any capital gains arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments held by the Company.

Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset as follows: Level 1 valued using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.
Level 2 valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1.
Level 3 valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.
The valuation techniques used by the company are explained in the accounting policies note on page 90.
There have been no transfers during the year between Levels 1 and 2.
A reconciliation of fair value measurements in Level 3 is set out below.

Level 3 investments are recognised at fair value through profit & loss on a recurring basis.
A - 10% change in the price used to value the investments as at the year end would result in a - 9,000 2017: - 32,000 impact to the capital return of the profit & loss.
The investment held in Herald Ventures Limited is valued semi-annually by the Polar Capital Valuation Committee on the recommendation of the Investment Manager.
The most recent valuation was carried out on 30 April 2018, the valuation principle remained as used in previous years, being the Herald Ventures valuation less a 25% public value discount applied to the underlying publicly traded investments of Herald Ventures.
The Board believe this to be an appropriate way in which to value an unquoted investment.

The main covenants relating to the above loans are: i Total borrowings shall not exceed 40% of the Companys net asset value ii The Companys minimum net asset value shall be 200 million iii The Company shall not change the investment manager without prior written consent of the lenders.
ii Reconciliation of bank loans 30 April 2018 30 April 2017 000 000 Bank loans held as at 30 April 2017 37,193 33,565 Effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on bank loans held 1,916 3,628 Bank loans held as at 30 April 2018 35,277 37,193 The reduction in the liability arising from the bank loans due to changes in foreign exchange rates is a non-cash movement and is included in the Statement of Comprehensive Income within 'Other currency losses'.
As disclosed in note 7, the reduction in the liability creates a foreign exchange gain on bank loans held in the year.

This exposes the Company to a range of financial risks that could impact on the assets or performance of the Company.
The main risks arising from the Companys pursuit of its investment objective are market risk, liquidity risk, credit risk and gearing risk and the Directors approach to the management of them is set out below.
The risks have remained unchanged since the beginning of the year to which the financial statements relate.
The Companys exposure to financial instruments comprise: Equity and non-equity shares which are held in the investment portfolio in accordance with the Companys investment objective Term loans and bank overdrafts, the main purpose of which is to raise finance for the Companys operations Cash, liquid resources and short-term receivables and payables that arise directly from the Companysoperations Derivative transactions which the Company enters into may include equity or index options, index future contracts, forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps.
The purpose of these is to manage the market price risks, foreign exchange risks and interest rate risks arising from the Companys investment activities.
The overall management of the risks is determined by the Board and its approach to each risk identified is set out below.
The Board and the investment manager co-ordinate the risk management and the investment manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision.
Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 105 a Market Risk Market risk comprises three types of risk: market price risk see note 27 a i, currency risk see note 27 a ii, and interest rate risk see note 27 a iii.
i Market Price Risk The Company is an investment company and as such its performance is dependent on the valuation of itsinvestments.
Consequently market price risk is the most significant risk that the Company faces.
Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Companys operations.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
A detailed breakdown of the investment portfolio is given on pages 30 to 33.
Investments are valued in accordance with the Companys accounting policies as stated in Note 2 f. At the year end, the Companys portfolio included derivative instruments of 2,369,000 30 April 2017: 716,000.
Management of the risk In order to manage this risk it is the Boards policy to hold an appropriate spread of investments in the portfolio in order to reduce both the statistical risk and the risk arising from factors specific to a particular technology sector.
The allocation of assets to international markets, together with stock selection covering small, medium and large companies, and the use of index options, are other factors which act to reduce price risk.
The Investment Manager actively monitors market prices throughout the year and reports to the Board which meets regularly in order to consider investment strategy.
Market price risk exposure The Companys exposure to changes in market prices at 30 April on its quoted and unquoted investments was as follows: 30 April 2018 30 April 2017 000 000 Non-current asset investments at fair value through profit or loss 1,491,331 1,220,068 Derivative financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss 2,369 716 1,493,700 1,220,784 An analysis of the Companys portfolio is shown on pages 28 to 36.
Polar Capital Technology Trust plc 106 Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 30 April 2018 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED for the year ended 30 April 2018 27 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Market price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and the value of shareholders funds to an increase or decrease of 15% 30 April 2017:15% in the fair values of the Companys investments.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions and historic trends.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys investments at each balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.

Management of the risk The investment manager mitigates the individual currency risks through the international spread of investments and may make use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
Borrowings in foreign currencies are entered into to manage the asset exposure to those currencies, which vary according to the asset allocation.
Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 107 Foreign currency exposure The table below shows, by currency, the split of the Companys non-sterling monetary assets, liabilities and investments that are priced in currencies other than Sterling.
30 April 2018 30 April 2017 000 000 Monetary Assets: Cash and short term receivables US Dollars 47,478 46,300 Japanese Yen 19,821 12,174 Euros 16,971 11,641 Taiwan Dollars 6,742 1,099 Swedish Kroner 657 703 Korean Won 282 Indian Rupee 36 40 Hong Kong Dollars 1,255 Monetary Liabilities: Payables US Dollars 6,069 12,577 Japanese Yen 64 11,711 Bank Loans: US Dollars 16,699 17,777 Japanese Yen 18,578 19,416 Foreign currency exposure on net monetary items 50,577 9,221 Non-Monetary Items: Investments at fair value through profit or loss that are equities US Dollars 1,184,225 939,721 Japanese Yen 74,939 71,909 Korean Won 51,348 69,700 Euros 67,011 42,564 Taiwan Dollars 39,475 38,091 Hong Kong Dollars 55,974 33,483 Canadian dollars 4,395 7,699 Swedish Kroner 1,304 1,824 Investments at fair value through profit or loss that are derivatives US Dollars 2,369 716 Total net foreign currency exposure 1,531,617 1,214,928 2017 Restated - see page 108.
Polar Capital Technology Trust plc 108 Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 30 April 2018 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED for the year ended 30 April 2018 27 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Restatement of Foreign currency exposure as at 30 April 2017 The Hong Kong Dollars under monetary assets has been restated to 1,255,000 as previously reported 2017: 1,255,000 as it was previously shown as a positive number.
The US Dollars and Japanese Yen under monetary liabilities were restated to 12,577,000 as previously reported 2017: 13,000, 11,711,000 as previously reported 2017: 12,000 respectively as the figures were incorrectly rounded twice.
The US Dollars in the non-monetary items under investments had double counted the US Dollar option, this is therefore restated to 939,721,000 as previously reported 2017: 940,437,000.
As a result of these changes the total amount has been restated to 1,214,928,000 as previously reported 2017: 1,241,701,000.
There is no impact to the profit and loss account or the net asset value of the Company in this or any earlier period.
Foreign currency exchange rate movement During the financial year sterling appreciated by 6.5% against the US Dollar 2017: depreciated by 11.7%, appreciated by 4.5% 2017: depreciated by 6.2% against the Japanese Yen, depreciated by 4.1% 2017: depreciated by 7.1% against the Euro, appreciated by 7.4% 2017: depreciated by 11.5% against the Hong Kong Dollar, depreciated by 0.1% 2017: depreciated by 11.8% against the Korean Won and appreciated by 4.4% 2017: depreciated by 17.4% against the Taiwan Dollar.
Foreign currency sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the loss after tax for the year and the value of shareholders funds in regard to the financial assets and financial liabilities and the exchange rates for the US Dollar, Euro, Japanese Yen, Hong Kong Dollar, Korean Won and Taiwan Dollar.
Based on the year end position, if Sterling had depreciated, by a further 10%, against the currencies shown, this would have the following effect: 30 April 2018 000 Hong Kong Korean Taiwan US Dollar Euro Yen Dollar Won Dollar Statement of Comprehensive Income profit after tax Revenue return 550 38 81 14 95 94 Capital return 134,589 9,331 8,457 6,219 5,737 5,134 Change to the profit loss after tax for the year 135,139 9,369 8,538 6,233 5,832 5,228 Change to shareholders funds 135,139 9,369 8,538 6,233 5,832 5,228 30 April 2017 000 Hong Kong Korean Taiwan US Dollar Euro Yen Dollar Won Dollar Statement of Comprehensive Income profit after tax Revenue return 464 25 99 9 82 94 Capital return 107,740 6,022 8,073 3,860 7,744 4,354 Change to the profit loss after tax for the year 108,204 6,047 8,172 3,869 7,826 4,448 Change to shareholders funds 108,204 6,047 8,172 3,869 7,826 4,448 Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 109 Based on the year end position, if Sterling had appreciated, by a further 10%, against the currencies shown, this would have the following effect: 30 April 2018 000 Hong Kong Korean Taiwan US Dollar Euro Yen Dollar Won Dollar Statement of Comprehensive Income profit after tax Revenue return 450 31 66 12 78 77 Capital return 110,118 7,635 6,920 5,088 4,694 4,202 Change to the profit loss after tax for the year 110,568 7,666 6,986 5,100 4,772 4,279 Change to shareholders funds 110,568 7,666 6,986 5,100 4,772 4,279 30 April 2017 000 Hong Kong Korean Taiwan US Dollar Euro Yen Dollar Won Dollar Statement of Comprehensive Income profit after tax Revenue return 380 20 81 8 67 77 Capital return 88,151 4,928 6,605 3,158 6,336 3,563 Change to the profit loss after tax for the year 88,531 4,948 6,686 3,166 6,403 3,640 Change to shareholders funds 88,531 4,948 6,686 3,166 6,403 3,640 In the opinion of the Directors, neither of the above sensitivity analyses are representative of the year as a whole since the level of exposure changes frequently as part of the currency risk management process used to meet the Companys objectives.
iii Interest Rate Risk Interest rate changes may affect the income received from cash at bank and interest payable on borrowings.
All cash balances earn interest at a variable rate.
The Company finances its operations through its term loans as well as bank overdrafts and any retained gains arising from operations.
The Company uses borrowings in the desired currencies at both fixed and floating rates of interest to both generate the desired interest rate profile and manage the exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Management of the risk The Board imposes borrowing limits to ensure gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions and reviews these on a regular basis.
The Company may also enter into interest rate swap agreements.
Interest rate exposure The exposure, at 30 April, of financial assets and liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to: floating interest rates i. e. giving cash flow interest rate risk when the rate is due to be re-set: fixed interest rates i. e. giving fair value interest rate risk when the financial instrument is due for repayment.
30 April 2018 000 30 April 2017 000 Within More than Within More than one year one year Total one year one year Total Exposure to floating interest rates: Cash and Cash equivalents 101,156 101,156 63,602 63,602 Exposure to fixed interest rates: Bank loan 35,277 35,277 37,193 37,193 Total exposure to interest rates 65,879 65,879 26,409 26,409 Polar Capital Technology Trust plc 110 Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 30 April 2018 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED for the year ended 30 April 2018 27 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Interest rate sensitivity The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary financial instruments held at each balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.
The table below illustrates the Companys sensitivity to interest rate movements, with a change of 0.25% p. a. in the rates of interest available to the Companys financial assets and a change of 0.25% p. a in the rates of interest available to the Companys financial liabilities.
The effect on the revenue and capital return after tax and the value of shareholders funds are as follows if rates increased: 30 April 2018 30 April 2017 000 000 Statement of Comprehensive Income - profit after tax Revenue return 165 66 Capital return Change to the profit loss after tax for the year 165 66 Change to shareholders funds 165 66 A corresponding decrease in the rate would have equal and opposite effect to that shown in the table above.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions.
This is not representative of the year as a whole, since the exposure changes as level of cash loans held during the year will be affected by the strategy being followed in response to the Investment Managers perception of market prospects and the investment opportunities available at any particular time.
b Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the possibility of failure of the Company to realise sufficient assets to meet its financial liabilities.
Management of the risk The Companys assets mainly comprise readily realisable securities which may be sold to meet funding requirements as necessary.
Liquidity risk exposure The maturity of the Companys existing borrowings are set out in note 17 to the financial statements.
Shortterm flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft facilities.
At 30 April the financial liabilities comprised of: 30 April 2018 30 April 2017 000 000 Due within 1 month: Balances due to brokers 6,042 12,545 Accruals 11,544 2,956 Due after 3 months and within 1 year: Bank loan 35,559 37,490 Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 111 c Credit Risk Credit risk is the exposure to loss from failure of a counterparty to deliver securities or cash for acquisitions or disposals of investments or to repay deposits.
Management of the risk The Company manages credit risk by using brokers from a database of approved brokers and by dealing through Polar Capital.
All cash balances are held with approved counterparties.
HSBC Bank plc is the custodian of the Companys assets.
The Companys assets are segregated from HSBCs own trading assets and are therefore protected in the event that HSBC were to cease trading.
These arrangements were in place throughout the current year and the prior year.
Credit risk exposure The maximum exposure to credit risk at 30 April 2018 was 110,765,000 30 April 2017: 84,591,000 comprising: 30 April 2018 30 April 2017 000 000 Balances due from brokers 8,378 20,021 Accrued income 1,231 896 Cash at bank 101,156 63,602 110,765 84,519 All of the above financial assets are current, their fair values are considered to be the same as the values shown and the likelihood of a material credit default is considered low.
None of the Companys financial assets are past due or impaired.
All deposits were placed with banks that had a rating of A or higher.
Investment transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers, the credit standing of each is reviewed periodically by the Investment Manager are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker.
d Gearing risk The Companys policy is to increase its exposure to equity markets through the judicious use of borrowings.
When borrowings are invested in such markets, the effect is to magnify the impact on Shareholders funds of changes, both positive and negative, in the value of the portfolio.
Management of the risk The Company uses short-term loans to manage gearing risk, details of which can be found in note 17.
Gearing risk exposure The loans are valued at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method in the financial statements.
The Board regulates the overall level of gearing by raising or lowering cash balances.
Polar Capital Technology Trust plc 112 Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 30 April 2018 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED for the year ended 30 April 2018 27 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED e Capital Management Policies and Procedures The Companys capital, or equity, is represented by its net assets which are managed to achieve the Companys investment objective set out on page 37.
The Board monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Companys capital on an ongoing basis.
This review includes: i the planned level of gearing through the Companys fixed rate loan facility and ii the need to issue or buy back equity shares for cancellation, which takes account of the difference between the net asset value per share and the share price ie the level of share price discount or premium.
The Companys objectives, policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from the preceding accounting period.
The Company is subject to externally imposed capital requirements through the Companies Act with respect to its status as a public company.
In addition in order to pay dividends out of profits available for distribution by way of dividend, the Company has to be able to meet one of the two capital restriction tests imposed on investment companies by company law.
The Company is also subject to externally imposed capital requirements through the loan covenants set out in the loan facility.
These requirements are unchanged since the previous year end and the Company has complied with them.
