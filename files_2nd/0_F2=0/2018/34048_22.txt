RESULTS FOR THE YEAR RESULTS FOR THE YEAR The following pages provide information about the financial performance for the year on a segmental and Group basis.
A detailed narrative regarding Group and divisional performance has been provided in the Group operating review section on pages 17 to 23.
The key performance indicators, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share are presented and defined in notes 6 and 7.
These are considered key performance indicators because management use these measures to assess longand short-term performance of the Group on a periodic basis.
This section also provides details of the primary operating and finance costs, as well as providing analysis on employee related information and taxation.
Segmental reporting Key Performance Indicator adjusted EBITDA Management uses an adjusted profit measure to monitor the ongoing profitability of the Group, which is defined as Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA adjusted for significant or non-recurring items SONR'.
The significant or non-recurring items that are excluded from EBITDA to calculate adjusted EBITDA are as follows: acquisition expenses and gains and losses on business combinations, disposals and changes in ownership: income and expenses that are significant or non-recurring or non-trading in nature, including business closure costs, restructuring costs and onerous lease provisions: impairment charges and accelerated depreciation and amortisation on property, plant and equipment, intangibles and goodwill: amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition of businesses.
The Directors primarily use the adjusted EBITDA measure when making decisions about the Groups activities as it is the most reliable and relevant profit measure across all segments.
As this is a non-GAAP measure, adjusted EBITDA measures used by other entities may not be calculated in the same way and hence are not directly comparable.
Management has determined the operating segments based on the operating reports reviewed by the Board of Directors that are used both to assess performance and make strategic decisions.
Management has identified that the Board of Directors is the chief operating decision maker in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
The Board of Directors consider the business to be split into the four main revenue-generating divisions: UK Vehicle Remarketing, International Vehicle Remarketing, Vehicle Buying and Automotive Services.
Group costs comprise central head office functions and any costs not directly attributable to the segments.
Information on segment assets and liabilities is not regularly reported to the Board of Directors and is therefore not disclosed.

Management estimates the amount of taxes payable based upon their analysis and determines whether provision should be made for potential settlement of disputed positions which are under negotiation.
Any estimated exposure to interest on tax liabilities is provided for in the related tax amount.

The differences are explained below: For the For the year ended year ended 1 April 2018 2 April 2017 m m Profit on ordinary activities before tax 75.9 56.4 Profit on ordinary activities multiplied by the rate of corporation tax in the UK of 19.0% 2017: 20.0% 14.4 11.3 Effects of: Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 2.5 1.3 Income not subject to tax 0.3 0.4 Reduction in UK tax rate 2.7 Changes in recognition of deferred tax 0.2 2.4 Effect of different tax rates on profits earned outside the UK 1.0 0.8 Adjustments in respect of prior periods 1.1 2.6 Total taxation charge 18.9 15.3 The Group has operations across Europe, however, the principal location of trading where the majority of business profits are derived is the UK.
The effective tax rate has therefore been referenced to the UK corporation tax rate of 19.0% for the year.
Effective tax rate The effective tax rate for the year of 24.9% is higher than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK as a result of higher income tax rates in Europe, prior year adjustments in the UK and Europe on both current and deferred tax balances, and the impact of permanently disallowable items and provisions charged in the year.
Permanently disallowable items comprise expenditure incurred which does not qualify for a tax deduction in the territory in which it arises.
Prior period adjustments relate to changes in the composition of deferred tax assets in the UK which is offset by additional income tax payable in respect of prior periods in Europe.
Excluding the impact of the significant and non-recurring items in the year, the Group has a tax rate of 23.1%.
This is in line with the 22.9% effective tax rate estimated in the Interim report for the six months ended 1 October 2017.
The Group is routinely subject to audit by tax authorities in the territories in which it operates.
Where points are investigated the Group considers each issue on its merits and, where appropriate, holds provisions in respect of the potential tax liability which may arise.
Reductions in the UK corporation tax rate to 19.0% effective from 1 April 2017 and 17.0% effective 1 April 2020 were substantively enacted prior to the balance sheet date.
This will reduce the Groups future tax charge accordingly.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities reported at the balance sheet date have been measured using a blend of these rates, based on when the relevant tax liability or asset is expected to crystallise.
Management expects the Groups underlying tax rate to remain in the low-twenties over the short to medium-term, before the anticipated impact of the UKs future reduction in the corporation tax rate reduces the overall tax rate from 2020 onwards.
Deferred tax Critical accounting estimates deferred tax Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent managements best estimate in determining the amounts to be recognised.
When assessing the extent to which deferred tax assets should be recognised, consideration is given to the timing and level of future taxable income.
