The cross currency and interest rate swaps are measured at fair value using level 2 inputs note 30.
The bonds which are designated as being fair value hedged are remeasured for the fair value changes in respect of the hedged risk using level 2 inputs.
The fair values are estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows using appropriate market sourced data at the balance sheet date.
