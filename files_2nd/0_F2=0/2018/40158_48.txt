Net interest income Accounting policy Interest income for financial assets held at either fair value through other comprehensive income or amortised cost, and interest expense on all financial liabilities held at amortised cost is recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.
Interest income and expense on financial instruments held at fair value through profit or loss is recognised within net interest income using the effective interest method, with the exception of fair value elected structured notes and structured deposits for which all gains and losses are recognised within trading income.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or a financial liability and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability.
When calculating the effective interest rate, the Group estimates cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument for example prepayment options but does not consider future credit losses.
The calculation includes all fees paid or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts.
Where the estimates of cash flows have been revised, the carrying amount of the financial asset or liability is adjusted to reflect the actual and revised cash flows, discounted at the instruments original effective interest rate.
The adjustment is recognised as interest income or expense in the period in which the revision is made.
Interest income for financial assets that are either held at fair value through other comprehensive income or amortised cost that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition stage 3 and have had amounts written off, is recognised using the credit adjusted effective interest rate.
This rate is calculated in the same manner as the effective interest rate except that expected credit losses are included in the expected cash flows.
Interest income is therefore recognised on the amortised cost of the financial asset including expected credit losses.
Should the credit risk on a stage 3 financial asset improve such that the financial asset is no longer considered credit-impaired, interest income recognition reverts to a computation based on the rehabilitated gross carrying value of the financial asset.
