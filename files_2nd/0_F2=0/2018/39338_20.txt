Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Notes to the consolidated accounts for the year ended 30 December 2018 1 Accounting policies for the consolidated accounts Significant accounting policies The Restaurant Group plc the Company is a public listed company incorporated and registered in Scotland.
The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 30 December 2018 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The principal activity of the Group during the period continued to be the operation of restaurants and pubs.
a Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs and IFRS interpretations as adopted by the European Union.
b Going concern basis The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis as, after making appropriate enquires, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future at the time of approving the financial statements.
The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group and further comments on going concern are set out in the report of the Directors.
c Basis of preparation The accounting year runs to a Sunday within seven days of 31 December each year which will be a 52 or 53 week period.
The year ended 30 December 2018 was a 52 week period, with the comparative year to 31 December 2017 being a 52 week period.
The financial statements are presented in sterling, rounded to the nearest thousand.
They have been prepared on the historical cost basis.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Future accounting policies At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the Group has not applied the following new and revised IFRSs that have been issued but are not yet effective and in some cases have not yet been adopted by the EU: IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 2 amendments Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2018 73 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 1 Accounting policies for the consolidated accounts continued The directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group in future periods, except as noted below: IFRS 16 applicable for year ending 2020 will have a material impact on the reported assets, liabilities and income statement of the Group given the extensive portfolio of operating leases held.
Under IFRS 16, the Group will be required to account for its operating leases by recognising a right-of-use asset and related lease liability on the balance sheet.
This will additionally impact the depreciation and interest amounts recognised in the income statement.
The measurement of overall cash flows of the Group will remain unchanged, although there will be classification changes within the cash flow statement as a result of adopting IFRS 16.
Furthermore, extensive disclosures will be required by IFRS 16.
As shown in note 24, the Group has lease commitments of 1,137m at 30 December 2018 across leases of varying remaining length and age.
The impact of the standard on the Group is currently being assessed and it is not yet practicable to quantify the effect of IFRS 16 on these consolidated financial statements.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed review has been completed.
Changes to accounting policies The Group has adopted IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers which have been adopted by the Group.
The implementation of these accounting standards, with effect from 1 January 2018, has not had a material impact on the Group.
There have been no other changes to the accounting standards in the current year that have materially impacted the Group financial statements.
d Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company possess power over the investee, has exposure to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account, regardless of managements intention to exercise that option or warrant.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
ii Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intragroup balances and any gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
e Foreign currency i Transactions and balances Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the date of the balance sheet.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction.
The resulting exchange differences are booked into reserves and reported in the consolidated income statement.
ii Group companies On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date and their statements of profit or loss are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
The exchange differences arising on translation for consolidation are recognised in OCI.
74 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2018 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements f Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation see below and impairment losses see accounting policy k. Cost is the amount of cash or cash equivalents paid or the fair value of the other consideration given to acquire an asset at the time of its acquisition or construction.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
Finance leases Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
The owner-occupied properties excluding land element acquired by way of finance lease are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation see below and impairment losses see accounting policy k. Subsequent costs The Group recognises in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment the cost of replacing part of such an item when that cost is incurred if it is probable that enhanced future economic benefits embodied with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other costs are recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Depreciation Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis to the residual value over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Freehold land Indefinite Freehold buildings 50 years Long and short leasehold property Term of lease or 50 years, whichever is lower Fixtures and equipment 3-10 years Motor vehicles 4 years Computer equipment 3-5 years The estimated useful lives and residual values applied are reviewed at each reporting date with any changes in estimates being applied prospectively.
Intangible assets Goodwill All business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method.
Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition of subsidiaries.
In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since 1 January 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units.
Goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is formally tested for impairment at least annually or when an impairment trigger has arisen see accounting policy k. Intangible assets Trademarks Trademarks represent amounts arising on acquisition of subsidiaries.
Licences are stated at fair value less any accumulated impairment losses.
Trademarks are stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Trademarks are allocated to cash generating units.
Trademarks are not subject to amortisation but are formally tested for impairment at least annually or when an impairment trigger has arisen see accounting policy k. The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2018 75 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 1 Accounting policies for the consolidated accounts continued Intangible assets Franchise agreements Franchise agreements represent amounts arising on acquisition of subsidiaries.
Franchise agreements are stated at fair value less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Franchise agreements are amortised to the income statement using the straight-line method over 15 years, which is the shorter of their estimated useful lives and periods of contractual rights.
Software and IT development Software and IT development are stated at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Software and IT development are amortised to the income statement using the straight-line method over 5 years.
Fair value lease assets and liabilities Lease assets and lease liabilities recognised upon acquisition arise where operating lease rentals are either favourable or unfavourable to current market terms.
A mark to market adjustment is applied to the operating leases to calculate the present values the difference between contractual and market rents until that difference is extinguished.
Lease assets and liabilities recognised upon acquisition are released against the rental expense over the life of the lease so that the income statement charge reflects current market terms.
g Financial assets Classification The Group classifies its financial assets as loans and receivables.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired.
Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period.
These are classified as non-current assets.
The Groups loans and receivables comprise cash and cash equivalents and other receivables in the balance sheet.
Other receivables are amounts due from suppliers or sub tenants in the ordinary course of business.
Other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment see accounting policy k. Recognition and measurement Financial assets are recognised when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provisions for impairment.
Impairment of financial assets is based on managements estimate of future cash inflows.
Offsetting financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and liability simultaneously.
The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the company or the counterparty.
76 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2018 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements h Financial liabilities Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost: any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down.
In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs.
To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a pre-payment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates.
i Inventory Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined in accordance with the weighted average inventory costing model, including applicable commercial discounts.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
j Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and debit and credit card payments received within 48 working hours.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
k Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets are reviewed annually to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
The Group formally determines whether property, plant and equipment are impaired by considering indicators of impairment annually.
This requires the Group to determine the lowest level of assets which generate largely independent cash flows cash generating units or CGU and to determine their recoverable amount, based on estimating the value-in-use of these assets or CGUs: and compare these to their carrying value.
Cash generating units are deemed to be individual units or a cluster of units depending on the nature of the trading environment in which they operate.
We only consider sites as a cluster of units, i. e. as a single CGU, where they are in a single, shared location, such as an airport, such that demand at one unit can directly affect that of other units in the same location.
The discount rate applied in the value-in-use calculations is the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
We apply any CGU specific risks to the underlying cash flow assumptions in calculating the value-in-use and therefore apply the same discount rate to each CGU.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
For goodwill and assets that have an indefinite useful life, the recoverable amount is estimated annually.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Goodwill Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement and are not subsequently reversed.
All goodwill stated on the balance sheet relates to the acquisition of Blubeckers Limited, Brunning and Price Limited, Wagamama Mabel Topco Limited, Food and Fuel Limited and Ribble Valley Inns Limited.
l Share-based payment transactions The Group operates a number of share-based payment schemes.
These schemes allow Group employees to acquire shares of the Company and all options are equity-settled.
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The Stochastic, Black-Scholes and Finnerty valuation models are used to measure the fair value of the options granted.
The type of award and conditions attached to the award determine which valuation model is used.
At the end of each reporting period, the group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions and service conditions.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2018 77 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 1 Accounting policies for the consolidated accounts continued m Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money.
n Onerous lease provisions A provision for onerous lease is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a lease are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the lease.
The Group provides for its onerous obligations under operating leases where the property is closed or vacant and for properties where the fixed cost is in excess of income.
The amount provided is based on the lowest net cost of exiting the contract.
Estimates have been made with respect to the time to exit, sublet or cover the fixed cost base, along with other associated exit costs as well as an evaluation of the cost of void period prior to sublet and the value of lease incentive which may be required to be paid as part of the sublet process.
o Deferred and current tax Corporation tax payable is provided on the taxable profit at the current rate.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, except to the extent that the deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill.
Temporary differences are differences between the carrying amount of the Groups assets and liabilities and their tax base.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse based on tax rates and laws that are enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
p Pensions The Group makes contributions for eligible workers into defined contribution pension plans and these contributions are charged to the income statement as they are accrued.
The Group does not operate any defined benefit plans.
q Revenue Revenue represents amounts received and receivable for goods provided excluding value added tax and voluntary gratuities left by customers for the benefit of employees and is recognised at the point of sale.
Where the Group operates a Concession unit under a franchise agreement, it acts as principal in this trading arrangement.
All revenue from franchise arrangements is recognised by the Group at the point of sale and licencing fees are recorded in cost of sales as the goods are sold.
Where the Group acts as a franchisor in a trading relationship, franchise fees comprise on-going royalties based on the sales results of the franchisee and up front initial site and territory fees.
Royalty revenue is accrued in line with reported sales performance once revenue can be reliably measured.
Up front initial site and territory fees are deferred and recognised on opening of the associated franchisee restaurant.
78 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2018 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements r Other income rental income Rental income is derived from sites where the Group is the lessor.
Rental income is recognised in the income statement as earned.
Provisions are made for any doubtful debts.
Where any lease incentives are provided to the lessee such as rent-free periods, such incentives are accounted for as a reduction in lease income over the lease term.
s Expenses Operating lease payments Fixed payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Contingent rents, such as turnover related rents, are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Incentives to enter into an operating lease are spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term as a reduction in rental expense.
Finance lease payments Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability.
The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Pre-opening expenses Property rentals and related costs incurred up to the date of opening of a new restaurant are written off to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Promotional and training costs are written off to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Borrowing costs Debt is stated net of borrowing costs which are spread over the term of the loan.
All other borrowings costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Commercial discount Commercial discounts represent a reduction in cost of goods and services in accordance with negotiated supplier contracts, the majority of which are based on purchase volumes.
Commercial discounts are recognised in the period in which they are earned and to the extent that any variable targets have been achieved in that financial period.
Exceptional items In order to illustrate the trading performance of the Group, presentation has been made of performance measures excluding those exceptional items which it is considered would distort the comparability of the Groups results.
Exceptional items are defined as those items that, by virtue of their unusual nature or size, warrant separate additional disclosure in the financial statements in order to fully understand the performance of the Group.
The Groups income statement provides a reconciliation of the adjusted profitability measures, excluding exceptional items to the equivalent unadjusted IFRS measures.
Exceptional items are then further detailed in Note 6. t Dividends In accordance with IAS 10 Events after the Balance Sheet Date, dividends declared after the balance sheet date are not recognised as a liability at that balance sheet date, and are recognised in the financial statements when they have received approval by shareholders.
u Treasury shares Own equity instruments that are reacquired treasury shares are recognised at cost and deducted from equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Groups own equity instruments.
Any difference between the carrying amount and the consideration, if reissued, is recognised in the share premium.
The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2018 79 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 1 Accounting policies for the consolidated accounts continued v Restatement of comparatives During the year, management have identified five items for which we have retrospectively amended the financial statements.
Impairment and As originally Capital Rent free Finance Dilapidations onerous disclosed contributions i periods ii lease iii provision iv leases v As restated 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Consolidated income statement for the 52 weeks ended 31 December 2017 Cost of sales before exceptional items 589,490 387 199 708 588,594 Exceptional cost of sales 8,386 16,508 24,894 Interest payable 1,911 199 1,712 Trading tax on profit from ordinary activities 12,076 12,076 Exceptional tax credit 1,423 826 2,249 Profit after tax 32,933 387 14,974 18,346 Adjusted EBITDA 95,118 842 205 95,755 Depreciation and amortisation 36,514 455 6 708 36,255 Consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2017 Property, plant and equipment 335,029 16,460 84 24,253 327,320 Trade and other payables current 124,238 841 8,038 2,200 114,841 Other payables non-current 2,548 15,232 8,038 1,222 24,596 Deferred tax liabilities 5,127 826 4,301 Provisions non-current 31,688 2,200 33,888 Retained earnings 127,548 387 1,306 23,427 105,814 Consolidated statement of changes in equity Retained earnings as at 1 January 2017 129,481 1,306 8,453 122,334 80 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2018 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Impairment and As originally Capital Rent free Finance Dilapidations onerous disclosed contributions i periods ii lease iii provision iv leases v As restated Basic and diluted earnings per share Weighted average ordinary shares for the purposes of basic earnings per share 200,376,258 200,376,258 Weighted average ordinary shares for the purposes of diluted earnings per share 201,344,618 201,344,618 Total profit for the year 000 32,933 387 14,974 18,346 Basic profit loss per share for the year pence Note 9 16.44 0.19 7.47 9.16 Diluted profit loss per share pence Note 9 16.36 0.19 7.44 9.12 Adjusted basic profit loss per share for the year pence Note 9 22.29 0.19 22.48 Adjusted diluted profit loss per share pence Note 9 22.18 0.19 22.37 i Lease incentives capital contributions The Group has historically recognised contributions received from landlords to offset against the cost of fitting out a restaurant as a reduction in Property, plant and equipment.
Management has identified this error in the year, and reclassified to Trade and other payables, split between current and non-current.
Whereas these have previously been depreciated each year, over the lease life, all lease incentives are now recognised within Cost of sales in the income statement.
The prior year credit was also reclassified from Depreciation into Cost of sales.
This has resulted in: An increase in the Property, plant and equipment as at 1 January 2017 of 16.9m, representing the reversal of prior incentives, with a corresponding increase in Trade and other payables balance for the remaining incentives to recognise over the lease life.
An increase in the Depreciation charge for 2017 of 0.5m and a decrease in rent of 0.8m.
ii Lease incentives rent free periods The Group has previously accounted for rent free lease incentives as a current liability, despite them being recognised in the income statement over the life of the lease.
The Group has reclassified amounts that will be unwound to the income statement after one year to non-current Other payables.
This has resulted in: An 8.0m increase in non-current Other payables as at 1 January 2017, and a corresponding decrease in current Trade and Other payables.
There is no impact on the 2017 income statement as the incentive was released appropriately.
The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2018 81 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 1 Accounting policies for the consolidated accounts continued iii Finance lease The historical accounting for finance leases on a number of sites was incorrect.
A mechanical calculation error had led to the future cash outflows being overstated.
This has resulted in: A 1.7m reduction in non-current Other payables, and a corresponding reduction in Retained earnings as at 1 January 2017.
There is less than a 0.1m impact on Property, plant and equipment as these sites have been fully impaired.
The impact on the income statement for 2017 is considered immaterial, and has not been adjusted.
iv Dilapidations provision The Group historically recorded dilapidation provisions within current Trade and other payables.
The Group has corrected the reclassification of dilapidations to non-current Provisions.
This has resulted in: A 2.2m increase in non-current Provisions, and a corresponding decrease in current Trade and other payables as at 1 January 2017.
No impact on the income statement for 2017 as these were recognised prior to 1 January 2017. v Impairment and onerous leases As part of the year-end process, management reviewed and re-assessed the method by which central costs are allocated to the individual CGUs for the purposes of impairment testing.
As a result an appropriate portion of the central costs were allocated to the CGUs to more accurately determine their future cash flows.
This change has been applied retrospectively to the 1 January 2017 balance sheet.
This has resulted in: A write down of the 1 January 2017 Property, plant and equipment values of 8.5m and corresponding reduction in opening Retained earnings: and An additional 2017 Exceptional impairment charge of 16.5m and a reduction in Depreciation of 0.7m, totalling a 15.8m impact on Profit before tax.
Critical accounting judgements In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies as described above, management has made a number of judgements and estimations of which the following are the most significant: Critical accounting estimates and assumptions a Onerous lease provisions Provisions for onerous leases are identified as major sources of estimation uncertainty and by their nature are inherently judgemental.
Estimates have been made with respect to the time to exit, sublet or cover the fixed cost base, along with other associated exit costs as well as an evaluation of the cost of void periods prior to sublet and the value of lease incentive which may be required to be paid as part of the sublet process.
In determining the provision, the risk adjusted cash flows have been discounted on a pre-tax basis using a risk free rate.
82 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2018 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements b Impairment of property, plant and equipment The Group formally determines whether property, plant and equipment are impaired by considering indicators of impairment annually.
Calculating the value-in-use requires the Group to make an estimate of the future cash flows of each CGU and to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
The estimated future cash flows for each CGU are based on past experience and trading at the specific CGU.
The discount rate used in the year ended 30 December 2018 for all CGUs was based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital of 9.2% year ended 31 December 2017: 10.2%.
The Directors believe the risks associated with each CGU are the same, the nature of assets being tested for impairment is consistent, all CGUs are within the restaurant sector and cash flow projections are compiled in the same way for every CGU.
The Group makes judgements in relation to impairment decisions based on the value-in-use estimates of each CGU.
c Acquisition accounting When assets are acquired, management determines whether the assets form a business combination.
A fair value exercise of both the consideration paid and the net assets acquired is performed once it is determined that a business combination has taken place.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
Acquisition costs incurred are taken to the income statement.
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets acquired and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the acquisition date fair value transferred over the net identifiable amounts of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in exchange for the business combination.
Identifiable intangible assets, meeting either the contractual-legal or separability criterion, are recognised separately from goodwill.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
The Group makes judgements in relation to the fair value of the consideration, of the net assets acquired and whether the purchase represents a business combination.
2 Segmental analysis The Group trades in one business segment that of operating restaurants primarily within the United Kingdom.
In addition, the Group operates restaurants in the United States and generates revenues from franchise royalties primarily in the Middle East and Europe.
The segmentation between geographical location and restaurant operations and royalty revenues are not considered significant to be reportable segments under IFRS 8.
The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2018 83 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 3 Revenue Revenue has been generated from the operation of restaurants, with approximately 99% of revenue generated within the United Kingdom.
The remainder is attributable to restaurants within the United States and from franchise royalties primarily in the Middle East and Europe.

To reflect the rights issue, the number of shares previously used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share have been amended in the table above in accordance with IAS 33.
A bonus adjustment factor of 1.3705 has been applied, based on the ratio of an adjusted closing share price of 200.0p per share on 30 October 2018, the business day before the shares started trading ex rights price at that date of 108.5 pence per share.
Prior to this re-presentation, the EPS for the year ended 31 December 2017 as restated Note 1 was 9.16 pence basic, 9.12 pence diluted, 22.48 pence adjusted basic and 22.37 pence adjusted diluted.
Diluted earnings per share information is based on adjusting the weighted average number of shares for the purposes of basic earnings per share in respect of notional share awards made to employees in regards of share option schemes and the shares held by the employee benefit trust.
The calculation of diluted earnings per share does not assume conversion, exercise or other issue of potential ordinary shares that would have an anti dilutive effect on earnings per share.

Refer to Note 28 for further details of intangible assets recognised on acquisition of subsidiaries.
Goodwill and trademarks arising on business combinations are not amortised but are subject to an impairment review annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might be impaired.
Therefore, goodwill and trademarks arising on acquisition are monitored and an impairment test is carried out which compares the value in use of each cash generating unit CGU to its carrying value.
The recoverable amount of the goodwill and trademark CGUs is 352.9m and 236.5m as at 30 December 2018 respectively.
The recoverable amounts have been based on value in use estimates using cash flow projections based on one year budgets approved by the Board.
The value in use estimates differ depending upon the area of the business.
The projected cash flows have been discounted using a rate based on the Groups pre tax.
Weighted Average Cost of Capital of 9.2% 2017: 10.2% that reflects the risk of these assets.
Cash flows are extrapolated in perpetuity with an annual growth rate of 2%.
Perpetuity is believed to be reasonable due to the significant proportion of freeholds in the estate and the nature of the leasehold properties.
It was concluded that the value in use for the CGUs is higher than its carrying value and therefore did not require impairment.
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis taking into consideration the impact on key impairment test assumptions arising from a range of possible trading and economic scenarios.
The scenarios have been performed separately with the sensitivities summarised as follows: An increase in the discount rate of 1% A decrease of 5% on forecast cash flows The sensitivity analysis shows that no impairment would result from either an increase in the discount rate or a decrease in forecast cash flows.

Included within the book value of property, plant and equipment are assets under construction of 2.8m 2017: 0.7m which are not depreciated.
During the period the Group amended its estimate of residual values for property, plant and equipment by reference to an external valuation.
The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2018 93 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 12 Property, plant and equipment continued Impairment testing on the Groups property, plant and equipment has been based on value in use estimates using cash flow projections based on one year budgets approved by the Board.
The value in use estimates differ depending on the area of the business.
The projected cash flows have been discounted using a rate based on the Groups pre tax Weighted Average Cost of Capital of 9.2% 2017: 10.2% that reflects the risk of these assets.
Cash flows are extrapolated in perpetuity or to the end of the lease life with an annual growth rate of 2%.
The key assumptions in the value in use estimates are the discount rate applied and the forecast cash flows.
An increase of 1% in the discount rate would give rise to an additional impairment charge of approximately 1.2m, whilst a decrease of 1% in the discount rate would give rise to a reduction in impairment of approximately 0.5m.
The forecast cash flows take into account managements experience of the specific sites and its long term expectations of the market.
A 10% reduction in these forecast cash flows would result in an additional impairment charge of approximately 2.8m.

The provision comprises the onerous element of expenditure over the life of those contracts which are considered onerous, expiring in 1 to 30 years, and exit costs including the costs of strip out, dilapidations and the costs expected to be incurred over the void period until the property is sublet.
Onerous lease provisions resulted in a charge of 9.5m in the year 2017: 4.5m.
This comprises: A 5.2m credit in respect of unutilised provisions following the successful exit of 28 sites ahead of expectations: A further charge totalling 14.7m was provided for in the year.
This comprised a charge of 11.1m in respect of newly identified onerous leases and a charge of 3.6m in respect of sites previously provided for.
During the year 16.8m of provisions were acquired through business combinations.
Included in the opening balance is a 2.2m reclassification of dilapidations to other provisions, which are expected to be utilised within three years.
Refer to Note 1 for further details.
Changes in the EBITDA performance of each site could impact on the value of the provision.
It is estimated that, a 10% decline in the EBITDA performance of the sites included in the provision would generate an additional provision of 0.3m.
Additionally, it is estimated that, should all leases with more than ten years remaining on the committed lease term be exited two years ahead of expiry, the provision would reduce by 1.0m.
A 1% increase in the risk free rate would reduce the provision by 1.7m while a reduction of similar magnitude would result in an additional provision of 1.9m.

Date by which Deposited Date of Award Shares must be acquired 3 March 2015 30 June 2015 Vesting of share options under the LTIP is dependent on continuing employment or in accordance with good leaver status as set out in the scheme rules.
In exceptional circumstances, employees may be permitted to exercise options before the normal vesting date.
The Conditional and Matching Awards granted on 3 March 2015 became exercisable on 3 March 2018.
The performance criteria was based on total shareholder return TSR and Adjusted earnings per share EPS.
For the TSR element of the award, The Restaurant Group plc was ranked below the median of its comparator group and consequently, none of the TSR element of the award vested.
In respect of the Adjusted EPS element of the award, the growth in Adjusted EPS did not meet the performance criteria and therefore none of this part of the award vested.
The options from the LTIP scheme will be satisfied through shares purchased via a trust.
Further details are provided in Note 19.

Interest is payable at floating interest rates which fluctuate and are dependent on LIBOR and base rate.
The average rate of interest charged during the year on the Groups debt was 3.02% 2017: 2.22%.
On 2018 results, net interest excluding onerous lease interest was covered 47.3 times 2017: 76.5 times by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and exceptional items.
Based on year-end debt and earnings for 2018, a 1% rise in interest rates would reduce interest cover to 27.9 times 2017: 61.1 times.
At 30 December 2018 the Group had a cash balance of 65.9m 2017: 9.6m.
Total Group borrowing facilities consist of a 200m revolving credit facility, a 20m revolving credit facility and a 225m high-yield bond.
The Group has a 10m overdraft facility, which is repayable on demand, on which interest is payable at the banks overdraft rate.

The maturity dates on the Groups debt facilities are as follows: December 2021 for the 200m revolving credit facility: December 2021 for the 20m revolving credit facility: and July 2022 for the high-yield bond.
During the year the Group refinanced to fund the acquisition of Wagamama.
On the 24 December 2018 the previous revolving credit facility was repaid in full and a new revolving credit facility was drawn down.
The charge relates to the write off of unamortised finance costs connected to the cancelled debt facility.
Total borrowing costs of 2.1m were capitalised against the new debt facility in the year.
106 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2018 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Secured liabilities and assets pledged as security The Group has pledged certain assets in order to fulfil the collateral requirements of the revolving credit facility and high-yield bond.
The high-yield bond and 20m of the revolving credit facility are secured by a fixed charge over the fixtures and fittings of 35.3m at acquisition: 35.5m, other receivables of 7.5m at acquisition: 6.8m, trademarks and licences of 0.5m at acquisition 0.5m, and assets arising from a finance leases of 1.0m at acquisition 1.0m.
The fixed charge also covers 90 at acquisition: 90 off balance sheet operating leases.
The revolving credit facility and high-yield bond are secured by a floating charge over the assets not effectively charged by way of fixed charge.
This includes leasehold properties of 76.4m at acquisition: 76.6m, software and IT development of 1.2m at acquisition: 1.2m, stock of 2.6m at acquisition 2.6m, prepayments of 9.4m at acquisition: 10.3m and cash of 38.0m at acquisition: 37.6m.
The maturity profile of anticipated gross future cash flows, including interest, relating to the Groups non-derivative financial liabilities, on an undiscounted basis, are set out below: At 30 December 2018 Trade and other Fixed Floating Finance payables rate rate lease excluding tax loan loan debt Total 000 000 000 000 000 Within one year 164,685 9,281 5,322 272 179,560 Within two to five years 248,343 144,617 1,089 394,049 After five years 12,370 12,370 164,685 257,624 149,939 13,731 585,979 At 31 December 2017 Trade and other Fixed Floating Finance payables rate rate lease excluding tax loan loan debt Total 000 000 000 000 000 Within one year 91,895 669 164 92,728 Within two to five years 33,204 658 33,862 After five years 8,140 8,140 91,895 33,873 8,962 134,730 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2018 107 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 23 Financial instruments and derivatives continued Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities Financial assets 2018 2017 000 000 Gross amount of recognised financial assets 65,988 23,121 Gross amounts of recognised financial liabilities set off in the balance sheet 85 13,510 Net amount of financial assets presented in the balance sheet 65,903 9,611 Fair value of financial assets and liabilities All financial assets and liabilities are accounted for at cost and the Directors consider the carrying value to approximate their fair value.
b Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial losses to the Group.
Counterparties for cash balances are large established financial institutions.
The Group is exposed to credit related losses in the event of non-performance by the financial institutions but does not expect them to fail to meet their obligations.
As a retail business with trading receipts settled either by cash or credit and debit cards, there is very limited exposure from customer transactions.
The Group is exposed to credit risk in respect of commercial discounts receivable.
The Directors make regular assessments of the recoverability of commercial discount receivables based on their knowledge of the customer, historic payments and relevant macroeconomic factors.
An appropriate provision will be made if it is considered the amounts will not be recovered, either partially or in full.
This is consistent with the previous period.
Receivables that are neither past due nor impaired are expected to be fully recoverable.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of any allowances for losses, represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit.
c Liquidity risk The Group has built an appropriate mechanism to manage liquidity risk of the short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
Liquidity risk is managed through the maintenance of adequate cash reserves and bank facility by monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
The Groups loan facility, which matures in December 2021 as set out in note a above ensures continuity of funding, provided the Group continues to meet its covenant requirements as detailed in the Directors Report.
d Foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk relates to the US business and a significant proportion of this risk is mitigated by a natural hedge given that employees and suppliers of the US business are predominantly paid in US dollars from sales revenue generated in the USA.
The Group has used forward contracts to lock in exchange rates for known capital expenditure commitments to manage its remaining foreign exchange risk as part of an overall FX risk management strategy.
e Interest rate risk Exposure to interest rate movements has been controlled historically through the use of floating rate debt and interest rate swaps to achieve a balanced interest rate profile.
The Group does not currently have any interest rate swaps in place as the current market conditions results in a low level of exposure.
The Groups exposure will continue to be monitored and the use of interest rate swaps may be considered in the future.
108 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2018 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements 24 Lease commitments Future lease payments in respect of finance leases are due as follows: Present value of minimum Minimum lease payments lease payments 2018 2017 2018 2017 000 000 000 000 Within one year 272 164 272 164 Within two to five years 1,089 658 779 627 After five years 12,370 8,140 1,564 699 13,731 8,962 Less: future interest payments 11,116 7,472 Present value of lease obligations 2,615 1,490 2,615 1,490 Analysed as: Amount due for settlement within one year 272 164 Amount due for settlement after one year 2,343 1,326 Present value of lease obligations 2,615 1,490 Lease commitments are in respect of property leases where the initial term of the lease is in excess of 25 years and the conditions of the lease are in keeping with a finance lease.
There are no finance leases where the Group itself is the lessor.
The interest rate applied in calculating the present value of the payments is the incremental borrowing cost of the Group in relation to each lease.
The total future minimum rentals payable and receivable under operating leases over the remaining lives of the leases are: Payable Receivable Payable Receivable 2018 2018 2017 2017 Payments due: 000 000 000 000 Within one year 97,481 2,253 73,606 2,037 Within two to five years 322,856 6,451 263,256 6,499 After five years 717,132 22,064 512,931 17,312 1,137,469 30,768 849,793 25,848 The Group has entered into a number of property leases on standard commercial terms, both as lessee and lessor.
There are no restrictions imposed by the Groups operating lease arrangements, either in the current or prior year.
Included within the minimum rentals are amounts payable on properties where the rental payment is based on turnover.
For these properties, primarily in the Groups Concessions business, the amount included above is the minimum guaranteed rent as detailed in the concession agreement.
The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2018 109 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 25 Capital commitments 2018 2017 000 000 Authorised and contracted for: 12,259 23,450 At 30 December 2018, the Group had commitments of 12.3m 2017: 23.5m relating to expenditure contracted for the fit out of pubs and restaurants which have not yet incurred.
26 Contingent liabilities The Group has assigned a number of leases to third parties that were originally completed prior to 1 January 1996 and are therefore unaffected by the Landlord and Tenant Covenants Act 1995 and also a number of leases completed after this date that were the subject of an Authorised Guarantee Agreement.
Consequently, should the current tenant default, the landlord has a right of recourse to The Restaurant Group plc, or its subsidiaries, for future rental payments.
As and when any liability arises, the Group will take whatever steps necessary to mitigate the costs.
The possibility of any outflow is deemed to be remote, however, we estimate contingent liabilities to be 1.6m 2017: 2.0m, calculated on an undiscounted basis to the end of the lease term, up to a period of 5 years.
27 Related party transactions There were no related party transactions in the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2018, other than as described below.
In the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2018, the Group received 0.1m 2017: 0.1m of loan note interest from Black House Newco Limited, all of which was recognised in the income statement.
Capital repayments of nil 2017: 0.4m were received in the year.
Black House Newco Limited is a previous joint venture in which the Group was a party to.
They are considered a related party given the Groups significant influence over Black House Newco Limited.
Up until 2018 the Group held a convertible loan note receivable of 2.9m 2017: 2.9m.
The loan note receivable was fully provided for in prior years and fully written off during 2018.
Remuneration in respect of key management personnel, defined as the Directors for this purpose, is disclosed in Note 5.
Further information concerning the Directors remuneration is provided in the Directors remuneration report on pages 40 to 53.
At the year end the Group owes 123,862 to the Executive Directors in relation to the 2017 deferred bonus share awards, net of tax.
