The STraTegic reporT governance Financial STaTemenTS addiTional inFormaTion What estimates and critical judgements have we made in accounting for our BDUK contracts?
The group receives government grants in relation to the BDUK programme and other rural superfast broadband contracts.
Where weve achieved certain service levels, or delivered the network more efficiently than anticipated, weve an obligation to either re-invest or repay grant funding.
Where this is the case, we assess and defer the income with a corresponding increase in capital expenditure.
Assessing the timing of whether and when we change the estimated take-up assumption is judgemental as it involves considering information which is not always observable.
Our consideration on whether and when to change the base case assumption is dependent on our expectation of the long term take-up trend.
Our assessment of how much grant income to defer includes consideration of the difference between the take-up percentage agreed with the local authority and the likelihood of actual take-up.
The value of the government grants deferred is disclosed in note 17.
In the current year we had a net grant funding of 74m 2016 17: 28m net grant deferral mainly related to our activity on the BDUK programme.
Our base case assumption for take-up in BDUK areas has been increased to 41% 2016 17: 39% following our review of the level of customer take-up.
Based on the current build, a change in the take-up assumption of 4% would result in approximately a 50m movement in the amount deferred.
To date we have a grant funding liability of 536m 2016 17: 446m.
