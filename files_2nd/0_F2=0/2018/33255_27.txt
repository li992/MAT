Financial risk management continued a Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a third party might fail to fulfil its performance obligations under the terms of a financial instrument.
For cash and cash equivalents and other receivables, credit risk represents the carrying amount on the balance sheet.
Credit risk arises from loans to two subsidiaries, receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and deposits with banks.
The Companys financial assets are with counterparties whom the Company considers to have an appropriate credit rating.
Location of credit risk is determined by physical location of the bank branch, customer or counterparty.
The maximum allowable term of maturity for any individual security is 12 months.
Investment counterparties must have a credit rating of at least Baa1 or better by Moodys Investor Services or BBB by Standard and Poors.
No more than 25% of the aggregate market value of the investment portfolio is maintained in any one country, with the exception of the United States of America, United Kingdom and Barbados, or in any one industry group.
Investments are held mainly in United States dollars and cash and cash equivalents in other foreign currencies are maintained for operational requirements.
Company policies are aimed at minimising losses as a result of a counterpartys failure to honour its obligations.
The Companys exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counterparty.
Maximum exposure to credit risk at each reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets in note 16.
The Company does not hold collateral as security for any receivables.
The Company does not grade the credit quality of receivables.
b Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Company monitors its risk of a shortage of funds using projected cash flows and by monitoring the maturity of both its financial assets and liabilities.
The following table outlines the expected maturity of the Companys significant financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period from the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.
As the amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows, these balances may not agree with the amounts disclosed in the balance sheet.

Post balance sheet events a Dividends Acacia has a cash flow based dividend policy where we aim to pay a dividend of between 15-30% of our operational cash flow after sustaining capital and capitalised development but before expansion capital and financing costs.
As a result of the inability to export concentrates following the imposition of the concentrate ban in 2017, the uncertainty around a resolution of the ongoing dispute between the Company and the GoT, and the current liquidity requirements, the Board of Directors has not recommended a final dividend for 2018. b Update on Discussions between Barrick and the GoT On 20 February 2019 the Company noted further announcements by the GoT and by Barrick regarding their direct discussions, but has not yet received a detailed proposal agreed in principle between Barrick and the GoT for a comprehensive resolution of Acacias disputes with the GoT.
Acacia continues to engage with Barrick to understand Barricks plans for the next steps in its direct discussions with the GoT.
Any proposal received by Acacia in the future for a comprehensive resolution of the Companys disputes with the GoT that might be agreed in principle between Barrick and the GoT as a result of their direct discussions will be subject to review by the Independent Committee of the Acacia Board of Directors.
