Priority profit share and carried interest continued Capital return b Priority profit share loans to General Partners 2018 2017 000 000 Movement on loans to General Partners: Losses on current year loans advanced to General Partners 6,325 1,882 Gains on prior year loans recovered from General Partners 510 Total losses on priority profit share loans advanced to General Partners 6,325 1,372 In years in which the funds described in note 5 a have not yet earned sufficient net income to satisfy the priority profit share, the entitlement is carried forward to the following years.
The priority profit share is payable quarterly in advance, even if insufficient net income has been earned.
Where the cash amount paid exceeds the net income, an interest free loan is advanced to the general partner by these primary buyout funds, which is funded via a loan from the Company.
Such loan is only recoverable from the general partner by an appropriation of net income.
Until sufficient net income is earned, no value is attributed to this loan and hence an unrealised capital loss is recognised and reversed if sufficient income is subsequently generated.
