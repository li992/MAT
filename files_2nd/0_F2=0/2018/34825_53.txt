Property provisions relate to onerous leases, dilapidations, market rent adjustments and other property liabilities.
Market rent provisions relate to the fair value of liabilities on leases acquired, which are assessed on acquisition and released over the remaining life of the lease.
The property provision includes onerous leases, which are assessed as being the unavoidable costs of the lease obligations in excess of the economic benefits expected to be received from operating it.
The unavoidable costs of the lease reflect the lease net cost of exiting from the contract and are measured as the lower of the net cost of continuing to operate the lease and any penalties or other costs from exiting it, measured on a discounted basis.
The remaining provision will be utilised over the period to the next rent review date or the remaining lease life depending on the term of the lease.
This is between one and 30 years see further analysis below.
