GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES for the year ended 30 November 2018 continued Leases The Group as lessee Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Non-property assets held under finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease with a corresponding liability being recognised for the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between the reduction of the lease liability and finance charges in the Group income statement so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Non-property assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term.
Interests in leasehold investment properties are accounted for as finance leases with the value of minimum lease payments inherent within the carrying value of the property and the liability reflected within long-term liabilities.
On payment of a ground rent, initially the majority of such costs is charged to the Group income statement as interest payable, with the balance reducing the liability.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the Group income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The Group as lessor Rental income from operating leases, adjusted for the impact of any cash incentives given to the lessee and to reflect any rent-free incentive periods, is recognised in the Group income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Income taxes Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from, or paid to, the taxation authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable result for the year.
The taxable result differs from the result as reported in the Group income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that will not be taxable or deductible.
In particular, as a property group, the effective tax rate for the year reflects the benefit of certain investment gains not being taxable because of historical indexation, capital allowances, land remediation and other reliefs on certain property expenditure.
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements on an undiscounted basis, using the rates of tax expected to apply based on legislation enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, with the following exceptions: in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future: and deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Income tax is charged or credited directly to equity or other comprehensive income if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity or other comprehensive income.
Otherwise, income tax is recognised in the Group income statement.
As a property group, tax and its treatment is often an integral part of transactions.
The outcome of tax treatments are recognised by the Group to the extent that the outcome is reasonably certain.
Where tax treatments have been challenged by HMRC, or management believe that there is a risk of such challenge, provision is made for the best estimate of potential exposure based on the information available at the balance sheet date and supported by the Groups tax advisors, where such exposure is considered more likely than not to occur.
All of the Groups subsidiaries, joint ventures other than those in liquidation processes and associates are resident in the UK for tax purposes and therefore subject to full UK corporation tax.
St. Modwen Properties PLC 134 Annual report and financial statements 2018 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Additional information Pensions The Group operates a pension scheme with both defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
The defined benefit section is closed to new members and, from 1 September 2009, to future accrual.
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit section is determined using the projected unit credit method, which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period to determine current service cost and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value of defined benefit obligation and is based on actuarial advice.
Past service costs are recognised in the Group income statement on the earlier of: the date on which the plan amendment or curtailment occurs: or when the Company recognises related restructuring costs or termination benefits.
Net interest is calculated by applying a discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset and is recognised in the Group income statement as finance cost.
Actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling if applicable and the return on scheme assets excluding interest are recognised in full in the Group statement of comprehensive income in the year in which they occur.
The defined benefit pension asset or liability in the Group balance sheet comprises the present value of the defined benefit obligation, less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly.
When a pension asset net surplus arises from the above calculation, it is limited to the present value of any economic benefits that will be available to the Company in accordance with the requirements of IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction.
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are recognised in the Group income statement in the year in which they become payable.
Own shares Shares in St. Modwen Properties PLC held by the Group are classified as a deduction from equity attributable to owners of the Company and are recognised at cost.
Dividends Dividends are recognised when declared and approved and dividends declared and approved after the balance sheet date are not recognised as liabilities at the balance sheet date.
Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received including the fair value of any residential properties received in part-exchange, excluding discounts, rebates, VAT and other sales taxes or duty.
Where required, revenue is allocated between components in a multi-element transaction e. g. where there is simultaneously a sale of land and a construction contract with the purchaser of the land based on their respective fair values of the components.
The following criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised: Sale of property Revenue arising from the sale of property is recognised on legal completion of the sale.
Construction contracts Revenue arising from construction contracts is recognised in accordance with the Groups accounting policy on construction contracts see below.
An appropriate proportion of revenue from construction contracts is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of contract activity.
Rental income Rental income arising from investment properties is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Management and performance fees Where the Group is solely providing development management services without being responsible for the performance of the underlying construction, management fees receivable are recognised over time as the service is performed in the period to which they relate.
Performance fees are recognised when the Group has substantially fulfilled its obligations in respect of the transaction and hence the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group.
Interest income Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts over the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Dividend income Dividend income from joint ventures is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
St. Modwen Properties PLC Annual report and financial statements 2018 135 GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES for the year ended 30 November 2018 continued Construction contracts Where the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date.
The extent to which the contract is complete is determined by the total costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total anticipated costs of the entire contract.
Variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments are included to the extent that it is probable that they will result in revenue.
Where the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised only to the extent of contract costs incurred where it is probable they will be recoverable.
Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Borrowing costs Interest is capitalised if it is directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of inventory or the redevelopment of investment properties.
Capitalisation commences when the activities to develop the property start and continues until the property is substantially ready for its intended use.
Capitalised interest is calculated with reference to the weighted average interest rate of incremental borrowings.
Government grants Government grants relating to property are treated as deferred income and released to the Group income statement over the expected useful life of the assets concerned.
Share-based payments Share-based payments to employees are equity-settled and are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date, using an appropriate option pricing model.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest.
Fair value hierarchy Assets and liabilities that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, are required to be grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets.
Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity.
If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for any amounts it may have to pay.
If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Groups obligations are discharged, cancelled, or expire.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value or recoverable amount.
Provision is made when there is evidence that the Group will not be able to recover balances in full.
Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances and short-term deposits with banks with initial maturity less than three months.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are recorded at amortised cost.
Where payment is on deferred terms the liability is initially recorded by discounting the nominal amount payable to net present value.
The discount to nominal value is amortised over the period of the deferred arrangement and charged to finance costs.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost.
Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised in finance income or finance expense, as appropriate.
The effective interest rate method is used to charge interest to the Group income statement.
St. Modwen Properties PLC 136 Annual report and financial statements 2018 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Additional information Derivative financial instruments and hedging The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with interest rate fluctuations.
Such instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value.
The Group has determined that the derivative financial instruments in use do not qualify for hedge accounting and, consequently, any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken to the Group income statement.
Equity instruments An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received less direct issue costs.
Convertible bonds Convertible bonds are assessed on issue as to whether they should be classified as a financial liability, as equity or as a compound financial instrument with both debt and equity components.
This assessment is based on the terms of the bond and in accordance with IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation.
The Groups convertible bonds have been designated as at fair value through profit and loss.
Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policies In the application of the Groups accounting policies outlined above, the directors are required to make judgements relating to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations which are dealt with separately below, that the directors have made in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Complex transactions Certain property transactions entered into by the Group involve an element of complexity and the need to exercise judgement to determine the most appropriate accounting policy.
Such transactions include the accounting for the right to secure the interest in the surplus land at New Covent Garden Market together with the associated obligation to procure the new market for the Covent Garden Market Authority further details of which are set out below.
New Covent Garden Market accounting treatment The contractual arrangement between VSM NCGM Limited the Groups 50:50 joint venture with Vinci in respect of New Covent Garden Market and the Covent Garden Market Authority CGMA involves VSM NCGM Limited committing to procure a new market in Nine Elms for the CGMA and in return receiving an option to acquire the surplus land on the site.
In substance the arrangement represents a barter of development and construction services for the interest in the land.
In determining the most appropriate accounting policy for the arrangement, consideration was given as to whether to account for the transaction as the acquisition of an interest in the surplus land for non-cash consideration or to account for the development as a construction contract under IAS 11 Construction Contracts, with the consideration taking the form of the non-cash interest in the surplus land.
It was concluded that the former more faithfully and fairly represented the substance of the arrangement, reflecting that the key strategic rationale for entering into the transaction was to secure the interest in the surplus land and then to unlock its significant value, rather than to secure construction activity in building a new market.
Judgement was also applied in determining the appropriate classification for the interest in the surplus land, which legally takes the form of an option.
Given the intention to take physical delivery of the land and that, at the point of initial recognition, it had not been determined whether to hold the surplus land for capital appreciation or to sell it on to a third party, the surplus land interest was judged to meet the definition of an investment property under IAS 40 Investment Properties, and hence has been accounted for in this way rather than as a financial asset or as inventory.
Subsequent to initial recognition of the interest in the land as investment property and the recognition of the liability to procure the new market facilities, judgement was also applied in determining whether there should be any ongoing interaction between the two balances for example, whether any subsequent adjustment to the estimate of the liability should be accounted for as an adjustment to the original investment property purchase price which ultimately would give rise to an investment property revaluation gain or loss or as a separate provision remeasurement gain or loss in the income statement.
As, going forward, the two balances operate entirely independently of each other, it was determined that they should also be accounted for separately in accordance with the requirements of their respective applicable accounting standards.
Consequently, remeasurements of both the investment property valuation and provision liability are recognised, separately, in VSM NCGM Limiteds income statement in accordance with the requirements of IAS 40 Investment Property and IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets respectively.
Remeasurements of both the investment property valuation and provision liability are reflected together as component parts of the net profit loss of joint ventures and associates post-tax line within the Group income statement.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty In the application of the Groups accounting policies outlined above, the directors are required to make estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant and so actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
St. Modwen Properties PLC Annual report and financial statements 2018 137 GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES for the year ended 30 November 2018 continued The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting period that may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.
Where sensitivities are provided in the notes to the Group financial statements, these are based on a reasonably possible range of outcomes within the next financial year, each of which having been considered with all other variables remaining constant.
Valuation of investment properties Investment properties are held at fair value, which is determined by independent valuations undertaken by external valuation experts in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Manual of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
These valuations are based on prevailing market conditions and evidence of transaction prices for similar properties together with assumptions including yields, estimated rental values, gross development values and the appropriateness of remediation expenditure and costs to complete.
Market conditions and assumptions are expected to change over time and any increase in yields or costs to complete or any decreases in estimated rental values or gross development values in subsequent periods would result in a decrease in the fair value of investment properties.
The Group adopts the valuation performed by its independent valuers as the fair value of its investment properties, following review by management.
The sensitivity of the carrying amount of the liability to the assumptions and estimates used is disclosed in note 9 to the Group financial statements.
Cost to establish a market in Nine Elms The Group engages an external expert to estimate the costs to complete the market in Nine Elms, based on experience of construction to date, recent tendering activity and wider trends in relevant build costs, including inflation.
In determining the appropriate liability to recognise, the reasonably possible range of outcomes estimated by the external expert is reviewed, together with an assessment of the likelihood of sensitivities, risks and opportunities inherent in this complex, long-term project materialising.
Any cost increases or decreases on the project would result in a decrease or increase respectively of the Groups share of its investment in the joint venture.
The sensitivity of the carrying amount of the liability to the assumptions and estimates used is disclosed in note 11 to the Group financial statements.
Net realisable value of inventories In order to determine the profit that the Group is able to recognise on its developments in any given year, the Group has to allocate site-wide development costs between units built in the current year and those to be built in future years, which has an impact on the carrying value of inventories.
The Group has ongoing procedures for assessing the carrying value of inventories and identifying where this is in excess of net realisable value with reference to estimates of costs to complete and remaining revenues.
The assumptions and estimates for both revenue and costs are based on conditions existing at the balance sheet date, with reference to recent experience on similar properties and site-specific knowledge.
The Group does not have any key assumptions or sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of inventory within the next financial year.
Notwithstanding this, as a significant portion of the Groups activities are undertaken through housebuilding and development, the Group is required to make estimates in accounting for revenue and margin.
These estimates may depend upon the outcome of future events and may need to be revised as circumstances change.
Standards and interpretations not yet effective At the date of approval of these financial statements, the following standards, amendments and interpretations which have not been adopted in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU : IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions Amendments to IFRS 3 Definition of a Business Amendments to IFRS 4 Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts Amendments to IFRS 9 Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 28 Definition of Material Amendments to IAS 19 Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement Amendments to IAS 28 Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards Amendments to IFRSs Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2015 2017 Cycle Clarifications to IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers St. Modwen Properties PLC 138 Annual report and financial statements 2018 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Additional information The directors are still assessing the impact that the adoption of the majority of these standards, amendments and interpretations will have on the financial statements of the Group in future periods.
Adoption of the majority of these standards, amendments and interpretations is expected to have little or no impact on the reported results of the Group, although amended disclosures may be required.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, which is effective for the Groups year ending 30 November 2019, concerns the classification, measurement and disclosure of financial instruments.
The classification of all financial assets of the Group, excluding derivative financial assets, will change from loans and receivables to amortised cost, but this will not have a quantitative impact on the financial statements as loans and receivables are currently, subsequent to initial recognition, measured at amortised cost.
The classification of all other financial instruments will remain unchanged.
The introduction of an expected credit loss model will result in the Group evaluating its provision against trade and other receivables using a probability-weighted approach of a range of possible outcomes, which differs from the existing approach of providing against estimated irrecoverable trade and other receivables past due.
However, as the existing provision is not material and the increase to the provision on the implementation of this new provisioning policy is not anticipated to be significant, the impact on the Group income statement for the year ending 30 November 2019 of adopting IFRS 9 is not expected to be material.
The new hedging requirements of IFRS 9 are not applicable to the Group as the Group does not currently hedge account and does not intend to designate any hedging instruments in a hedging relationship with hedged items.
The release of IFRS 9 also introduced new disclosure requirements to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and these changes will result in some limited disclosure changes to the financial instruments note to the Group financial statements.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which is effective for the Groups year ending 30 November 2019, replaces a number of existing revenue standards and interpretations and introduces a five-step, principles-based, model for the recognition of revenue.
The new standard does not apply to the rental income revenue stream, which will be accounted for under IFRS 16 Leases, but does apply to the remainder of the Groups revenue streams.
The Group intends to apply IFRS 15 retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented on adoption.
The only quantitative impact arising from the Groups existing contracts with customers relates to the recognition of revenue on the sale of part-exchange properties.
Revenue is currently recognised as a reduction in housebuilding cost of sales as the purchase and subsequent sale of part-exchange properties is considered an integral part of the sale of the associated St. Modwen Homes unit.
However, under IFRS 15, as the sale of a part-exchange property is a distinct contract with a separate customer, the proceeds should be recognised as revenue.
This will have no impact on the overall profit, cash flow or taxation of St. Modwen Homes, but will slightly alter the presentation of its results.
Applying IFRS 15 for the year ended 30 November 2018 would have resulted in an additional 3.2m of income and an equivalent 3.2m of expense being recognised.
The Group considered the potential impact on adopting IFRS 15 of unbundling contracts due to an assessment of the performance obligations to be delivered to customers.
The assessment will vary depending on the terms of the specific contracts entered into by the Group.
However, the Groups assessment concluded that this impact was immaterial for contracts in progress at the date of implementation and therefore no transitional adjustment to equity will be required.
IFRS 15 also establishes principles for reporting useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
This will increase the extent of some of the revenue-related disclosures in the financial statements.
IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 Leases is not mandatorily effective for the Group until the year ending 30 November 2020, but the Group intends to early adopt the standard at the same time as IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers in the year ending 30 November 2019.
The new standard removes the existing distinction between finance leases and operating leases and requires all lessee contracts in excess of 12 months to be recognised in the Group balance sheet as a right-of-use asset, depreciated on a straight-line basis, and a lease liability recognised at amortised cost, amortised using the effective interest method.
There is no impact on the Groups lessor accounting.
The Group intends to apply IFRS 16 retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognised as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at 1 December 2018.
On transition, the Group anticipates recognising a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability of c. 6m in respect of its leases of certain office premises, motor vehicles and office equipment that are currently accounted for as operating leases.
As there is no impact on the Groups lessor accounting and the Group does not have a significant annual charge for operating leases as lessee, the impact on the Group income statement for the year ending 30 November 2019 of adopting IFRS 16 is not expected to be material.
St. Modwen Properties PLC Annual report and financial statements 2018 139 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 30 November 2018 1.
Segmental information a. Reportable segments IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires the identification of the Groups operating segments, defined as being discrete components of the Groups operations whose results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker being the Chief Executive to allocate resources to those segments and to assess their performance.
The Group divides its business into the following segments: housebuilding activity through St. Modwen Homes and the Persimmon joint venture: and the balance of the Groups portfolio of properties which the Group manages internally, and reports, as a single business segment.
As discussed in the strategic report, following the Groups recent focus on the enablement of its strategy during the year ended 30 November 2018, the Group is now focusing on its three strategic objectives and is currently amending some of its internal financial reporting systems to align more closely to these objectives.
The Group intends to report on this basis to the chief operating decision maker, but has not yet concluded whether this reporting will be used to assess performance and allocate resources.
The Group anticipates reviewing the identification of its operating segments in accordance with IFRS 8 for the year ending 30 November 2019.
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Groups accounting policies.

Non-statutory information The purpose of this note is to explain, analyse and reconcile a number of non-statutory financial performance and financial position metrics, which are used extensively by the Group to monitor its performance.
These metrics reflect the way in which the Group is run, that the Group is in the real estate sector, and in particular that the Group reviews and reports performance of its joint ventures and associates in the same way as it would if they were subsidiaries.
This means that proportionally consolidated measures often referred to as see-through in the strategic report are particularly relevant, whilst also having the benefit of removing the taxation effects on equity accounted entities from the statutory profit before tax figure.
A number of these measures are explained below, together with the EPRA-based measures that are discussed in note 3.
Trading profit See note 2a : Trading profit is calculated on a proportionally consolidated basis and is stated before the principal non-cash income statement items, being revaluation gains and losses, changes in the estimate of the obligation to establish the new Covent Garden flower market, non-cash financing charges and tax.
For a property group with a low depreciation charge and no intangible amortisation charge, this has historically represented a more useful measure than the EBITDA alternative performance measure used by many other companies.
St. Modwen Properties PLC Annual report and financial statements 2018 141 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 30 November 2018 continued 2.
Non-statutory information continued Total accounting return see note 2f : The Groups shareholders measure their returns in terms of both the Groups growth and the dividend return and total accounting return combines these two items.
Whilst this is often measured by Total Shareholder Return which combines share price growth and dividend return, in the real estate sector, it is also insightful to consider net asset growth, which therefore directly reflects the most recent valuation of assets.

Gearing and loan-to-value The Groups capacity to borrow is primarily linked to the value of the property portfolio excluding assets held under finance leases.
Accordingly both adjusted gearing and see-through loan-to-value are calculated using the comparable measure of net borrowings and see-through net borrowings respectively.
Reflecting that residential assets are less attractive for security purposes, we also disclose see-through loan-to-value excluding residential using the comparable measure of see-through net borrowings.
These terms are defined as follows: Net borrowings: Total borrowings at amortised cost and excluding finance leases and fair value movements on the Groups convertible bond less cash and cash equivalents.
See-through net borrowings: Total borrowings at amortised cost excluding finance leases and fair value movements on the Groups convertible bond less cash and cash equivalents including the Groups share of its joint ventures and associates.
This includes the development account beneficially owned by one of our joint ventures VSM NGCM Limited, held for the purpose of funding the establishment of a market at Nine Elms, which would otherwise need to be funded by injecting cash into the joint venture in the future.
Adjusted gearing: The ratio of net borrowings to total equity.
See-through loan-to-value: See-through net borrowings expressed as a percentage of the Groups property portfolio excluding valued assets held under finance leases, calculated on a proportionally consolidated basis including the Groups share of its joint ventures and associates.
See-through loan-to-value excluding residential : See-through net borrowings expressed as a percentage of the Groups property portfolio excluding valued assets held under finance leases and residential land and developments, calculated on a proportionally consolidated basis including the Groups share of its joint ventures and associates.

EPRA performance measures This note sets out two performance measures of the European Public Real Estate Association EPRA, calculated in accordance with their Best Practices Recommendations BPR.
These measures are intended to provide comparability and are explained in detail below: EPRA earnings see note 3a : For investors of real estate companies, a key measure of ongoing operational performance and the extent to which dividend payments are underpinned by earnings is the level of income arising from operational activities.
EPRA earnings exclude unrealised valuation movements and profits on disposal to provide an indicator of the leasing and property management performance of a business.
Adjusted EPRA earnings see note 3a : Whilst EPRA earnings provides a comparable measure for investors, it is not a relevant measure for housebuilders as it excludes all profits from such activity.
On the basis that these profits are realised in cash and represent a core ongoing activity for the Group, a company specific adjustment is made to EPRA earnings in respect of this profit.
Furthermore, the amortisation of loan arrangement fees represents a non-cash interest charge on an ongoing basis and therefore a further company specific adjustment is made for this.
After adjusting these two items for tax, EPRA earnings can be reconciled to adjusted EPRA earnings, which provides a relevant cash-based profit measure that underpins the dividend policy of the Group.
EPRA net asset value see note 3b : The objective of EPRA net asset value is to highlight the fair value of net assets on an ongoing, long-term basis.
Assets and liabilities that are not expected to crystallise in normal circumstances such as the fair value of derivative financial instruments and deferred taxes on property valuation surpluses are therefore excluded, which facilitates a more objective comparison with peer companies.

2 Inventory development gains exclude overheads directly attributable to the residential housebuilding business as these form part of the profits or losses on sale of trading properties that should be adjusted in arriving at EPRA earnings.
3 Pre-sold property development gains arise from property disposals and their development and therefore should be adjusted in arriving at EPRA earnings.
4 The amortisation of discounts on deferred payment arrangements are linked to the disposal of either investment properties or inventory and are therefore adjusted in arriving at EPRA earnings.
5 The early redemption of the retail bond represents a material close-out cost associated with debt and therefore should be adjusted in arriving at EPRA earnings.

Share-based payments The Group has a Save As You Earn share option scheme open to all employees.
Employees must ordinarily remain in service for a period of three or five years from the date of grant before exercising their options.
The option period ends six months following the end of the vesting period.
The Group also operates a discretionary Executive Share Option Plan ESOP.
Options are granted at a fixed price equal to the market price at the date of grant.
Employees must ordinarily remain in service for a period of three years from the date of grant before exercising their ESOP awards.
The option ends on the tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
Details of the Groups Performance Share Plan PSP are given in the Directors Remuneration report.

The charge to the Group income statement during the year in respect of share-based payments was 1.8m 2017: 1.8m.
The fair value of the share incentive reserve in respect of share options outstanding at the year end was 4.7m 2017: 5.1m and included 2.3m 2017: 1.9m in respect of options that had vested at the year end.
In arriving at fair value it has been assumed that, when vested, shares options are exercised in accordance with historical trends.
Expected volatility was determined by reference to the historical volatility of the Groups share price over a period consistent with the expected life of the options.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 4.00 2017: 3.69.
The share options outstanding under the ESOP at the year end had a range of exercise prices between 1.74 and 4.74 2017: 1.56 and 4.74 with all PSP options exercisable at nil 2017: nil.

This provides a composite position with respect to the Groups exposure to asset types by sector.
The aggregate ERVs and weighted average equivalent yields provided above are disclosed for those assets held by the Group excluding its joint ventures and associates.
The Groups portfolio has a wide spread of yields as it includes assets that are at various stages of the property lifecycle.
Income producing assets are generally acquired at high yields where the Group has the opportunity to add significant value.
As assets are enhanced and development activity is undertaken, improved and new assets are created and valued at lower yields.
All other factors being equal, a higher equivalent yield would lead to a decrease in the valuation of an asset and an increase in the current or estimated future rental stream would have the effect of increasing the capital value, and vice versa.
However, there are inter-relationships between the unobservable inputs which are partially determined by market conditions, which would impact on these changes.

New Covent Garden Market The first parcel of land at Nine Elms, London, was released to VSM NCGM Limited during the year ended 30 November 2017 and was subsequently sold.
The remaining liability to establish a new market at Nine Elms continues to have a significant impact on the results and net assets of the joint venture.
The Group continues to regularly monitor the remaining works required to establish the market.
The Board of VSM NCGM Limited, including representatives of VINCI and St. Modwen, engages an external quantity surveyor to assess the costs of procuring the market facility.
The complicated nature of working on a site with a live market has resulted in changes to the phasing of the project during the year ended 30 November 2018, but not an increase to the overall cost of the project.
As this liability is recorded at its net present value, these phasing changes have resulted in the recognition of a finance credit in VSM NCGM Limited, with the Groups share of this credit being 4.7m.
In the year ended 30 November 2017, VSM NCGM Limited increased its liability for the estimate of this forecast cost, with the Groups share of this increase being 24.6m.
The liability of VSM NCGM Limited to establish a new market facility at Nine Elms for CGMA has been calculated by: estimating the costs of procuring the market facility at current rates: applying a current estimate of inflation for the period of the build of 2.0%: and discounting the forecast cash flows to todays value using a discount rate of 5%, considered by the Board of VSM NCGM Limited to appropriately reflect the risks and rewards of the procurement.
The table below sets out a sensitivity analysis for each of these key sources of estimation uncertainty with the resulting increase decrease in the Groups share of the carrying value of the liability at 30 November 2018: Increase in sensitivity Decrease in sensitivity m m Change in costs of procuring the market facility at current rates of 5.0% 2.2 2.2 Change in inflation of 0.5% 1.1 1.1 Change in discount rate of 0.5% 1.2 1.2 c.

Amounts recoverable on contracts represent the cumulative spend incurred on the development of land not under the control of the Group less the progress payments received in respect of such development.
Where this development is for the construction of assets on property pre-sold by the Group, the construction expenditure and progress payments profile are not materially different.
On larger infrastructure projects undertaken by the Group through a development agreement, there are often limited receipts in the early phases of development and more significant receipts as the project advances, resulting in amounts recoverable on contracts being recognised that reduce over time.

The operational cycle is such that a proportion of inventories will not be realised within 12 months.
It is not possible to determine with accuracy when specific inventory will be realised as this will be subject to a number of issues including the strength of the property market.
The value of inventories expensed during the year ended 30 November 2018 and included in development profits was 231.3m 2017: 194.2m.
As at 30 November 2018, nil 2017: 14.2m of inventory was pledged as security for the Groups loan facilities.
This security was released as part of the Groups refinancing to move to unsecured facilities in December 2017.

In the normal course of events the payments will be made in line with either the disposal of investment properties held on the Group balance sheet, or the commencement of development.
Net cash outflows on the settlement of the deferred consideration will therefore be limited.

Risk management objectives Capital risk The Group manages its capital to ensure that the entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Company consists of debt as disclosed in note 15, cash and cash equivalents and equity, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Group statement of changes in equity.
The capital structure of the Group is reviewed with reference to gearing as disclosed in note 2 which the Group intends to keep low to provide a robust financial platform for business growth.
Market risk Market risk is the potential adverse change in the Groups income or the Groups net worth arising from movements in interest rates or other market prices.
Interest rate risk is the Groups principal market risk and the Group is exposed to interest rate risk as some of its borrowings are at variable interest rates.
The Group uses a combination of variable rate borrowings and interest rate hedging to manage the risk.

Financial instruments continued The following table details the Groups sensitivity, after tax, to a reasonably possible change in interest rates of 100 basis points based on year end levels of debt: 2018 2017 m m Interest on borrowings 1.7 2.1 Effect of interest rate swaps 0.6 1.4 Effect of interest rate cap 0.2 Net impact on profit of an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates 0.9 0.7 2018 2017 m m Interest on borrowings 1.7 2.1 Effect of interest rate swaps 0.6 1.4 Net impact on profit of a decrease of 100 basis points in interest rates 1.1 0.7 Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss where counterparties are not able to meet their obligations as they fall due.
The credit risk on the Groups liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with strong credit ratings.
Bank deposits are only placed with banks in accordance with Group policy that specifies minimum credit rating and maximum exposure.
Credit risk on derivatives is closely monitored.
Trade and other receivables consist of amounts due from a large number of parties spread across geographical areas.
The Group does not have any significant concentrations of credit risk as the tenant base is large and diverse with the largest individual tenant accounting for 1.6m 2017: 8.1m of gross rental income.
The carrying amount of financial assets, as detailed above, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date.
Included within trade and other receivables is 1.4m 2017: 0.8m which is provided against as it represents estimated irrecoverable amounts.
This allowance has been determined by a review of all significant balances that are past due considering the reason for nonpayment and the creditworthiness of the counterparty.
A reconciliation of the changes in this account during the year is provided below: 2018 2017 m m At start of year 0.8 0.6 Impairment losses recognised 1.7 0.5 Amounts written off as uncollectable 0.6 0.2 Impairment losses reversed 0.5 0.1 At end of year 1.4 0.8 Trade and other receivables include 2.3m 2017: 2.3m which are past due as at 30 November 2018 for which no provision has been made because the amounts are considered recoverable.

The Group manages liquidity risk by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities and through the use of borrowing facilities, overdrafts and cash to ensure continuity of funding.
Borrowing facilities are monitored with reference to their maturity dates, with detailed plans in place for any facilities maturing within 18 months, and available undrawn facilities, details of which are disclosed in note 15.
The weighted average maturity of the Groups borrowing facilities at 30 November 2018 was 4.5 years 2017: 2.7 years.
