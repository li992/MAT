Financial statements FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 2.
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE BY SEGMENT Overview The Groups operating segments are aligned to those business units that are evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
Operating segments with similar economic characteristics are aggregated into reportable segments.
Following a reassessment of the Groups reportable segments, the Group has presented the results of the Iron Ore businesses as the Iron Ore reportable segment.
Manganese, which was previously reported with Iron Ore has been aggregated with Nickel as a single reportable segment.
Comparative information has been restated to reflect this change.
The Corporate and other segment includes unallocated corporate costs and exploration costs.
Exploration costs represent the cost of the Groups exploration activities across all segments.
The disclosures in this note include certain Alternative Performance Measures APMs.
