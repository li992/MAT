Financial statements Glossary Alternative Performance Measures Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures APMs issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority came into effect for all communications released on or after 3 July 2016 for issuers of securities on a regulated market.
In the reporting of financial information, the Directors have adopted various APMs of historical or future financial performance, position or cash flows other than those defined or specified under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
The Directors measure the performance of the Group based on the following financial measures which are not recognised under EU-adopted IFRS, and consider these to be important measures in evaluating the Groups strategic and financial performance.
The Directors believe that these APMs assist in providing additional useful information on the underlying trends, performance and position of the Group.
APMs are also used to enhance the comparability of information between reporting periods, by adjusting for non-underlying items, to aid the user in understanding the Groups performance.
Consequently, APMs are used by the Directors and management for performance analysis, planning, reporting and incentive setting purposes and have remained consistent with prior year.
All APMs relate to the current periods results and comparative periods where provided.
