Given the long-term nature of annuity business, longevity remains a significant assumption in determining policyholder liabilities.
The assumptions used reference recent population mortality data, with specific risk factors applied on a per policy basis to reflect the features of the Companys portfolio.
The recent declining mortality improvements observed in population data were considered as part of the judgement exercised in setting the 2018 mortality basis.
New mortality projection models are released regularly by the Continuous Mortality Investigation CMI.
The CMI 2016 model was used to produce the 2018 results and the CMI 2015 model was used to produce the 2017 results.
The default calibration of CMI 2016 was adopted to reflect the Companys view of future mortality improvements based on a range of possible outcomes, with an appropriate margin for prudence.
The mortality improvement assumptions used are summarised in the table below: Year ended CMI Model, with calibration to reflect future mortality improvements 31 December 2018 CMI 2016 For males: with a long-term improvement rate of 2.25% pa For females: with a long-term improvement rate of 2.00% pa 31 December 2017 CMI 2015 For males: with a long-term improvement rate of 2.25% pa For females: with a long-term improvement rate of 2.00% pa For annuities in deferment, the tables used were AM92 four years males and AF92 four years females for 2018 and 2017.

annuity options on unit-linked obligation and, in the case of policies policies except for minor classified as insurance contracts, amounts for certain policies provision for expenses and mortality linked to cash units within SAIF.
The latter component is determined by applying mortality assumptions on a basis that is appropriate for the policyholder profile.
For those contracts where the level of insurance risk is insignificant, the assets and liabilities arising under the contracts are distinguished between those that relate to the financial instrument liability and acquisition costs and deferred income that relate to the component of the contract that relates to investment management.
Acquisition costs and deferred income are recognised consistent with the level of service provision in line with the requirements of IFRS 15.
To calculate the non-unit reserves for linked business, assumptions have been set for the gross unit growth rate and the rate of inflation of maintenance expenses, as well as for the valuation interest rate.
Operation of the UK with-profits sub-funds The WPSF mainly contains with-profits business but it also contains some non-profit business unit-linked, term assurances and annuities.
The WPSFs profits, apportioned 90 per cent to its policyholders and 10 per cent to shareholders as surplus for distribution, are determined via the annual actuarial valuation.
Application of significant judgement Determining bonuses using the table described in the material features table above requires the PAC Board to apply significant judgement in many respects, including in particular the following: Determining what constitutes fair treatment of customers: Smoothing of investment returns: and Determining at what level to set bonuses to ensure that they are competitive.
co. uk Annual Report 2018 Prudential plc 263 C Balance sheet notes continued C4 Policyholder liabilities and unallocated surplus continued C4.2 Products and determining contract liabilities continued Key assumptions The overall rate of return on investments and the expectation of future investment returns are the most important influences in bonus rates, subject to the smoothing described below.
Prudential determines the assumptions to apply in respect of these factors, including the effects of reasonably likely changes in key assumptions, in the context of the overarching discretionary and smoothing framework that applies to its with-profits business.
As such, it is not possible to specifically quantify the effects of each of these assumptions, or of reasonably likely changes in these assumptions.
Prudentials approach, in applying significant judgement and discretion in relation to determining bonus rates, is consistent conceptually with the approach adopted by other firms that manage a with-profits business and is also consistent with the requirements of the Principles and Practices of Financial Management PPFM that are applied in the management of their with-profits funds.
In accordance with industry-wide regulatory requirements, the PAC Board has appointed: A chief actuary who provides the PAC Board with all actuarial advice: A with-profits actuary whose specific duty is to advise the PAC Board on the reasonableness and proportionality of the manner in which its discretion has been exercised in applying the principles and practices of financial management and the manner in which any conflicting interests have been addressed: and A with-profits committee of independent individuals, which assesses the degree of compliance with the PPFM and the manner in which conflicting rights have been addressed.
Determination of bonus rates In determining bonus rates for the UK with-profits policies, smoothing is applied to the allocation of the overall earnings of the UK with-profits fund of which the investment return is a significant element.
The degree of smoothing is illustrated numerically by comparing in the following table the relatively smoothed level of policyholder bonuses declared as part of the surplus for distribution, with the more volatile movement in investment return and other items of income and expenditure of the UK component of the UK with-profits fund for each year presented.
