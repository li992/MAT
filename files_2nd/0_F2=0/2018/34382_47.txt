Level 2: I nputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
These levels are specified in accordance with IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
Property valuations are inherently subjective as they are made on the basis of assumptions made by the valuer which may not prove to be accurate.
For these reasons, and consistent with EPRAs guidance, we have classified the valuations of our property portfolio as Level 3 as defined by IFRS 13.
The inputs to the valuations are defined as unobservable by IFRS 13 and these are analysed in a table on the following page.
There were no transfers between levels in the period.
The Groups total property portfolio was valued by external valuers on the basis of fair value, in accordance with the RICS Valuation Professional Standards 2014, ninth edition, published by The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
The information provided to the valuers, and the assumptions and valuation models used by the valuers, are reviewed by the property portfolio team, the Head of Offices, the Head of Retail and the Chief Financial Officer Chief Executive Officer post January 2018.
The valuers meet with the external auditors and also present directly to the Audit Committee at the interim and year end review of results.
Further details of the Audit Committees responsibilities in relation to valuations can be found in the Report of the Audit Committee on pages 69 to 73.
Investment properties, excluding properties held for development, are valued by adopting the investment method of valuation.
This approach involves applying capitalisation yields to current and future rental streams net of income voids arising from vacancies or rent-free periods and associated running costs.
These capitalisation yields and future rental values are based on comparable property and leasing transactions in the market using the valuers professional judgement and market observation.
Other factors taken into account in the valuations include the tenure of the property, tenancy details and ground and structural conditions.
120 British Land Annual Report and Accounts 2018 10 Property continued In the case of ongoing developments, the approach applied is the residual method of valuation, which is the investment method of valuation as described above, with a deduction for all costs necessary to complete the development, including a notional finance cost, together with afurther allowance for remaining risk.
Properties held for development are generally valued by adopting the higher of the residual method of valuation, allowing for all associated risks, or the investment method of valuation for the existing asset.
