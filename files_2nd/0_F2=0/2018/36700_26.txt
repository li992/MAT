Organisational structure and accounting policies continued Critical accounting estimates and key sources of estimation uncertainty The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reported year.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates.
The estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The key accounting estimate is in respect of the determination of the fair value of financial assets classified as fair value through profit or loss FVTPL.
The methodology used in determining fair values is disclosed above.
An attribution analysis of movements in the fair value of investments can be found on page 35 and an analysis of the trading performance and valuation and gearing analysis of the top 20 buyout investments by value can be found on pages 36 and 37.
A sensitivity analysis to equity price risk can be found in note 19.
