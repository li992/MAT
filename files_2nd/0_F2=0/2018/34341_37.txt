In our opinion, the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.
Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing UK ISAs UK and applicable law.
Our responsibilities are described below.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion.
Our audit opinion is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.
We were first appointed as auditor by the Directors on 23 March 2015.
The period of total uninterrupted engagement is for the 4 financial years ended 31 December 2018.
We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and we remain independent of the Group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities.
No non-audit services prohibited by that standard were provided.
2 Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material misstatement Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement whether or not due to fraud identified by us, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy: the allocation of resources in the audit: and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
We summarise below the key audit matters, in decreasing order of audit significance, in arriving at our audit opinion above, together with our key audit procedures to address those matters and, as required for public interest entities, our results from those procedures.
These matters were addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken in the context of, and solely for the purpose of, our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and consequently are incidental to that opinion.
We do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Litigations and contingent liabilities Refer to page 65 Audit Committee report, page 133 accounting policy and pages 192 to 211 financial disclosures.
The risk: Dispute outcome: The Group is subject to a large volume of claims including class actions, which could have a significant impact on the results if the potential exposures were to materialise.
For our 2018 audit we believe the most significant risk relates to ongoing smoking and health litigation brought against the operating Company by the province of Quebec, Canada, which is disclosed in note 28 contingent liabilities and financial commitments and due to be ruled on by the Quebec Court of Appeal imminently.
This assessment is consistent with our 2017 audit.
The amounts involved are significant, and the application of accounting standards to determine the amount, if any, to be provided as a liability or disclosed as a contingent liability, is inherently subjective.
This includes assumptions relating to the likelihood and or timing of cash outflows from the business and the interpretation of preliminary and pending court rulings.
The effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we determined that the potential exposure to litigation has a high degree of judgement, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a whole, and possibly many times that amount.
Our procedures included: Control design and operation: Evaluating the processes and controls over litigations operated by Management at Group, regional and local level through regular meetings with in-house legal counsel and review of Board and sub-committee meeting minutes: Enquiry of lawyers: Assessing the status of cases through inspection of written confirmations from the Groups external counsel, correspondence between the Group and their external counsel and discussions with and representations from in-house counsel BAT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2018 115
