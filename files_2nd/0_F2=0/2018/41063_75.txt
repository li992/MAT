Strategic report Governance Financial Statements Investor information 9 Share-based payments 9.1 Accounting policy Share-based payments The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees in exchange for services rendered by them.
The fair value of the share-based award is calculated at the date of grant and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity.
This is based on the Groups estimate of share options that will eventually vest.
This takes into account movement of non-market conditions, being service conditions and financial performance, if relevant.
The fair value of share options is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The charge in the period for share-based payments was 33m 2017: 20m.
9.2 Share save schemes The Share save scheme began in May 2000 and all employees including Executive Directors are eligible once the necessary service requirements have been met.
The scheme allows participants to save up to a maximum of 350 each month for a period of three years.
Options are offered at a discount to the mid-market closing price on the day prior to the offer and are exercisable for a period of six months commencing after the end of the fixed period of the contract.
The exercise of options under this scheme is subject only to service conditions.
The schemes that launched in May 2011 and subsequently are under the new scheme rules approved by the shareholders in June 2010.
The fair value of options granted, and the inputs used to determine it are as follows: Grant date 17 May 2017 16 May 2016 19 May 2015 20 May 2014 Share price at grant date 2.44 1.91 1.81 2.10 Fair value of options granted 16.5m 5.1m 4.8m 11.6m Exercise price 1.84 1.70 1.64 1.64 Dividend yield 2.08% 2.62% 5.15% 6.21% Annual risk free interest rate 0.30% 0.87% 1.06% 1.00% 1 Expected volatility 28.1% 26.8% 22.7% 18.3% 1 The volatility measured at the standard deviation of expected share price returns is based on statistical analysis on weekly share prices over the past 3.37 years prior to the date of grant.
The requirement that the employee has to save in order to purchase shares under the Share save plan is a non-vesting condition.
This feature has been incorporated into the fair value at grant date by applying a discount to the valuation obtained from the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The discount is determined by estimating the probability that the employee will stop saving based on expected future trends in the share price and employee behaviour.

The awards have no exercise price and accrue the value of dividends over the vesting period with the exception of senior employees within the schemes granted in 2016.
LTIP grants issued between 2013 and 2016 had associated performance conditions for Executive Committee members, whilst other senior employees eligible for LTIPs had to satisfy a service condition only.
The LTIP schemes granted since 2016 have service and performance conditions for all employees.
The performance conditions associated with all awards are measured through adjusted free cash flow, sales and earnings per share performance.
Awards normally vest three years after the original grant date, provided the relevant service and performance criteria have been met.
