The Companys registration number is 7133583, and its registered office is Beech Gate, Millfield Lane, Lower Kingswood, Tadworth, Surrey, KT20 6RP.
The Company has been approved by HM Revenue & Customs as an Investment Trust under Section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act, 2010 and intends to conduct its affairs so as to continue to be approved.
2 Accounting Policies The Companys Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, to the extent that they have been adopted by the European Union, the Companies Acts that apply to companies reporting under IFRS, IFRC interpretations and, as far as it is consistent with IFRS, with the Statement of Recommended Practice: Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts SORP issued by the Association of Investment Companies AIC, in November 2014, and updated in January 2017 with consequential amendments.
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are summarised below.
a Basis of accounting The Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, except for the measurement at fair value of investments and derivative assets and liabilities.
b Adoption of new and revised Financial Reporting Standards The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year.
At the date of authorisation of these Financial Statements, the following IFRS were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 9: Financial instruments The standard is not expected to have any impact on the Company as most assets are held at fair value through profit or loss.
IFRS 15: Revenue from contracts with customers Given the nature of the Companys revenue streams from financial instruments, the provisions of this standard are not expected to have any impact.
IFRS 16: Leases This standard is not applicable to the Company as it has no leases.
c Segmental reporting The Company is engaged in a single segment business and, therefore, no segmental reporting is provided.
d Presentation of the Income Statement In order to reflect better the activities of an investment company and in accordance with guidance issued by the AIC, supplementary information which analyses the Income Statement between items of a revenue and capital nature has been prepared alongside the Income Statement.
The net revenue profit after taxation is the measure the Directors believe appropriate in assessing the Companys compliance with certain requirements set out in Section 1159 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010. e Significant accounting estimates and judgements The Directors make judgements and estimates concerning the future.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, such as expectations of future events, and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The judgements required in order to determine the appropriate valuation methodology of unlisted investments have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities.
These judgements include making assessments of the possible valuations in the event of a listing and other marketability related risks.
f Income Income from equity investments and derivative instruments is credited to the revenue column of the Income Statement on the date on which the right to receive the payment is established, normally the ex-dividend date.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised as a gain in the capital column of the Income Statement.
Special dividends are treated as a revenue receipt or a capital receipt depending on the facts and circumstances of each particular case.
Interest income is accounted for on an accruals basis.
g Functional currency and foreign exchange The Directors, having regard to the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its investors operate, have determined the functional currency to be UK sterling.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are calculated in UK sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities and those carried at fair value and denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the Balance Sheet date.
All capital gains and losses, including exchange differences on the translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities, are dealt with in capital reserve.
INFORMATION FOR SHAREHOLDERS FINANCIAL GOVERNANCE STRATEGY 48 | Fidelity China Special Situations PLC Annual Report 2018 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2 Accounting Policies continued h Investment management and performance fees and other expenses These are accounted for on an accruals basis and are charged as follows: With effect from 1 April 2017, the investment management fee is allocated 25% to revenue and 75% to capital.
Prior to 1 April 2017, the investment management fee was allocated equally between revenue and capital: Any performance fee, if due, is allocated entirely to capital, as the Board believe it reflects the capital performance of the Companys investments: and All other expenses are allocated in full to revenue with the exception of those directly attributable to share issues or other capital events.
i Finance costs Finance costs comprise interest and fees on bank loans and overdrafts and interest paid on CFDs, which are accounted for on an accruals basis, and dividends paid on short CFDs, which are accounted for on the date on which the obligation to incur the cost is established, normally the ex-dividend date.
With effect from 1 April 2017, finance costs are allocated 25% to revenue and 75% to capital.
Prior to 1 April 2017, finance costs were allocated equally between revenue and capital.
j Taxation The taxation expense represents the sum of current taxation and deferred taxation.
Taxation currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit before taxation, as reported in the Income Statement, because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Companys liability for current taxation is calculated using taxation rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred taxation is the taxation expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the Financial Statements and the corresponding taxation bases used in the computation of taxable profit based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted when the taxation is expected to be payable or recoverable, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred taxation liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred taxation assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Taxation is charged or credited to the revenue column of the Income Statement, except where it relates to items of a capital nature, in which case it is charged or credited to the capital column of the Income Statement.
Where expenses are allocated between revenue and capital any tax relief in respect of the expenses is allocated between revenue and capital returns on the marginal basis using the Companys effective rate of corporation tax for the accounting period.
The Company is an approved Investment Trust under Section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 and is not liable for UK taxation on capital gains.
k Dividends paid to shareholders Dividends payable to equity shareholders are recognised when the Companys obligation to make payment is established.
l Investments The portfolio of investments is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy, and information about the portfolio is provided on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors.
Investments are designated by the Company as held at fair value through profit or loss, which is initially taken to be their cost, and is subsequently measured as bid or last traded prices, depending upon the convention of the exchange on which they are listed, where available, or otherwise at fair value based on published price quotations.
Investments which are not quoted, or are not frequently traded, are stated at the Directors best estimate of fair value.
The Managers Fair Value Committee, which is independent of the Portfolio Managers team, provides a recommendation of fair values to the Directors based on recognised valuation techniques that take account of the cost of the investment, recent arms length transactions in the same or similar investments and financial performance of the investment since acquisition.
In accordance with the AIC SORP, the Company includes transaction costs, incidental to the purchase or sale of investments within gains on investments held at fair value through profit or loss in the capital column of the Income Statement and has disclosed them in Note 10 below.

Derivative transactions into which the Company may enter include CFDs, futures, options, warrants and forward currency contracts.
Derivatives are classified as fair value through profit or loss held for trading, and are initially accounted and measured at fair value on the date the derivative contract is entered into and subsequently measured at fair value as follows: CFDs the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying shares in the contract, calculated in accordance with accounting policy 2 l on the previous page: Futures the difference between contract price and the quoted trade price: and Options the quoted trade price for the contract.
Where such transactions are made to protect or enhance income, if the circumstances support this, then the income derived is included in derivative income in the revenue column of the Income Statement.

The Company obtains equivalent exposure to equities through the use of CFDs.

p Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents may comprise cash and short-term money market funds which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
q Bank loans Loans are initially included in the financial statements at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received net of any issue costs relating to the borrowing.

61 | Annual Report 2018 Fidelity China Special Situations PLC 18 Financial Instruments continued Counterparty risk Certain of the derivative instruments in which the Company may invest are not traded on an exchange but instead will be traded between counterparties based on contractual relationships, under the terms outlined in the International Swaps Dealers Associations ISDA market standard derivative legal documentation.
These are known as Over The Counter OTC trades.
As a result the Company is subject to the risk that a counterparty may not perform its obligations under the related contract.
In accordance with the risk management process which the Investment Managers employ, they will seek to minimise such risk by: only entering into transactions with counterparties which they believe to have an adequate credit rating at the time the transaction is entered into, by ensuring that formal legal agreements covering the terms of the contract are entered into in advance, and through adopting a counterparty risk framework which measures, monitors and manages counterparty risk by the use of internal and external credit agency ratings and evaluates derivative instrument credit risk exposure.
Collateral For OTC and exchange traded derivative transactions, collateral is used to reduce the risk of both parties to the contract.
Collateral is managed on a daily basis for all relevant transactions.

This collateral comprised: Deutsche Bank AG 13,300,000 in cash, HSBC Bankplc 8,986,000 in cash and UBS AG 7,961,000 in cash.
Offsetting To further mitigate counterparty risk for OTC derivative transactions, the ISDA legal documentation is in the form of a master agreement between the Investment Trusts managed by Fidelity and the broker.
This allows enforceable netting arrangements in the event of a default or termination event.
Derivative instrument assets and liabilities that are subject to netting arrangements have not been offset in preparing the Balance Sheet.

63 | Annual Report 2018 Fidelity China Special Situations PLC 18 Financial Instruments continued Derivative instruments risk A Derivative Instrument Charter, including an appendix entitled Derivative Risk Measurement and Management, details the risks and risk management processes used by the Investment Managers.
This Charter was approved by the Board and allows the use of derivative instruments for the following purposes: to gain exposure to equity markets, sectors or individual investments: to hedge equity market risk in the Companys investments with the intention of mitigating losses in the event of market falls: to enhance portfolio returns by writing call and put options: and to take short positions in equity markets, which would benefit from a fall in the relevant market price, where the Investment Managers believe the investment is overvalued.
These positions distinguish themselves from other short exposures held for hedging purposes since they are expected to add risk to the portfolio.
The risk and investment performance of these instruments are managed by an experienced, specialist derivative team of the Investment Managers using portfolio risk assessment tools for portfolio construction.
