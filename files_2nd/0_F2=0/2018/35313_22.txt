GENERAL INFORMATION Diploma PLC is a public limited company registered and domiciled in England and Wales and listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The address of the registered office is 12 Charterhouse Square, London EC1M 6AX.
The consolidated financial statements comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and were authorised by the Directors for publication on 19 November 2018.
These statements are presented in UK sterling, with all values rounded to the nearest 100,000, except where otherwise indicated.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs, as adopted by the European Union EU and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, as applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements of the Parent Company, Diploma PLC, have been prepared in accordance with FRS101 Reduced Disclosure Framework and are set out in a separate section of the Annual Report & Accounts on pages 94 and 95.
ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES The Group uses a number of alternative non-Generally Accepted Accounting Practice non-GAAP financial measures which are not defined within IFRS.
The Directors use these measures for internal management reporting in order to assess the operational performance of the Group on a comparable basis, and as such these measures should be considered alongside the IFRS measures.
The following non-GAAP measures are referred to in this Annual Report & Accounts: 2.1 Adjusted operating profit At the foot of the Consolidated Income Statement, adjusted operating profit is defined as operating profit before amortisation and impairment of acquisition intangible assets, acquisition expenses, adjustments to deferred consideration collectively, acquisition related charges, the costs of a material restructuring including the incremental cost related directly to the change of the Chief Executive Officer in 2018 or rationalisation of operations and the profit or loss relating to the sale of businesses or property.
The Directors believe that adjusted operating profit is an important measure of the operational performance of the Group.
2.2 Adjusted profit before tax At the foot of the Consolidated Income Statement, adjusted profit before tax is separately disclosed, being defined as adjusted operating profit, after finance expenses but before fair value remeasurements under IAS39 in respect of future purchases of minority interests and before tax.
The Directors believe that adjusted profit before tax is an important measure of the operational performance of the Group.
2.3 Adjusted earnings per share Adjusted earnings per share adjusted EPS is calculated as the total of adjusted profit before tax, less income tax costs, but including the tax impact on the items included in the calculation of adjusted profit, less profit attributable to minority interests, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
The Directors believe that adjusted EPS provides an important measure of the earning capacity of the Group.
2.4 Free cash flow At the foot of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, free cash flow is reported, being defined as net cash flow from operating activities, after net capital expenditure on fixed assets and including proceeds received from business disposals, but before expenditure on business combinations investments and dividends paid to both minority shareholders and the Companys shareholders.
The Directors believe that free cash flow gives an important measure of the cash flow of the Group, available for future investment or distribution to shareholders.
2.5 Trading capital employed and ROATCE In the Sector analysis in note 3, trading capital employed is reported, being defined as net assets less cash and cash equivalents and after adding back: borrowings: retirement benefit obligations: deferred tax: and acquisition liabilities in respect of future purchases of minority interests and deferred consideration.
Adjusted trading capital employed is reported as being trading capital employed plus goodwill and acquisition related charges previously written off net of deferred tax on acquisition intangible assets.
Return on adjusted trading capital employed ROATCE at the Group and Sector level is defined as the adjusted operating profit, divided by adjusted trading capital employed and adjusted for the full year effect of major acquisitions and disposals.
The Directors believe that ROATCE is an important measure of the profitability of the Group.
3. BUSINESS SECTOR ANALYSIS The Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM for the purposes of IFRS8 is the Chief Executive Officer or interim Executive Chairman.

A further 0.5m of current tax 2017: 0.3m was credited to the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity which relates to share-based payments made during the year.
Factors affecting the tax charge for the year The difference between the total tax charge calculated by applying the effective rate of UK corporation tax of 19.0% to the profit before tax of 72.7m and the amount set out above is as follows: 2018 2017 m m Profit before tax 72.7 66.8 Tax on profit at UK effective corporation tax rate of 19.0% 2017: 19.5% 13.8 13.0 Effects of: higher tax rates on overseas earnings 4.0 5.3 adjustments to current tax charge in respect of previous years 0.1 0.3 other permanent differences 0.6 0.6 Total tax on profit for the year 18.3 18.6 The Group earns its profits in the UK and overseas.
The UK corporation tax rate was reduced from 20.0% to 19.0% on 1 April 2017.
Asthe Group prepares its consolidated financial statements for the year to 30 September, the effective tax rate for UK corporation taxinrespect of the year ended 30 September 2018 was 19.0% 2017: 19.5% and this rate has been used for tax on profit in the abovereconciliation.
The reduction in the effective rate of taxation reflects the impact from the reduction in the US Federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35%, effective from 1 January 2018.
There was no material impact from the revaluation of US deferred tax balances at the reduced tax rate.
The Groups US businesses account for ca.
26% of Group revenues and adjusted operating profit before tax.
The Groups net overseas tax rate is higher than that in the UK, primarily because profits earned in the US, Canada and Australia are taxed at higher rates than the UK.

TAX EXPENSE CONTINUED The UK deferred tax assets and liabilities at 30 September 2018 have been calculated based on the future UK corporation tax rate of 17.0%, as substantively enacted at 30 September 2018.
At 30 September 2018, the Group had outstanding tax liabilities of 4.8m 2017: 4.0m of which 2.1m related to UK tax liabilities and 2.7m related to overseas tax liabilities.
These amounts are expected to be paid within the next financial year.

For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each ofthe Groups three operating Sectors.
This reflects the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored by management and reflects the Groups strategy of acquiring businesses to drive synergies across a Sector, rather than within an individual business.
The impairment test requires a value in use valuation to be prepared for each Sector using discounted cash flow forecasts.
The cash flow forecasts are based on a combination of annual budgets prepared by each business and the Groups strategic plan.
Beyond five years, cash flow projections utilise a perpetuity growth rate of 2%.
The key assumptions used to prepare the cash flow forecasts relate to gross margins, revenue growth rates and the discount rate.
Thegross margins are assumed to remain sustainable, which is supported by historical experience: revenue growth rates generally approximate to the average rates for the markets in which the business operates, unless there are particular factors relevant to a business, such as start-ups.
The annual revenue growth rates used in the cash flow forecasts for the next five years represent the budgeted rates for 2018 and thereafter, average growth rates for each Sector: these annual growth rates then reduce to 2% over thelonger term.
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 75 DIPLOMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2018 10.
GOODWILL CONTINUED The cash flow forecasts are discounted to determine a current valuation using a single market derived pre-tax discount rate of ca.
This single rate is based on the characteristics of lower risk, non-technically driven, distribution businesses operating generally in well developed markets and geographies and with robust capital structures.
As these features are consistent between each of the Groups Sectors, the Board considers that it is more appropriate to use a single discount rate applied to each Sectors cash flow forecasts.
Based on the criteria set out above, no impairment in the value of goodwill in any of the Sectors was identified.
The Directors have also carried out sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions noted above to determine whether a reasonably possible adverse change in any of these assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill.
The analysis indicates that a reasonably possible adverse change would not give rise to an impairment charge to goodwill in any of the three Sectors.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 79 DIPLOMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2018 19.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Groups overall management of the financial risks is carried out by a central treasury team under policies and procedures which arereviewed and approved by the Board.
The treasury team identifies, evaluates and where appropriate, hedges financial risks in close cooperation with the Groups operating businesses.
The treasury team does not undertake speculative foreign exchange dealings for which there is no underlying exposure.
The Groups principal financial instruments, other than a number of forward foreign currency contracts, comprise cash and short term deposits, investments, trade and other receivables and trade and other payables, borrowings and other liabilities.
Trade and other receivables and trade and other payables arise directly from the Groups day-to-day operations.
The financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those of credit, liquidity, foreign currency, interest rate and capital management.
An explanation of each of these risks, how the Group manages these risks and an analysis of sensitivities is set out below and on page33 within Internal Control and Risk Management, all of which have been audited.
a Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations: this arises principally from the Groups trade and other receivables from customers and from cash balances including deposits held with financial institutions.
The Group is exposed to customers ranging from government backed agencies and large public and private wholesalers, to small privately owned businesses and the underlying local economic risks vary throughout the world.
Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise and credit limits are set as deemed appropriate for each customer.
The Group establishes a provision for impairment that represents its estimate of potential losses in respect of specific trade and other receivables where it is deemed that a receivable may not be recoverable.
When the receivable is deemed irrecoverable, the provision is written off against the underlying receivable.
During the year, the Group had no significant unrecoverable trade receivables: there have been no other significant trade receivables written off in the past five years other than 0.2m written off in 2015.
Exposure to counterparty credit risk with financial institutions is controlled by the Group treasury team which establishes and monitors counterparty limits.
Centrally managed funds are invested entirely with counterparties whose credit rating is AA or better.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk was as follows: Carrying amount 2018 2017 m m Trade receivables 70.8 63.4 Other receivables 3.5 2.3 Cash and cash equivalents 36.0 22.3 110.3 88.0 There is no material difference between the book value of the financial assets and their fair value at each reporting date.
An analysis of the ageing and currency of trade receivables and the associated provision for impairment is set out in note 16.
An analysis of cash and cash equivalents is set out in note 18. b Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group continually monitors net cash and forecasts cash flows to ensure that sufficient resources are available to meet the Groups requirements in the short, medium and long term.
Additionally, compliance with debt covenants are monitored regularly and during 2018 all covenants were complied with fully.
The Group is highly cash generative and uses monthly cash flow forecasts to monitor cash requirements and to optimise its return on shorter term deposits.
Typically the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on hand to meet foreseeable operational expenses, but the Group also maintains a committed revolving bank facility.
This facility, which expires on 1 June 2020, is a committed three year multi-currency revolving facility for 30.0m with an accordion option to increase the committed facility by a further 30.0m up to a maximum of 60.0m and to extend the term up to five years.
Interest on this facility is payable at between 70 and 115bps over LIBOR, depending on the ratio of net debt to EBITDA.
None of the facility had been drawn down at 30 September 2018 2017: Nil.
The undrawn committed facilities available at 30 September are as follows: 2018 2017 m m Expiring within one year Expiring after two years 30.0 30.0 80 DIPLOMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2018 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2018 19.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED The Groups financial liabilities are as follows: Carrying amount 2018 2017 m m Trade payables 48.3 42.5 Other payables 3.6 3.3 Other liabilities note 20 5.6 6.6 57.5 52.4 The maturities of the undiscounted financial liabilities are as follows: Less than one year 57.5 48.3 One to two years 4.5 Two to five years 57.5 52.8 Less: discount 0.4 57.5 52.4 There is no material difference between the book value of these financial liabilities and their fair value at each reporting date.
c Currency risk The Groups principal currency risk comprises translational and transactional risk from its exposure to movements in US dollars, Canadian dollars and Euros.
The transactional exposure arises on trade receivables, trade payables and cash and cash equivalents and these balances are analysed by currency in notes 16, 17 and 18, respectively.
Net foreign exchange gains of 0.1m 2017: 0.5m were recognised in operating profit for the year.
The Group holds forward foreign exchange contracts in certain of the Groups businesses to hedge forecast transactional exposure to movements primarily in the US dollar and Euro.
These forward foreign exchange contracts are classified as cash flow hedges and are stated at fair value.
The notional value of forward contracts as at 30 September 2018 was 39.7m 2017: 33.0m.
The net fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts used as hedges at 30 September 2018 was a 0.7m asset 2017: 0.9m liability.
The amount removed from Other Comprehensive Income and taken to the Consolidated Income Statement in cost of sales during the year was a 0.9m credit 2017: 0.2m debit.
The change in the fair value of cash flow hedges taken to Other Comprehensive Income during the year was a 0.7m credit 2017: 1.0m debit.
Management considers that the most significant foreign exchange risk relates to the US dollar, Canadian dollar and Euro.
The Groups sensitivity to a 10% strengthening in UK sterling against each of these currencies with all other variables held constant is as follows: 2018 m Decrease in adjusted operating profit at average rates US dollar: UK sterling 2.4 Canadian dollar: UK sterling 1.7 Euro: UK sterling 1.0 Decrease in total equity at spot rates US dollar: UK sterling 2.2 Canadian dollar: UK sterling 5.4 Euro: UK sterling 2.3 d Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will affect the Groups results.
The Groups interest rate risk arises primarily from its cash funds and borrowings.
The Group does not undertake any hedging of interest rates.
All cash deposits, held in the UK and overseas, are held on a short term basis at floating rates or overnight rates, based on the relevant UK base rate, or equivalent rate.
Surplus funds are deposited with commercial banks that meet the credit criteria approved by the Board, for periods of between one and six months at rates that are generally fixed by reference to the relevant UK base rate, or equivalent rate.
An increase of 1% in interest rates would not have a significant impact on the Groups profit before tax.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED e Fair values There are no material differences between the book value of financial assets and liabilities and their fair value.
The basis for determining fair values are as follows: Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are designated as level 1 assets in the fair value hierarchy and valued at year end forward rates, adjusted for the forward points to the contracts value date with gains and losses taken to equity.
No contracts maturity date is greater than 18 months from the year end.
Trade and other receivables payables As the majority of receivables payables have a remaining life of less than one year, the book value is deemed to reflect the fair value.
Other liabilities The carrying amount represents a discounted value of the expected liability which is deemed to reflect the fair value.
f Capital management risk The Groups capital structure comprises cash funds and medium term bank borrowing facilities.
The Groups objective when managing capital is to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern and to maintain robust capital ratios to support the development of the business and provide strong returns to shareholders.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may change the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or increase bank borrowings.

RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS The Group maintains two pension arrangements which are accounted for under IAS19 Revised Employee Benefits.
The principal arrangement is the defined benefit pension scheme in the UK, maintained by Diploma Holdings PLC and called the Diploma Holdings PLC UK Pension Scheme the Scheme.
This Scheme provides benefits based on final salary and length of service on retirement, leaving service or death and has been closed to further accrual since 5 April 2000.
The second and smaller pension arrangement is operated by Kubo in Switzerland and provides benefits on retirement, leaving service or death for the employees of Kubo in accordance with Swiss law.
Kubo was acquired by the Group on 13 March 2015.
The Kubo pension scheme is a defined contribution based scheme, which for technical reasons, is required under IFRS to be accounted for in accordance with IAS19 revised.
The amount of pension deficit included in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position in respect of these two pension arrangements is: 2018 2017 m m Diploma Holdings PLC UK Pension Scheme 6.8 5.4 Kubo Pension Scheme 3.7 4.5 Pension scheme net deficit 10.5 9.9 84 DIPLOMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2018 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2018 25.

Diploma Holdings PLC UK Pension Scheme The Scheme is subject to a Statutory Funding Objective under the Pensions Act 2004 which requires that a valuation of the Scheme is carried out at least once every three years to determine whether the Statutory Funding Objective is met.
As part of the process the Company must agree with the Trustees of the Scheme the contributions to be paid to address any shortfall against the Statutory Funding Objective.
The most recent triennial actuarial valuation carried out as at 30 September 2016 reported that the Scheme had a funding deficit of 9.2m and held assets which covered 75% of its liabilities at that date.
The next triennial actuarial valuation of the Scheme will be carried out as at 30 September 2019.
There were no Scheme amendments, curtailments or settlements during the year.
On 28 September 2018 the Trustees completed a Buy-In of the pensioner liabilities in the Scheme with Just Retirement Limited.
The Scheme paid 12.3m to Just Retirement Limited on 28 September 2018 to fund 95% of the Buy-In premium and 0.7m was paid on 22 October 2018 to fund the remaining 5% of the premium.
The impact of this transaction has been reflected in the pension disclosures set out below.
The Scheme is managed by a set of Trustees appointed in part by the Company and in part from elections by members of the Scheme.
The Trustees have responsibility for obtaining valuations of the fund, administering benefit payments and investing the Schemes assets.
The Trustees delegate some of these functions to their professional advisors where appropriate.
The Scheme exposes the Company and therefore the Group, to a number of risks: Investment risk.
The Scheme holds investments in asset classes, such as equities, which have volatile market values and while these assets are expected to provide real returns over the long term, volatility over the short term can cause additional funding to be required if a deficit emerges.
The Schemes liabilities are assessed using market yields on high quality corporate bonds to discount the liabilities.
As the Schemes assets include equities, the value of the assets and liabilities may not move in the same way.
A significant proportion of the benefits under the Scheme are linked to inflation.
The Schemes assets are expected to provide a good hedge against inflation over the long term, however movements over the short term could lead to funding deficits emerging.
In the event that members live longer than assumed, a larger funding deficit may emerge in the Scheme.

The current strategy is designed to broadly match assets and liabilities in respect of pensioner members, but to invest in growth assets in respect of deferred pensioners.
Annuity policies have been taken out in respect of some historic pensioners, but the Scheme has not purchased annuities for retirements since 2005.
Effect of the Scheme on the Groups future cash flows The Company is required to agree a schedule of contributions with the Trustees of the Scheme following each triennial actuarial valuation.
Following the triennial actuarial valuation carried out as at 30 September 2016, the Company agreed to contribute 0.5m in cash to the scheme annually.
The next valuation of the Scheme will be carried out as at 30 September 2019.
