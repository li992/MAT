Primarily as a result of our decision during 2017to strategically realign our business in Australia, which included reducing capacity in P&OCruises Australia, weperformed discounted future cash flow analyses oncertain ships as of July 31,2017.
Based onthese discounted future cash flow analyses, wedetermined that some of these ships had net carrying values that exceeded their estimated discounted future cash flows.
We estimated the July 31,2017fair values of these ships based ontheir discounted cash flows and comparable market transactions.
We then compared these estimated fair values to the net carrying values and, as a result, werecognized $137million and $115million of ship impairment charges in the NAAand EAsegments, respectively, for the year end November 30,2017.
Theimpairment is included in other ship operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
We had noimpairment charges in 2018.
Theprincipal assumptions used in our analyses consisted of forecasted future operating results, including net revenue yields and net cruise costs including fuel prices, estimated ship sale proceeds, and changes in strategy, including decisions about the transfer of ships between brands.
We used relevant historical experience as well as economic and external industry data in determining an estimate of future cash flows.
All principal assumptions are considered Level 3inputs.
AtNovember 30,2018, the cost of assets under construction, which are included in the above table, totaled $1.1billion $658 million at November 30,2017.
AtNovember 30,2018, the net bookvalue of assets is shownafter deducting government construction grants of $91million $102 million at November 30,2017.
