Johnson Matthey Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Accounts Notes on the accounts for the year ended 31st March 2018 30 Other financial assets and liabilities continued Fair values are measured using a hierarchy where the inputs are: Level 1 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 not level 1 but are observable for that asset or liability either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 not based on observable market data unobservable.
Of the other financial assets listed above, all are measured at fair value using level 2 inputs.
All other financial liabilities are measured at fair value using level 2 inputs.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts, forward precious metal price contracts and currency swaps is estimated using appropriate market sourced data at the balance sheet date.
31 Financial risk management The groups and parent companys activities expose them to a variety of financial risks including credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk.
Market risk includes foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and price risk.
The main financial risks managed by the group and parent company, under policies approved by the board, are credit risk, foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The group and parent company use derivative financial instruments, in particular forward currency contracts and currency swaps, to manage their financial risks associated with their underlying business activities and the financing of those activities.
Some derivative financial instruments used to manage financial risk are not designated as hedges and, therefore, are classified as held for trading.
The group and parent company do not undertake any speculative trading activity in financial instruments.
31a Credit risk Within certain businesses, the group and parent company derive a significant proportion of their revenue from sales to major customers.
Sales to individual customers are frequently high if the value of precious metals is included in the price.
The failure of any such company to honour its debts could materially impact the groups and parent companys results.
The group and parent company derive significant benefit from trading with their large customers and manage the risk at many levels.
Each sector has a credit committee that regularly monitors its exposure.
The Audit Committee receives a report every six months that details all significant credit limits, amounts due and amounts overdue within the group and the relevant actions being taken.
At 31st March 2018, trade receivables for the group amounted to 1,049 million 2017: 951 million parent company 165 million 2017: 164 million.
799 million 2017: 691 million of these receivables at group level 115 million 2017: 101 million at parent company level arose in Clean Air which mainly supplies the automotive industry including car and truck manufacturers and component suppliers.
Although Clean Air has a wide spread of available customers, the concentrated nature of this industry means that amounts owed by individual customers can be large.
Other parts of the group tend to sell to a larger number of customers and amounts owed tend to be lower.
At 31st March 2018, for the group as a whole, no single outstanding balance exceeded 2% 2017: 2% of revenue.
No assets have been taken possession of as collateral.
The credit profiles of the groups and parent companys customers are obtained from credit rating agencies where possible and are closely monitored.
The scope of these reviews includes amounts overdue and credit limits.
Generally, payments in the automotive industry and in the other markets in which the group operates, are made promptly.
Trade receivables are considered impaired when the amount is in dispute, customers are in financial difficulty or for other reasons which imply there is doubt over the recoverability of the debt.
Trade receivables can be analysed as: Group Parent company 2018 2017 2018 2017 million million million million Amounts neither past due nor impaired 966 885 152 149 Amounts past due but not impaired less than 30 days 62 50 7 11 30 90 days 19 9 6 2 more than 90 days 2 6 2 Total past due but not impaired 83 65 13 15 Amounts impaired 9 7 3 1 Specic allowances for bad and doubtful debts 9 6 3 1 Carrying amount of impaired receivables 1 Trade receivables net of allowances 1,049 951 165 164 176 Notes on the accounts for the year ended 31st March 2018 31 Financial risk management continued 31a Credit risk continued Movements in the allowances for impairments were: Group Parent company 2018 2017 2018 2017 million million million million At beginning of year 6 7 1 1 Charge for year 5 2 2 Released 2 2 Utilised 2 Exchange adjustments 1 At end of year 9 6 3 1 The groups financial assets included in sundry receivables are all current and not impaired.
Of the parent companys amounts receivable from subsidiaries 128 million is impaired 2017: 128 million.
The credit risk on cash and deposits and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties with significant balances are banks with strong credit ratings.
The exposure to individual banks is monitored frequently against internally-defined limits, together with the banks credit ratings and credit default swap prices.
As at 31st March 2018, the maximum net exposure with a single bank for cash and deposits was 67 million 2017: 49 million for the group and 12 million 2017: 22 million for the parent company, whilst the largest mark to market exposure for derivative financial instruments to a single bank was 3 million 2017: 10 million for the group and parent company.
The group and parent company also use money market funds to invest surplus cash thereby further diversifying credit risk and, at 31st March 2018, the groups and parent companys exposure to these funds was 171 million 2017: 211 million.
The amounts on deposit at the year end represent the groups and parent companys maximum exposure to credit risk on cash and deposits.
The parent company also guarantees some of its subsidiaries borrowings, partly through interest netting arrangements, payables and precious metal leases, and its exposure at 31st March 2018 was 32 million 2017: 28 million.
31b Foreign currency risk The group operates globally with a significant amount of its profit earned outside the UK.
In order to protect the groups sterling balance sheet and reduce cash flow risk, the group has financed most of its investment in the US and Europe by borrowing US dollars and euros, respectively.
Although much of this funding is obtained by directly borrowing the relevant currency, a part is achieved through currency swaps which can be more efficient and reduce costs.
To a lesser extent, the group has also financed a portion of its investment in China using a currency swap.
The group has designated the currency swaps, a US dollar loan and euro loans fair value of the loans was 167 million 2017: a US dollar loan and a euro loan with a fair value of 67 million as hedges of net investments in foreign operations as they hedge the changes in values of the subsidiaries' net assets against movements in exchange rates.
The change in the value of the net investment hedges from movements in foreign currency exchange rates is recognised in equity and is offset by an equal and opposite movement in the carrying value of the net assets of the subsidiaries.
The main currencies of the net debt after taking into account the effect of the currency swaps were: Group Group Parent company Parent company Borrowings Borrowings Cash Cash Borrowings Borrowings Cash Cash 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 million million million million million million million million Sterling 976 911 596 678 977 898 588 689 US dollar 608 658 547 500 608 662 537 486 Euro 473 526 273 239 476 526 260 234 Chinese renminbi 68 68 30 43 45 68 2 2 Hong Kong dollar 53 23 132 94 53 23 132 94 Swedish krona 53 66 53 66 Other currencies 154 124 128 106 125 99 76 73 2,385 2,376 1,706 1,660 2,337 2,342 1,595 1,578 177 Other Information Accounts Governance Strategic Report Johnson Matthey Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Accounts Notes on the accounts for the year ended 31st March 2018 31 Financial risk management continued 31b Foreign currency risk continued The groups objective is to match foreign currency assets and liabilities at an entity level in order to avoid any impact on the income statement of the entity resulting from movements in exchange rates.
The group and parent company use forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign exchange exposures arising on forecast receipts and payments in foreign currencies.
These are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges.
The majority of the cash flows are expected to occur in the year ending 31st March 2019.
The main impact of movements in exchange rates on the groups results arises on translation of overseas subsidiaries profits into sterling.
The groups largest exposure is to the US dollar and a 5% 6.6 cent 2017: 6.5 cent movement in the average exchange rate for the US dollar against sterling would have had an 11 million 2017: 10 million impact on underlying operating profit.
The group is also exposed to the euro and a 5% 5.7 cent 2017: 6.0 cent movement in the average exchange rate for the euro against sterling would have had a 10 million 2017: 10 million impact on underlying operating profit.
This exposure is part of the groups economic risk of operating globally which is essential to remain competitive in the markets in which it operates.
31c Interest rate risk The groups and parent companys interest rate risk arises from their fixed rate borrowings fair value risk and floating rate borrowings cash flow risk.
Their policy is to optimise interest cost and reduce volatility in reported earnings and equity.
They manage their risk by reviewing the profile of their debt regularly and by selectively using interest rate and cross currency swaps to maintain borrowings in appropriate currencies and at competitive rates.
The group and parent company have designated one 2017: one US dollar fixed rate to US dollar floating rate swap as a fair value hedge as it hedges the changes in the fair value of bonds attributable to changes in interest rates.
The losses on the interest rate swaps in the year ended 31st March 2018 were 3 million 2017: 8 million and the gains on the bonds attributable to the hedged risk were 3 million 2017: 6 million.
The group and parent company have designated the US dollar fixed interest rate to sterling fixed interest rate cross currency swap as a cash flow hedge as it hedges the movement in the cash flows of the hedged bond attributable to changes in the US dollar sterling exchange rate.
Its cash flows are expected to occur in 2025 when the bond which it hedges matures and, therefore, the exchange effect on it is expected to be realised in the income statement in 2025.
The interest element is realised in the income statement each year.
At 31st March 2018, 99% 2017: 99% of the groups net debt and 90% 2017: 92% of the parent companys net debt were at fixed rates with an average interest rate of 3.1% 2017: 3.1%.
The remaining debt is funded on a floating rate basis.
Based on the groups net debt funded at floating rates, after taking into account the effect of the swaps, a 1% change in all interest rates would have an immaterial impact on the groups profit before tax.
31d Fair value of financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments is approximately equal to book value except for: 2018 2017 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair amount value amount value Group million million million million US Dollar Bonds 2022, 2023, 2025 and 2028 448 420 507 503 Euro Bonds 2021 and 2023 104 118 103 120 Euro EIB loan 2019 109 113 107 112 Sterling Bonds 2024 65 71 65 74 KfW US dollar loan 2024 36 35 40 42 2018 2017 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair amount value amount value Parent company million million million million Amounts receivable from subsidiaries 2,162 2,232 2,028 2,145 Amounts payable to subsidiaries 2,687 2,701 2,801 2,829 US Dollar Bonds 2022, 2023, 2025 and 2028 448 420 507 503 Euro Bonds 2021 and 2023 104 118 103 120 Euro EIB loan 2019 109 113 107 112 Sterling Bonds 2024 65 71 65 74 KfW US dollar loan 2024 36 35 40 42 The fair values are calculated using level 2 inputs note 30 by discounting future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market interest rates prevailing at the year end.
There were no transfers of any financial instrument between the levels of the fair value hierarchy note 30 during the year.
178 Notes on the accounts for the year ended 31st March 2018 31 Financial risk management continued 31e Liquidity risk The groups and parent companys policy on funding capacity is to ensure that they always have sufficient long term funding and committed bank facilities in place to meet foreseeable peak borrowing requirements.
At 31st March 2018, the group and parent company had borrowings under committed bank facilities of nil 2017: nil.
The group and parent company also have a number of uncommitted facilities, including metal leases, and overdraft lines at their disposal.
