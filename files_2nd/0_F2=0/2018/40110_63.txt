There is no difference between fair value and carrying value of the above financial instruments 2017: nil.
FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
Contracts for difference are classified as Level 1 as the fair value is calculated using quoted prices for listed shares and commodities at contract inception and the period end.
Foreign forward purchase and sales contracts and options are classified as Level 2 as the fair value is calculated using models based on inputs which are observable directly or indirectly at the period end these inputs include but are not restricted to the following maturity date, quoted forward option prices.
Available-for-sale financial assets are classified as Level 1 as the fair value is calculated using quoted prices, except for House of Fraser UK & Ireland Ltd previously Highland Group Holdings which is classified as Level 3.
House of Fraser Ltd is held at managements estimate of the fair value of the enterprise based on publicly and non-publicly available data, managements assessment is that the fair value is nil 2017: nil Other equity derivatives are calculated using a model with inputs which are directly observable and inputs which are not based on observable market data this includes expected volatility from the shares historical prices.
These are therefore classified as Level 3.
There have been no transfers between fair value hierarchy levels during the year.
The fair value of equity derivative agreements are included within the derivative financial assets balance of 1.9m and derivative financial liabilities balance of 5.6m.
The derivative financial assets and derivative financial liabilities as at 29 April 2018 relate to strategic investments held of between 0.08% and 10.47% of investee share capital.

The maximum exposure to credit risk as at 29 April 2018 is the fair value of the derivative assets in the Balance Sheet.
b DERIVATIVES: FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD PURCHASE CONTRACTS The most significant exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations relates to purchases made in foreign currencies, principally the US Dollar, and online sales in Euros and Australian dollars.
The Groups policy is to reduce substantially the risk associated with foreign currency spot rates by using forward fixed rate currency purchase contracts, taking into account any foreign currency cash flows.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes, however if derivatives, including both forwards and written options, do not qualify for hedge accounting they are accounted for as such and accordingly any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The carrying values of the derivative financial instruments includes foreign currency purchase and sales contracts, written currency options and equity derivative contracts: The sterling principal amounts of hedged forward foreign currency purchase contracts and contracted forward rates were as follows: 29 April 2018 30 April 2017 m m US Dollar purchases 1,035.8 - Contracted rates USD GBP 1.3600 1.4301 - US Dollar purchases 217.0 - 1.110 1.320 - Contracted rates USD EUR 1,177.0 777.3 Euro sales Contracted rates EUR GBP 1.069 1.190 1.069 1.240 AUD sales 9.1 12.5 Contracted rates AUD GBP 1.6896 1.74 1.6896 1.79 The sterling principal amounts of unhedged forward foreign currency purchase contracts and contracted forward rates were as follows: 29 April 2018 30 April 2017 m m Euro Sales - 302.7 Contracted rates - 1.09-1.24 FY18 Value excludes SWAPS of 102.7M Euros FY17:260.9m which are required for cash management purposes only.
The sterling principal amounts of unhedged written currency option contracts and contracted rates were as follows: 29 April 2018 30 April 2017 m m US Dollar purchases 126.1 - Contracted rates USD EUR 1.110 1.210 - - Euro sales 1,452.2 1,080.0 1.069 1.190 1.069 1.09 Contracted rates EUR GBP 9.1 12.5 - AUD sales Contracted rates AUD GBP 1.6896 1.74 1.6896 1.79 At 29 April 2018 1,186.1m of forward sales contracts and 1,252.8m of purchase contracts qualified for hedge accounting and the loss on fair valuation of these contracts of 61.2m has therefore been recognised in other comprehensive income.
184 The loss on fair value of the written options and unhedged forward contracts of 15.4m has been included within finance costs.
At 29 April 2018 672.3m of hedged purchase contracts had a maturity at inception of greater than 12 months FY17: nil of purchase contracts and 821.0m of hedged sales had a maturity at inception of greater than 12 months FY17: 934.9m sales contracts.
At 29 April 2018 nil of unhedged purchase contracts had a maturity at inception of greater than 12 months 2017: nil of purchase contracts and 821.0m of unhedged sales had a maturity at inception of greater than 12 months 2017: 1,395.2m sales contracts.
c SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS The Groups principal foreign currency exposures are to US Dollars and Euros.
The table below illustrates the hypothetical sensitivity of the Groups reported profit and equity to a 10% increase and decrease in the US Dollar Sterling and Euro Sterling exchange rates at the year-end date, assuming all other variables remain unchanged.
The figures have been calculated by comparing the fair values of outstanding foreign currency contracts at the current exchange rate to those if exchange rates moved as illustrated.
The income statement figures include the profit effect of any relevant derivatives which are not in a designated cash flow hedge.
The impact on US Dollar and Euro related hedging instruments is included in equity.
Positive figures represent an increase in profit or equity: Income statement Equity 29 April 2018 30 April 2017 29 April 2018 30 April 2017 m m m m Sterling strengthens by 10% 0.2 33.5 0.3 39.0 US Dollar 0.6 4.0 0.6 0.8 Euro Sterling weakens by 10% 0.3 36.9 0.3 42.9 US Dollar 0.6 4.4 0.6 0.9 Euro INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS The following table illustrates the hypothetical sensitivity of the Groups reported profit and equity to a 0.5% increase or decrease in interest rates, assuming all other variables were unchanged.
The analysis has been prepared using the following assumptions: For floating rate assets and liabilities, the amount of asset or liability outstanding at the balance sheet date is assumed to have been outstanding for the whole year.
Fixed rate financial instruments that are carried at amortised cost are not subject to interest rate risk for the purpose of this analysis.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The capital structure of the Group consists of equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent company, comprising issued share capital, share premium, retained earnings and cash and borrowings.
It is the Groups policy to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain the development of the business.
In respect of equity, the Board has decided that, in order to maximise flexibility in the near term with regards to a number of inorganic growth opportunities under review, not to return any cash by way of a dividend at this time.
The Board is committed to keeping this policy under review and to looking to evaluate alternative methods of returning cash to shareholders when appropriate.
The objective of the Share Scheme is to encourage employee share ownership and to link employees remuneration to the performance of the Company.
It is not designed as a means of managing capital.
In respect of cash and borrowings, the Board regularly monitors the ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA, the working capital requirements and forecasted cash flows however no minimum or maximum ratios are set.
The ratio for net debt to Reported EBITDA, excluding charges for the Share Schemes, is 1.1 2017: 0.6.
The objective is to keep this figure below 3.0 FY17: 3.0.
Based on this analysis, the Board determines the appropriate return to equity holders whilst ensuring sufficient capital is retained within the Group to meet its strategic objectives, including but not limited to, acquisition opportunities.
