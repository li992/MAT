Supplementary information 10.1 Alternative performance measures We assess our performance using a variety of measures that are not defined under IFRS and are therefore termed alternative performance measures APMs.
The APMs that we use may not be directly comparable with similarly named measures used by other companies.
We have presented below reconciliations from these APMs to the most appropriate measure prepared in accordance with IFRS.
All APMs should be read together with the IFRS consolidated income statement, IFRS consolidated statement of financial position and IFRS consolidated statement of cash flows, which are presented in the Group financial statements section of this report.
Key performance indicators KPIs are defined as the measures by which the development, performance or position of the business can be measured effectively.
KPI Measure is a key input to a metric used for executive remuneration.

called short-term fluctuations in investment return and economic assumption changes in the Groups insurance entities.
It is calculated based on expected returns on investments backing equity holder funds, with consistent allowance for the corresponding expected movements in equity holder liabilities.
Impacts arising from the difference between the expected return and actual return on investments, and the corresponding impact on equity holder liabilities except where they are directly related to a significant management action, are excluded from adjusted profit and are presented within profit before tax.
The impact of certain changes in economic assumptions is also excluded from adjusted profit and is presented within profit before tax.
Coupons payable on perpetual notes classified as non-controlling interests for which interest is accrued are included in adjusted profit before tax.
For IFRS purposes, these are recognised directly in equity.
This gave rise to an adjusting item in 2017, prior to the reclassification of such instruments to subordinated liabilities on 18 December 2017.
Dividends payable on preference shares classified as non-controlling interests are excluded from adjusted profit in line with the treatment of ordinary shares.
Similarly to preference shares, our share of interest payable on Tier 1 debt instruments held by associates, which are only accounted for when paid as if interest is not paid it is cancelled, is excluded from adjusted profit.

The Reported basis results reflect this accounting treatment with Aberdeen results included from 14 August 2017 only.
Therefore, Aberdeen is included from 14 August 2017 only in the 2017 results on a Reported basis.
In our Strategic report we have also presented comparative results on a Pro forma basis to assist in explaining trends by showing performance for the combined Group as if Standard Life plc and Aberdeen had always been merged.

Restructuring includes the impact of major regulatory change.
By highlighting and excluding these costs we aim to give shareholders a fuller understanding of the performance of the business.
Restructuring and corporate transaction expenses include costs relating to the integration of businesses acquired.
Other restructuring costs excluded from adjusted profit relate to projects which have a significant impact on the way the Group operates.
Costs are only excluded from adjusted profit where they are outwith business as usual activities and the costs would not have been incurred had the restructuring project not taken place.
For headcount related costs, where duplicate posts are identified as a result of an integration plan, the duplicated cost will be treated as a restructuring cost from the beginning of the process which eliminates the duplicate cost.
For continuing operations, the 2018 expenses mainly relate to integration and merger related costs of 191m 2017: 109m of which 59m relates to transaction costs which included 20m of merger related costs relating to the accounting impact of the alignment of Aberdeen and Standard Life Investments variable pay structures.
For discontinued operations, the 2018 expenses mainly related to the redemption of our Tier 1 subordinated bonds of 198m 2017: nil, and 53m 2017: nil of separation costs relating to the sale of the UK and European insurance business to Phoenix.
2018 also included 14m of costs in relation to Brexit which we consider to be a major regulatory change.
The residual costs of 47m related to other restructuring and corporate transaction expenses.
Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and through the purchase of customer contracts is included as an adjusting item.
This is consistent with peers and therefore excluding these items aids comparability.
Highlighting this as an adjusting item aims to give a fuller understanding of these accounting impacts which arise where businesses have been acquired but do not arise where businesses have grown organically.
2018 includes the 880m impairment of the Aberdeen Standard Investments goodwill intangible asset, reflecting the impact of markets and flows on future earnings expectations.
Further details are provided in Note 14.
Supplementary information continued Profits on the disposal of a subsidiary, joint venture or associate are also removed to assist comparability of results period on period.
The sale of our UK and European insurance subsidiary completed on 31 August 2018.
Profit on disposal of interests in associates in 2018 of 185m includes 177m in relation to the HDFC Asset Management IPO.
Details are provided in Note 1 of the Group financial statements.
Impairment of associates in 2018 of 228m relates to our investment in Phoenix and reflects the fall in the Phoenix share price between 31 August 2018 and 31 December 2018.
This impairment will reverse in future periods if the Phoenix share price increases.
The impairment of Phoenix is considered an item which is one-off and not indicative of the long-term operating performance of the Group and has therefore been excluded from adjusted profit to assist comparability of results period to period.
More details are provided in Note 12 of the Group financial statements.
Investment return variances and economic assumption changes in the Groups insurance entities are excluded from adjusted profit.
The Groups UK and European insurance business was sold during the year and is classified as discontinued operations.
The Groups other wholly owned insurance business, SL Asia, is classified as held for sale.
For annuities, all fluctuations in liabilities and the assets backing those liabilities due to market interest rate including credit risk movements over the period are excluded from adjusted profit.
Removing these investment return variances and economic assumption changes is consistent with many of our insurance peers and aims to ensure that adjusted profit reflects a long-term view aligned to the maturity profile and economic matching of the corresponding assets and liabilities.
In relation to certain subordinated liabilities this adjustment also excludes an accounting mismatch that arises where subordinated liabilities are measured at amortised cost and certain assets backing the liabilities are measured at fair value.
Where associates and joint ventures have a policy for determining investment return variances and economic assumption changes, the Group uses the policy of the associate or joint venture for including their results in the Groups adjusted profit.
This currently applies only to the Groups investment in Phoenix.
The Phoenix policy is similar to that used by the wholly owned insurance entities.
Details of the main differences are included in Note 12 of the Group financial statements.
Details on items classified as Other in the table on the previous page are provided in Note 12 of the Group financial statements.
In 2018 this balance primarily relates to a held for sale accounting adjustment.
Following the classification of the UK and European insurance business as held for sale on the announcement of the transaction on 23 February 2018, no amortisation or depreciation was recognised.
This increase to profit was classified as an adjusting item as it related to the disposal of a subsidiary.
Restructuring and corporate transaction expenses used to determine adjusted profit before tax in 2017 were 215m on a Pro forma basis compared to 173m on a Reported basis.
The Pro forma basis in 2017 included merger related costs of 42m incurred by Aberdeen.
The results for 2018 are the same on a Pro forma basis as on a Reported basis.
240 Standard Life Aberdeen 2018 FINANCIAL INFORMATION Reconciliation of adjusted profit to IFRS profit by component The key components of adjusted profit before tax are total adjusted operating income which is broken down into fee based revenue and spread risk margin, total adjusted operating expenses and share of associates and joint ventures profit before tax.

Adjusted operating income and expenses exclude items which have an equal and opposite effect on IFRS income and IFRS expenses in the consolidated income statement.
Other presentation differences also include Aberdeen Standard Investments commission expenses which are presented in expenses in the consolidated income statement but are netted against adjusted operating income in the analysis of Group adjusted profit by segment.
Further details of presentation differences are included in Note 2 b ii of the Group financial statements section of this report.
