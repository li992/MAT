They are generally due for settlement within 30 days and therefore are all classified as current.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at the amount of consideration that is unconditional.
The Group holds the trade receivables with the objective to collect the contractual cash flows and therefore measures them subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Due to the short-term nature of the current receivables, their carrying amount is not considered to be materially different to their fair value.
Land Lease Premium represent the fair value asset of leases acquired with Cinema City Holdings B. V and with Regal.
Further information relating to loans to jointly controlled entities is set out in Note 12.
18. Business Combinations 2018 Acquisition of Regal Entertainment Group On the 5 December 2017, the Group announced the proposed acquisition of Regal by means of an acquisition of the entire issued, and to be issued, share capital of Regal.
The acquisition was based on an implied enterprise value of $5.8bn.
The acquisition of Regal completed on 28 February 2018.
Consideration Transferred Of the total consideration for the acquisition, $3.4bn was settled fully in cash, funded by the proceeds of the fully underwritten Rights Issue at the Rights Issue Price of 157.0 pence per New Ordinary Share, which raised $2.3bn, plus an additional $4.1bn was raised through committed Debt Facilities.
The restructured debt arrangement consists of a US Dollar and Euro term loan totalling $4.1bn and a $300.0m revolving credit facility.
The previous financing arrangements in place as at 31 December 2017 for the Group and Regal have been terminated and superseded by the new financing arrangements from 28 February 2018.
As the consideration was entirely paid in cash the acquisition is being accounted for as an acquisition under IFRS 3 rather than as a reverse takeover under IFRS 3, notwithstanding the size of the acquisition.

The Key Judgments and Estimates considered were as follows: Property, plant and equipment The assessed fair value of property, plant and equipment including assets held for sale of $1,884.3m include a number of adjustments.
Land and buildings assets at 65 sites were revalued to reflect open market at the date of acquisition, resulting in a fair value uplift of $235.0m.
A fair value uplift of $27.2m on right of use assets included within Property, Plant and Equipment in respect of finance leases was recognised as a result of forecast income at the lease sites exceeding the recorded value of the assets.
In assessing the fair value of Property, Plant and Equipment at a CGU level, the carrying value reported by Regal prior to acquisition was assumed to reflect the fair value of the assets at each CGU.
In order to verify this assumption, the carrying value of each CGU was compared to the depreciated replacement cost of the assets at each site based on the useful economic lives and current market pricing.
It was concluded that the carrying value of the CGU assets accurately represented the fair value on this basis.
A further exercise was completed to compare the carrying value of each CGU to its estimated value in use.
Estimating the value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from each CGU and discount these to their net present value at a pre-tax discount rate.
Future cashflows were based on the performance of each CGU for the 12months preceding the acquisition date.
Where the estimated value in use did not support the carrying value of a CGU, a fair value adjustment was recognised.
Assets with a value of $105.2m were written down, where the forecast cashflows of a CGU discounted by applying an indicative acquisition internal rate of return did not support its value at the date of acquisition.
The judgements applied in assessing the fair value of acquired PPE involved key assumptions, which are sensitive to change.
Sensitivity analysis has been performed on the value in use assessment, giving consideration to incremental changes in the key assumptions of admissions levels, average ticket price, concession spend per person and discount rate.
There were 42 CGUs with a total fair value of $61.4m whose fair value was considered to be sensitive to changes in key assumptions An increase in the discount rate of 8.6% of 1% would result in an additional fair value reduction of $2.6m.
Admissions levels, average ticket price, concession spend per person combine to drive the expected cashflows used in assessing the value in use.
An overall reduction of 1% in the expected cashflows which included growth rates between 0.0% and 1.0% would result in a further fair value reduction of $0.8m.
Intangible assets Acquired identifiable intangible assets include $365.0m in respect of brands and $141.0m in respect of customer relationships.
Management consider the residual goodwill of $4,625.8m to represent a number of factors including the skills and industry knowledge of Regals management and workforce, synergies expected to be realised post acquisition and the future value expected to be generated by the Group from Regals pipeline of new sites and the potential for refurbishing the existing estate.
None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
The contributions Regal has made to the Group since 28 February 2018 represented by the US segment disclosed in Note 2.
Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 113 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 18. Business Combinations continued The fair value of the brand asset was assessed by considering the benefit to the Groups future revenue of the acquired brand and assessing the royalty costs that would be incurred in deriving the same benefit.
The key assumptions in the assessment are the forecast revenue growth and royalty cost applied, the valuation is sensitive to both of these areas A royalty cost of 0.75% of revenue was applied.
A reduction of the forecast revenue growth rate of 1% would result in a reduction in the value of the brand asset by $52.1m.
A reduction in the royalty rate applied of 0.1% would result in a reduction of the brand asset of $48.6m Contract liabilities An assessment of the expected fair value of revenue attributable to performance obligations under advertising contracts was derived by generating an expected fair value of the contract using current market advertising prices.
This resulted in a fair value uplift of $245.7m being applied to deferred revenue, resulting in a liabilty at acquisition of $680.8m.
The key judgement in assessing the value of the contract liability at the acquisition date was the current pricing of screen advertising.
A range of observable price points were considered, the range of potential values of the contract liability based on those price points was from $658.9m to $720.9m.
A reduction of 1% in the advertising price applied would reduce the fair value of the liability at acquisition by $10.8m.
Other Fair Value Adjustments: Management have also considered the lease contract of each of the acquired sites.
A provision of $35.3m has been recognised in respect of onerous lease contracts.
The provision reflects the present value of the future lease payments under these lease contracts to the extent that the contract results in the site making a loss.
An exercise was conducted to compare the current rentals of each of the sites to the current market rental rate.
Accordingly, a net provision of $162.0m has been recognised in respect of a number of sites where the current rental rate is either above or below the assumed average market rental rate.
As a result of adjusting all rental payments to a fair market basis, Deferred income of $196.0m in respect of landlord contributions received by Regal prior to the acquisition have been written off and a liability of $87.0m in respect of contractual increments in rent has been eliminated.
Future incremental rent charges will be recorded in the income statement in line with IAS 17.
The fair value of the Groups investment in a listed Joint Venture was increased by $51.0m, reflecting the Groups holding and the share price of the entity at the acquisition date.
2017 Acquisition of Empire cinema On 15 June 2017 the Group completed the acquisition of the Newcastle cinema from Cinema Holdings Limited by means of an acquisition of 100% of the shares.
The consideration consists of two elements, the initial consideration of $9.1m plus contingent consideration based on the performance of the site over a 24 month period post completion of the refurbishment.
The contingent consideration has been provisionally estimated at $4.1m based on the expected future performance of the site and the market.
Fair Value of Consideration Transferred $m Cash consideration 9.1 Contingent consideration 4.0 Total fair value of consideration transferred 13.1 The fair value of net assets has been determined at $2.6m, the residual goodwill of $10.5m represents a number of factors including the strategic location of the sites acquired, the benefit of the sites being established sites, the value of the acquired sites can add to Cineworld existing brand and products as well as synergies expected to be realised post acquisition.
Identifiable Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed $m Fair value of total net identifiable assets upon acquisition Property, plant and equipment 2.6 Total net identifiable assets 2.6 Goodwill 10.5 Consideration transferred 13.1 The Key Judgments considered were as follows: Property and Leases The fair value of property, plant and equipment of $2.6m represents managements initial assessment of the assets acquired.
As well as considering the fair value of acquired property, plant and equipment, management also considered the lease contracts for the cinema: no assets or liabilities were identified in respect of these contracts.
Tax No income tax liability is recognised on acquisition as future tax charges are not expected to arise in respect of tax positions open at the date of acquisition.
