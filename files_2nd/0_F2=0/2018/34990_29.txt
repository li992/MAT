The Companys ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
These Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101.
The Financial Statements are prepared under the historical cost convention.
No profit and loss account is presented by the Company as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
The results of Computacenter plc are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of Computacenter plc which are available from Computacenter plc, Hatfield Business Park, Hatfield Avenue, Hatfield, AL10 9TW.

The Financial Statements are prepared in pound sterling and are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds 000.
2 Summary of significant accounting policies Basis of preparation The Company has taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions under FRS 101: a the requirements of paragraphs 45 b and 46-52 of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment: b t he requirements of paragraphs 62, B64 d, B64 e, B64 g, B64 h, B64 j to B64 m, B64 n ii, B64 o ii, B64 p, B64 q ii, B66 and B67 of IFRS 3 Business Combinations: c the requirements of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures: e the requirements of paragraphs 91-99 of IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement: f the requirement in paragraph 38 of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements to present comparative information in respect of: i paragraph 79 a iv of IAS 1: ii paragraph 73 e of IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment: iii paragraph 118 e of IAS 38 Intangible Assets: iv paragraphs 76 and 79 d of IAS 40 Investment Property: and v paragraph 50 of IAS 41 Agriculture.
g the requirements of paragraphs 10 d, 10 f, 39 c and 134-136 of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: h the requirements of IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows: i the requirements of paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors: j the requirements of paragraph 17 of IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures: k t he requirements in IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group, provided that any subsidiary which is a party to the transaction is wholly owned by such a member: and l the requirements of paragraphs 134 d -134 f and 135 c -135 e of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
The basis for all of the above exemptions is because equivalent disclosures are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group in which the entity is consolidated.
Intellectual property Licences purchased in respect of intellectual property are capitalised, classified as an intangible asset on the Balance Sheet and amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of the licence, normally 20 years.
Depreciation of fixed assets Freehold land is not depreciated.
Depreciation is provided on all other tangible fixed assets at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset evenly over its expected useful life, as follows: Freehold buildings 25 years Investment property Investment property is defined as land and or buildings held by the Company to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or both, rather than for sale in the ordinary course of business or for use in supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes.
The Company recognises any part of an owned or leased under a finance lease property that is leased to third-parties as investment property, unless it represents an insignificant portion of the property.
Investment property is measured initially at cost including transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the Company elected to measure investment property at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any i. e. applying the same accounting policies including useful lives as for property, plant and equipment.
The fair values, which reflect the market conditions at the balance sheet date, are disclosed in note 4.
Investments Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
166 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2018 Impairment of assets The carrying values of assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Share-based payment transactions The accounting policy in relation to share-based payment transactions is disclosed in full in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
In addition to that, the financial effect of awards by the Company of options over its equity shares to employees of subsidiary undertakings are recognised by the Company in its individual Financial Statements as an increase in its investment in subsidiaries with a credit to equity equivalent to the IFRS 2 cost in subsidiary undertakings.
On transition to IFRS, the Group did not apply the measurement rules of IFRS 2 to equity-settled awards granted before 7 November 2002 or granted after that date and vested before 1 January 2005.
However, later modifications of such equity instruments are measured under IFRS 2.
Taxation Corporation tax payable is provided on taxable profits at the current tax rate.
Where Group relief is surrendered from other subsidiaries in the Group, the Company is required to pay to the surrendering company an amount equal to the loss surrendered multiplied by the current tax rate.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Own shares held Shares in the Company, held by the Company, are classified in shareholders equity as own shares held and are recognised at cost.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken to revenue reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Merger accounting and the merger reserve Prior to 1 January 2013, certain significant business combinations were accounted for using the pooling of interests method or merger accounting, which treats the merged groups as if they had been combined throughout the current and comparative accounting periods.
Merger accounting principles for these combinations gave rise to a merger reserve in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, being the difference between the nominal value of new shares issued by the Parent Company for the acquisition of the shares of the subsidiary and the subsidiarys own share capital and share premium account.
These transactions have not been restated, as permitted by the IFRS 1 transitional arrangements.
The merger reserve is also used where more than 90 per cent of the shares in a subsidiary are acquired and the consideration includes the issue of new shares by the Company, thereby attracting merger relief under the Companies Act 1985 and, from 1 October 2009, the Companies Act 2006.

The fair value of investment property amounted to 37.6 million at 31 December 2018 2017: 37.3 million.
The fair values for disclosure purposes have been determined using either the support of qualified independent external valuers or by internal valuers with the necessary recognised and relevant professional qualification, applying a combination of the present value of future cash flows and observable market values of comparable properties.
Managements most recent external valuation of this property took place in February 2016.
As this property is leased to a subsidiary and is carried at depreciated cost value, an updated external valuation was not sought at 31 December 2018.
