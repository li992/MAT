 Mitchells & Butlers plc 105 Notes to the financial statements Section 1 Basis of preparation continued Recent accounting developments The International Accounting Standards Board IASB and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations which have been adopted by the Group in these financial statements for the first time: Accounting standard Requirement Impact on financial statements Amendments to IAS 7: The Group has adopted the amendments to IAS 7 for Apart from the additional disclosures in notes 4.1 Disclosure Initiative the first time in the current year.

The Groups liabilities arising from financing activities consist of borrowings note 4.2 and certain derivatives note 4.4.
Reconciliations between the opening and closing balances of these items are provided in note 4.1 and 4.4 respectively.
Consistent with the transition provisions of the amendments, the Group has not disclosed comparative information for the prior year.
Amendments to IAS 12: The Group has adopted the amendments to IAS 12 for the The application of these amendments has had Recognition of Deferred Tax first time in the current year.
The amendments clarify how no impact on the Groups consolidated financial Assets for Unrealised Losses an entity should evaluate whether there will be sufficient statements as the Group already assesses the future taxable profits against which it can utilise a sufficiency of future taxable profits in a way that deductible temporary difference.

to 2016 Cycle for the first time in the current year.
The other amendments included in this package are not yet mandatorily effective and they have not been early adopted by the Group.
IFRS 12 states that an entity need not provide summarised financial information for interests in subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures that are classified or included in a disposal group that is classified as held for sale.
The IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations which could impact the Group, with an effective date for financial periods beginning on or after the dates disclosed below: Accounting standard Effective date IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2018 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2018 IFRS 2 amendments Classification and Measurement 1 January 2018 of Share-based Payment Transactions IAS 40 amendments Transfer of Investment Property 1 January 2018 Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 20142016 Cycle 1 January 2018 IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advanced 1 January 2018 Consideration IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments 1 January 2019 subject to EU approval Amendments to IAS 28 Long-term Interest in Associates 1 January 2019 subject to EU approval and Joint Ventures Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2015-2017 Cycle 1 January 2019 subject to EU approval Amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits: Plan Amendment, 1 January 2019 subject to EU approval Curtailment or Settlement The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group in future periods.
A review of the impact of IFRS 15 and IFRS 9 has been performed as described below.
Beyond this, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed review has been completed.
106 Mitchells & Butlers plc  STRATEGIC REPORT 1 TO 45 GOVERNANCE 46 TO 91 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 92 TO 147 OTHER INFORMATION 148 TO 152 Impact of adoption of IFRS 15 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers replaces IAS 18 Revenue and is effective for financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
It applies to the Group for the 52 weeks ending 28 September 2019.
IFRS 15 has been introduced to provide a single, comprehensive framework for revenue recognition.
The core principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity should recognise revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
Specifically, the standard introduces a five-step approach to revenue recognition: Step 1: Identify the contract with a customer Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract Step 3: Determine the transaction price Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract Step 5: Recognise revenue when the entity satisfies a performance obligation IFRS 15 is not expected to have a material impact on the Group when it is adopted, as the majority of the Groups revenue is in relation to the sale of food and drink within pubs and restaurants, for which the consideration is known and the performance obligations are satisfied at the point of sale.
Impact of adoption of IFRS 9 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and is effective for financial periods starting on or after 1 January 2018.
IFRS 9 has been introduced to address some of the complexity contained within IAS 39 but also introduces the concept of earlier recognition of credit losses on loans and receivables.
The adoption of IFRS 9 is not expected to have a material impact on any reported balances in the financial statements, as following assessment by management, there are no financial assets that will require a change in treatment.
The Group will be required to update its hedging documentation to reflect the requirements of IFRS 9.
However, there will be no change to the effectiveness of the Groups cash flow hedges.
In addition, there may be minor amendments to disclosures within the financial statements.
The following standard will have a material impact on the Group when it becomes effective.
Accounting standard Effective date IFRS 16 Leases The standard replaces IAS 17 Leases when it becomes effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
The Group currently expects to adopt IFRS 16 for the 52 week period ending 26 September 2020.
 Mitchells & Butlers plc 107 Notes to the financial statements Section 1 Basis of preparation continued Impact of adoption of IFRS 16 IFRS 16 requires lessees to recognise a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability for all leases except for low value assets or where the lease term is 12 months or less.
The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date.
Subsequently, the lease liability is adjusted for interest and lease payments, as well as the impact of lease modifications.
As a result of this change, the income statement will include depreciation of the right-of-use asset and interest on the liability, rather than the rental expense recognised under IAS 17.
Following transition, any unused onerous lease provision will transition to become a provision for impairment of right-of-use assets.
Furthermore, the classification of cash flows will also be impacted as operating lease payments under IAS 17 are presented as operating cash flows: whereas under the IFRS 16 model, the lease payments will be split into a principal and an interest portion which will be presented as financing and operating cash flows respectively.
Accounting requirements for lessors is substantially unchanged from IAS 17.
IFRS 16 will be effective for the Group for the year ending September 2020.
The Group currently has operating lease commitments of 670m as disclosed in note 2.3.
A preliminary assessment indicates that these arrangements will meet the definition of a lease under IFRS 16 and hence the Group will recognise a right of use asset and corresponding liabilities, unless they qualify for low value or short-term exemption.
The right of use asset will be depreciated on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Interest will be recognised on the lease liability, resulting in a higher interest expense in the earlier years of the lease term.
The total expense recognised in the Income Statement over the life of the lease will be unaffected by the new standard.
There will be no impact on cash flows, although the presentation of the Group cash flow statement will change significantly, with an increase in cash flows from operating activities being offset by an increase in cash flows from financing activities.
The Group has established a working group to ensure we take all the necessary steps to comply with the requirements of IFRS 16.
The working group includes our outsource partners who manage estate activity as well as key members of our finance and property teams.
Work has already commenced to collate relevant data, review available system solutions and agree relevant accounting policies.
Given the number of leases and historical data requirements to adopt the fully retrospective approach, the Group intends to apply the modified retrospective approach, with assets equal to liabilities, at transition.
This approach will not require restatement of comparative information.
Given the complexities of IFRS 16 and the sensitivity to key assumptions such as discount rates, it is not yet practicable to fully quantify the effect of IFRS 16 on the financial statements of the Group.
Critical accounting judgements and estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions in the application of accounting policies that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expense.
Estimates and judgements are periodically evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Details of the Groups critical accounting judgements and estimates are described within the relevant accounting policy section in each of the notes to the financial statements.
Critical judgements are described in each section listed below: Note 2.2 Separately disclosed items Note 3.1 Property, plant and equipment Note 3.3 Provisions Note 4.5 Pensions Critical estimates are described in: Note 3.1 Property, plant and equipment Note 3.3 Provisions 108 Mitchells & Butlers plc  STRATEGIC REPORT 1 TO 45 GOVERNANCE 46 TO 91 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 92 TO 147 OTHER INFORMATION 148 TO 152 Notes to the financial statements Section 2 Results for the year 2.1 Segmental analysis Accounting policies Operating segments IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires operating segments to be based on the Groups internal reporting to its Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
The CODM is regarded as the Chief Executive together with other Board members.
The Group trades in one business segment that of operating pubs and restaurants and the Groups brands meet the aggregation criteria set out in Paragraph 12 of IFRS 8.
Economic indicators assessed in determining that the aggregated operating segments share similar economic characteristics include expected future financial performance: operating and competitive risks: and return on invested capital.
The disclosure set out in the Annual Report and Accounts for 2017 included segmental information for the retail operating business and property business, with an internal rent charge being levied against the Groups retail operating units by the property business.
With a stable estate, the internal rent charge is no longer used by the CODM as an indicator of performance as movements in this charge are insignificant.
The business is focused on delivery of sales growth and control of short-term costs within its trading pubs, in order to maximise return from its existing estate.
The CODM uses EBITDA and profit before interest and adjusted items operating profit pre-adjustments as the key measures of the Groups results on an aggregated basis.
Geographical segments Substantially all of the Groups business is conducted in the United Kingdom.
In presenting information by geographical segment, segment revenue and non-current assets are based on the geographical location of customers and assets.
Includes balances relating to intangibles, property, plant and equipment and non-current lease premiums.
2.2 Separately disclosed items Accounting policy In addition to presenting information on an IFRS basis, the Group also presents adjusted profit and earnings per share information that excludes separately disclosed items and the impact of any associated tax.
Adjusted profitability measures are presented excluding separately disclosed items as we believe this provides both management and investors with useful additional information about the Groups performance and supports a more effective comparison of the Groups trading performance from one period to the next.
Adjusted profit and earnings per share information is used by management to monitor business performance against both shorter-term budgets and forecasts but also against the Groups longer-term strategic plans.
Separately disclosed items are those which are separately identified by virtue of their size or incidence and include movements in the valuation of the property portfolio as a result of the annual revaluation exercise, impairment review of short leasehold and unlicensed properties, legal costs associated with the dispute in relation to the defined benefit pension scheme and material movements in the onerous lease provision.
Critical accounting judgements Judgement is used to determine those items which should be separately disclosed to allow a better understanding of the adjusted trading performance of the Group.
This judgement includes assessment of whether an item is of sufficient size or of a nature that is not consistent with normal trading activities.
Separately disclosed items are identified as follows: One-off legal costs associated with the ongoing court case between the Company and the Trustee of the Defined Benefit Pension scheme in relation to the rate of inflation applied to pension increases for certain sections of the membership.
These costs would prevent year-on-year comparability of the Groups trading if not separately disclosed.
Onerous lease provision this provision is calculated on a site by site basis, with the majority of the additions for the prior period being disclosed separately.
This prior period increase was the result of a full review of estate strategy and an update to the discount rate applied in calculating the provision.
Due to the size of the resulting increase in the provision, this was disclosed separately.
Profit loss arising on property disposals property disposals are disclosed separately as they are not considered to be part of adjusted trade performance and there is volatility in the size of the profit loss in each accounting period.
Movement in the valuation of the property portfolio this is disclosed separately, due to the size and volatility of the movement in property valuation each period, which can be partly driven by movements in the property market.
This movement is also not considered to be part of the adjusted trade performance of the Group and would prevent year-on-year comparability of the Groups trading performance if not separately disclosed.
 Mitchells & Butlers plc 109 Notes to the financial statements Section 2 Results for the year continued 2.2 Separately disclosed items continued The items identified in the current period are as follows: 2018 2017 52 weeks 53weeks Notes m m Adjusted items Legal costs associated with the defined benefit pension scheme a 6 Onerous lease provision additions b 35 Total adjusted items recognised within operating costs 6 35 Net profit arising on property disposals 1 1 Movement in the valuation of the property portfolio see note 3.1 : Impairment arising from the revaluation c 28 51 Impairment of short leasehold and unlicensed properties d 15 17 Impairment of assets held for sale e 4 Net movement in the valuation of the property portfolio 43 72 Total adjusted items before tax 48 106 Tax credit relating to above items 7 23 Total adjusted items after tax 41 83 a.
There are ongoing legal proceedings between the Company as principal employer and Mitchells & Butlers Pensions Limited as Trustee for which costs have been incurred both by the Company and by the Trustee but which the Company has agreed to pay.
The legal proceedings are in relation to the Mitchells & Butlers Pension Plan MABPP, whereby the Trust Deed and Rules provide that it is a matter for the Company to determine the rate of inflation which should be applied to pension increases for certain sections of the membership in excess of guaranteed minimum pensions, the Company has instructed the Trustee to apply CPI subject to certain caps in respect of such increases.
The Trustee believes that this power was incorrectly vested in the Company in the Trust Deed and Rules of the MABPP in 1996 and, despite it being reflected in further versions of the Trust Deed and Rules, has made an application to court for those various Trust Deeds and Rules to be rectified.
It is the Boards belief that the Company holds the power to fix such an inflation index and the Company is therefore contesting that application.
The hearing is expected to be held in late 2019. b.
During the prior period, a review of estate strategy in relation to managed leasehold sites was completed, with specific focus on the challenges around loss-making sites and those located on retail and leisure parks.
The losses were considered to be unavoidable for the remaining committed lease term.
In addition, the discount rate applied in the calculation was also updated.
As a result, the onerous lease provision increased significantly with the majority of this increase recognised as a separately disclosed item in the prior period.
The net movement in the onerous lease provision in the current period has been included within adjusted profit as it is immaterial.
See note 3.3 for further details.
c. Impairment arising from the Groups revaluation of its pub estate where the carrying values of the properties exceed their recoverable amount.
See note 3.1 for further details.
d. Impairment of short leasehold and unlicensed properties where their carrying values exceed their recoverable amount.
e. Impairment recognised on reclassification of property, plant and equipment to assets held for sale.

 The majority of revenue comprises food and beverages sold in the Groups businesses.
This revenue is recognised at the point of sale to the customer.
 Rental income is received from unlicensed and leased operations.
Income from these operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Operating profit Operating profit is stated after charging adjusted items but before investment income and finance costs.
Supplierincentives Supplier incentives and rebates are recognised within operating costs as they are earned.
The accrued value at the reporting date is included in other receivables.
 Leases in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases and sub-leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Lease incentives are recognised as a liability and a subsequent reduction in the rental expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
Premiums paid on acquiring a new lease are spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Such premiums are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current lease premiums, with the current portion being the element which relates to the following period.
The Groups policy is to account for land held under both long and short leasehold contracts as operating leases, since it has no expectation that title will pass on expiry of the lease contracts.
Revenue is analysed as follows: 2018 2017 52 weeks 53weeks m m Goods 2,142 2,169 Services 10 11 2,152 2,180 Revenue from services includes rent receivable from unlicensed properties and leased operations of 9m 2017 10m.

Operating leases Operating lease commitments Group as lessee The vast majority of the Groups leases are industry standard UK pub or commercial property leases which provide for periodic rent reviews to open market value and enjoy statutory rights to renewal on expiry.
Generally they do not contain conditions relating to rent escalation, rights to purchase, concessions, residual values or other material provisions of an unusual nature.

112 Mitchells & Butlers plc  STRATEGIC REPORT 1 TO 45 GOVERNANCE 46 TO 91 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 92 TO 147 OTHER INFORMATION 148 TO 152 2.4 Taxation Accounting policies Current tax The income tax expense represents both the income tax payable, based on profits for the period, and deferred tax and is calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense which are not taxable.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except when it relates to items that are charged or credited in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the income tax is also charged or credited in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profits and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associate with such investments and interests are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilise the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised based on tax laws and rates that have been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The amount of deferred tax recognised is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities.

A deferred tax asset has not been recognised on tax allowances with a value of 15m 2017 14m because it is not certain that future taxable profits will be available in the company where these tax allowances arose against which the Group can utilise these benefits.
These tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely.
Factors which may affect future tax charges The Finance Act 2016 was substantively enacted on 15 September 2016 and reduced the main rate of corporation tax from 19% to 17% from 1 April 2020.
The effect of these changes has been reflected in the closing deferred tax balances at 30 September 2017 and 29 September 2018.
2.5 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share EPS has been calculated by dividing the profit or loss for the period by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding own shares held by employee share trusts.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Adjusted earnings per ordinary share amounts are presented before adjusted items see note 2.2 in order to allow a better understanding of the adjusted trading performance of the Group.

 Mitchells & Butlers plc 115 Notes to the financial statements Section 3 Operating assets and liabilities 3.1 Property, plant and equipment Accounting policies Property, plant and equipment The majority of the Groups freehold and long leasehold licensed land and buildings are revalued annually and are therefore held at fair value less depreciation.
Short leasehold buildings leases with an unexpired lease term of less than 50 years, unlicensed land and buildings and fixtures, fittings and equipment are held at cost less depreciation and impairment.
All land and buildings are disclosed as a single class of asset within the property, plant and equipment table, as we do not consider the short leasehold and unlicensed buildings to be material for separate disclosure.
Non-current assets held for sale are held at their carrying value or their fair value less costs to sell where this is lower.
Depreciation Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis to write off the cost less residual value over the estimated useful life of an asset and commences when an asset is ready for its intended use.
Expected useful lives and residual values are reviewed each year and adjusted if appropriate.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Freehold and long leasehold buildings are depreciated so that the difference between their carrying value and estimated residual value is written off over 50 years from the date of acquisition.
The residual value of freehold and long leasehold buildings is reassessed each year and is estimated to be equal to the fair value determined in the annual valuation and therefore no depreciation charge is recognised.
Short leasehold buildings, and associated fixtures, fittings and equipment, are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life and the unexpired term of the lease.
Fixtures, fittings and equipment have the following estimated useful lives: Information technology equipment 3 to 7 years Fixtures and fittings 3 to 20 years At the point of transfer to non-current assets held for sale, depreciation ceases.
Should an asset be subsequently reclassified to property, plant and equipment, the depreciation charge is calculated to reflect the cumulative charge had the asset not been reclassified.
Disposals Profits and losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment are calculated as the difference between the net sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset at the date of disposal.
Revaluation The revaluation utilises valuation multiples, which are determined via third-party inspection of 20% of the sites such that all sites are individually valued approximately every five years: estimates of fair maintainable trade FMT : and estimated resale value of tenants fixtures and fittings.
Properties are valued as fully operational entities, to include fixtures and fittings but excluding stock and personal goodwill.
The value of tenants fixtures and fittings is then removed from this valuation via reference to its associated resale value.
Where sites have been impacted by expansionary capital investment in the preceding twelve months, FMT is taken as the lower of the post investment forecast or the prior year FMT, as the current year trading performance includes a period of closure.
Valuation multiples derived via third-party inspections determine brand standard multiples which are then used to value the remainder of the non-inspected estate via an extrapolation exercise, with the output of this exercise reviewed at a high level by the Directors and the third-party valuer.
Where the value of land and buildings derived purely from a multiple applied to the fair maintainable trade misrepresents the underlying asset value, for example, due to low levels of income or location characteristics, a spot valuation is applied.
Surpluses which arise from the revaluation exercise are included within other comprehensive income in the revaluation reserve unless they are reversing a revaluation adjustment which has been recognised in the income statement previously: in which case an amount equal to a maximum of that recognised in the income statement previously is recognised in income.
Where the revaluation exercise gives rise to a deficit, this is reflected directly within the income statement, unless it is reversing a previous revaluation surplus against the same asset: in which case an amount equal to the maximum of the revaluation surplus is recognised within other comprehensive income in the revaluation reserve.
Impairment Short leasehold and unlicensed properties are reviewed on an outlet basis for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an outlet exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an outlets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Any changes in outlet earnings, or cash flows, the discount rate applied to those cash flows, or the estimate of sales proceeds could give rise to an additional impairment loss.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior periods.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
An impairment reversal is only recognised where there is a change in the estimates used to determine recoverable amounts, not where it results from the passage of time.
116 Mitchells & Butlers plc  STRATEGIC REPORT 1 TO 45 GOVERNANCE 46 TO 91 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 92 TO 147 OTHER INFORMATION 148 TO 152 Critical accounting judgements The revaluation methodology is determined using management judgement, with advice from third-party valuers.
The application of a valuation multiple to the fair maintainable trade of each site is considered the most appropriate method for the Group to determine the fair value of licensed land and buildings.
Where sites have been impacted by expansionary capital investment in the preceding twelve months, management judgement is used to determine the most appropriate FMT.
The FMT is taken as the lower of the post investment forecast or the prior year FMT, as the current year trading performance includes a period of closure.
Critical accounting estimates The application of the valuation methodology requires two critical accounting estimates: the estimation of valuation multiples, which are determined via third-party inspections: and an estimate of fair maintainable trade, including reference to historic and future projected income levels.
A sensitivity analysis of changes in valuation multiples and FMT, in relation to the properties to which these estimates apply, is provided on page 118.
The carrying value of properties to which these estimates apply is 4,230m 2017 4,230m.
When a review for impairment is conducted for short leasehold properties, the recoverable amount is determined based on value in use calculations.
The value in use calculation requires two critical accounting estimates: the estimation of future cash flows, including reference to historical and future projected income levels: and the selection of an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate.
A sensitivity analysis of changes in future cash flows and discount rate, in relation to the properties to which these estimates apply, is provided on page 118.
The carrying value of properties to which these estimates apply is 156m 2017 170m.

 Mitchells & Butlers plc 117 Notes to the financial statements Section 3 Operating assets and liabilities continued 3.1 Property, plant and equipment continued Revaluation of freehold and long leasehold properties The freehold and long leasehold properties have been valued at fair value, as at 29 September 2018 using information provided by CBRE, independent chartered surveyors.
The valuation was carried out in accordance with the RICS Valuation Global Standards 2017 which incorporate the International Valuation Standards and the RICS Valuation Professional Standards UK January 2014 revised April 2015 the Red Book assuming each asset is sold as a fully operational trading entity.
The fair value has been determined having regard to factors such as current and future projected income levels, taking account of location, quality of the pub restaurant and recent market transactions in the sector.
Sensitivity analysis Changes in either the FMT or the multiple could materially impact the valuation of the freehold and long leasehold properties.
The average movement in FMT of revalued properties in recent years is 1.0%.
It is estimated that, given the multiplier effect, a 1.0% change in the FMT of the freehold or long leasehold properties would generate an approximate 37m movement in their valuation.
Multiples are determined at an individual brand level.
The average movement in weighted average of all brand multiples in recent years is 0.1.
It is estimated that a 0.1 change in the multiple would generate an approximate 42m movement in valuation.
Impairment review of short leasehold and unlicensed properties Short leasehold and unlicensed properties comprising land and buildings and fixtures, fittings and equipment which are not revalued to fair market value, are reviewed for impairment by comparing site value in use calculations to their carrying values.
The value in use calculation uses forecast trading performance cash flows, which are discounted by applying a pre-tax discount rate of 7.5% 2017 7.0%.
Any resulting impairment relates to sites with poor trading performance, where the output of the value in use calculation is insufficient to justify their current net book value.
Sensitivity analysis The Group has performed a sensitivity analysis on the impairment tests for its short leasehold properties using various reasonably possible scenarios.
It is estimated that a 5.0% decline in the EBITDA of the short leasehold properties would generate an approximate 1m increase in the impairment charge.
It is also estimated that 0.5% increase in the discount rate would not result in a significant increase to the impairment charge.
The movement of 0.5% is considered reasonable, given that the discount rate has increased by 0.5% in the current period.
Current year valuations have been incorporated into the financial statements and the resulting revaluation adjustments have been taken to the revaluation reserve or income statement as appropriate.
The impact of the revaluations impairments described above is as follows: 2018 2017 52 weeks 53weeks m m Income statement Revaluation loss charged as an impairment 89 109 Reversal of past impairments 61 58 Total impairment arising from the revaluation 28 51 Impairment of short leasehold and unlicensed properties 15 17 Impairment of assets held for sale 4 43 72 Revaluation reserve Unrealised revaluation surplus 171 210 Reversal of past revaluation surplus 176 136 5 74 Net decrease increase in property, plant and equipment 48 2 The valuation techniques are consistent with the principles in IFRS 13 and use significant unobservable inputs such that the fair value measurement of each property within the portfolio has been classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

120 Mitchells & Butlers plc  STRATEGIC REPORT 1 TO 45 GOVERNANCE 46 TO 91 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 92 TO 147 OTHER INFORMATION 148 TO 152 3.3 Provisions Accounting policy Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events: it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation: and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are measured using the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Onerous property provisions represent the expected unavoidable losses on onerous and vacant property leases and comprise the lower of the net rent payable or the operating loss after rental costs.
The provision is calculated on a site by site basis with a provision being made for the remaining committed lease term, where a lease is considered to be onerous.
Other contractual dilapidations costs are also recorded as provisions as appropriate.
Critical accounting judgements Determination of whether a loss is unavoidable requires areas of judgement such as consideration of potential future investment decisions, local conditions which may be impacting on current performance.
Critical accounting estimates In relation to onerous property provisions, estimates are required in determining the future EBITDA performance of each site and the potential to exit leases earlier than the expiry date.
A sensitivity analysis of changes in these estimates is provided below.
The value of provisions to which these estimates apply is 43m 2017 42m.
Provisions The provision for unavoidable losses on onerous property leases has been set up to cover rental payments of vacant or loss-making properties.
Payments are expected to continue on these properties for periods of 1 to 25 years.
Provisions can be analysed as follows: Property leases m At 24 September 2016 9 a Released in the period 1 b Provided in the period 36 Unwinding of discount 1 Utilised in the period 3 At 30 September 2017 42 a Released in the period 6 b Provided in the period 11 Unwinding of discount 1 Utilised in the period 5 At 29 September 2018 43 a.
Releases in the prior period primarily related to property disposals.
Releases in the current period primarily relate to improvement in performance of managed properties.
During the prior period, a full review of estate strategy in relation to managed leasehold properties was completed, with specific focus on the challenges around loss-making sites and those located on retail and leisure parks.
With lower footfall on many of these parks and the continued uncertain economic outlook, alongside increased cost pressures such as living wage, business rates review, apprenticeship levy, sugar tax and food price inflation, a number of short leasehold sites were considered to be challenged when striving to achieve a break-even profit performance.
As a result, the losses were considered unavoidable for the remaining committed lease term for managed properties.
In addition, the discount rate applied in the calculation was updated.
As a result of these changes, a 35m increase in the provision was included as a separately disclosed item see note 2.2.
The remaining increase of 1m was recognised within adjusted profit, as this represented unavoidable losses on unlicensed properties.
Sensitivity analysis The Group has performed a sensitivity analysis on the onerous lease provision calculation using various reasonably possible scenarios.
It is estimated that a 5% decline in the future EBITDA performance of the sites included in the provision would generate an additional provision of 1m.
It is also estimated that, should all leases with more than 10 years remaining on the committed lease term be exited two years ahead of expiry, the provision would reduce by 1m.
 Mitchells & Butlers plc 121 Notes to the financial statements Section 3 Operating assets and liabilities continued 3.4 Goodwill and other intangible assets Accounting policies Business combinations and goodwill Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values of assets given and liabilities incurred or assumed by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that: deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits revised respectively: and assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that standard.
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognised separately from goodwill are initially recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirers previously held equity interest in the acquiree over the net of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.
If, after reassessment, the net of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirers previously held interest in the acquiree, the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement as a bargain purchase.
When the consideration transferred by the Group in a business combination includes assets or liabilities resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, the contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition date fair value and included as part of the contingent consideration transferred in a business combination.
Changes in fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as measurement period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments against goodwill.
Measurement period adjustments are adjustments that arise from additional information obtained during the measurement period which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date.
The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of contingent consideration that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments depends on how the contingent consideration is classified.
Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not re-measured at subsequent reporting dates and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.
Contingent consideration that is classified as an asset or a liability is re-measured at subsequent reporting dates, at fair value, with the corresponding gain or loss being recognised in the income statement.
When a business combination is achieved in stages, the Groups previously-held interests in the acquired entity is re-measured to its acquisition date fair value and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in the income statement.
Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest were disposed of.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete.
Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period, or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.
Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
The impairment review requires management to consider the recoverable value of the business to which the goodwill relates, based on either the fair value less costs to sell or the value in use.
Value in use calculations require management to consider the net present value of future cash flows generated by the business to which the goodwill relates.
Fair value less costs to sell is based on managements estimate of the net proceeds which could be generated through disposing of that business.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Computer software Computer software and associated development costs, which are not an integral part of a related item of hardware, are capitalised as an intangible asset and amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful life.
The period of amortisation ranges between three and seven years with the majority being five years.

 Mitchells & Butlers plc 123 Notes to the financial statements Section 3 Operating assets and liabilities continued 3.5 Associates Accounting policies An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
The results, assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting, except when the investment is classified as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.
Under the equity method, an investment in an associate is accounted for using the equity method from the date on which the investee becomes an associate.
On acquisition of the investment in an associate, any excess of the cost of the investment over the Groups share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the investee is recognised as goodwill, which is included within the carrying amount of the investment.
If after reassessment the Groups share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities are in excess of the cost of the investment, this is recognised immediately in profit or loss in the period in which the investment is acquired.
The requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets are applied to determine whether it is necessary to recognise any impairment loss with respect to the Groups investment in an associate.
When necessary, the entire carrying amount of the investment including goodwill is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 as a single asset by comparing its recoverable amount higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal with its carrying amount.
Any impairment loss recognised forms part of the carrying amount of the investment.
Any reversal of that impairment loss is recognised in accordance with IAS 36 to the extent that the recoverable amount of the investment subsequently increases.
The Group discontinues the use of the equity method from the date when the investment ceases to be an associate, or when the investment is classified as held for sale.
When the Group retains an interest in the former associate and the retained interest is a financial asset, the Group measures the retained interest at fair value at that date and the fair value is regarded as its fair value on initial recognition in accordance with IAS 39.
The difference between the carrying amount of the associate at the date the equity method was discontinued, and the fair value of any retained interest and any proceeds from disposing of a part interest in the associate is included in the determination of the gain or loss on disposal of the associate.
In addition, the Group accounts for all amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to that associate on the same basis as would be required if that associate had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.
Therefore, if a gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income by that associate would be reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal of the related assets or liabilities, the Group reclassifies the gain or loss from equity to profit or loss when the equity method is discontinued.
When the Group reduces its ownership interest in an associate but the Group continues to use the equity method, the Group reclassifies to profit or loss the proportion of the gain or loss that had previously been recognised in other comprehensive income relating to that reduction in ownership interest if that gain or loss would be reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal of the related assets or liabilities.
When a Group entity transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses resulting from the transactions with the associate are recognised in the Groups consolidated financial statements only to the extent of interests in the associate that are not related to the Group.
The nature of the activities of all of the Groups associates is trading in pubs and restaurants, which are seen as complementing the Groups operations and contributing to the Groups overall strategy.
Associates can be analysed as follows: m At 24 September 2016 and 30 September 2017 Acquisitions 5 At 29 September 2018 5 Acquisitions in the period relate to the shares purchased in 3Sixty Restaurants Limited and Fatboy Pub Company Limited.
Details of these associates are provided in note 5.2.
During the period, a put and call option agreement was entered into, which allows the Company to acquire the remaining 60% share capital of the associate, 3Sixty Restaurants Limited, at any point in time after three years from the initial purchase date.
The initial 40% investment was purchased on 1 August 2018 for 4m.
The current shareholders also have the option to sell the remaining 60% to the Company, subject to a number of conditions.

 Mitchells & Butlers plc 125 Notes to the financial statements Section 4 Capital structure and financing costs continued 4.2 Borrowings Accounting policy Borrowings, which include the Groups secured loan notes, are stated initially at fair value normally the amount of the proceeds net of issue costs.
Thereafter they are stated at amortised cost using an effective interest basis.
Finance costs, which are the difference between the net proceeds and the total amount of payments to be made in respect of the instruments, are allocated over the term of the debt using the effective interest method.
Borrowing costs are not attributed to the acquisition or construction of assets and therefore no costs are capitalised within property, plant and equipment.
Borrowings can be analysed as follows: 2018 2017 m m Current a, b Securitised debt 86 82 Liquidity facility 147 147 Unsecured revolving credit facilities 6 Total current 233 235 Non-current a, b Securitised debt 1,744 1,827 Total borrowings 1,977 2,062 a.

All of the floating rate notes are hedged using interest rate swaps which fix the interest rate payable.
Interest and margin is payable on the floating rate notes as follows: Tranche Interest Margin A1N 3 month LIBOR 0.45% A3N 3 month US$ LIBOR 0.45% A4 3 month LIBOR 0.58% AB 3 month LIBOR 0.60% C2 3 month LIBOR 1.88% D1 3 month LIBOR 2.13% The overall cash interest rate payable on the loan notes is 6.2% 2017 6.1% after taking account of interest rate hedging and the cost of the provision of a financial guarantee provided by Ambac in respect of the Class A and AB notes.
The securitisation is governed by various covenants, warranties and events of default, many of which apply to Mitchells & Butlers Retail Limited, the Groups main operating subsidiary.
These include covenants regarding the maintenance and disposal of securitised properties and restrictions on its ability to move cash, by way of dividends for example, to other Group companies.
At 29 September 2018, Mitchells & Butlers Retail Limited had cash and cash equivalents of 54m 2017 97m.
Of this amount 1m 2017 1m, representing disposal proceeds, was held on deposit in an account over which there are a number of restrictions.
The use of this cash requires the approval of the securitisation trustee and may only be used for certain specified purposes such as capital enhancement expenditure and business acquisitions.
The carrying value of the securitised debt in the Group balance sheet is analysed as follows: 2018 2017 m m Principal outstanding at beginning of period 1,911 1,998 Principal repaid during the period 82 77 Exchange on translation of dollar loan notes 3 10 Principal outstanding at end of period 1,832 1,911 Deferred issue costs 5 6 Accrued interest 3 4 Carrying value at end of period 1,830 1,909 Liquidity facility Under the terms of the securitisation, the Group holds a liquidity facility of 295m provided by two counterparties.
As a result of the decrease in credit rating of one of the counterparties, the Group was obliged to draw that counterpartys portion of the facility during the 52 weeks ended 27 September 2014.
The amount drawn at 29 September 2018 is 147m 2017 147m.
These funds are charged under the terms of the securitisation and are not available for use in the wider Group.
The facility, which is not available for any other purpose, is sized to cover 18 months debt service.
Unsecured revolving credit facilities The Group holds three unsecured committed revolving credit facilities of 50m each, and uncommitted revolving credit facilities of 15m, available for general corporate purposes.

Financial assets All financial assets are recognised or derecognised on a trade date where the purchase or sale of a financial asset is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within the timeframe established by the market concerned.
Financial assets are initially measured at fair value, plus transaction costs, except for those financial assets classified as at fair value through profit or loss, which are initially measured at fair value.
Financial assets are classified into the following specified categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL : derivative instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships: held-to-maturity investments: available-for-sale AFS financial assets: and loans and receivables.
The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
Impairment of financial assets Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the instrument have been affected.
For certain categories of financial assets, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are, in addition, assessed for impairment on a collective basis.
Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include the Groups past experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the agreed credit period, as well as observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account.
When a trade receivable is considered uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account.
Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss to the extent that the carrying amount of the investment at the date the impairment is reversed does not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are classified as either borrowings at amortised cost or other financial liabilities.
The borrowings accounting policy is provided in note 4.2.
Other financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity.
If the Group does not retain substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership but continues to control a transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay.
If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Groups obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired.
The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability discharged and the consideration paid and payable is recognised in profit or loss.
Effective interest method The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a debt instrument and of allocating finance charges over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash flows including all fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts over the expected life of the debt instrument, or where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Finance charges are recognised on an effective interest basis for all debt instruments.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group uses interest rate and currency swap contracts to hedge its exposure to changes in interest rates and exchange rates.
These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and hedge accounting is applied where the necessary criteria under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement are met.
Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading or speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date, and are re-measured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates.
Fair value is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows at a rate that reflects the credit risk of various counterparties.
Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of highly probable future cash flows are recognised in equity.
The cumulative gain or loss is transferred from equity and recognised in the income statement at the same time as the hedged transaction affects profit or loss.
The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised in the income statement immediately.
128 Mitchells & Butlers plc  STRATEGIC REPORT 1 TO 45 GOVERNANCE 46 TO 91 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 92 TO 147 OTHER INFORMATION 148 TO 152 Movements in the fair value of derivative instruments which do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement immediately.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point, the cumulative gain or loss in equity remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction affects profit or loss.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement immediately.
Financial risk management Financial risk is managed by the Groups Treasury function.
The Groups Treasury function is governed by a Board Approved Treasury Policy Statement which details the key objectives and policies for the Groups treasury management.
The Treasury Committee ensures that the Treasury Policy is adhered to, monitors its operation and agrees appropriate strategies for recommendation to the Board.
The Treasury Policy Statement is reviewed annually, with recommendations for change made to the Board, as appropriate.
The Group Treasury function is operated as a cost centre and is the only area of the business permitted to transact treasury deals.
It must also be consulted on other related matters such as the provision of guarantees or the financial implications of contract terms.
An explanation of the Groups financial instrument risk management objectives and strategies is set out below.
The main financial risks which impact the Group result from funding and liquidity risk, credit risk, capital risk and market risk, principally as a result of changes in interest and currency rates.
Derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate and foreign currency swaps, are used to manage market risk.
Funding and liquidity risk In order to ensure that the Groups long-term funding strategy is aligned with its strategic objectives, the Treasury Committee regularly assesses the maturity profile of the Groups debt, alongside the prevailing financial projections.
This enables it to ensure that funding levels are appropriate to support the Groups plans.
The current funding arrangements of the Group consist of the securitised notes issued by Mitchells & Butlers Finance plc and associated liquidity facility along with three committed unsecured revolving credit facilities of 50m each.
The terms of the securitisation and the revolving credit facilities contain various financial covenants.
Compliance with these covenants is monitored by Group Treasury.
The Group also has uncommitted revolving credit facilities of 15m.
The Group prepares a rolling daily cash forecast covering a six week period and an annual cash forecast by period.
These forecasts are reviewed on a daily basis and are used to manage the investment and borrowing requirements of the Group.
A combination of cash pooling and zero balancing agreements are in place to ensure the optimum liquidity position is maintained.
The Group maintains sufficient cash balances or committed facilities outside the securitisation to ensure that it can meet its medium-term anticipated cash flow requirements.
The maturity table below details the contractual undiscounted cash flows both principal and interest for the Groups financial liabilities, after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps.

 Mitchells & Butlers plc 129 Notes to the financial statements Section 4 Capital structure and financing costs continued 4.4 Financial instruments continued Credit risk The Group Treasury function enters into contracts with third parties in respect of derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes and the investment of surplus funds.
These activities expose the Group to credit risk against the counterparties.
To mitigate this exposure, Group Treasury operates policies that restrict the investment of surplus funds and the entering into of derivative transactions to counterparties that have a minimum credit rating of A long-term and A1 P1 F1 short-term.
Counterparties may also be required to post collateral with the Group, where their credit rating falls below a predetermined level.
The amount that can be invested or transacted at various ratings levels is restricted under the policy.
To minimise credit risk exposure against individual counterparties, investments and derivative transactions are entered into with a range of counterparties.
The Group Treasury function reviews credit ratings, as published by Moodys, Standard & Poors and Fitch Ratings, current exposure levels and the maximum permitted exposure at given credit ratings, for each counterparty on a daily basis.
Any exceptions are required to be formally reported to the Treasury Committee on a four-weekly basis.
Included in other receivables are amounts due from certain Group suppliers.
Included in trade and other payables at the period end are amounts due to some of these suppliers.
This reduces the Groups credit exposure.
The Groups credit exposure at the balance sheet date was: 2018 2017 m m Cash and cash equivalents 122 147 Other cash deposits 120 120 Trade receivables 7 5 Other receivables 14 15 Derivatives 48 43 Capital management The Groups capital base is comprised of its net debt analysed in note 4.1 plus total equity disclosed on the face of the Group balance sheet.
The objective is to maintain a capital base which is sufficiently strong to support the ongoing development of the business as a going concern, including the amenity, and cash flow generation of the pub estate.
By keeping debt and headroom against its debt facilities at an appropriate level, the Group ensures that it maintains a strong credit position, whilst maximising value for shareholders and adhering to its covenants and other restrictions associated with its debt see note 4.2.
In managing its capital structure, from time to time the Group may realise value from non-core assets, buy back or issue new shares, initiate and vary its dividend payments and seek to vary or accelerate debt repayments.
The Groups policy is to ensure that the maturity of its debt profile supports its strategic objectives.
The Board considers the latest covenant compliance, headroom projections and projected balance sheet positions periodically throughout the year, based on the advice of the Treasury Committee which meets on a four-weekly basis.
The Treasury Committee is chaired by the Group Treasurer and monitors Treasury performance and compliance with Board-approved policies.
The Group Finance Director is also a member of the Committee.
Total capital at the balance sheet date is as follows: 2018 2017 m m Net debt note 4.1 1,688 1,750 Total equity 1,769 1,626 Total capital 3,457 3,376 Market risk The Group is exposed to the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of its financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
Market risk comprises foreign currency and interest rate risk.
Foreign currency risk The Group faces currency risk in two main areas: At issuance of the Class A3N floating rate notes, the Group entered into a cross currency interest rate swap to manage the foreign currency exposure resulting from both the US$ principal and initial interest elements of the notes.
The A3N notes have a carrying value of 212m 2017 222m and form part of the securitised debt see note 4.2.
Sensitivity analysis Further to the step-up on the A3N notes on 15 December 2010, the Group has additional foreign currency exposure as a result of the increase in US$ finance costs.
A movement of 10% in the US$ exchange rate would have a nil 2017 nil impact on the reported Group profit and a 21m 2017 22m impact on the reported Group net assets.
The Group has no significant profit and loss exposure as a result of retranslating monetary assets and liabilities at different exchange rates.
As the Group is predominantly UK based and acquires the majority of its supplies in sterling, it has no significant direct currency exposure from its operations.
130 Mitchells & Butlers plc  STRATEGIC REPORT 1 TO 45 GOVERNANCE 46 TO 91 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 92 TO 147 OTHER INFORMATION 148 TO 152 Interest rate risk The Group has a mixture of fixed and floating interest rate debt instruments and manages the variability in cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates by using derivative financial instruments.
Where the necessary criteria are met, the Group minimises the volatility in its financial statements through the adoption of the hedge accounting provisions permitted under IAS 39.
The interest rate exposure resulting from the Groups 1.9bn securitisation is largely fixed, either as a result of the notes themselves being issued at fixed interest rates, or through a combination of floating rate notes against which effective interest rate swaps are held, which are eligible for hedge accounting.
Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis below has been calculated based on the Groups exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative instruments as at the balance sheet date.
A 1% movement is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.
For floating rate liabilities, which are not hedged by derivative instruments, the analysis has been prepared assuming that the liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole period.
For interest income the analysis assumes that cash and cash equivalents and other cash deposits that were held in interest bearing accounts at the balance sheet date were held for the whole period.
The Groups sensitivity to a 1% movement in interest rates is detailed below: 2018 2017 m m a Interest income 2 2 b Interest expense 1 2 Profit impact 1 c Derivative financial instruments fair values 76 86 Total equity 77 86 a.
Represents interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents and other cash deposits these are defined in note 4.1. b.
The element of interest expense which is not matched by payments and receipts under cash flow hedges which would otherwise offset the interest rate exposure of the Group.
c. The impact on total equity from movements in the fair value of cash flow hedges.
Derivative financial instruments Cash flow hedges Changes in cash flow hedge fair values are recognised in the hedging reserve in equity to the extent that the hedges are effective.
The cash flow hedges detailed below have been assessed as being highly effective during the period and are expected to remain highly effective over the remaining contract lives.
During the period a gain of 16m 2017 gain of 60m on cash flow hedges was recognised in equity.
A loss of 34m 2017 loss of 53m was recycled from equity and included in the Group income statement for the period.
Cash flow hedges securitised borrowings At 29 September 2018, the Group held ten 2017 ten interest rate swap contracts with a nominal value of 931m 2017 963m, designated as a hedge of the cash flow interest rate risk of 931m 2017 963m of the Groups floating rate borrowings, comprising the A1N, A3N, A4, AB, C2 and D1 loan notes.
The cash flows on these contracts occur quarterly, receiving a floating rate of interest based on LIBOR and paying a fixed rate of 4.8483% 2017 4.8558%.
The contract maturity dates match those of the hedged item.
The ten interest rate swaps are held on the balance sheet at fair market value, which is a liability of 244m 2017 292m.
At 29 September 2018 the Group held one 2017 one cross currency interest rate swap contract, with a nominal value of 165m 2017 177m, designated as a hedge of the cash flow interest rate and currency risk of the Groups A3N floating rate US$276m 2017 US$297m borrowings.
The cross currency interest rate swap is held on the balance sheet at a fair value asset of 48m 2017 43m.
The cash flows on this contract occur quarterly, receiving a floating rate of interest based on US$ LIBOR and paying a floating rate of interest at LIBOR in sterling.
The cash flows arising from interest rate swap positions on the same counterparty may be settled as a net position.
The cross currency interest rate swap is held under a separate agreement and cash movements for this instrument are settled individually.

As the securitised debt is traded on an active market, the market value represents the fair value of this debt.
The fair value of interest rate and currency swaps is the estimated amount which the Group could expect to pay or receive on termination of the agreements.
These amounts are based on quotations from counterparties which approximate to their fair market value and take into consideration interest and exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Other financial assets and liabilities are either short-term in nature or their book values approximate to fair values.

IFRS 13 Financial Instruments requires the Groups derivative financial instruments to be disclosed at fair value and categorised in three levels according to the inputs used in the calculation of their fair value: Level 1 instruments use quoted prices as the input to fair value calculations: Level 2 instruments use inputs, other than quoted prices, that are observable either directly or indirectly: Level 3 instruments use inputs that are unobservable.
The table below sets out the valuation basis of financial instruments held at fair value by the Group: Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Fair value at 29 September 2018 m m m m Financial assets: Currency swaps 48 48 Financial liabilities: Interest rate swaps 244 244 196 196 Level1 Level2 Level3 Total  m m m m Financial assets: Currency swaps 43 43 Financial liabilities: Interest rate swaps 292 292 249 249 4.5 Pensions Accounting policy Retirement and death benefits are provided for eligible employees in the United Kingdom principally by the Mitchells & Butlers Pension Plan MABPP and the Mitchells & Butlers Executive Pension Plan MABEPP.
These plans are funded, HMRC approved, occupational pension schemes with defined contribution and defined benefit sections.
The defined benefit section of the plans is now closed to future service accrual.
The defined benefit liability relates to these funded plans, together with an unfunded unapproved pension arrangement the Executive Top-Up Scheme, or MABETUS in respect of certain MABEPP members.
The assets of the plans are held in self-administered trust funds separate from the Companys assets.
In addition, Mitchells & Butlers plc also provides a workplace pension plan in line with the Workplace Pensions Reform Regulations.
This automatically enrols all eligible workers into a Qualifying Workplace Pension Plan.
As the Company do not have an unconditional right to recover any surplus from the pension plans, IFRIC 14 requires the minimum funding liability to be recognised, where it is in excess of the actuarial liability.
As such, the total pension liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the Groups defined benefit arrangements is the greater of the minimum funding requirements, calculated as the present value of the agreed schedule of contributions, and the actuarial calculated liability.
The actuarial liability is the present value of the defined benefit obligation, less the fair value of the scheme assets.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method as determined annually by qualified actuaries.
This is based on a number of financial assumptions and estimates, the determination of which may be significant to the balance sheet valuation in the event that this reflects a greater deficit than that suggested by the schedule of minimum contributions.
There is no current service cost as all defined benefit schemes are closed to future accrual.
The net pension finance charge, calculated by applying the discount rate to the pension deficit or surplus at the beginning of the period, is shown within finance income or expense.
The administration costs of the scheme are recognised within operating costs in the income statement.
Remeasurement comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of minimum funding requirements, and the return on scheme assets are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit to the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Curtailments and settlements relating to the Groups defined benefit plan are recognised in the income statement in the period in which the curtailment or settlement occurs.
For the defined contribution arrangements, the charge against profit is equal to the amount of contributions payable for that period.
Critical accounting judgements The calculation of the defined benefit liability requires management judgement to select an appropriate high-quality corporate bond to determine the discount rate.
The most significant criteria considered for the selection of bonds include the rating of the bonds and the currency and estimated term of the retirement benefit liabilities.
In addition, management have used judgement to determine the applicable rate of inflation to apply to pension increases in calculating the defined benefit obligation.
Details of this are given below.
 Mitchells & Butlers plc 133 Notes to the financial statements Section 4 Capital structure and financing costs continued 4.5 Pensions continued Measurement of scheme assets and liabilities Actuarial valuation The actuarial valuations used for IAS 19 revised purposes are based on the results of the latest full actuarial valuation carried out at 31 March 2016 and updated by the schemes independent qualified actuaries to 29 September 2018.
Scheme assets are stated at market value at 29 September 2018 and the liabilities of the schemes have been assessed as at the same date using the projected unit method.
IAS 19 revised requires that the scheme liabilities are discounted using market yields at the end of the period on high-quality corporate bonds.
In relation to the MABPP, the Trust Deed and Rules provide that it is a matter for the Company to determine the rate of inflation which should be applied to pension increases for certain sections of the membership in excess of guaranteed minimum pensions and the Company has instructed the Trustee to apply CPI subject to certain caps in respect of such increases.
The Trustee believes that this power was incorrectly vested in the Company in the Trust Deed and Rules of the MABPP in 1996 and, despite it being reflected in further versions, has made an application to court for those various Trust Deeds and Rules to be rectified.
The hearing is expected to be held in late 2019.
The actuarial surplus as determined under IAS 19 revised has continued to be calculated using RPI, pending final resolution of the matter.
The applicable rate of CPI at 29 September 2018 is 2.2%.
Leaving all other principal financial assumptions constant, the impact of this change on the defined benefit obligation as measured under IAS 19 revised is estimated to be 150m.
However under IFRIC 14 an additional liability is recognised such that the total balance sheet position reflects the schedule of contributions agreed by the Company, extending to 2023.
As such should the Company be successful in contesting the application there will be no necessary movement in the total balance sheet position.
The principal financial assumptions have been updated to reflect changes in market conditions in the period and are as follows: 2018 2017 Executive Executive Main plan plan Mainplan plan Discount rate 2.9% 2.9% 2.7% 2.7% Pensions increases RPI max 5% 3.0% 3.0% 3.1% 3.1% Inflation rate RPI 3.2% 3.2% 3.2% 3.2% The discount rate is based on a yield curve for AA corporate rated bonds which are consistent with the currency and estimated term of retirement benefit liabilities.
The mortality assumptions were reviewed following the 2016 actuarial valuation.
A summary of the average life expectancies assumed is as follows: 2018 2017 Executive Executive Main plan plan Mainplan plan years years years years Male member aged 65 current life expectancy 21.2 23.9 21.2 23.8 Male member aged 45 life expectancy at 65 23.0 25.6 22.9 25.5 Female member aged 65 current life expectancy 23.6 26.0 23.6 25.9 Female member aged 45 life expectancy at 65 25.5 27.9 25.4 27.8 Minimum funding requirements The results of the 2016 actuarial valuation showed a funding deficit of 451m, using a more prudent basis to discount the scheme liabilities than is required by IAS 19 revised.
The Company has subsequently agreed recovery plans for both the Executive and Main schemes in order to close the funding deficit in respect of its pension liabilities.
The new recovery plans show an unchanged level of cash contributions with no extension to the agreed payment term 45m per annum indexed with RPI from 1 April 2016 subject to a minimum increase of 0% and maximum of 5%, until 31 March 2023.
Under IFRIC 14, an additional liability is recognised, such that the overall pension liability at the period end reflects the schedule of contributions in relation to a minimum funding requirement, should this be higher than the actuarial deficit.
The employer contributions expected to be paid during the financial period ending 28 September 2019 amount to 49m.
In 2024, an additional payment of 13m will be made into escrow, should such further funding be required at that time.
This is a contingent liability and is not reflected in the pensions liability as it is not committed.
134 Mitchells & Butlers plc  STRATEGIC REPORT 1 TO 45 GOVERNANCE 46 TO 91 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 92 TO 147 OTHER INFORMATION 148 TO 152 Sensitivity to changes in actuarial assumptions The sensitivities regarding principal actuarial assumptions, assessed in isolation, that have been used to measure the scheme liabilities are set out below.

In presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the statement of financial position.
There have been no changes in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis from prior periods.
Principal risks and assumptions The defined benefit schemes are not exposed to any unusual, entity specific or scheme specific risks but there are general risks: Inflation the majority of the plans obligations are linked to inflation.
Higher inflation will lead to increased liabilities which is partially offset by the plans holding inflation linked gilts and other inflation linked assets.
Interest rate The plans liabilities are determined using discount rates derived from yields on AA-rated corporate bonds.
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities though this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the bonds held by the plans.
Mortality The majority of the obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the members and their partners, so any increase in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans liabilities.
Asset returns Assets held by the pension plans are invested in a diversified portfolio of equities, bonds and other assets.
Volatility in asset values will lead to movements in the net deficit surplus reported in the consolidated balance sheet for the plans which in addition will also impact the pension finance charge in the consolidated income statement.

Virtually all equity instruments, bonds and gold have quoted prices in active markets and are classified as Level 1 instruments.
Absolute return bond funds, gilt repurchase transactions and forward foreign exchange contracts are classified as Level 2 instruments.
Real estate debt and infrastructure debt are classified as Level 3 instruments.
In the 52 weeks ended 29 September 2018 the Group paid 7m 2017 7m in respect of the defined contribution arrangements, with an additional 2m 2017 1m outstanding as at the period end.
At 29 September 2018 the MABPP owed 1m 2017 2m to the Group in respect of expenses paid on its behalf.
This amount is included in other receivables in note 3.2.
4.6 Share-based payments Accounting policy The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based compensation plans, whereby, subject to meeting any relevant conditions, employees are awarded shares or rights over shares.
The cost of such awards is measured at fair value, excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions, on the date of grant.
The expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period and is adjusted for the estimated effect of non market-based vesting conditions and forfeitures, on the number of shares that will eventually vest due to employees leaving the employment of the Group.
Fair values are calculated using either the Black-Scholes, Binomial or Monte Carlo simulation models depending on the conditions attached to the particular share scheme.
SAYE share options granted to employees are treated as cancelled when employees cease to contribute to the scheme.
This results in an accelerated recognition of the expense that would have arisen over the remainder of the original vesting period.
Schemes in operation The net charge recognised for share-based payments in the period was 3m 2017 2m.
The Group had four equity-settled share schemes 2017 four in operation during the period: the Performance Restricted Share Plan PRSP : Sharesave Plan: Share Incentive Plan SIP and Short Term Deferred Incentive Plan STDIP.
The vesting of all awards or options is generally dependent upon participants remaining in the employment of a participating company during the vesting period.
Further details on each scheme are provided in the Report on Directors remuneration on pages 68 to 91.
The following tables set out weighted average information about how the fair value of each option grant was calculated: 2018 2017 Performance Performance Restricted Sharesave Restricted Sharesave Share Plan Plan SharePlan Plan Valuation model Monte Carlo and Monte Carlo and Binomial Black-Scholes Binomial Black-Scholes Weighted average share price 259.2p 264.2p 246.1p 231.0p a Exercise price 246.0p 221.0p b Expected dividend yield 1.97% 2.94% Risk-free interest rate 0.68% 0.86% 0.34% 0.31% c Volatility 32.5% 31.0% 32.0% 29.43% d Expected life years 2.4 4.0 3.5 4.10 Weighted average fair value of grants during the period 224.2 61.3 182.4 42.8 a.
The exercise price for the Performance Restricted Share Plan is 1 per participating employee.
The expected dividend yield for the Sharesave Plan has used historical dividend information.
For details on the Groups current dividend policy refer to the Financial review on page 45.
The expected dividend yield for the Performance Restricted Share Plan options is zero as participants are entitled to Dividend Accrued Shares to the value of ordinary dividends paid or payable during the vesting period.
c. The expected volatility is determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price commensurate with the expected term of the options and share awards.
d. The expected life of the options represents the average length of time between grant date and exercise date.
The fair value of awards under the Short Term Deferred Incentive Plan and the Share Incentive Plan are equal to the share price on the date of award as there is no price to be paid and employees are entitled to Dividend Accrued Shares to the value of ordinary dividends paid or payable during the vesting period.
The assumptions set out above are therefore not relevant to these schemes.
The fair value of options granted under the Share Incentive Plan during the period was 264.2p 2017 231.0p.

Dividends Dividends proposed by the Board but unpaid at the period end are not recognised in the financial statements until they have been approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
Scrip dividends are fully paid up from the share premium account.
They are accounted for as an increase in share capital for the nominal value of the shares issued, and a resulting reduction in share premium.

The Company has established two employee share trusts: Share Incentive Plan SIP Trust The SIP Trust was established in 2003 to purchase shares on behalf of employees participating in the Companys Share Incentive Plan.
Under this scheme, eligible employees are awarded free shares which are normally held in trust for a holding period of at least three years.
After five years the shares may be transferred to or sold by the employee free of income tax and National Insurance contributions.
The SIP Trust buys the shares in the market or subscribes for newly issued shares with funds provided by the Company.
During the holding period, dividends are paid directly to the participating employees.
At 29 September 2018, the trustees, Equiniti Share Plan Trustees Limited, held 1,847,623 2017 1,698,880 shares in the Company.
