Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information 163 Notes to the Parent Company Accounts Share-based compensation The Company operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans.
The economic cost of awarding shares and share options to employees is recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account equivalent to the fair value of the benefit awarded.
The fair value of options over the Companys shares awarded to employees of subsidiary companies is treated as a capital contribution, resulting in an increase in investments.
The fair value is determined by reference to option pricing models, principally Monte Carlo and adjusted Black-Scholes models.
The charge is recognised in the profit and loss account over the vesting period of the award.
At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimate of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
Any revision to the original estimates is reflected in the profit and loss account with a corresponding adjustment to equity immediately to the extent it relates to past service and the remainder over the rest of the vesting period.
Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
See Note D1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for details of dividends paid in the year.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The Company makes certain estimates and assumptions regarding the future.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
In the future, actual experience may differ from these estimates and assumptions.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are shown below please refer to the notes in the consolidated financial statements for further detail.
Sensitivities to the estimates and assumptions are provided, where relevant, in the relevant notes to the consolidated accounts.
