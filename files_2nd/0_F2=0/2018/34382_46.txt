9 Pensions The British Land Group of Companies Pension Scheme the scheme is the principal defined benefit pension scheme in the Group.
The assets of the scheme are held in a trustee-administered fund and kept separate from those of the Company.
It is not contracted out of SERPS State Earnings-Related Pension Scheme and it is not planned to admit new employees to the scheme.
The Group has three other small defined benefit pension schemes.
There is also a Defined Contribution Pension Scheme.
Contributions to this scheme are at a flat rate of 15% of salary for non-Directors and are paid by the Company.
The total net pension cost charged for the year was 7m 2016 17: 7m, of which 5m 2016 17: 4m relates to defined contribution plans and 2m 2016 17: 3m relates to the current service cost of the defined benefit schemes.
A full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out at 31 March 2015 by consulting actuaries, AON Hewitt Associates Ltd.
The employers contributions will be paid in the future at the rate recommended by the actuary of 72.9% per annum of basic salaries.
The best estimate of employer contributions expected to be paid during the year to 31 March 2019 is 5m.
The major assumptions used for the actuarial valuation were: 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa Discount rate 2.6 2.4 3.2 3.1 4.4 Salary inflation 4.9 4.9 4.8 4.8 5.2 Pensions increase 3.3 3.3 3.2 3.2 3.5 Price inflation 3.4 3.4 3.3 3.3 3.7 The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements.
The assumptions are that a member currently aged 60 will live on average for a further 28.8 years if they are male and for a further 30.5 years if they are female.
For a member who retires in 2038 at age 60, the assumptions are that they will live on average for a further 30.4 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 31.6 years after retirement if they are female.

The scheme holds a significant portion of growth assets equities and diversified growth funds which, although expected tooutperform corporate bonds in the long term, create volatility and risk in the short term.
The allocation to growth assets is monitored toensure it remains appropriate given the schemes long term objectives.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the schemes liabilities for accounting purposes, although this will bepartially offset by an increase in the value of the schemes bond holdings.
Inflation risk The majority of the schemes benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation.
The majority of the assets are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
Life expectancy The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result inanincrease in the liabilities.
