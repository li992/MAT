c Fair value of financial instruments IFRS 13 requires an entity to classify fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that re ects the signi cance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
The fair value hierarchy has the following classi cations: Level 1 valued using quoted prices in active markets for identical investments.
Level 2 valued using other signi cant observable inputs including quoted prices for similar investments, interest rates, prepayments, credit risk, etc.
There are no level 2 financial assets 2017: nil.
Level 3 valued using signi cant unobservable inputs including the Companys own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments.
There are no level 3 financial assets 2017: nil.
All of the Companys investments are in quoted securities actively traded on recognised stock exchanges, with their fair value being determined by reference to their quoted bid prices at the reporting date.
The total value of the investments of 905,125,000 2017: 1,035,670,000 has therefore been determined as Level 1.
Please refer to Note 22 on page 50 for the disclosure and fair value categorisation of the financial liabilities.
