Notes on the accounts for the year ended 31st March 2018 3 Effect of exchange rate changes on translation of foreign subsidiaries sales excluding precious metals and underlying operating profit continued The group believes that sales excluding precious metals is a better measure of the underlying performance of the group than revenue.
Total revenue can be heavily distorted by year on year fluctuations in the market prices of precious metals.
In addition, in many cases, the value of precious metals is passed directly on to our customers.
Underlying profit and earnings are measures that the group believes provide a better guide to the underlying performance of the group.
These measures exclude amortisation of acquired intangibles, major impairment and restructuring charges, profit or loss on disposal of businesses, gain or loss on significant legal proceedings together with associated legal costs, significant tax rates changes and, where relevant, related tax effects, and are reconciled to their equivalent GAAP measures in note 4.
