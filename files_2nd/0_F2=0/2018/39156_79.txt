102 PZ Cussons Plc Governance and Financial Statements 2018 Financial Statements Notes to the Company Financial Statements continued 1.
Accounting policies continued Critical accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty Estimates and accounting judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The preparation of Financial Statements under IFRS requires management to make assumptions and estimates about future events.
The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, differ from the actual results.
In the course of preparing the Companys Financial Statements, no key source of estimation uncertainty has been identified.
The critical judgements required when preparing the Companys Financial Statements are as follows: Carrying value of investments in subsidiaries Annually the Directors consider whether there are any indicators of impairment that may suggest that the recoverable amount of the Companys investments in subsidiaries is less than their carrying amount.
The assessment of impairment indicators requires management to apply judgement in assessing current and forecast trading performance as well as assessing the impact of principal risks and uncertainties specific to the investments it holds.
Details of the Companys investments are set out in Note 4 and in the current year the Directors have concluded that no indicators of impairment existed.
