The recoverable amounts have been determined based on fair value less costs of disposal using discounted cash flow projections.
The key assumptions used in determining the recoverable amounts are set out in note 7.
Management believes that any reasonably possible change in a key assumption on which the recoverable amounts are based would not cause the carrying amounts to exceed their recoverable amounts.
