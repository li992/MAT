Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information 31 Accounting policy changes and regional restructure Revisions to previously issued consolidated financial statements Adoption of IFRS 15 With effect from 1 January 2018, the Group has adopted IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
In the 2018 financial statements the Group has fully revised prior periods, as permitted by the Standard, to ensure comparability of the income statement across prior periods.
This standard requires certain payments to indirect customers, previously shown as marketing expenses, to be shown as deductions from revenue.
This has reduced previously reported revenue for the year ended 31 December 2017 by 664 million 2016: 621 million, with a corresponding reduction in operating costs.
In addition, due to the timing of the recognition of certain payments to indirect customers, previously reported revenue and operating profit for the twelve months ended 31 December 2017 has been reduced by a further 64 million 2016: nil million.
The impact on the Group Balance Sheet is disclosed below.
In addition the above has also had an incidental impact on revenue policy included in note 1, note 2, note 6, note 7, note 13, note 19, note 22, note 29 and note 30 a.
Segment revision In connection with the acquisition of RAI, the Group has revised its organisational structure.
RAI is reported as a separate region United States.
The markets which previously comprised EEMEA merged with the Americas, Western Europe and Asia-Pacific to form three new regions.
The markets in the Middle East merged with Asia-Pacific to form the Asia-Pacific and Middle East region APME.
The markets in East and Central Africa, West Africa and Southern Africa merged with the Americas region to form the Americas and Sub-Saharan Africa region AMSSA.
The markets in Russia, Ukraine, Caucasus, Central Asia, Belarus, Turkey and North Africa merged with the Western Europe region to form the Europe and North Africa region ENA.
Accordingly the following disclosures have been revised in these consolidated financials: Note 2 Segmental analyses Note 9 Intangible assets Note 26 Group employees Adoption of new accounting standards effective 1 January 2018 Adoption of IFRS 9 In addition, with effect from 1 January 2018, the Group has adopted IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with no restatement of prior periods, as permitted by the Standard.
The cumulative impact of adopting the Standard, including the effect of tax entries, has been recognised as a restatement of opening reserves in 2018, and is 38 million, arising from the impairment of financial assets under the expected loss model.
A simplified lifetime expected loss model is available for balances arising as a result of revenue recognition, by applying a standard rate of provision on initial recognition of trade debtors based upon the Groups historical experience of credit loss modified by expectations of the future, and increasing this provision to take account of overdue receivables.
Applying the requirements of IFRS 9 has resulted in a decrease of trade and other debtors of 45 million as at 1 January 2018.
IFRS 9 also changes the classification and measurement of financial assets.
The category of available-for-sale investments where fair value changes were deferred in reserves until disposal of the investment has been replaced with the category of financial assets at Fair Value through Profit and Loss for most investments and the category of financial assets at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income for qualifying equity investments, and the available-for-sale reserve at 1 January 2018 has been reclassified into retained earnings.
In addition, certain loans and receivables which do not meet the measurement tests for amortised cost classification under IFRS 9 have been reclassified as financial assets at Fair Value through Profit and Loss at the same date.
The Group has used the term investments held at fair value to refer to all of these financial assets both preand postthe adoption of IFRS 9.

The distinction between operating leases and finance leases is removed with the effect that virtually all leasing arrangements will be brought on to the balance sheet as financial obligations and right-to-use assets.
In adopting IFRS 16, the Group will apply the modified retrospective approach consistently across the Group, with no restatement of prior periods, as permitted by the Standard.
On the initial implementation of the Standard, previously recognised operating leases will be capitalised as right-to-use assets and financial liabilities will be recognised at the same initial value.
The Group will take advantage of certain practical expedients available under the Standard including: grandfathering previously recognised lease arrangements: applying a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics: assessing whether a lease is onerous prior to applying the Standard: applying hindsight in determining the lease term if the contract contains options to extend or terminate the lease: and not applying the capitalisation requirements of the Standard to leases for which the lease term ends within 12 months of the date of initial application.
234 BAT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2018 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information 31 Accounting policy changes and regional restructure continued Going forward, the Group will also adopt several practical expedients under the Standard including: not applying the requirements of IFRS 16 to leases of intangible assets: applying the portfolio approach where appropriate to do so: not applying the recognition and measurement requirements of IFRS 16 to short-term leases and to leases of low-value assets: and not separating non-lease components from lease components except in the case of property-related leases.
The anticipated impact of the new Standard to the Groups balance sheet at 1 January 2019, and a reconciliation to reported leasing commitments in note 28, is shown below: m Minimum lease commitments as disclosed in note 28 690 Additional commitments on the exercise of options 28 Low value leases and short-term leases excluded 24 Discounted to present value 132 To be capitalised as lease liabilities at 1 January 2019 562 Prepaid leases reclassified from receivables 3 To be capitalised as righttouse assets at 1 January 2019 565 The weighted average incremental borrowing rate applied in discounting lease commitments was 5.76%.
