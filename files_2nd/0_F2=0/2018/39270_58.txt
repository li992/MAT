Business combinations All business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method acquisition accounting in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
The cost of a business combination is the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the acquirer.
The cost of a business combination is allocated at the acquisition date by recognising the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that satisfy the recognition criteria at their fair values.
The acquisition date is the date on which the acquirer effectively obtains control of the acquiree.
An intangible asset is recognised if it meets the definition of an intangible asset under IAS 38 Intangible Assets.
The intangible assets arising on acquisition are goodwill, customer lists and relationships, and brands.
Goodwill represents the synergies, workforce and other benefits expected as a result of combining the respective businesses.
Customer lists and relationships and brands are recognised at their fair value at the date of acquisition using an income-based approach, which involves the use of assumptions including customer termination, profit margins and discount rates.
The use of these assumptions requires estimation in the valuation approach.
Deferred and contingent consideration is accounted for at fair value at the acquisition date with subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration being recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Costs directly attributable to business combinations are charged to the income statement as incurred and presented as one-off items.
