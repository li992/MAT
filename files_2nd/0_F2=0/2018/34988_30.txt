IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts, cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps to hedge the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
As explained in section Q of the Groups accounting policies, such derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date, and are remeasured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates.
For derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to the consolidated income statement in the period.
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT All derivative financial instruments are shown at fair value in the balance sheet.
All the derivatives held by the Group at fair value are considered to have fair values determined by Level 2 inputs as defined by the fair value hierarchy of IFRS 13 Fair value measurement.
Thefair values of derivative financial instruments represent the maximum credit exposure.

Overseas tax is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
The impact of changes in statutory rates relates principally to the reduction of the federal tax rate in the United States from 35% to 21% from 1 January 2018 following the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
US federal deferred taxes as at 30 September 2018 have been calculated at 21%.
The impact of the reduction in tax rate on deferred tax assets and liabilities through the income statement is not significant but there is a resulting one off charge of 13 million to other comprehensive income in respect of deferred tax assets arising on postemployment benefits.
The income tax effects of the adjustments between statutory and underlying results are shown in note 32 to the consolidated financial statements.
There is no difference between the statutory and underlying cash tax paid of 349 million 2017: statutory and underlying 357million.

These intra-group arrangements provide a benefit to the Groups effective tax rate.
Prior year items relate to the reassessment of prior year tax estimates and the resolution of open items.
The global nature of the Groups operations gives rise to several factors which could affect the future tax rate.
These include the mix of profits, changes to statutory tax rates or tax legislation and the foreign exchange rates applicable when those profits are translated into sterling.
In addition, the future tax charge may be affected by the impact of acquisitions, disposals or other restructurings and the resolution of open issues with tax authorities.
Tax uncertainties and associated risks are increasing for all multi-national groups as a consequence of changes to local and international tax rules.
Tax risk can arise from unclear regulations and differences in interpretation, but most significantly where tax authorities apply diverging standards in assessing intra-group cross-border transactions.
The Group has recognised potential liabilities in respect of uncertain tax positions as described in section B of the Group accounting policies, none of which is individually material.
In determining such liabilities, having regard to the specific circumstances of each tax position and external advice where appropriate, the Group assesses the range of potential outcomes and estimates whether additional tax may be due.
The Group does not currently anticipate any material changes to the amounts recorded in respect of these liabilities as at 30 September 2018 see also note 26.

After netting off balances within countries, the following are the deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised in the consolidated balance sheet: 2018 2017 NET DEFERRED TAX BALANCE M M Deferred tax assets 45 132 Deferred tax liabilities 49 48 Net deferred tax liability asset 4 84 Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of tax losses of 41 million 2017: 54 million and other temporary differences of 20 million 2017: 23 million.
Of the total tax losses, 26 million 2017: 44 million will expire at various dates between 2019 and 2021.
These deferred tax assets have not been recognised as the timing of recovery is uncertain.
The Group does not recognise any deferred tax liability on temporary differences relating to potentially taxable unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries totalling 474 million 2017: 452 million because it is able to control the timing of reversal of these differences.
It is probable that no reversal will take place in the foreseeable future.
130 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2018 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 6 EARNINGS PER SHARE The calculation of earnings per share is based on earnings after tax and the weighted average number of shares in issue during the period.
The underlying earnings per share figures have been calculated based on earnings excluding the effect of the amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition, acquisition transaction costs, adjustment to contingent consideration on acquisition, non-controlling interest put options, gains and losses on disposal of businesses, hedge accounting ineffectiveness, change in fair value of investments and the tax attributable to these amounts.
These items are excluded in order to show the underlying trading performance of the Group.

Goodwill relating to the Groups geographical segments of Europe and Rest of World has been reclassified to reflect a change in the way those segments are managed by the chief operating decision maker: Turkey is now part of the Rest of World segment.
Goodwill of 68 million has been reclassified from Europe to Rest of World for the year ended 30 September 2017.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amount of a Cash Generating Unit CGU is determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for these calculations are externally derived long term growth rates, pre-tax discount rates and cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and forecasts approved by management covering a five year period.
Budgets and forecasts are based on expectations of future outcomes taking into account past experience, adjusted for anticipated revenue growth, from both new business and like for like growth and taking into consideration external economic factors.
Cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using estimated growth rates based on local expected economic conditions and do not exceed the long term average growth rate for that country.
The pre-tax discount rates are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks relating to the country in which the CGU operates.

This has been based on changes in key assumptions considered to be reasonably possible by management.
The directors do not consider that any reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions would cause the value in use of the net operating assets of the individually significant CGUs disclosed above to fall below their carrying values.

TRADE RECEIVABLES The book value of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value due to the short term nature of the majority of the receivables.
Credit sales are only made after credit approval procedures have been completed satisfactorily.
The policy for making provisions for bad and doubtful debts varies from country to country as different countries and markets have different payment practices, but various factors are considered, including how overdue the debt is, the type of receivable and its past history, and current market and trading conditions.
Full provision is made for debts that are not considered to be recoverable.
There is limited concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables due to the diverse and unrelated nature of the Groups client base.
Accordingly, the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the provision for the impairment of receivables.
The book value of trade and other receivables represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
Trade receivable days at 30 September 2018 were 42 days 2017: 41 days on a constant currency basis.

The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents as disclosed in note 15: debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 16: and equity attributable to equity shareholders of the Parent, comprising issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT The Group continues to manage its interest rate and foreign currency exposure in accordance with the policies set out below.
The Groups financial instruments comprise cash, borrowings, receivables and payables that are used to finance the Groups operations.
The Group also uses derivatives, principally interest rate swaps, forward currency contracts and cross currency swaps, to manage interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments.
The Groups treasury policies are designed to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates and to manage the Groups financial risks.
The Board approves any changes to the policies.
LIQUIDITY RISK Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group finances its operations through cash generated by the business and borrowings from a number of sources including the bank, the public and the private placement markets.
The Group has developed long term relationships with a number of financial counterparties with the balance sheet strength and credit quality to provide credit facilities as required.
The Group seeks to avoid a concentration of debt maturities in any one period to spread its refinancing risk.
The maturity profile of the Groups principal borrowings at 30 September 2018 shows that the average period to maturity is 5.4 years 2017: 5.6 years.
Liquidity risk faced by the Group is mitigated by having diverse sources of finance available to it and by maintaining substantial unutilised committed banking facilities to maintain a level of headroom in line with Board approval.
The level of undrawn facilities is set out in note 16.
FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK The Groups policy is to match its principal projected cash flows by currency to actual or effective borrowings in the same currency.
As currency cash flows are generated, they are used to service and repay debt in the same currency.
Where necessary, to implement this policy, forward currency contracts and cross currency swaps are executed which, when applied to the actual currency liabilities, convert these to the required currency.
The borrowings in each currency can give rise to foreign exchange differences on translation into sterling.
Where the borrowings are less than, or equate to, the net investment in overseas operations, these exchange rate variances are treated as movements on reserves and recorded in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income rather than in the consolidated income statement.
Non-sterling earnings streams are translated at the average rate of exchange for the year.
Fluctuations in exchange rates have given and will continue to give rise to translation differences.
The Group is only partially protected from the impact of such differences through the matching of cash flows to currency borrowings.
The Group has minimal exposure to the foreign currency risk of trade receivables and payables as operations within individual countries have little cross-border activity which might give rise to translation risks on trade related balances.
The main currencies to which the Groups reported sterling financial position is exposed are the US dollar, the euro and the Japanese yen.
As set out above, the Group seeks to hedge its exposure to currencies by matching debt in currency against the cash flows generated by the Groups foreign operations in such currencies.
The effect on profit after tax and equity of a 10% strengthening of sterling against these currencies on the Groups financial statements is shown below.
A 10% weakening would result in an equal and opposite impact on the profit or loss and equity of the Group.
This table shows the impact on the financial instruments in place on 30 September and has been prepared on the basis that the 10% change in exchange rates occurred on the first day of the financial year and applied consistently throughout the year.

The Group implements this policy either by borrowing fixed rate debt or by using interest rate swaps so that the interest rates on at least 80% of the Groups projected debt are fixed for one year, reducing to 60% fixed for the second year and 40% fixed for the third year.
The sensitivity analysis given below has been determined based on the derivative and non-derivative financial instruments the Group had in place at the year end date only.
The effect of a 1% increase in interest rates prevailing at the balance sheet date on the Groups cash and cash equivalents and debt subject to variable rates of interest at the balance sheet date would be a loss of 6 million 2017: loss of 8 million over the course of a year.
A similar 1% decrease in interest rates would result in an equal and opposite effect over the course of a year.

The sensitivity gains and losses given above may vary because cash flows vary throughout the year and interest rate and currency hedging may be implemented after the year end date in order to comply with the treasury policies outlined above.
CREDIT RISK Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
The Groups policy is to minimise its exposure to credit risk from the failure of any single financial counterparty by spreading its risk across a portfolio of financial counterparties and managing the aggregate exposure to each against certain pre-agreed limits.
Exposure to counterparty credit risk arising from deposits and derivatives is concentrated at the Group centre where possible.
Financial counterparty limits are derived from the long and short term credit ratings, and the balance sheet strength of the financial counterparty.
All financial counterparties are required to have a minimum short term credit rating from Moodys of P-1 or equivalent from another recognised agency.
To reduce credit exposures, the Group has International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA Master Agreements with all of its counterparties for financial derivatives, which permit net settlement of assets and liabilities in certain circumstances.
Exposure to counterparty credit risk arising from deposits and derivatives is centralised at the Group centre.
The maximum exposure to credit risk resulting from financial activities, without considering netting arrangements, is equal to the carrying value of the Groups financial assets.
The Groups policy to manage the credit risk associated with trade and other receivables is set out in note 13.
HEDGING ACTIVITIES The following section describes the derivative financial instruments the Group uses to apply the interest rate and foreign currency hedging strategies described above.
FAIR VALUE HEDGES The Group uses interest rate and cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value of fixed rate borrowings.
These instruments swap the fixed interest payable on the borrowings into floating interest rates and hedge the fair value of the borrowings against changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
These swaps all qualify for fair value hedge accounting as defined by IAS 39, some of which are designated in fair value hedge relationships where appropriate.
144 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2018 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 17 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED NET INVESTMENT HEDGES The Group uses foreign currency denominated debt, forward currency contracts and cross currency swaps to partially hedge against the change in the sterling value of its foreign currency denominated net assets due to movements in foreign exchange rates.
The carrying value of debt and derivatives in a net investment hedge was 1,683 million 2017: 1,712 million.
A foreign exchange loss of 73 million 2017: gain of 116 million relating to the net investment hedges has been netted off within currency translation differences as presented on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
DERIVATIVES NOT IN A HEDGING RELATIONSHIP The Group has a number of derivative financial instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting.
These include some interest rate swaps and some forward currency contracts used for interest and cash management.
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT All derivative financial instruments are shown at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet.
Derivative financial instrument fair values are present values determined from future cash flows discounted at rates derived from market sourced data.
There were no transfers between levels in either the year ended 30 September 2018 or 2017.
The fair values of derivative financial instruments represent the maximum credit exposure.

The Group has Supply Chain Financing SCF arrangements in place.
The principal purpose of these arrangements is to enable the supplier, ifit so wishes, to sell its receivables due from the Group to a third party bank prior to their due date, thus providing earlier access to liquidity.
From the Groups perspective, the invoice payment due date remains unaltered and the payment terms for suppliers participating in the SCFprogrammes are similar to those of suppliers that are not participating, and to the wider industry more generally.
If a receivable is purchased by a third party bank, that third party bank does not benefit from additional security when compared to the security originally enjoyed by the supplier.
At 30 September 2018, the value of invoices sold under the SCF programmes was 478 million, with 444 million related to the Groups programme in the USA 2017: 438 million and 403 million respectively.
These amounts are included within trade payables and all cashflows associated with the programme are included within operating cash flows as they continue to be part of the normal operating cycle ofthe Group.

Provisions in respect of discontinued and disposed of businesses relate to estimated amounts payable in connection with onerous contracts and claims arising from disposals.
The final amount payable remains uncertain as, at the date of approval of these financial statements, there remains a further period during which claims may be received.
The timing of any settlement will depend upon the nature and extent of claimsreceived.
Provisions for onerous contracts represent the liabilities in respect of short and long term leases on unoccupied properties and other contracts lasting under five years.
Provisions for legal and other claims relate principally to provisions for the estimated cost of litigation and other sundry claims.
The timing of the settlement of these claims is uncertain.
Provisions for reorganisation include provision for redundancy costs and these are expected to be utilised over the next year.
Other provisions include environmental provisions.
These are in respect of potential liabilities relating to the Groups responsibility for maintaining its operating sites in accordance with statutory requirements and the Groups aim to have a low impact on the environment.
Theseprovisions are expected to be utilised as operating sites are disposed of or as environmental matters are resolved.
Provisions are discounted to present value where the effect is material using the discount rate applicable to the liability.
20 POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS PENSION SCHEMES OPERATED The Group operates a number of pension arrangements throughout the world which have been developed in accordance with statutory requirements and local customs and practices.
The majority of schemes are self-administered and the schemes assets are held independently of the Groups assets.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries.
The Group makes employer contributions to the various schemes in existence within the range of 2% to 46% of pensionable salaries 2017: 2% to 46%.
The contributions payable for defined contribution schemes of 110 million 2017: 123 million have been fully expensed against profits in the current year.
UK SCHEMES Within the UK there are now three main arrangements: the Compass Retirement Income Savings Plan CRISP, the Compass Group Pension Plan the Plan, and the Companys stakeholder pension arrangement.
CRISP was launched on 1 February 2003.
This has been the main vehicle for pension provision for new joiners in the UK since that date but existing members of the Plan had continued to accrue benefits under those arrangements up until 5 April 2010.
CRISP is a contracted-in money purchase arrangement whereby the Group will match employee contributions up to 6% of pay minimum 3%.
Within CRISP a new defined contribution section was established from April 2006 known as the Compass Higher Income Plan CHIP.
Senior employees who contribute to CRISP will receive an additional employer-only contribution into CHIP.
The amount of contribution and eligibility for CHIP are decided annually at the Companys discretion.
The payment towards CHIP may be taken in part, or in whole, as a cash supplement instead of a pension contribution.
The Chairman is a former employee of the Group.
The other five trustee directors are UK based employees of the Group, three of whom have been nominated by CRISP members.
The Plan is a defined benefit arrangement.
Those UK employees who transfer from the public sector under the Transfer of Undertakings Protection of Employment Regulations 2006, typically up until 31 March 2015, were eligible to join the Plan, which has otherwise been closed to new entrants since 2003.
Such transferees enter into the GAD sections of the Plan and are known as GAD members.
The Plan closed to future accrual for all existing members, other than GAD members, on 5 April 2010.
The affected members were offered membership of CRISP from 6 April 2010.
The Plan is operated on a pre-funded basis.
The funding policy is to contribute such variable amounts, on the advice of the actuary, as achieves a 100% funding level on a projected salary basis.
The actuarial assessments covering expense and contributions are carried out by independent qualified actuaries.
A formal actuarial valuation of the Plan is carried out every three years.
The most recent valuation of the Plan took place as at 5 April 2016.
At the valuation date the total market value of the assets of the Plan was 2,233 million which represented 103% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
150 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2018 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 20 POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED By agreement with the trustees, the Company is no longer funding any deficit.
The next triennial valuation is due to be completed as at 5April2019.
The Plan is reappraised annually by independent actuaries in accordance with IAS 19 Employee benefits requirements.
The Plan has a corporate trustee.
There is an independent chairman and one other independent trustee director.
There are a further five trustee directors, who are either UK based employees or former employees of the Group three of whom have been nominated by Planmembers.
The Company is subject to the Pension Automatic Enrolment Regulations for its workforce in the UK.
Both the Plan and CRISP are compliant arrangements under these Regulations and have been registered as such.
All new UK employees who meet the statutory eligibility criteria, and are not already in one of these registered compliant arrangements, are automatically enrolled into the National Employment Savings Trust NEST.
The Company considers that NEST provides the right type of service, communication material and investment choice for our employees and that it has the capabilities to support a company as large and diverse as Compass.
The UK Plan has to provide a minimum benefit for service known as Guaranteed Minimum Pension GMP which, as a result of statutory rules, is calculated differently for men and women.
Although equal treatment in pension provision for males and females is required, there has been uncertainty on whether and how pension schemes should equalise GMPs in practice.
In line with most other UK pension schemes, the UK Plan has not yet equalised GMPs, nor has the Group historically recorded an obligation for such equalisation on the balance sheet.
A judgement on the Lloyds Banking Group High Court hearing on GMP equalisation was published on 26 October 2018.
The judgement indicates that pension trustees need to amend scheme benefits to equalise for the effect of unequal GMPs and indicates an acceptable range of methods for how to do so.
This recent judgement therefore creates an obligation to equalise for all schemes that provide GMPs, including the UK Plan.
Initial estimates indicate that this obligation could be between 1% to 2% of accrued liabilities 20 million - 40 million.
This liability will be recognised in financial year 2019.
As at 30 September 2018, no additional obligation has been recognised.
OVERSEAS SCHEMES In the USA, the defined benefit plans are frozen to new participants and the main vehicle for retirement are the defined contribution plans.
The actuary provides Compass USA with the contributions required each year to the defined benefit plans, in order to work towards a 100% funding level on a projected salary basis.
Compass USA contributes to a number of multi-employer union sponsored pension plans and is required to abide by the individual collective bargaining agreements CBA negotiated with each union.
Under the terms of these CBAs, Compass USA is required to pay the union members salary and contribute to various multi-employer benefit plans which include i post employment benefits, including pensions and post employment healthcare, ii defined contribution plans, such as 401 k and annuity and savings plans, iii other plans which include legal funds, training funds and education funds.
Participation in multi-employer pension plans bear risks that differ from single-employer plans.
These risks include: a Assets contributed to the plans by Compass USA may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers.
b If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan for any reason, the unfunded obligation remaining may transition to the remaining employers participating in the plan.
c If Compass USA stops participating in the plan for any reason, the Company may be required to pay a proportionate amount to the plan for its share of the unfunded liability, known as a withdrawal liability.
Compass USA is involved with 38 multi-employer benefit plans.
The Group is not aware of, and has no reasonable expectation that, any plan in which it currently participates is in imminent danger of becoming insolvent, or is likely to experience a mass withdrawal.
These plans are accounted for as defined contribution plans, as the information provided by the plan administrators is insufficient for them to be accounted for as defined benefit plans.
The Group made total contributions of 17 million in the year 2017: 16 million to these arrangements.
In Canada, Germany, Norway, Spain and Switzerland, the Group also participates in funded defined benefit arrangements.
In other countries, Group employees participate primarily in state arrangements to which the Group makes the appropriate contributions.
Other than where required by local regulation or statute, the defined benefit schemes are closed to new entrants.
For these schemes the current service cost will increase under the projected unit credit method as the members of the schemes approach retirement.
Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2018 151 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 30 September 2018 20 POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED ALL DEFINED BENEFIT SCHEMES The Groups obligations in respect of defined benefit pension schemes are calculated separately for each scheme by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior years.
That benefit is discounted to determine its present value and the fair value of scheme assets is then deducted.
The discount rate used is the yield at the valuation date on high quality corporate bonds, whose term is consistent with the timing of the expected benefit payments over future years.
The Group takes advice from independent actuaries relating to the appropriateness of the assumptions which include life expectancy of members, expected salary and pension increases, and inflation.
It is important to note that comparatively small changes in the assumptions used may have a significant effect on the consolidated income statement and balance sheet.
The liabilities of the defined benefit schemes are measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid using the projected unit method.
This method is an accrued benefits valuation method that makes allowances for projected earnings.
These calculations are performed by a qualified actuary.
Disclosures showing the assets and liabilities of the schemes are set out below.
This assumption is presented as a weighted average.
The mortality assumptions used to value the current year UK pension schemes are derived from the S2PA generational mortality tables 2017: S2PA generational mortality tables with improvements in line with the projection model prepared by the Continuous Mortality Investigation of the UK actuarial profession, with 0.2 years age rating for male non-pensioners, -0.2 years age rating for male pensioners 2017: 0.2 years age rating for male non-pensioners, -0.2 years age rating for male pensioners and -0.1 years age rating for all females 2017: -0.1 years age rating for all females, with a long term underpin of 1.25% p. a.
These mortality assumptions take account of experience to date and assumptions for further improvements in the life expectancy of scheme members.
The Group estimates the average duration of the UK and USA Plans liabilities to be 18 years 2017: 19 years and 9 years 2017: 9 years respectively.
Examples of the resulting life expectancies for the UK Plan are as follows: 2018 2017 LIFE EXPECTANCY AT AGE 65 MALE FEMALE MALE FEMALE Member aged 65 in 2018 2017 22.6 24.5 22.5 24.4 Member aged 65 in 2043 2042 24.4 26.9 24.3 26.8 The other demographic assumptions have been set having regard to the latest trends in scheme experience and other relevant data.
The assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuation of pension schemes.
For the overseas schemes, regionally appropriate assumptions have been used where recommended by local actuaries.
The mortality assumptions used to value USA schemes are derived from the RP2014 combined healthy table, generational MP2017 scale.
Examples of the resulting life expectancies for the US schemes are as follows: 2018 2017 LIFE EXPECTANCY AT AGE 65 MALE FEMALE MALE FEMALE Member aged 65 in 2018 2017 22.2 23.7 22.4 23.9 Member aged 65 in 2043 2042 24.2 25.6 24.3 25.8 152 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2018 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 20 POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED RISKS The Group bears a number of risks in relation to its defined benefit pension schemes.
These risks and how they are mitigated for the Groups largest defined benefit plan are described below: RISK DESCRIPTION OF RISK MITIGATION Interest rate A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase As part of the investment strategy, the UK Plan aims to mitigate this the schemes benefit obligations under IAS 19. risk through investment in a liability driven investment LDI Theschemes are therefore exposed to the risk portfolio.

Inflation The schemes benefit obligations are linked to The UK Plan contains caps on increases to scheme benefits to inflation.
A higher rate of expected long term mitigate the risk of increase in inflation.
Additionally the UK Plan inflation will therefore lead to higher liabilities, both invests in LDI products which increase decrease in value when for the IAS 19 and funding liability.
expectations of future inflation rates increase fall, thus providing protection against inflation risk.
Investment Asset returns are volatile and there is a risk that the To mitigate against investment risk the UK Plan invests in a way value of pension schemes assets may not move in which aims to hedge a large proportion of the movements in the line with changes in pension schemes liabilities.
corresponding liabilities and investments are diversified across and within asset classes, to avoid overexposure to any one asset class or market.

expectancy will lead to higher liabilities.
SENSITIVITIES OF PRINCIPAL ASSUMPTIONS Measurement of the Groups defined benefit obligations is particularly sensitive to changes in key assumptions, including discount rate, life expectancy and inflation.
The sensitivities of the principal assumptions used to measure the defined benefit obligations of the schemes are set out below: IMPACT ON SCHEME DEFICIT IMPACT ON SCHEME DEFICIT ASSUMPTION CHANGE IN ASSUMPTION 2018 2017 UK Discount rate Increase by 0.5% Decrease by 188 million Decrease by 203 million Decrease by 0.5% Increase by 201 million Increase by 218 million Inflation Increase by 0.5% Increase by 110 million Increase by 121 million Decrease by 0.5% Decrease by 106 million Decrease by 115 million CPI Inflation Increase by 0.5% Increase by 25 million Increase by 28 million Decrease by 0.5% Decrease by 24 million Decrease by 27 million Life expectations from age 65 Increase by 1 year Increase by 89 million Increase by 93 million Life expectations long term annual improvement rate Increase to 1.5% per annum Increase by 38 million Increase by 40 million USA AND OTHERS Discount rate Increase by 0.5% Decrease by 12 million Decrease by 18 million Decrease by 0.5% Increase by 13 million Increase by 19 million Inflation Increase by 0.5% Increase by 5 million Increase by 4 million Decrease by 0.5% Decrease by 5 million Decrease by 4 million Life expectations from age 65 Increase by 1 year Increase by 5 million Increase by 8 million The sensitivities above consider the impact of the single change shown, with the other assumptions assumed to be unchanged.
The sensitivity analyses have been determined based on a method that extrapolates the impact on the defined benefit obligations as a result of reasonable changes in key assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period.
In practice, changes in one assumption may be accompanied by offsetting changes in another assumption although this is not always the case.
The impact of a change in the UK inflation rate shown above includes the impact of a change in both the RPI and CPI inflation rates.
Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2018 153 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 30 September 2018 20 POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED The Groups net pension surplus is the difference between the schemes assets and the schemes liabilities.
Changes in the assumptions may occur at the same time as changes in the market value of scheme assets.
These may or may not offset the changes in assumptions.
For example, a fall in interest rates will increase the schemes liabilities but may also trigger an offsetting increase in the market value of certain assets so there may be little effect on the Groups liability.
ANALYSIS OF THE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS At 30 September 2018, the assets of the various schemes were invested in a diversified portfolio that consisted primarily of equities and debt securities.
The fair value of these assets is shown below by major category: 2018 2017 FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS UK USA OTHER TOTAL UK USA OTHER TOTAL BYMAJOR CATEGORY M M M M M M M M EQUITY TYPE ASSET Global equities quoted 170 272 15 457 158 223 14 395 Global equities unquoted 17 17 15 15 GOVERNMENT BONDS UK fixed interest quoted 554 554 706 706 UK index linked quoted 997 997 885 885 Overseas quoted 9 9 7 7 Overseas unquoted 20 20 26 26 CORPORATE BONDS Corporate bonds quoted 515 65 580 530 123 653 Corporate bonds unquoted Diversified securities quoted OTHER ASSETS Property funds quoted 176 1 177 169 1 170 Property funds unquoted 13 13 11 11 Insurance policies unquoted 12 12 13 13 Other assets 9 9 9 9 Cash and cash equivalents 13 48 1 62 13 72 3 88 At 30 September 2,425 385 97 2,907 2,461 425 92 2,978 The UK Plan has holdings of diversified global equity type investments, mainly shares in listed companies.
The return on these investments is variable, and they are generally considered to be riskier investments.
However, it is generally accepted that the yield on these investments will contain a premium to compensate investors for this additional risk.
There is significant uncertainty about the likely size of this risk premium.
In respect of investments held in global equities there is also a risk of unfavourable currency movements.
The trustee manages these risks by holding approximately 50% of those investments in funds which are hedged against currency movements.
The UK Plan also holds corporate bonds and other fixed interest securities.
The risk of default on these is assessed by various rating agencies.
Some of these bond investments are issued by HM Government.
The risk of default on these is lower compared to the risk on corporate bond investments, although some risk may remain.

In the current year, Compass Group USA Inc. Retirement Plan for Salaried Employees has been settled.
As a result, a 5 million loss has been recognised in the income statement on the settlement of the scheme liabilities.
The Group made total contributions to defined benefit schemes of 32 million in the year 2017: 36 million and expects to make total contributions to these schemes of 30 million in 2019, including 18 million related to the defined benefit plans in USA and 3 million in UK.
The UK Plan is the largest scheme within the Group and was in surplus on a funding basis at the date of the most recent actuarial valuation as at 5 April 2016 and so no deficit contributions are currently required.
The remaining Group funded schemes do not have significant minimum funding requirements whilst contributions to unfunded pension schemes are quite stable.
As a result, we do not expect the required future contributions to change substantially beyond next year.

23 ACQUISITION, SALE AND CLOSURE OF BUSINESSES ACQUISITIONS The main acquisitions completed during the year are as follows: The total cash spent on acquisitions during the year, net of cash acquired, was 420 million 2017: 96 million.
The most significant acquisition during the year relates to Unidine.
On 29 December 2017, Compass Group USA, Inc. a USA subsidiary of the Group, purchased 80% of the share capital of Unidine Corp. for an initial consideration of 234 million $305 million.
Unidine Corp. is a Massachusetts based company that operates as a caterer in the healthcare and seniors market.
The preliminary goodwill in relation to the assets acquired is 193 million $252 million.
This goodwill is provisional and will be finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date.
Changes are expected to principally relate to the valuation of contracts acquired.
This goodwill represents the premium the Group paid to acquire a company that complements its existing businesses and creates significant opportunities for cross selling and other synergies.
The following table summarises the recognised amounts of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition of Unidine Corp. BOOK VALUE FAIR VALUE M M Net assets acquired Goodwill arising on acquisition 193 Contract related and other intangibles arising on acquisition 4 117 Trade and other receivables 25 25 Other assets 7 7 Cash and cash equivalents 6 6 Deferred tax 25 Trade and other payables 8 8 Other liabilities 23 23 Fair value of net assets acquired 292 Satisfied by Cash consideration 234 Contingent consideration 58 Total consideration 292 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2018 159 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 30 September 2018 23 ACQUISITION, SALE AND CLOSURE OF BUSINESSES CONTINUED In addition to the acquisitions set out above, the Group has also completed several smaller bolt-on acquisitions in several countries.

Contingent consideration is an estimate at the date of acquisition of the amount of additional consideration that will be payable in the future.
The actual amount paid can vary from the estimate depending on the terms of the transaction and, for example, the actual performance of the acquired business.
The adjustments made in respect of acquisitions in the year to 30 September 2018 are provisional and will be finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date, principally in relation to the valuation of contracts acquired.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of the businesses represents the premium the Group paid to acquire companies which complement the existing business and create significant opportunities for cross-selling and other synergies.
The goodwill arising is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
In the period from acquisition to 30 September 2018, the acquisitions contributed revenue of 210 million and operating profit of 13 million to the Groups results 2017: 45 million and 2.5 million respectively.
If the acquisitions had occurred on 1 October 2017, it is estimated that the combined sales of Group and equity accounted joint ventures for the period would have been 23,387 million and total Group operating profit including associates would have been 1,701 million.
160 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2018 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 23 ACQUISITION, SALE AND CLOSURE OF BUSINESSES CONTINUED SALE AND CLOSURE OF BUSINESSES Following a strategic review of the business, the Group decided to take actions to simplify its portfolio of businesses based on an assessment of market growth opportunity, scalability, the Groups market position and capabilities.
As a result of this review and some prior year disposals, the Group consolidated income statement includes a 58 million net loss on sale and closure of businesses 2017: nil and a related tax charge of 10 million.
This balance includes a 19 million write-down of net assets for businesses that are held for sale where the carrying amount was higher than net realisable value.
The remaining 39 million consists of a net gain on disposal offset by asset write-downs and exit costs relating to committed or completed business exits.
As at the balance sheet date, the Group has classified certain businesses, including South Africa, Vision Security Group in the UK and part of our US laundries business, as held for sale as these disposals are highly probable and are expected to be completed within 12 months.
The sale of Vision Security Group to Mitie Group plc completed after the balance sheet date in October 2018.
The major classes of assets and liabilities classified as held for sale as at 30 September 2018 are as follows: CARRYING AMOUNT M Goodwill 21 Other intangible assets 17 Property, plant and equipment 58 Interest in joint ventures and associates 1 Trade and other receivables 82 Inventory 33 Other 24 Total assets held for sale 236 Trade and other payables 70 Other 2 Total liabilities directly associated with the assets held for sale 72 Cumulative income or expenses included in other comprehensive income relating to these businesses amount to 21 million of foreign exchange losses.
The non-recurring fair value measurement of the businesses held for sale is categorised as a Level 3 fair value, and is primarily based on offers received or agreed sale price for these businesses from interested parties.

PERFORMANCE BONDS, GUARANTEES AND INDEMNITIES The Company and certain subsidiary undertakings have, in the normal course of business, given guarantees and entered into counterindemnities in respect of such guarantees relating to the Groups own contracts and or the Groups share of certain contractual obligations of joint arrangements and associates.
Where the Group enters into such arrangements, it does so in order to provide assurance to the beneficiary that it will fulfil its existing contractual obligations.
The issue of such guarantees and indemnities does not therefore increase the Groups overall exposure and the disclosure of such performance bonds, guarantees and indemnities is given for information purposes only.
EUREST SUPPORT SERVICES On 21 October 2005, the Company announced that it had instructed Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer to conduct an investigation into the relationships between Eurest Support Services ESS a member of the Group, IHC Services Inc. IHC and the United Nations UN.
Ernst & Young assisted Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer in this investigation.
On 1 February 2006, it was announced that the investigation hadconcluded.
The investigation established serious irregularities in connection with contracts awarded to ESS by the UN.
The work undertaken by Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer and Ernst & Young gave no reason to believe that these issues extended beyond a few individuals within ESS to other parts of ESS or the wider Compass Group of companies.
The Group settled all outstanding civil litigation against it in relation to this matter in October 2006, but litigation continues between competitors of ESS, IHC and other parties involved in UN procurement.
IHCs relationship with the UN and ESS was part of a wider investigation into UN procurement activity being conducted by the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York, and with which the Group co-operated fully.
The current status of that investigation is uncertain and a matter for the US authorities.
Those investigators could have had access to sources unavailable to the Group, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer or Ernst & Young, and further information may yet emerge which is inconsistent with, or additional to, the findings of the Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer investigation, which could have an adverse impact on the Group.
The Group has, however, not been contacted by, or received further requests for information from, the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York in connection with these matters since January 2006.
The Group has co-operated fully with the UN throughout.
Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2018 163 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 30 September 2018 26 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES CONTINUED OTHER LITIGATION AND CLAIMS The Group is also involved in various other legal proceedings incidental to the nature of its business and maintains insurance cover to reducefinancial risk associated with claims related to these proceedings.
Where appropriate, provisions are made to cover any potential uninsured losses.
The increasingly complex international corporate tax environment and an increase in audit activity from tax authorities means that the potential for tax uncertainties and disputes has increased.
The Group is currently subject to a number of audits and reviews in jurisdictions around the world that primarily relate to complex corporate tax issues.
None of these tax audits are currently expected to have a material impact on the Groups financial position.
In addition, we continue to engage with tax authorities and other regulatory bodies on both payroll and sales tax reviews, and compliance with labour laws and regulations.
Again, we currently do not expect any of these to have a material impact on the Groups financial position.
On 24 November 2017, the European Commission published its preliminary decision on the Group Financing Exemption in the UKs Controlled Foreign Company legislation, finding that the legislation is in breach of EU State Aid rules.
Like many other multinational groups that have acted in accordance with this UK legislation, the Group may be affected by the final outcome of this investigation, the timing of which, including any appeal, is uncertain.
We have calculated our maximum potential liability as at 30 September 2018 to be 108 million, but do not consider that any provision is required in this respect based on our current assessment of the issue.
OUTCOME Although it is not possible to predict the outcome or quantify the financial effect of these proceedings, or any claim against the Group related thereto, in the opinion of the directors, any uninsured losses resulting from the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on the financial position of the Group.
The timing of the settlement of these proceedings or claims is uncertain.
