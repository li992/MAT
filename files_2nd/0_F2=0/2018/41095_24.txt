Discount or Premium A description of the difference between the share price and the net asset value per share.
The size of the discount or premium is calculated by subtracting the share price from the net asset value per share and is usually expressed as a percentage % of the net asset value per share.
If the share price is higher than the net asset value per share the result is a premium.
If the share price is lower than the net asset value per share, the shares are trading at a discount.
Equity Swaps An equity swap is an agreement where one party counterparty transfers the total return of an underlying equity position to the other party swap holder in exchange for a payment of the principal, and interest for financed swaps, at a set date.
Total return includes dividend income and gains or losses from market movements.
The exposure of the holder is the market value of the underlying equity position.
The company uses two types of equity swap: funded, where payment is made on acquisition.
They are equivalent to holding the underlying equity position with the exception of additional counterparty risk and not possessing voting rights in the underlying: and, financed, where payment is made on maturity.
As there is no initial outlay, financed swaps increase exposure by the value of the underlying equity position with no initial increase in the investments value there is therefore embedded leverage within a financed swap due to the deferral of payment to maturity.
The Company employs swaps for two purposes: To gain access to individual stocks in the Indian, Chinese and emerging markets, where the Company is not locally registered to trade: and, To gain exposure to thematic baskets of stocks a Basket Swap.
Basket Swaps are used to build exposure to themes, or ideas, that the Portfolio Manager believes the Company will benefit from and where holding a Basket Swap is more cost effective and operationally efficient than holding the underlying stocks or individual swaps.
Gearing Gearing is calculated as the overdraft drawn, less net current assets excluding dividends, divided by Net Assets, expressed as a percentage.

International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA ISDA has created a standardised contract the ISDA Master Agreement which sets out the basic trading terms between the counterparties to derivative contracts.
Leverage Leverage is defined in the AIFMD as any method by which the AIFM increases the exposure of an AIF.
In addition to the gearing limit the Company also has to comply with the AIFMD leverage requirements.
For these purposes the Board has set a maximum leverage limit of 140% for both methods.
This limit is expressed as a % with 100% representing no leverage or gearing in the Company.
There are two methods of calculating leverage as follows: The Gross Method is calculated as total exposure divided by Shareholders Funds.
Total exposure is calculated as net assets, less cash and cash equivalents, adding back cash borrowing plus derivatives converted into the equivalent position in their underlying assets.

A call option is an option to buy, and a put option an option to sell.
The potential loss of the buyer is limited to the higher of the premium paid or the market value of the bought option.
On the other side for the seller of a covered call option your company does not sell uncovered options any loss would be offset by gains in the covering position, and for sold puts the potential loss is the strike price times the number of option contracts held.
For the purposes of calculating exposure to risk in note 16 beginning on page 64, the potential loss is used.
The exposure, used in calculating the AIFMD leverage limits, between these two b ounds is determined as the delta an options delta measures the sensitivity of an options price solely to a change in the price of the underlying asset adjusted equivalent of the underlying position.
