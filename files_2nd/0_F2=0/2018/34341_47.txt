g Fox River As explained in note 28, a Group subsidiary has certain liabilities in respect of indemnities given on the purchase and disposal of former businesses in the United States and in 2011, the subsidiary provided 274 million in respect of claims in relation to environmental clean-up costs of the Fox River.
On 30 September 2014, a Group subsidiary, NCR, Appvion and Windward Prospects entered into a Funding Agreement with regard to the costs for the clean-up of Fox River.
In January 2017, NCR and Appvion entered into a consent decree with the US Government to resolve how the remaining clean-up will be funded and to resolve further outstanding claims between them.
The Consent Decree was approved by a US District Judge in August 2017 but is currently subject to appeal in the US Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, refer to note 28 for further details.
In July 2016, the High Court ruled in a Group subsidiarys favour that a dividend of 135 million paid by Windward to Sequana in May 2009 was a transaction made with the intention of putting assets beyond the reach of the Group subsidiary and of negatively impacting its interests.
On 10 February 2017, further to a hearing in January 2017 to determine the relief due, the Court found in the Group subsidiarys favour, ordering that Sequana must pay an amount up to the full value of the dividend plus interest which equates to around US$185 million, related to past and future clean-up costs.
The Court granted all parties leave to appeal and Sequana a stay in respect of the above payments.
In June 2018, the Court of Appeal heard arguments in the Sequana Claims Appeal as defined in note 28.
On 6 February 2019, the Court of Appeal gave judgment upholding the High Courts findings, with one immaterial change to the method of calculating the damages awarded.
Sequana therefore remains liable to pay the above mentioned dividend.
Due to the uncertain outcome of the case no asset has been recognised in relation to this ruling.
In February 2017, Sequana entered into a process in France seeking court protection the Sauvegarde, exiting the Sauvegarde in June 2017.
No payments have been received.
The provision is 108 million at 31 December 2018 2017: 138 million.
Based on this Funding Agreement, 30 million has been paid in 2018, which includes legal costs of 5 million 2017: 25 million, including legal costs of 7 million: 2016: 17 million, including legal costs of 11 million.
In addition, in 2016 the devaluation of sterling against the US dollar led to a charge of20 million.
h Other adjusting items In 2018, the Group incurred 294 million of other adjusting items, including 178 million related to Engle progeny litigation offset by credits related to the Non-Participating Manufacturers settlement, which have been adjusted within other operating expenses.
In 2018, the European Securities and Markets Authority ESMA recognised the specific issues related to Venezuela and proposed that companies with exposure to Venezuela use an estimated exchange rate rather than the official exchange rate, as otherwise required under IAS 21.
Accordingly, the Group has used an exchange rate calculated with reference to the estimated inflation since the latest dividend payment in 2010.
In addition, the net assets of the Groups Venezuelan operations are subject to accounting adjustments IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies, as they are revalued, for accounting purposes, from their acquisition date to the balance sheet date.
However, management believes that such a revaluation is not reflective of the recoverable value of those assets and have incurred an impairment charge of 110 million.
This charge has been treated as an adjusting item as it does not reflect the underlying performance of the Group.
The Group has also recognised a gain of 45 million within net finance costs note 4, being the partial counter-party to the above non-monetary asset movement, generating a monetary gain due to hyperinflation accounting under IAS 29.
In 2017, the release of the fair value acquisition accounting adjustments to finished goods inventories of 465 million on the RAI acquisition has been adjusted within Changes in inventories of finished goods and work in progress.
Also included in 2017 is the impairment of certain assets of 69 million related to a third-party distributor Agrokor in Croatia, that has been adjusted within other operating expenses.
In 2016, the Board of Audit and Inspection of Korea BAI concluded its tax assessment in relation to the 2014 year-end tobacco inventory, and imposed additional sales tax excise and VAT and penalties.
This resulted in the recognition of a 53 million charge by a Group subsidiary.
Management deems the tax and penalties to be unfounded and has appealed to the tax tribunal against the assessment.
Based on the legal opinion from a local law firm, management believes that this appeal will be successful, and that the findings of the BAI will be reversed.
On grounds of materiality and the high likelihood of the tax and penalties being reversed in future, the Group has classified the tax and penalties charge as an adjusting item in 2016.
