Alternative performance measures Alternative performance measures are denoted by the symbol When assessing and discussing the Groups reported financial performance, financial position and cash flows, Glencore makes reference to Alternative performance measures APMs, which are not defined or specified under the requirements of IFRS, but are derived from the financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS.
The APMs are consistent with how the business performance is measured and reported within the internal management reporting to the Board and management and assist in providing meaningful analysis of the Groups results both internally and externally in discussions with the financial analyst and investment community.
The Group uses APMs to improve the comparability of information between reporting periods and segments and to aid the understanding of the activity taking place across the Group by adjusting for items that are of an infrequent nature and by aggregating or disaggregating notably in the case of relevant material associates and joint ventures accounted for on an equity basis certain IFRS measures.
APMs are also used to approximate the underlying operating cash flow generation of the operations Adjusted EBITDA.
Investments in the extractive industry are typically significant and the initial spend generally occurs over several years, upfront, prior to the operations generating cash.
As a result, the investments are sometimes made with partners and an assessment to approximate the operating cash flow generation pay-back of the investment Adjusted EBITDA is required.
Against this backdrop, the key APMs used by Glencore are Adjusted EBITDA, Net funding Net debt and the disaggregation of the equivalent key APMs of our relevant material associates and joint ventures Proportionate adjustment to enable a consistent evaluation of the financial performance and returns attributable to the Group.
Adjusted EBITDA is a useful approximation of the operating cash flow generation by eliminating depreciation and amortisation adjustments.
Adjusted EBITDA is not a direct measure of our liquidity, which is shown by our cash flow statement and needs to be considered in the context of our financial commitments.
Proportionate adjustments are useful to enable a consistent evaluation of the financial performance and returns available to the Group, irrespective of the differing accounting treatments required to account for our minority joint ownership interests of our relevant material investments.
Net funding is an aggregation of IFRS measures Borrowings less cash and cash equivalents and Net debt is Net funding less Readily marketable inventories and provides a measure of our financial leverage and, through Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA relationships, provides an indication of relative financial strength and flexibility.
APMs used by Glencore may not be comparable with similarly titled measures and disclosures by other companies.
APMs have limitations as an analytical tool, and a user of the financial statements should not consider these measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, analysis of the Groups results of operations: and they may not be indicative of the Groups historical operating results, nor are they meant to be a projection or forecast of its future results.
Listed below are the definitions and reconciliations to the underlying IFRS measures of the various APMs used by the Group.
Proportionate adjustment For internal reporting and analysis, management evaluates the performance of Antamina copper zinc mine 34% owned, Cerrejn coal mine 33% owned and Collahuasi copper mine 44% owned under the proportionate consolidation method reflecting Glencores proportionate share of the revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities of these investments.
During the year, the Glencore Agri joint venture continued its transition to a fully independent stand-alone group through bedding down of its independent governance structure and the firm establishment of its own stand-alone capital structure and credit profile, including the removal of all, but one see note 10 of the Groups legacy guarantee arrangements.
As a result of its increasing independence and Glencores management evaluating the segments financial performance on a net return basis as opposed to an Adjusted EBITDA basis, the financial results of Glencore Agri are no longer adjusted and presented on a proportionate consolidation basis, but rather are presented on a basis consistent with its underlying IFRS treatment equity accounting.
Applicable comparative balances have been adjusted to reflect these changes.
In November 2017, Glencore completed the acquisition of additional shares in Volcan, thereby increasing its total economic interest from 7.7% to 23.3% compared to its 63% voting interest.
For internal reporting and analysis, management evaluates the performance of Volcan under the equity method, reflecting the Groups relatively low 23.3% economic ownership in this fully ring-fenced listed entity, with its stand-alone, independent and separate capital structure.
The impact is that we reflect 23.3% of Volcans net income in the Groups Adjusted EBIT EBITDA and its results are excluded from all other APMs including production data.
