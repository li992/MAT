Absent these benefits, the Reported Tax Rate for the year would have been 21%.
The cash tax paid for the year was $537m which was 27% of Profit before tax.
Taxation has been provided at current rates on the profits earned for the periods covered by the Group Financial Statements.
The 2018 prior period current tax adjustment relates mainly to net reductions in provisions for tax contingencies and tax accrual to tax return adjustments.
The 2017 prior period current tax adjustment relates mainly to net reductions in provisions for tax contingencies totalling $105m and tax accrual to tax return adjustments.
The 2016 prior period current tax adjustment relates mainly to net reductions in provisions for tax contingencies totalling $67m and tax accrual to tax return adjustments.
The 2018 and 2017 prior period deferred tax adjustments relate mainly to tax accrual to return adjustments.
The 2016 prior period deferred tax adjustments relate mainly to tax accrual to return adjustments and releases in provisions for tax contingencies.
To the extent that dividends remitted from overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are expected to result in additional taxes, appropriate amounts have been provided for.
No deferred tax has been provided for unremitted earnings of Group companies overseas as these are considered permanently employed in the business of these companies.
Unremitted earnings may be liable to overseas taxes and or UK taxation after allowing for double tax relief if distributed as dividends.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and branches for which Deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised totalled approximately $8,144m at 31 December 2018 2017: $8,359m: 2016: $6,884m.
Factors affecting future tax charges As a group with worldwide operations, AstraZeneca is subject to several factors that may affect future tax charges, principally the levels and mix of profitability in different jurisdictions, transfer pricing regulations, tax rates imposed and tax regime reforms.
Details of the material tax exposures and items currently under audit, negotiation and review are set out in Note 29.

6 Segment information AstraZeneca is engaged in a single business activity of biopharmaceuticals and the Group does not have multiple operating segments.
AstraZenecas biopharmaceuticals business consists of the discovery and development of new products, which are then manufactured, marketed and sold.
All of these functional activities take place and are managed globally on a highly integrated basis.
These individual functional areas are not managed separately.
The SET, established and chaired by the CEO, is the vehicle through which he exercises the authority delegated to him from the Board for the management, development and performance of our business.
It is considered that the SET is AstraZenecas chief operating decision making body as defined by IFRS 8.
The operation of the SET is principally driven by the management of the commercial operations, R&D, and manufacturing and supply.
All significant operating decisions are taken by the SET.
While members of the SET have responsibility for implementation of decisions in their respective areas, operating decision making is at SET level as a whole.
Where necessary, these are implemented through cross-functional sub-committees that consider the Group-wide impact of a new decision.
For example, product launch decisions would be initially considered by the SET and, on approval, passed to an appropriate sub-team for implementation.
The impacts of being able to develop, produce, deliver and commercialise a wide range of pharmaceutical products drive the SET decision making process.
In assessing performance, the SET reviews financial information on an integrated basis for the Group as a whole, substantially in the form of, and on the same basis as, the Groups IFRS Financial Statements.
The high upfront cost of discovering and developing new products coupled with the relatively insignificant and stable unit cost of production means that there is not the clear link that exists in many manufacturing businesses between the revenue generated on an individual product sale and the associated cost and hence margin generated on a product.
Consequently, the profitability of individual drugs or classes of drugs is not considered a key measure of performance for the business and is not monitored by the SET.
Resources are allocated on a Group-wide basis according to need.
In particular, capital expenditure, in-licensing, and R&D resources are allocated between activities on merit, based on overall therapeutic considerations and strategy under the aegis of the Groups Early Stage Product Committees and a single Late Stage Product Committee.

As detailed in Note 6, the Group does not have multiple operating segments and is engaged in a single business activity of biopharmaceuticals.
Recoverable amount is determined on a fair value less costs to sell basis using the market value of the Companys outstanding Ordinary Shares.
Our market capitalisation is compared to the book value of the Groups net assets and this indicates a significant surplus at 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016.
As a further check, we also perform a discounted cash flow calculation whereby we risk adjust projections of the Groups post-tax cash flows over 10 years.
This length of time is considered by the Board as a reasonable period given the long development and life-cycle of a medicine.
The projections include assumptions about product launches, competition from rival products and pricing policy as well as the possibility of generics entering the market.
In setting these assumptions we consider our past experience, external sources of information including information on expected increases and ageing of populations in our established markets and the expanding patient populations in newer markets, our knowledge of competitor activity and our assessment of future changes in the pharmaceutical industry.
The 10-year period is covered by internal budgets and forecasts.
Given that internal budgets and forecasts are prepared for all projections, no general growth rates are used to extrapolate internal budget and forecast amounts.
No terminal value is included as the recoverable amount determined by the cash flows exceed the carrying value of net assets without inclusion of a terminal value.
AstraZenecas post-tax weighted average cost of capital 7.0% for 2018, 2017 and 2016 is used in the calculation to discount the cash flows to reflect the impact of risks relevant to the Group and the time value of money.
No goodwill impairment was identified.

Recoverable amount is determined as the higher of value in use or fair value less costs to sell using discounted cash flow calculations where the products expected post-tax cash flows are risk-adjusted over their estimated remaining useful economic life.
The projections are covered by internal budgets and forecasts.
The risk-adjusted cash flows are discounted using AstraZenecas post-tax weighted average cost of capital 7% for 2018, 2017 and 2016.
The estimates used in calculating the recoverable amount are highly sensitive and depend on assumptions specific to the nature of the Groups activities including: outcome of R&D activities: probability of technical and regulatory success: market volume, share and pricing: amount and timing of projected future cash flows: and sales erosion curves following patent expiry.
In 2018, the Group recorded impairment charges of $144m in respect of launched products Eklira $114m, revised carrying value of $396m and Movantik $30m, revised carrying value of $59m.
Impairment charges recorded against products in development related to MEDI0680 $470m and other intangible assets $95m.
In 2017, the Group recorded an impairment charge of $491m in respect of launched products Byetta $92m, revised carrying value of $407m, FluMist $121m, revised carrying value of $267m and Movantik $174m, revised carrying value of $106m.
Impairment charges recorded against products in development related to tralokinumab $53m and other intangible assets $51m.
Impairment charges recorded in 2016 relates to the termination, or reassessment of the likelihood of success, of several individual projects, none of which had significant capitalised values.
170 AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2018 Financial Statements Financial Statements The impairments recorded on launched products were a consequence of revised market volume, share and price assumptions and, for FluMist in 2017, the US market expected timing of renewed recommendation from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ACIP under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
These impairments were calculated using value in use models.
Impairments recorded on products in development were a consequence of failed or poor performing trials, with the individual assets being fully impaired.
When launched products, such as the ones detailed above, are partially impaired, the carrying values of these assets in future periods are particularly sensitive to changes in forecast assumptions, including those assumptions set out above, as the asset is impaired down to its recoverable amount.
Assets that are particularly sensitive to variations in valuation assumptions include Byetta carrying value as at 31 December 2018 of $316m and Ardea carrying value of $1,172m.
The Byetta valuation, impaired in 2017, is most sensitive to the expected timing of a generic entering the market.
Increasing the probability of a generic entry into the market by 20% from our base valuation model would result in an impairment charge of $25m.
No impairment charge has been recorded on Ardea, a product in development, with a net book value of $1,172m.
The Ardea valuation is particularly sensitive to variations in the probability of technical and regulatory success PTRS assumptions.
Sensitivities performed at the year end on the Ardea asset included reducing the PTRS by 5 percentage points.
Applying this sensitivity would result in an impairment charge against the Ardea intangible asset of approximately $70m.
The Group has performed an assessment on assets which have had impairments recorded in previous periods to determine if any reversals of impairments were required and none were identified with the exception of a reversal of $28m in respect of an asset previously impaired prior to 2016.
This assessment included FluMist where an impairment of $121m was taken in 2017 and where currently the uncertainty remains around long term sales potential in the US following the reinstatement of the US recommendation by ACIP in 2018.

This agreement was to divest a number of assets in MedImmunes non-core inflammation and autoimmunity portfolio to Viela, including MEDI-551, which is an advanced Phase IIb III asset, and a number of other clinical & pre-clinical assets.
AstraZeneca contributed $142m in initial funds and has a 45% interest in the joint venture.
Consideration was $142m and a restricted disposal gain of $63m was recognised in Other operating income.
On 27 November 2017, AstraZeneca entered into a joint venture agreement with Chinese Future Industry Investment Fund FIIF, to discover, develop and commercialise potential new medicines to help meet unmet needs globally, and to bring innovative new medicines to patients in China faster.
The agreement resulted in the formation of a joint venture entity based in China, Dizal Jiangsu Pharmaceutical Co. Limited.
AstraZeneca contributed $55m in initial funds and has a 48% interest in the joint venture.
The joint venture entity purchased exclusive rights from AstraZeneca in 2017 to develop and commercialise three potential medicines currently in pre-clinical development in the areas of oncology, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, and respiratory, resulting in a disposal gain of $28m for AstraZeneca recognised in Other operating income.
In 2015, AstraZeneca established the subsidiaries Entasis Therapeutics Ltd and Entasis Therapeutics Inc. collectively known as Entasis for the development of early-stage infection assets.
In March 2016, Entasis closed a Series B financing, raising $25m from four third party investors.
Under the funding agreement, a new board of directors was appointed, and a voting rights agreement was put in place committing to reduce AstraZenecas voting interest to approximately 49%.
The results of Entasis were consequently deconsolidated in 2016 from the Group, with an investment in associate of $24m recognised.
There was no gain or loss recognised on deconsolidation.
During 2017, the voting interests were further reduced and at 31 December 2017 were approximately 18%.
Entasis completed an IPO on 26 September 2018.
A gain was made of $25m recognised in profit.
After the IPO AstraZenecas holding was reduced to 16.5% with only one member on an increased board size of 14.
As a result, the investment is no longer accounted for as an associate and is now included in equity securities held at FVOCI.

The financial impact from the reclassification of equity and fixed income investments from available for sale to at fair value through Other comprehensive income and at fair value through profit and loss has been recorded in the Group accounting policies under Impact from adoption of IFRS 9.
Other investments classified as at fair value through Other comprehensive income and at fair value through profit and loss IFRS 9 Other investments held at fair value through Other comprehensive income include equity securities which are not held for trading and which the Group has irrevocably elected at initial recognition to recognise in this category.
Other investments held at fair value through profit and loss comprise fixed income securities for which the Group has not elected to recognise fair value gains through Other comprehensive income.
The fair value of listed investments is based on year end quoted market prices.
Fixed deposits are held at amortised cost with carrying value being a reasonable approximation of fair value given their short-term nature.

The Japanese to US swap effectively converts $750m of the Groups $1,000m 1.95% 2019 bond into a Japanese yen borrowing, partially hedging the Groups Japanese yen denominated assets and revenues.
At 31 December 2018 the fair value of this swap was $213m 2017: $223m: 2016: $242m, the swapped US dollar:Japanese yen rate was 78.01 and the Japanese yen interest rate on the swap was 0.3452%.
The Chinese renminbi to US dollar swap hedges inter-company funding provided to Chinese Group entities.
At 31 December 2018 the fair value of this swap was $ 4 m 2017: $ 4 m: 2016: $7m, the swapped US dollar:Chinese renminbi rate was 6.68 and the Chinese renminbi interest rate on the swap was 4.796%.
A further $151m Chinese renminbi to US dollar swap matured in December 2018 when the inter-company loan it was hedging was repaid fair value 2017: $11m: 2016: $29m.
Hedge ineffectiveness recognised on swaps designated in a net investment hedge during the period was $nil.
2 Instruments designated in a cash flow hedge are cross currency swaps with total nominal amounts of euro 2.2bn that effectively convert our fixed rate euro 500m 0.25%, euro 900m 0.75% and euro 800m 1.25% callable bonds repayable in 2021, 2024 and 2028 respectively into fixed rate USD borrowings and hedge the exposure to foreign exchange spot rate and interest rate risk.
The fair value of these swaps at 31 December 2018 was $101m 2017: $197m: 2016: $ 115 m. The swap maturity dates match the underlying bond maturity dates and the average swapped euro:US dollar exchange rate and swapped interest rates are 1.14 and 2.7% respectively.
3 Cross currency swaps designated in a fair value hedge refers to a cross currency interest rate swap that hedges a designated euro 300m portion of our euro 750m 0.875% 2021 non-callable bond against exposure to movements in the euro:US dollar exchange rate.
The maturity date of the cross currency interest rate swap is in 2021 and the swapped euro:US dollar exchange rate and swapped interest rate are 1.09 and three month US dollar libor 1.27% respectively.
All derivatives are held at fair value and fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as defined in Note 11.
None of the derivatives have been reclassified in the year.
The fair value of interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps is estimated using appropriate zero coupon curve valuation techniques to discount future contractual cash flows based on rates at current year end.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts and currency options are estimated by cash flow accounting models using appropriate yield curves based on market forward foreign exchange rates at the year end.
The majority of forward foreign exchange contracts for existing transactions had maturities of less than one month from year end.
The interest rates used to discount future cash flows for fair value adjustments, where applicable, are based on market swap curves at the reporting date, and were as follows: 2018 2017 2016 Derivatives 0.4 % to 3.2% 1.7% to 2.2% 1.5% to 2.2% AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2018 Notes to the Group Financial Statements 173 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 13 Non-current other receivables Non-current other receivables of $515m 2017: $847m: 2016: $901m include a prepayment of $114m 2017: $180m: 2016: $380m which represents the long-term element of minimum contractual royalties payable to Shionogi under the global licence agreement for Crestor, which was renegotiated in December 2013.
The resulting modified royalty structure, which includes fixed minimum and maximum payments in years until 2020, has resulted in the Group recognising liabilities, and corresponding prepayments, for the discounted value of total minimum payments.
The current portion of the prepayment is $114m 2017: $181m: 2016: $116m and is reported in amounts due within one year see Note 15.

Under IAS 39 all Cash and cash equivalents were held at amortised cost with fair value approximating to carrying value.
Following the adoption of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments on 1 January 2018 US dollar liquidity fund balances included in Cash and cash equivalents were reclassified from amortised cost to fair value through profit or loss.
During 2018 AstraZeneca was invested in constant net asset value funds with same day access for subscription and redemption.
These investments fail the solely payments of principal and interest test criteria under IFRS 9.
They are therefore measured at fair value through profit or loss, although the fair value will be materially the same as amortised cost.
The balance reclassified on 1 January 2018 was $1,150m as shown under Impact from adoption of IFRS 9 in the Group accounting policies section.

These borrowings comprise our 350m 5.75% 2031 non-callable bond and a euro 450m portion of our euro 750m 0.875% 2021 non-callable bond and have been designated as hedges of net investments in the Groups UK and Euro operations respectively.
Also included within borrowings held at amortised cost is the Groups $1bn 1.95% 2019 bond, $750m of which has been swapped to Japanese yen.
The US dollar to Japanese yen cross currency interest rate swap has been designated as a hedge of net investments in the Groups Japanese operations.
Hedge ineffectiveness recognised on borrowings designated in a net investment hedge during the period was nil.
The fair value of fixed-rate publicly traded debt is based on year end quoted market prices: the fair value of floating rate debt is nominal value, as mark to market differences would be minimal given the frequency of resets.
The carrying value of loans designated at fair value through profit or loss is the fair value: this falls within the Level 1 valuation method as defined in Note 11.
For loans designated in a fair value hedge relationship, carrying value is initially measured at fair value and remeasured for fair value changes in respect of the hedged risk at each reporting date.
All other loans are held at amortised cost.
Fair values, as disclosed in the table above, are all determined using the Level 1 valuation method as defined in Note 11, with the exception of overdrafts and finance leases, where fair value approximates to carrying values.
A gain of $8m was made during the year on the fair value of bonds designated at fair value through profit or loss, due to increased credit risk.
A gain of $34m has been made on these bonds since designation due to increased credit risk.
Under IFRS 9, the Group records the component of fair value changes relating to the component of own credit risk through Other comprehensive income.
Changes in credit risk had no material effect on any other financial assets and liabilities recognised at fair value in the Group Financial Statements.
The change in fair value attributable to changes in credit risk is calculated as the change in fair value not attributable to market risk.
The amount payable at maturity on bonds designated at fair value through profit or loss is $287m.
The interest rates used to discount future cash flows for fair value adjustments, where applicable, are based on market swap curves at the reporting date, and were as follows: 2018 2017 2016 Loans and borrowings 2.3% to 2.4% 1.9% to 2.2% 1.5% to 2.2% 176 AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2018 Financial Statements Financial Statements 19 Trade and other payables 2018 2017 2016 $m $m $m Current liabilities Trade payables 1,720 2,285 1,680 Value added and payroll taxes and social security 204 243 240 Rebates, chargebacks, returns and other revenue accruals 4,043 3,264 3,601 Clinical trial accruals 993 922 696 Other accruals 3,951 3,324 2,714 Externalisation revenue contract liabilities 92 Contingent consideration 867 555 527 Other payables 971 1,048 1,028 Total 12,841 11,641 10,486 Non-current liabilities Accruals 7 143 292 Externalisation revenue contract liabilities 78 Contingent consideration 4,239 4,979 4,930 Acerta Pharma put option liability Note 25 1,838 1,823 1,901 Other payables 608 895 2,365 Total 6,770 7,840 9,488 The Group has revised the presentation of Trade and other payables in 2018 to separately present clinical trial accruals, returns and other revenue accruals that have historically been presented within Trade payables see the Group Accounting policies section from page 153.
The Group has also separately presented the Acerta put option that has historically been presented within Other payables.
Included within Rebates, chargebacks, returns and other revenue accruals are contract liabilities of $126m 1 January 2018: $138m.
The revenue recognised in the year for contract liabilities is $139m, comprising $104m relating to other revenue accruals and $35m Externalisation Revenue contract liabilities.
Trade payables includes $166m 2017: $64m: 2016: $nil due to suppliers that have signed up to a supply chain financing programme, under which the suppliers can elect on a invoice by invoice basis to receive a discounted early payment from the partner bank rather than being paid in line with the agreed payment terms.
If the option is taken the Groups liability is assigned by the supplier to be due to the partner bank rather than the supplier.
The value of the liability payable by the Group remains unchanged.
The Group assesses the arrangement against indicators to assess if debts which vendors have sold to the funder under the supplier financing scheme continue to meet the definition of trade payables or should be classified as borrowings.
At 31 December 2018 the payables met the criteria of Trade payables.
The Acerta Pharma put option liability is remeasured each period, based on the latest assessment of the expected redemption amount with remeasurements taken to Selling, general and administrative costs see Note 2.
Interest arising from amortising the liability is included within Finance expense see Note 3.
The expected redemption amount is dependent on the accumulated profits of Calquence to the point of redemption, which may vary materially dependent on factors such as revenues earned, research and development expenditure, regulatory approvals received, and certain other expenses of Acerta Pharma B. V. and its subsidiaries.
The Group has adopted IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers from 1 January 2018 under the modified retrospective method.
Consequently, the Group has presented Externalisation revenue contract liabilities prospectively from that date.
With the exception of Contingent consideration payables of $5,106m 2017: $5,534m: 2016: $5,457m which are held at fair value within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as defined in Note 11, all other financial liabilities are held at amortised cost with carrying value being a reasonable approximation of fair value.

Revaluations of Contingent consideration are recognised in Selling, general and administrative costs and include a decrease of $482m in 2018 2017: an increase of $208m: 2016: a decrease of $999m based on revised milestone probabilities, and revenue and royalty forecasts, relating to the acquisition of BMSs share of the Global Diabetes Alliance.
Discount unwind on the liability is included within Finance expense see Note 3.
Management has identified that reasonably possible changes in certain key assumptions, including the likelihood of achieving successful trial results, obtaining regulatory approval, the projected market share of the therapeutic area and expected pricing for launched products, may cause the calculated fair value of the above contingent consideration to vary materially in future years.
The contingent consideration balance relating to BMSs share of Global Diabetes Alliance of $3,983m 2017: $4,477m: 2016: $4,240m would increase decrease by $398m with an increase decrease in sales of 10% as compared with the current estimates.

Exchange differences on the retranslation of the contingent consideration liability are recognised in Other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective.
Any ineffectiveness is taken to profit.
The amount of royalties payable under the arrangements is inherently uncertain and difficult to predict, given the direct link to future sales and the range of outcomes.
The maximum amount of royalties payable in each year is with reference to net sales.

Employee costs in connection with the initiatives are recognised in severance provisions.
Final severance costs are often subject to the completion of the requisite consultations on the areas impacted.
Details of the environmental and legal provisions are provided in Note 29.
Two payments totalling $145m were paid out of the legal provision during January 2019.

21 Post-retirement benefits Pensions Background The Company and most of its subsidiaries offer retirement plans which cover the majority of employees in the Group.
The Groups policy is to provide defined contribution DC orientated pension provision to its employees unless otherwise compelled by local regulation.
As a result, many of these retirement plans are DC, where the Group contribution and resulting charge is fixed at a set level or is a set percentage of employees pay.
However, several plans, mainly in the UK, the US and Sweden, are defined benefit DB, where benefits are based on employees length of service and linked to their salary.
The major defined benefit plans are now largely legacy arrangements as they have been closed to new entrants since 2000, apart from the collectively bargained Swedish plan which is still open to employees born before 1979.
During 2010, following consultation with its UK employees representatives, the Group introduced a freeze on pensionable pay at 30 June 2010 levels for defined benefit members of the UK Pension Fund.
The number of active members in the Fund continues to decline and is now approximately 700 employees.
In November 2017, the Group closed the qualified and non-qualified US defined benefit pension plans to future accrual and removed any salary link from 31 December 2017.
178 AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2018 Financial Statements Financial Statements The major defined benefit plans are funded through separate,  assets.
The cash funding of the plans, which may from time to time involve special Group payments, is designed, in consultation with independent qualified actuaries, to ensure that the assets are sufficient to meet future obligations as and when they fall due.
The funding level is monitored rigorously by the Group and local fiduciaries, taking into account: the Groups credit rating: local regulation: cash flows: and the solvency and maturity of the relevant pension scheme.
Financing principles Ninety one per cent of the Groups defined benefit obligations at 31 December 2018 are in schemes within the UK, the US and Sweden.
In these countries, the pension obligations are funded in line with the Groups financing principles.
There have been no fundamental changes to these principles during 2018.
The Group believes: In funding the benefits it promises to employees and meeting its obligations.
That the pension arrangements should be considered in the context of its broader capital structure.
In general, it does not believe in committing excessive capital for funding when the Group might use the capital elsewhere to reinvest in the wider business, nor does it wish to generate surpluses.
In taking some measured and rewarded risks with the investments underlying the funding, subject to a long-term plan to reduce those risks when opportunities arise.
That holding certain investments may cause volatility in the funding position.
However, the Group would not wish to amend its contribution level for relatively small deviations from its preferred funding level, because it is expected that there will be short-term volatility, but it is prepared to react appropriately to more significant deviations.
That proactive engagement with local Fiduciary Bodies is necessary and helpful to provide robust oversight and input in relation to funding and investment strategy and to facilitate liability management exercises appropriate to each pension plan.
In considering the use of alternative methods of providing security that do not require immediate cash funding but help mitigate exposure of the pension arrangement to the credit risk of the Group.
These principles are appropriate at the present date but they are kept under ongoing review, should circumstances change these principles may also be subject to change.
The Group has developed a long-term funding framework to implement these principles, which targets full funding on a low risk funding measure over the long term as the pension funds mature, with affordable long-term fide-risking of investment strategy over time.
Unless local regulation dictates otherwise, this framework determines the cash contributions payable to the pension funds.
A key element of this funding framework is the investment strategy used to grow existing assets and hedge against changes in liability values.
The Group provides regular input to local fiduciary boards with the aim of ensuring that an appropriate investment return is targeted over the long term in a risk-controlled manner.
UK The UK defined benefit pension fund represents approximately 62% of the Groups defined benefit obligations at 31 December 2018.
The financing principles are modified in light of the UK regulatory requirements summarised below and resulting discussions with the Pension Fund Trustee.
Role of Trustees and Regulation UK The UK Pension Fund is governed and administered by a corporate Trustee which is legally separate from the Group.
The Trustee Directors are comprised of representatives appointed by both the employer and employees, and include an independent professional Trustee Director.
The Trustee Directors are required by law to act in the interest of all relevant beneficiaries and are responsible in particular for the asset investment policy and the day-to-day administration of the benefits.
They are also responsible for jointly agreeing with the employer the level of contributions due to the UK Pension Fund see below.
The UK pensions market is regulated by The Pensions Regulator whose statutory objectives and regulatory powers are described on its website, www.
Funding requirements UK UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently.
On a triennial basis, the Trustee and the Group must agree the contributions required if any to ensure the Fund is fully funded over an appropriate time-period and on a suitably prudent measure.
The last full actuarial valuation of the AstraZeneca Pension Fund was carried out by a qualified actuary as at 31 March 2016 and following discussions between the Group and Trustee was finalised and accepted by The Pensions Regulator in 2017.
The next actuarial valuation is due to take place as at 31 March 2019, with a likely timescale for completion in early to mid-2020.
In relation to deficit recovery contributions, a lump sum contribution of 51m $68m was made in March 2018, with a further 51m contribution due before 31 March 2019.
In addition, a contribution of 26m $35m was made in March 2018, with a further contribution of 27m due before 31 March 2019, in relation to part payment of the deferred contribution explained below.
During 2017, the Group provided a letter of credit to the Trustee, to underwrite the deferral of an additional deficit recovery contribution payment of approximately 126m which was due in 2017.
This contribution will now be paid in five instalments with interest added each year from March 2018 to March 2022.
The letter of credit underwriting these payments will be renewed each year, but will reduce in value as each annual payment is made.
The Group entered into a long-term funding agreement with the Trustee in October 2016 under which the Group will grant a charge in favour of the Trustee over certain land and buildings at the Cambridge Biomedical Campus, which would crystallise only in the event of the Groups insolvency.
This charge will provide security in respect of future UK Pension Fund contributions.
Under the funding assumptions used to set the statutory funding target, the key assumptions from the actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2016 were as follows: long-term UK price inflation set at 2.6% per annum: salary increases at 0% per annum as a result of pensionable pay levels being frozen in 2010 : pension increases at 2.85% per annum: and discount rate at 3.71% per annum.
The resulting valuation of the Funds liabilities on that basis were 5,265m $6,710m compared to a market value of assets at 31 March 2016 of 4,492m $5,724m.
Under the governing documentation of the UK Pension Fund, any future surplus in the Fund would be returnable to the Group by refund assuming gradual settlement of the liabilities over the lifetime of the Fund.
As such, there are no adjustments required in respect of IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction.
AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2018 Notes to the Group Financial Statements 179 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 21 Post-retirement benefits continued GMP Equalisation UK A UK High Court judgment was issued on 26 October 2018 relating to Guaranteed Minimum Pensions GMP.
Although the ruling relates to the Lloyds Banking Group pension schemes, it is expected to create a precedent for other UK defined benefit pension schemes.
The ruling requires the equalisation of member benefits earned between 1990 and 1997 to address gender inequality in instances where GMP benefits are currently unequal.
While there remains some uncertainty, the Group has made a provision for the estimated financial impact of this ruling on the UK Pension Fund, based on a comparison of the cumulative value of members benefits with the benefits of a notional member of the opposite gender method C2 under the terminology of the High Court Judgement.
The estimated impact is based on the broad profile of the Fund ie age profile, service profile and GMP proportion and a past service cost of 17m $23m has been recognised in the year ended 31 December 2018.
Further work will be carried out with the Trustee over 2019 to determine the exact impact.
Rest of Group The IAS 19 positions for the US and Sweden as at 31 December 2018 are shown below.
These plans account for 29% of the Groups defined benefit obligations.
The US and Sweden pension funds are governed by Fiduciary Bodies with responsibility for the investment policies of those funds.
These plans are funded in line with the Groups financing principles and contributions are paid as prescribed by the long-term funding framework subject to local regulations being met.
The US defined benefit pension plans were actuarially revalued at 31 December 2018, when plan obligations were $1,463m and plan assets were $1,379m.
This includes obligations in respect of the non-qualified plan which is unfunded.
There has been an improvement in the funding position of the qualified US pension plan and it is now close to being fully funded on the IAS 19 basis.
As the funding position improved over 2018, the investment strategy was fide-risked, reducing equity exposure and increasing the interest rate hedge.
The Swedish defined benefit pension plans were actuarially valued at 31 December 2018, when plan obligations were estimated to amount to $1,872m and plan assets were $1,017m.
It should be noted that the Swedish plans have a funding surplus on the local GAAP accounting basis and this influences contribution policy.
On current bases, it is expected that ongoing contributions excluding those in respect of past service deficit contributions during the year ending 31 December 2019 for the three main countries will be approximately $32m.
Post-retirement benefits other than pensions In the US, and to a lesser extent in certain other countries, AstraZenecas employment practices include the provision of healthcare and life assurance benefits for retired employees.
As at 31 December 2018, some 3,215 retired employees and covered dependants currently benefit from these provisions and some 2,231 current employees will be eligible on their retirement.
AstraZeneca accrues for the present value of such retiree obligations over the working life of the employee.
In practice, these benefits will be funded with reference to the financing principles.
The cost of post-retirement benefits other than pensions for the Group in 2018 was $5m 2017: $14m: 2016: $17m.
Plan assets were $260m and plan obligations were $263m at 31 December 2018.
These benefit plans have been included in the disclosure of post-retirement benefits under IAS 19.
Financial assumptions Qualified independent actuaries have updated the actuarial valuations under IAS 19 of the major defined benefit schemes operated by the Group to 31 December 2018.
The assumptions used may not necessarily be borne out in practice, due to the inherent financial and demographic uncertainty associated with making long-term projections.
These assumptions were as follows: 2018 2017 UK RestofGroup UK RestofGroup Inflation assumption 3.2% 1.1% 3.1% 2.2% 1 1 Rate of increase in salaries 2.0% 3.1% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.0% 1.1% 2.9% 1.1% 2 2 Discount rate defined benefit obligation 2.8% 3.0% 2.5% 3.0% 2 3 3 Discount rate interest cost 2.4% 2.5% 2.5% 2.7% 2 3 3 Discount rate service cost 2.5% 2.9% 2.7% 3.5% 1 Pensionable pay frozen at 30 June 2010 levels following UK fund changes.

3 2018 interest costs and service costs calculated using discount rates based on market conditions as at 31 December 2017.
In the UK, a new assumption has been made that 30% of members will transfer out of the defined benefit section of the AstraZeneca Pension Fund at the point of retirement.
This assumption is based on Fund experience since pensions freedoms legislation came into effect in April 2015 and will be reviewed each year to ensure it remains appropriate.
The assumption has the impact of reducing liabilities by approximately 53m $70m and has been recorded in Other comprehensive income.
The weighted average duration of the post-retirement scheme obligations in the UK is 16 years and 15 years in the Rest of Group.
Demographic assumptions The mortality assumptions are based on country-specific mortality tables.
These are compared to actual experience and adjusted where sufficient data is available.
Additional allowance for future improvements in life expectancy is included for all major schemes where there is credible data to support a continuing trend.

Risks associated with the Groups defined benefit pensions The UK defined benefit plan accounts for 62% of the Groups defined benefit obligations and exposes the Group to a number of risks, the most significant of which are: Risk Description Mitigation Volatile asset returns The Defined Benefit Obligation DBO is calculated using a discount In order to mitigate investment risk, the Trustee invests in a suitably rate set with reference to AA-rated corporate bond yields: asset returns diversified range of asset classes, return drivers and investment that differ from the discount rate will create an element of volatility in managers.
The investment strategy will continue to evolve to further the solvency ratio.

expectancy over the next 75years for around 10,000 of the UK Pension Funds current pensioners and covers $2.1bn of the UK Pension Funds liabilities.
A one-year increase in life expectancy will result in a $217m increase in pension fund assets.
Other risks There are a number of other risks of running the UK Pension Fund including counterparty risks from using derivatives mitigated by using a diversified range of counterparties of high standing and ensuring positions are collateralised daily.
Furthermore, there are operational risks such as paying out the wrong benefits and legislative risks such as the government increasing the burden on companies through new legislation.
These are mitigated so far as possible via the governance structure in place which oversees and administers the pension funds.
The Groups pension plans in the US and Sweden also manage these key risks, where they are relevant, in a similar manner, with the local fiduciary bodies investing in a diversified growth portfolio and employing a framework to hedge interest rate risk.
Post-retirement scheme deficit The assets and obligations of the defined benefit schemes operated by the Group at 31 December 2018, as calculated in accordance with IAS 19, are shown overleaf.
The fair values of the schemes assets are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised.
The present value of the schemes obligations is derived from cash flow projections over long periods and is therefore inherently uncertain.

The past service cost in 2018 also includes costs predominantly related to enhanced pensions in early retirement in the UK and Sweden.
Group costs in respect of defined contribution schemes during the year were $341m 2017: $304m.
Rate sensitivities The following table shows the US dollar effect of a change in the significant actuarial assumptions used to determine the retirement benefits obligations in our three main defined benefit pension obligation countries.
2 Of the $301m increase, $217m is covered by the longevity swap.
3 Of the $302m decrease, $212m is covered by the longevity swap.
The sensitivity to the financial assumptions shown above has been estimated taking into account the approximate duration of the liabilities and the overall profile of the plan membership.
The sensitivity to the life expectancy assumption has been estimated based on the distribution of the plan cash flows.
22 Reserves Retained earnings The cumulative amount of goodwill written off directly to reserves resulting from acquisitions, net of disposals, amounted to $619m 2017: $631m: 2016: $613m using year-end rates of exchange.

With effect from 1 January 2018, the Company has disclosed separately the costs of hedging of cross currency interest rate swaps in cash flow hedges and net investment hedges.
The cumulative gain with respect to costs of hedging is $47m and the loss during the year was $54m.
The balance remaining in the foreign currency translation reserve from net investment hedging relationships for which hedge accounting no longer applied is a gain of 154m.
Other reserves The other reserves arose from the cancellation of 1,255m of share premium account by the Company in 1993 and the redenomination of share capital $157m in 1999.

This put option gives rise to a liability which is recorded at the present value of the expected redemption amount, calculated using a probability-weighted model based on forecast revenue and earnings of Acerta Pharma, and is recorded within Non-current other payables see Note 19.
The forecast revenue and earnings of Acerta Pharma will particularly be affected by the outcome of ongoing clinical trials and regulatory submissions relating to Calquence.
If actual earnings are lower than forecast, the liability for the put option will decrease.
Similarly, if actual earnings are higher than forecast, the liability for the put option will increase.
The value of the liability is also sensitive to the expected timing of exercise.
The amount of the liability is not directly correlated to time until the expected date of exercise.
During the year, the liability was remeasured due to a change in the expected timing of the exercise of the put option, while during 2017, Calquence received regulatory approval in the US for the treatment of adult patients with mantle cell lymphoma MCL who have received at least one prior therapy.
This approval has changed the weighted probability of certain outcomes in respect of the forecast earnings of Acerta Pharma and has brought forward the weighted average expected exercise date of the put option.
The changes to these assumptions resulted in a decrease 2017: decrease: 2016 decrease in the liability for the year before the effect of interest costs.
On exercise of the put option, the associated cash flows will be disclosed as financing activities within the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
26 Acquisitions of business operations There were no acquisitions of business operations in 2018 or 2017.
2016 Acquisitions Acerta Pharma On 2 February 2016, AstraZeneca completed an agreement to invest in a majority equity stake in Acerta Pharma, a privately-owned biopharmaceutical company based in the Netherlands and US.
The transaction provides AstraZeneca with a potential best-in-class irreversible oral Brutons tyrosine kinase BTK inhibitor, Calquence, currently in Phase III development for B-cell blood cancers and in Phase I II clinical trials in multiple solid tumours.
Acerta Pharma has approximately 150 employees.
Under the terms of the agreement, AstraZeneca has acquired 55% of the issued share capital of Acerta Pharma for an upfront payment of $2.5bn.
A further payment of $1.5bn was due either on receipt of the first regulatory approval for Calquence for any indication in the US, or the end of 2018, depending on which was first.
This was paid in 2017 on receipt of first regulatory approval in the US.
The agreement also includes options which, if exercised, provide the opportunity for Acerta Pharmas shareholders to sell, and AstraZeneca to buy, the remaining 45% of shares in Acerta Pharma.
The options can be exercised at various points in time, conditional on the first approval of Calquence in both the US and Europe and when the extent of the commercial opportunity has been fully established, at a price of approximately $3bn net of certain costs and payments incurred by AstraZeneca and net of agreed future adjusting items, using a pre-agreed pricing mechanism.
The acquiring entity within the Group was a Swedish krona functional currency subsidiary.
Foreign currency risk arises from the retranslation of the US dollar denominated liabilities arising from the transaction.
To manage this foreign currency risk these liabilities have been designated as the hedge instrument in a net investment hedge of the Groups underlying US dollar net investments.
AstraZenecas 55% holding is a controlling interest and Acerta Pharmas combination of intangible product rights with an established workforce and their operating processes requires that the transaction is accounted for as a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3.
Goodwill is principally attributable to the value of the specialist know-how inherent in the acquired workforce and the accounting for deferred taxes.
Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Acerta Pharmas results have been consolidated into the Groups results from 2 February 2016.
From the period from acquisition to 31 December 2016, Acerta Pharma had no revenues and its loss after tax was $212m.
If the acquisition had taken effect at the beginning of the reporting period in which the acquisition occurred 1 January 2016, on a pro forma basis, the revenue of the combined Group for 2016 would have been unchanged and the profit after tax would have been $3,367m.
This pro forma information does not purport to represent the results of the combined Group that actually would have occurred had the acquisition taken place on 1 January 2016 and should not be taken to be representative of future results.

186 AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2018 Financial Statements Financial Statements 27 Financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank overdrafts, finance leases, loans, current and non-current investments, cash and short-term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage the Groups funding and liquidity requirements.
The Group has other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those of liquidity, interest rate, foreign currency and credit.
Each of these is managed in accordance with Board-approved policies.
These policies are set out below.
The Group uses foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency forwards and swaps, currency options, interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps for the purpose of hedging its foreign currency and interest rate risks.
The Group may designate certain financial instruments as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges in accordance with IFRS 9.
Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument.
Sources of hedge effectiveness will depend on the hedge relationship designation but may include: A significant change in the credit risk of either party to the hedging relationship.
A timing mismatch between the hedging instrument and the hedged item.
Movements in foreign currency basis spread for derivatives in a fair value hedge.
A significant change in the value of the foreign currency denominated net assets of the Group in a net investment hedge.
The hedge ratio for each designation will be established by comparing the quantity of the hedging instrument and the quantity of the hedged item to determine their relative weighting: for all of the Groups existing hedge relationships the hedge ratio has been determined as 1:1.
Key controls applied to transactions in derivative financial instruments are: to use only instruments where good market liquidity exists, to revalue all financial instruments regularly using current market rates and to sell options only to offset previously purchased options or as part of a risk management strategy.
The Group is not a net seller of options, and does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Capital management The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders equity Note 23, debt Note 18, other current investments Note 11 and cash Note 16.
For the foreseeable future, the Board will maintain a capital structure that supports the Groups strategic objectives through: managing funding and liquidity risk optimising shareholder return maintaining a strong, investment-grade credit rating.
The Group utilises factoring arrangements for selected trade receivables.
These factoring arrangements qualify for full derecognition of the associated trade receivables under IFRS 9.
Amounts due, on invoices that have not been factored at year end, from customers that are subject to factoring arrangements are disclosed in Note 15.
Funding and liquidity risk are reviewed regularly by the Board and managed in accordance with policies described below.
The Boards distribution policy comprises a regular cash dividend and, subject to business needs, a share repurchase component.
The Board regularly reviews its shareholders return strategy, and in 2012 decided to suspend share repurchases in order to retain strategic flexibility.
The Groups net debt position loans and borrowings net of Cash and cash equivalents, other investments and derivative financial instruments has increased from a net debt position of $12,679m at the beginning of the year to a net debt position of $13,003m at 31 December 2018.
Liquidity risk The Board reviews the Groups ongoing liquidity risks annually as part of the planning process and on an ad hoc basis.
The Board considers short-term requirements against available sources of funding, taking into account forecast cash flows.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining access to a number of sources of funding which are sufficient to meet anticipated funding requirements.
Specifically, the Group uses US commercial paper, bank loans, committed bank facilities and cash resources to manage short-term liquidity and manages long-term liquidity by raising funds through the capital markets.
The Group is assigned short-term credit ratings of P-2 by Moodys and A-2 by Standard and Poors.
The Groups long-term credit rating is A3 negative outlook by Moodys and BBB stable outlook by Standard and Poors.
In addition to Cash and cash equivalents of $4,831m, short-term fixed income investments of $809m, fixed deposits of $40m, less overdrafts of $160m at 31 December 2018, the Group has committed bank facilities of $4.1bn available to manage liquidity.
At 31 December 2018, the Group has issued $3,792m under a Euro Medium Term Note programme and $14,546m under a SEC-registered programme.
The Group increased its committed bank facilities by $1.1bn in the year to a total of $4.1bn at 31 December 2018.
$0.2bn of the new facilities mature in December 2019 but have a one-year extension option, exercisable by the Group.
$0.5bn of the new facilities mature in December 2020 but have a one-year extension option, exercisable by the Group.
$0.4bn of the new facilities, together with the existing $3bn of facilities, mature in April 2022.
The funds made available under these facility agreements may be used for the general corporate purposes of the Group.
The Group regularly monitors the credit standing of the banking group and currently does not anticipate any issue with drawing on the committed facilities should this be necessary.
Advances under the revolving facilities bear an interest rate per annum based on LIBOR or other relevant benchmark rate plus a margin.
The facility agreements contain no financial covenants.
At 31 December 2018 the facilities were undrawn.

Where interest payments are on a floating rate basis, it is assumed that rates will remain unchanged from the last business day of each year ended 31 December.
It is not expected that the cash flows in the maturity profile could occur significantly earlier or at significantly different amounts, with the exception of $5,106m of contingent consideration and $1,838m arising from the put option over the non-controlling interest in Acerta Pharma, both held within Other payables see Note 19.
Market risk Interest rate risk The Group maintains a mix of fixed and floating rate debt.
The portion of fixed rate debt was approved by the Board and any variation requires Board approval.
A significant portion of the long-term debt is held at fixed rates of interest.
The Group uses interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements to manage this mix.
During the year, the Group issued $1.25bn of bonds maturing in 2023, $1.0bn in 2029 and $0.75bn in 2048.
These were to refinance the $1.4bn of bonds maturing in 2018 and for general corporate purposes.
188 AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2018 Financial Statements Financial Statements At 31 December 2018, the Group held interest rate swaps with a notional value of $0.29bn, converting the 7% guaranteed debentures payable in 2023 to floating rates.
No new interest rate swaps were entered into during 2018.
At 31 December 2018, swaps with a notional value of $0.29bn related to debt designated as fair value through profit or loss.
Designated hedges are expected to be effective and therefore the impact of ineffectiveness on profit is not expected to be material.
The accounting treatment for fair value hedges and debt designated as fair value through profit or loss is disclosed in the Group Accounting Policies section from page 157.
The majority of surplus cash is currently invested in US dollar liquidity funds, fully collateralised repurchase arrangements and investment grade fixed income securities.
The interest rate profile of the Groups interest-bearing financial instruments, as at 31 December 2018, 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016, is set out below.
In the case of current and non-current financial liabilities, the classification includes the impact of interest rate swaps which convert the debt to floating rate.
Foreign currency risk The US dollar is the Groups most significant currency.
As a consequence, the Group results are presented in US dollars and exposures are managed against US dollars accordingly.
Translational Approximately 67% of Group external sales in 2018 were denominated in currencies other than the US dollar, while a significant proportion of manufacturing, and research and development costs were denominated in pounds sterling and Swedish krona.
Surplus cash generated by business units is substantially converted to, and held centrally in, US dollars.
As a result, operating profit and total cash flow in US dollars will be affected by movements in exchange rates.
This currency exposure is managed centrally, based on forecast cash flows.
The impact of movements in exchange rates is mitigated significantly by the correlations which exist between the major currencies to which the Group is exposed and the US dollar.
Monitoring of currency exposures and correlations is undertaken on a regular basis and hedging is subject to pre-execution approval.
As at 31 December 2018, before impact of derivatives, 2.4% of interest-bearing loans and borrowings were denominated in pounds sterling and 18.3% were denominated in euros.
Where there is non-US dollar debt and an underlying net investment of that amount in the same currency, the Group applies net investment hedging.
Exchange differences on the retranslation of debt designated as net investment hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective.
The Group holds cross-currency swaps to hedge against the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
Fair value movements on the revaluation of the cross-currency swaps are recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective, with any ineffectiveness taken to profit.
Foreign currency risk arises when the Group has inter-company funding and investments in certain subsidiaries operating in countries with exchange controls or where there is risk of significant future currency devaluation.
One indicator of potential foreign currency risk is where a country is officially designated as hyper inflationary.
As at 31 December 2018, the Group operates in two countries designated as hyper inflationary being Argentina and Venezuela.
The foreign exchange risk to the Group from Argentina is immaterial.
At the start of 2018 Venezuela operated a two tier exchange rate system with a heavily subsidised DIPRO rate for essential goods and services and a second rate, DICOM, to cover all other non-essentials.
During 2017 the Group had begun to use the DICOM rate for the consolidation of its financial statements, believing that this was the best expectation of the rate at which profits would be remitted.
As a result of this the Group was unaffected by the elimination of the DIPRO rate in early 2018.
The foreign exchange risk to the Group from Venezuela is immaterial.
Transactional The Group aims to hedge all its forecast major transactional currency exposures on working capital balances, which typically extend for up to three months, are hedged, where practicable, using forward foreign exchange contracts against individual Group companies reporting currency.
In addition, the Groups external dividend, which is paid principally in pounds sterling and Swedish krona, is fully hedged from announcement to payment date.
Foreign exchange gains and losses on forward contracts transacted for transactional hedging are taken to profit.
Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis set out overleaf summarises the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to hypothetical changes in market rates and prices.
The range of variables chosen for the sensitivity analysis reflects our view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one-year period.
Market values are the present value of future cash flows based on market rates and prices at the valuation date.
For long-term debt, an increase in interest rates results in a decline in the fair value of debt.
AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2018 Notes to the Group Financial Statements 189 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 27 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 100 basis point change in interest rates in all currencies from their levels at 31 December 2018, with all other variables held constant.
Based on the composition of our long-term debt portfolio as at 31 December 2018, a 1% increase in interest rates would result in an additional $17m in interest expense being incurred per year.
The exchange rate sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 31 December 2018, with all other variables held constant.
The 10% case assumes a 10% strengthening of the US dollar against all other currencies and the -10% case assumes a 10% weakening of the US dollar.
Each incremental 10% movement in foreign currency exchange rates would have approximately the same effect as the initial 10% detailed in the table below and each incremental 1% change in interest rates would have approximately the same effect as the 1% detailed in the table below.

In 2017 and 2016 the sensitivity was calculated as 10% of year end exposure.
The sensitivity is now calculated by dividing the non-USD balances by adjusted foreign rates.
This does not have a material impact on results but has resulted in the weakening and strengthening values no longer being symmetrical.
There have been no other changes in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis.
Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk on financial assets, such as cash investments, derivative instruments, and Trade and other receivables.
The Group is also exposed in its Net asset position to its own credit risk in respect of the 2023 debentures which are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss.
Under IFRS 9, the Group records the effect of the losses and gains, arising from own credit risk, on the fair value of bonds designated at fair value through profit or loss in Other comprehensive income.
Financial counterparty credit risk The majority of the AstraZeneca Groups cash is centralised within the Group Treasury entity and is subject to counterparty risk on the principal invested.
The level of the Groups cash investments and hence credit risk will depend on the cash flow generated by the Group and the timing of the use of that cash.
The credit risk is mitigated through a policy of prioritising security and liquidity over return, and, as such, cash is only invested in high credit quality investments.
Counterparty limits are set according to the assessed risk of each counterparty and exposures are monitored against these limits on a regular basis.
The Groups principal financial counterparty credit risks at 31 December 2018 were as follows: Current assets 2018 2017 2016 $m $m $m Cash at bank and in hand 893 784 782 Money market liquidity fund 3,435 1,150 3,440 Collateralised repurchase agreement 400 1,150 950 1 Bank collateral 242 Other short-term cash equivalents 103 240 88 Total Cash and cash equivalents Note 16 4,831 3,324 5,018 Fixed income securities at fair value through profit and loss Note 11 809 Fixed income securities available for sale Note 11 1,150 847 Fixed deposits Note 11 40 80 37 Total derivative financial instruments Note 12 258 28 27 Current assets subject to credit risk 5,938 4,582 5,929 1 In 2017 the Group changed its accounting policy such that collateral receipts were included in interest bearing loans and borrowings.

The majority of excess cash is centralised within the Group treasury entity and is subject to counterparty risk on the principal invested.
This risk is mitigated through a policy of prioritising security and liquidity over return, and, as such, cash is only invested in high credit quality investments.
The majority of the Groups cash is invested in US dollar AAA-rated liquidity funds, fully collateralised repurchase agreements and short-term bank deposits.
The money market liquidity fund portfolios are managed by five external third-party fund managers to maintain an AAA rating.
The Groups investments represent no more than 10% of each overall fund value.
There were no other significant concentrations of financial credit risk at the reporting date.
The short-term repurchase agreements are fully collateralised investments.
The collateral is fixed income in nature and is held by a third party custodian and represents approximately 101% of the value of the cash deposited.
The minimum long term credit rating of the collateral is BBB minus.
In the event of any default, ownership of the collateral would revert to the Group, and would be readily convertible to cash.
The fixed income securities are managed by four external third-party fund managers.
The long term rating of these securities was BBB minus or better.
All financial derivatives are transacted with commercial banks, in line with standard market practice.
The Group has agreements with some bank counterparties whereby the parties agree to post cash collateral, for the benefit of the other, equivalent to the market valuation of the derivative positions above a predetermined threshold.
The carrying value of such cash collateral held by the Group at 31 December 2018 was $384m 2017: $513m: 2016: $322m and the carrying value of each cash collateral posted by the Group at 31 December 2018 was $14m 2017: $nil: 2016: $80m.
The impairment provision for other financial assets at 31 December 2018 was immaterial.
Equity securities represent non-controlling investments in third-party pharmaceutical companies.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise and credit limits are set as deemed appropriate for the customer.
The Group is exposed to customers ranging from government-backed agencies and large private wholesalers to privately owned pharmacies, and the underlying local economic and sovereign risks vary throughout the world.
Where appropriate, the Group endeavours to minimise risks by the use of trade finance instruments such as letters of credit and insurance.
Following the adoption of IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018 the Group introduced the expected credit loss approach to establish an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of expected losses in respect of Trade and other receivables.
Given the general quality and short-term nature of our trade receivables, there was no material impact assessed arising from the introduction of this method.
The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables.
To measure expected credit losses trade receivables have been grouped based on shared credit characteristics and the days past due.
The expected loss rates are based on payment profiles over a period of 36 months before 31 December 2018 or 1 January 2018 respectively and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period.
The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customer to settle the receivables.
On that basis, the loss allowance as at 31 December 2018 and 1 January 2018 was determined as follows: 0-90 days 90-180 days Over 180 days 31December 2018 Current past due past due past due Total Expected loss rate 0.05% 0.75% 10% 47% Gross carrying amount 2,854 82 27 70 3,033 Loss allowance 1 1 3 33 38 0-90 days 90-180 days Over 180 days 1January 2018 Current past due past due past due Total Expected loss rate 0.05% 0.75% 5% 33% Gross carrying amount 2,490 262 31 35 2,818 Loss allowance 1 2 1 12 16 Trade receivables are written off where there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.
Impairment losses on trade receivables are presented as net impairment losses within operating profit, any subsequent recoveries are credited against the same line.
In the US, sales to three wholesalers accounted for approximately 88% of US sales 2017: three wholesalers accounted for approximately 60%: 2016: three wholesalers accounted for approximately 83%.

The Directors believe that, together with the basic salary system, the Groups employee incentive schemes provide competitive and market-related packages to motivate employees.
They should also align the interests of employees with those of shareholders, as a whole, through long-term share ownership in the Company.
The Groups current UK, Swedish and US schemes are described below: other arrangements apply elsewhere.
Bonus plans The AstraZeneca UK Performance Bonus Plan Employees of participating AstraZeneca UK companies are invited to participate in this bonus plan, which rewards strong individual performance.
The AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme This scheme is a performance bonus scheme for Directors and senior employees who do not participate in the AstraZeneca UK Performance Bonus Plan.
Annual bonuses are paid in cash and reflect both corporate and individual performance measures.
The Remuneration Committee has discretion to reduce or withhold bonuses if business performance falls sufficiently short of expectations in any year such as to make the payment of bonuses inappropriate.
The AstraZeneca Deferred Bonus Plan This plan was introduced in 2006 and is used to defer a portion of the bonus earned under the AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme into Ordinary Shares in the Company for a period of three years.
The plan currently operates only in respect of Executive Directors and members of the SET.
Awards of shares under this plan are typically made in March each year, the first award having been made in February 2006.
192 AstraZeneca Annual Report & Form 20-F Information 2018 Financial Statements Financial Statements Sweden In Sweden, an all-employee performance bonus plan is in operation, which rewards strong individual performance.
Bonuses are paid 50% into a fund investing in AstraZeneca equities and 50% in cash.
The AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme, the AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan and the AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan all operate in respect of relevant AstraZeneca employees in Sweden.
US In the US, there are two all-employee short-term or annual performance bonus plans in operation to differentiate and reward strong individual performance.
Annual bonuses are paid in cash.
There is also one senior staff long-term incentive scheme, under which 123 participants may be eligible for awards granted as AstraZeneca ADSs.
AstraZeneca ADSs necessary to satisfy the awards are purchased in the market or funded via a share trust.
The AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan and the AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan operate in respect of relevant employees in the US.
Share plans The charge for share-based payments in respect of share plans is $219m 2017: $220m: 2016: $241m.
The plans are equity settled.
The AstraZeneca UK All-Employee Share Plan The Company offers UK employees the opportunity to buy Partnership Shares Ordinary Shares.
Employees may invest up to 1,800 over a 12-month accumulation period and purchase Partnership Shares in the Company with the total proceeds at the end of the period.
The purchase price for the shares is the lower of the price at the beginning or the end of the 12-month period.
In 2010, the Company introduced a Matching Share element, the first award of which was made in 2011.
Currently one Matching Share is awarded for every four Partnership Shares purchased.
Partnership Shares and Matching Shares are held in the HM Revenue & Customs HMRCapproved All-Employee Share Plan.
At the Companys AGM in 2002, shareholders approved the issue of new shares for the purposes of the All-Employee Share Plan.
The AstraZeneca 2014 Performance Share Plan PSP This plan was approved by shareholders in 2014 for a period of 10 years and replaces the AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan.
Generally, awards can be granted at any time, but not during a closed period of the Company.
The first grant of awards was made in May 2014.
Awards granted under the plan vest after three years, or in the case of Executive Directors and members of the SET, after an additional two-year holding period, and can be subject to the achievement of performance conditions.
For awards granted to all participants in 2018, vesting is subject to a combination of measures focused on scientific leadership, revenue growth and financial performance.
The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for agreeing any awards under the plan and for setting the policy for the way in which the plan should be operated, including agreeing performance targets and which employees should be invited to participate.
The main grant of awards in 2018 under the plan took place in March with further grants in May and August.
The AstraZeneca Investment Plan AZIP This plan was introduced in 2010 and approved by shareholders at the 2010 AGM.
The final grant of awards under this plan took place in March 2016.
Awards granted under the plan vest after eight years and are subject to performance conditions measured over a period of between three and eight years.

Research and development collaboration payments The Group has various ongoing collaborations, including in-licensing and similar arrangements with development partners.
Such collaborations may require the Group to make payments on achievement of stages of development, launch or revenue milestones, although the Group generally has the right to terminate these agreements at no cost.
The Group recognises research and development milestones as intangible assets once it is committed to payment, which is generally when the Group reaches set trigger points in the development cycle.
Revenue-related milestones are recognised as Intangible assets on product launch at a value based on the Groups long-term revenue forecasts for the related product.
The table below indicates potential development and revenue-related payments that the Group may be required to make under such collaborations.

Revenue-related milestone payments represent the maximum possible amount payable on achievement of specified levels of revenue as set out in individual contract agreements, but exclude variable payments that are based on unit sales eg royalty-type payments which are expensed as the associated sale is recognised.
The table excludes any payments already capitalised in the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2018.
The future payments we disclose represent contracted payments and, as such, are not discounted and are not risk adjusted.
As detailed in the Risk section from page 220, the development of any pharmaceutical product candidate is a complex and risky process that may fail at any stage in the development process due to a number of factors including items such as failure to obtain regulatory approval, unfavourable data from key studies, adverse reactions to the product candidate or indications of other safety concerns.
The timing of the payments is based on the Groups current best estimate of achievement of the relevant milestone.
