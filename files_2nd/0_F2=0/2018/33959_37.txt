General information Babcock International PLC is incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
The address of the registered office is 33 Wigmore Street, London, W1U 1QX.
Significant accounting policies The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented.
Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101, Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial instruments on a going concern basis.
The financial statements are prepared in Sterling which is the functional currency of the Company and rounded to the nearest million.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with FRS 101 requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Companys accounting policies.
The following exemptions from the requirements of IFRS have been applied in the preparation of these financial statements, in accordance with FRS 101: Paragraphs 45 b and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2, Share based payments IFRS 7, Financial instruments: Disclosures Paragraphs 91 to 99 of IFRS 13, Fair value measurement disclosure of valuation techniques and inputs used for fair value measurement of assets and liabilities Paragraph 38 of IAS 1, Presentation of financial statements comparative information in respect of: paragraph 79 a iv of IAS 1, Share capital and reserves: paragraph 73 e of IAS 16, Property, plant and equipment: and paragraph 118 e of IAS 38, Intangible assets reconciliations between the carrying amount at the beginning and end of the period The following paragraphs of IAS 1, Presentation of financial statements: 10 d, 10 f, 16, 38, 40, 111, and 134-136 IAS 7, Statement of cash flows Paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8, Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors Paragraph 17 of IAS 24, Related party transactions in respect of key management compensation The requirements of IAS 24, Related party disclosures to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, the Directors consider it appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these financial statements.
Investments Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment in value.
Taxation Current income tax Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
However, if the deferred income tax arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for.
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.

Significant accounting policies continued Taxation continued Deferred income tax continued Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in either other comprehensive income or in equity.
Finance costs Finance costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
Employee benefits a Share-based compensation The Company operates equity-settled, share-based compensation plans which are recharged to the relevant subsidiaries.
Full details of the share-based compensation plans are disclosed in note 23 to the Group financial statements.
b Treasury shares The shares purchased by the Companys ESOP trusts are recognised as a deduction to equity.
See note 22 to the Group financial statements for further details.
c Pension arrangements The Company operates a multi-employer defined benefit pension scheme, however all assets and liabilities are recognised in the relevant subsidiary in which the employee operates.
See note 24 to the Group financial statements for further details.
Derivative financial instruments Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
The Company designates certain of the derivative instruments within its portfolio to be hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or unrecognised firm commitments.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
For derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are deferred in equity until such time as the firm commitment is recognised, at which point any deferred gain or loss is included in the assets carrying amount.
These gains or losses are then realised through the income statement as the asset is sold.
Certain derivatives do not qualify or are not designated as hedging instruments and any movement in their fair value is recognised in the profit and loss account immediately.
Financial risk management All treasury transactions are carried out only with prime rated counterparties as are investments of cash and cash equivalents.
Dividends Dividends are recognised in the Companys financial statements in the period in which they are approved and in the case of interims, when paid.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the year.
However, the nature of estimation means that actual outcomes could differ from those estimates.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
There are no key estimate or judgements for the Company.
