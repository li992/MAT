The consolidated financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRS and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Company continues to prepare its parent Company financial statements in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101.
This section sets out the Groups accounting policies that relate to the financial statements as a whole.
Where an accounting policy is specific to one note, the policy is described in the note to which it relates.
The accounting policies have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements and have been applied consistently by all subsidiaries and joint ventures.
The Group prepares its annual consolidated financial statements on a 52 or 53 week basis.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared for the 52 weeks ended 29 December 2018 2017: 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017.
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments and certain investments which are measured at their fair value.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling.
All values are stated in million m except where otherwise indicated.
Going concern The Group reported a profit for the year of 230 million 2017: 209 million and generated operating cash inflows of 450 million 2017: 413 million.
Following refinancing activities that completed in May 2018, the Group is now funded by senior unsecured notes due for repayment in 2022 and 2026 and a multi-currency revolving credit facility maturing in April 2023.
The Groups forecasts show that it is expected to be able to operate within the terms of these facilities.
Further details of these facilities are provided in note 4.2.
After reviewing the Groups and Companys statement of financial position, available facilities, cash flow forecasts and trading budgets, the Directors believe the Group to be operationally and financially sound and have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the next 12 months.
Accordingly, the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its consolidated financial statements.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Merlin Entertainments plc and its subsidiaries at the end of each reporting period and include its share of its joint ventures results using the equity method.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns through its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated.
Where subsidiaries enter into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the Group, these are considered to be insurance arrangements and accounted for as such.
In this respect, the subsidiary concerned treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that it will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Foreign currency Foreign currency transactions are translated using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in equity as qualifying net investment hedges.
The results and financial position of those Group companies that do not have a Sterling functional currency are translated into Sterling as follows: Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the end of the reporting period.
Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the period.
All resulting exchange differences are recognised in equity in the translation reserve.
The reporting date foreign exchange rates by major currency are provided in note 4.3.
106 MERLIN E NTERTAINME NTS PLC ANN UAL RE PORT AND ACCOU NTS 2018 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS SECTION 1 BASIS OF PREPARATION C O N T I NUE D 52 weeks ended 29 December 2018 2017: 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017 1.1 BASIS OF PREPARATION CONTINUED Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group Financial instruments are recognised on the statement of financial position when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The accounting policy for each type of financial instrument is included within the relevant note.
Financial assets are initially measured at fair value, unless otherwise noted, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss.
A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or the Group transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity.
Financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, plus, in the case of other financial liabilities, directly attributable transaction costs.
Other financial liabilities, primarily the Groups interest-bearing loans and borrowings, are measured at amortised cost.
Financial liabilities are measured at fair value through profit or loss and are held on the statement of financial position at fair value.
A financial liability is derecognised when the Groups obligations are discharged, expire or are cancelled.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance costs.
An equity instrument is any contract that has a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Finance payments associated with financial instruments that are classified in equity are dividends and are recorded directly in equity.
Where financial instruments consist of a combination of debt and equity, the Group will assess the substance of the arrangement in place and decide how to attribute values to each taking into consideration the policy definitions above.
Judgements and estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Groups accounting policies.
It also requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Judgements Management considers the following areas to be the judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
They are explained in more detail in the related notes: Useful life of brands note 3.2 where brands have been recognised as part of an acquisition, they have been assessed as having indefinite useful lives and management have considered that this judgement remains appropriate.
Goodwill impairment reviews note 3.3 the level at which goodwill is initially allocated and thereafter monitored.
Estimates Management considers the following area to involve a significant degree of estimation uncertainty: Valuation of Resort Theme Parks Operating Group RTP assets and impairment note 3.3 estimation of discounted cash flows when calculating the value in use of assets.
Other non-significant areas that include a degree of estimation uncertainty are: Valuation of assets and impairment, excluding RTP note 3.3 estimation of discounted cash flows when calculating the value in use of assets.
Taxation note 2.4 recognition of deferred tax balances and accounting for tax risks.
Provisions note 3.5 estimated outflow to settle the obligation and, where relevant, the appropriate discount and inflation rates to apply.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings note 4.2 expected period of borrowings when calculating the effective interest rate on those borrowings.
Share-based payment transactions note 4.6 estimation of future performance when estimating vesting rates on share schemes.
Investments note 5.1 expected period of and eventual return on investments when calculating the fair value.
Employee benefits note 5.2 assumed discount rate, inflation rate and mortality when valuing defined benefit liabilities.
While these areas do not present a significant risk resulting in a material adjustment, they are areas of focus for management.
Those areas that require significant judgements or include estimation uncertainty on adoption of IFRS 16 Leases are set out in note 5.5.
New standards and interpretations The standards that have been implemented in the year that have had the most significant impact are IFRS 9 Financial instruments and IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers, as explained below.
A full list of new accounting standards and interpretations that have been implemented in the year, including those which have had no significant impact, can be found in note 5.5.
It also includes those standards that will be implemented next year or in future years, including our assessment of the potential impact of IFRS 16 Leases.

The new standard replaces IAS 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement and sets out requirements for recognising and measuring financial assets and financial liabilities.
The new requirements of the standard have been applied retrospectively, taking advantage of the exemption to not restate comparative information with respect to classification and measurement changes.
The impact of IFRS 9 has not seen material changes to the financial statements for the Group.
Further details of each aspect of the new standard have been provided below: Classification and measurement IFRS 9 contains a new classification and measurement approach for financial assets that reflects the business model in which assets are managed and their cash flow characteristics.
Under IFRS 9 the number of classification categories has reduced, resulting in all financial assets being measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss.
Areas to note following the adoption of IFRS 9 are: There has not been a change to the Groups trade and other receivables balances as a result of the classification changes.
The election available under IFRS 9 has been taken, allowing minority equity investments to continue to be held at fair value with changes going through other comprehensive income FVOCI.
These equity investments were previously held as available-for-sale, with changes in fair value being recognised through equity.
Under IFRS 9 all fair value gains and losses will be reported through OCI, no impairment losses will be recognised in profit or loss and any gains or losses realised on disposal of these investments will no longer be reclassified to profit or loss.
The classification for financial liabilities is largely similar under the new standard.
The Group has not had to adjust any classifications for financial liabilities.
Impairment IFRS 9 replaces the incurred loss model in IAS 39 with a forward looking expected credit loss ECL model.
This will apply to all financial assets measured at amortised cost or FVOCI, except equity investments, and will be measured in respect of default events that will occur in 12 months from the reporting date or over the lifetime of the financial asset, depending on certain criteria.
A review of each category of financial assets has been performed to assess the level of credit risk and the appropriate ECL to use.
The Group has assessed that this only applies to its accounting for trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents, as detailed below: The Group has limited credit risk in respect of trade and other receivables with its customers as the majority pay in advance or at the time of their visit.
The estimated ECLs are calculated using both actual credit loss experience and forward looking projections and do not result in material changes to the impairment of trade and other receivables.
Cash and cash equivalents are held with banks and financial institutions.
The estimated ECLs are calculated based on the 12 month expected loss basis and reflect the short term nature of the exposures.
The Group considers that its cash and cash equivalents have a low credit risk based on the external credit ratings of the counterparties.
Based on this, the ECL is not significant for cash and cash equivalents.
At each reporting date the expected credit losses will be reviewed to reflect changes in credit risk and adjustments made accordingly.
There has not been a material adjustment to trade and other receivables or cash as a result of the new methodology.
Hedging As allowed on initial application, the Group has chosen to apply its hedge accounting policy under IFRS 9 rather than continuing to apply IAS 39.
The new standard introduces a more principles-based approach with the intention of aligning the accounting for hedging instruments more closely with the Groups risk management strategies and to apply a more qualitative and forward looking approach to assessing hedge effectiveness.
IFRS 9 also introduces new requirements on rebalancing hedge relationships and prohibiting voluntary discontinuation of hedge accounting.
All of the Groups existing hedge relationships that were previously designated as effective hedging relationships have continued to qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS 9 and are aligned to the Groups risk management strategy and objective.
The new standard is applied prospectively and therefore there are no adjustments on transition.
Additional disclosures or amendments have been provided where required.

It replaced IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction contracts and related interpretations.
The Group has adopted IFRS 15 using the cumulative effect method without practical expedients.
This approach requires the effect of applying this standard to be recognised at the date of initial application i. e. 31 December 2017.
There is no impact to retained earnings on transition because the timing of recognition of each category of Merlins revenue under the transfer of risks and rewards principles in IAS 18 matches the timing under the control principles in IFRS 15.
In line with adopting IFRS 15 using the cumulative effect method, the information presented for 2017 has not been restated.
Impact IFRS 15 requires Merlin to make an assessment, considering the control principles of IFRS 15, as to whether parties involved in providing goods or services to a customer are acting as a principal if they control delivery to the customer or, if they are arranging for those goods or services to be provided by the other party, as an agent.
Under IAS 18 this assessment was made based on which entity had the exposure to the significant risks and rewards associated with the transaction.
We have reviewed how this change affects situations where a third party is involved, together with Merlin, in providing visitors to Merlin attractions with admission tickets and or accommodation, or commercial offerings such as photos and games services once inside a Merlin attraction.
There is no difference in the pattern of revenue recognition arising from this change.
Trade partners Merlin engages with trade partners such as online travel agents in selling admission tickets and accommodation to the visiting customer.
In instances where this leads to trade partners being considered Merlins agent, Merlin records revenue at the amount paid by the visiting customer gross and records the amount of underlying commission retained by the agent within cost of sales.
Commercial offerings Merlin partners with third parties in the operation of commercial offerings within theme park resorts and Midway attractions.
The most significant of these are photo and games operations where the Group has analysed which party is considered to control the relevant operation.
The nature of the operations concerned, and the judgements made, impact each Operating Group in different ways.
The following table summarises the impacts of adopting IFRS 15 on the Groups consolidated income statement for the 52 weeks ended 29 December 2018 and each of the line items affected.
There was no material impact on the Groups statement of financial position, statement of cash flows or statement of comprehensive income: Amounts without adoption As reported Adjustment of IFRS 15 m m m 2018 Revenue 1,688 35 1,653 Cost of sales 298 35 263 Gross profit 1,390 1,390 Disaggregation of revenue The following categories of revenue all excluding VAT and similar taxes have been disaggregated: Visitor revenue which represents admissions tickets, retail, food and beverage sales and other commercial offerings such as photos and games experiences inside a Merlin attraction.
Ticket revenue is recognised at point of entry.
Revenue from annual passes and other tickets that entitle a customer to continued visits over a period of time is deferred and then recognised evenly over the period that the pass is valid.
Retail and food and beverage revenue, along with other similar commercial offerings, is recognised at point of sale.
Accommodation revenue which represents overnight stay and conference room revenue along with food and beverage revenue earned within our hotels and other accommodation offerings.
Accommodation revenue is recognised at the time when a customer stays at Merlin accommodation.
Other revenue which represents sponsorship, function, management and service contract revenue along with other sundry items.
Sponsorship revenue is recognised over the relevant contract term.
Function revenue is recognised at the time of the event.
Management and service contract revenue is recognised in line with the performance obligations in the specific contract.
Information regarding the Groups results including this disaggregation of revenue by nature as required by IFRS 15 is included in note 2.1.

The Group is managed through its three Operating Groups, which form the operating segments on which the information shown below is prepared.
The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that is provided internally to the Chief Executive Officer CEO, who is the Groups chief operating decision maker, and the Board.
An operating segments operating results are reviewed regularly by the CEO to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance.
2 Performance is measured based on segment EBITDA, as included in internal management reports.
Segment operating profit is included for information purposes.
3 The Group has initially applied IFRS 15 and IFRS 9 at 31 December 2017.
Under the transition methods chosen, comparative information is not restated.
4 Other items include Merlin Magic Making, head office costs and various other costs, which cannot be directly attributed to the reportable segments.
5 Details of exceptional items are provided in note 2.2.

From time to time, the Group also enters into service contracts for attraction development.
Tickets, annual passes and other services can be bought in advance, generally online, in which case these advanced revenues are held in deferred revenue until the visitor uses those tickets or services.
Visitor revenue is then recognised when the visitor enters the attraction.
Revenue from the sale of annual passes is deferred and then recognised evenly over the period that the pass is valid.
Retail and food and beverage sales revenues are recognised at the point of sale.
Revenue for attraction development is recognised as performance obligations under the contract are met.
Service contract revenue in 2018 and 2017 is not material.
IFRS 15 requires Merlin to make an assessment, considering the control principles of IFRS 15, as to whether parties involved in providing goods or services to a customer are acting as a principal if they control delivery to the customer or, if they are arranging for those goods or services to be provided by the other party, as an agent.
The impact of adopting IFRS 15 in the 52 weeks ended 29 December 2018 is detailed in note 1.1.
Cost of sales Cost of sales of 298 million 2017: 255 million represents variable expenses excluding VAT and similar taxes incurred from revenue generating activities.
Retail inventory, food and beverage consumables and costs associated with the delivery of accommodation are the principal expenses included within this category.
Operating expenses Staff numbers and costs The average number of persons employed by the Group including Directors during the year, analysed by category, was as follows: 2018 2017 Operations 19,057 17,834 Attraction management and central administration 2,066 2,037 21,123 19,871 The aggregate payroll costs of these persons were as follows: 2018 2017 m m Wages and salaries 381 360 Share-based payments note 4.6 8 3 Social security costs 46 44 Other pension costs 13 13 448 420 Related party transactions with key management personnel Key management comprises the Executive and Non-executive Directors of the Board and the members of the Executive Committee.

They are separately presented as they are not part of the Groups underlying operating expenses.
2.3 FINANCE INCOME AND COSTS Accounting policies Income and costs Finance income comprises interest income from financial assets and investments, applicable foreign exchange gains and gains on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement.
Finance costs comprise interest expense, finance charges on finance leases, applicable foreign exchange losses and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement.
Interest income and interest expense are recognised as they accrue, using the effective interest method.
Capitalisation of borrowing costs Where assets take a substantial time to complete, the Group capitalises borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of those assets.

Tax relief on capitalised borrowing costs amounted to 2 million in 2018 2017: 1 million.
1 As part of the refinancing undertaken during the year see note 4.2, the Group restructured its interest rate swaps and was paid a net 5 million to cash-settle certain swaps.
The swaps had previously been hedge accounted through equity and 4 million has therefore been recycled through the income statement in the period to 29 December 2018 with the remainder to be recycled in the period to 2020.
Further details of the Groups debt are presented in note 4.2.
2 In 2017 the Group estimated that a refinancing of the bank facilities and multi-currency revolving credit facility was likely within the next 18 months, which was earlier than that previously assumed for accounting purposes.
As a result the Group accelerated the amortisation of financing costs in respect of these facilities and the resulting adjustment was recognised as a loss on re-measurement and presented in the income statement as a charge of 4 million.
2.4 TAXATION Accounting policies The tax charge for the year is recognised in the income statement and the statement of comprehensive income, according to the accounting treatment of the related transaction.
The tax charge comprises both current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Deferred tax is provided on certain temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and taxation purposes respectively.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.
After considering forecast future profits, deferred tax assets are recognised where it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which those assets can be utilised.
This assessment is made after considering a number of factors, including the Groups future trading expectations.

Tax provisions are based on managements estimate of the amount of tax payable and the likelihood of settlement in relation to matters which have yet to be concluded.
These include matters arising from ongoing audits, as well as other uncertain positions.
A combination of in-house tax experts, previous experience and professional firms is used when assessing tax risks.
Current provisions represent a number of different matters arising across the various jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
It is currently unclear when these matters will be settled, but certain matters have been open for several years and may not be resolved in the coming year.

The difference between the reported ETR of 19.2% and the UK standard tax rate of 19.0% is largely attributable to the Groups geographic mix of profits and reflects higher rates in certain jurisdictions, particularly the USA.
In addition, the reported rate is increased by non-deductible expenses which primarily arise as a result of depreciation on capital expenditure from continued investment in our attractions.
These factors are offset by the Groups internal financing arrangements, which have been put in place to support development and ongoing funding needs in overseas territories.
The Groups ETR has fallen from 22.9% to 19.0% based on underlying results.
This is primarily driven by the ongoing impact of a package of measures enacted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act USA tax reform in the USA on 22 December 2017.
In particular, the reduction in the US federal tax rate, effective in the 2018 period, has driven a significant reduction in the effect of tax rates in foreign jurisdictions 2018: 5.2%: 2017: 8.2%.
In 2017 the transitional impact of USA tax reform was separately disclosed.

Significant factors impacting the Groups future ETR include the USA tax reform, the ability to continue current financing arrangements and changes to local or international tax laws.
With regard to the latter, the European Commissions preliminary finding relating to the UKs Controlled Foreign Company rules is further detailed in note 5.4.
The Finance Act 2016, which provided for reductions in the main rate of UK corporation tax from 20% to 19% effective from 1 April 2017 and to 17% effective from 1 April 2020, was substantively enacted on 19 September 2016.
Otherwise, the Groups future ETR will primarily be affected by the geographic mix of profits.

Adjusted earnings per share is calculated in the same way except that the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders is adjusted for exceptional items see note 2.2.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.

Where components of an item of PPE have different useful lives, they are accounted for separately.
The initial cost of PPE includes all costs incurred in bringing the asset into use and includes external costs for the acquisition, construction and commissioning of the asset, internal project costs primarily staff expenses and capitalised borrowing costs.
Assets acquired through business combinations At the time of a business combination PPE is separately recognised and valued.
Given the specialised nature of the PPE acquired, fair values are calculated on a depreciated replacement cost basis.
The key estimates are the replacement cost, where industry specific indices are used to restate original historic cost: and depreciation, where the total and remaining economic useful lives are considered, together with the residual value of each asset.
The total estimated lives applied are consistent with those set out below.
Residual values are based on industry specific indices.
New sites Capital expenditure on new attractions includes all the costs of bringing the items of PPE within that attraction into use ready for the opening of the attraction.
Pre-opening costs are only capitalised to the extent they are required to bring PPE into its working condition.
Other pre-opening costs are expensed as incurred.
On inception of a lease for a new site, where required, the estimated cost of decommissioning any additions is included within PPE and depreciated over the lease term.
A corresponding provision is set up as disclosed in note 3.5.
Existing sites Subsequent expenditure on items of PPE in our existing estate can be broadly split into two categories: Capital expenditure which adds new items of PPE to an attraction or which extends the operational life, or enhances existing items, of PPE is accounted for as an addition to PPE.
Examples of such expenditure include new rides or displays and enhancements to rides or displays, which increase the appeal of our attractions to visitors.
Expenditure which is incurred to maintain the items of PPE in a safe and useable state and to maintain the useful life of items of PPE is charged to the income statement as incurred.
Examples of such expenditure include regular servicing and maintenance of buildings, rides and displays and ongoing repairs to items of PPE.
Depreciation Land is not depreciated.
Assets under construction are not depreciated until they come into use, when they are transferred to buildings or plant and equipment as appropriate.
Depreciation is then charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of PPE.
Asset lives for plant and equipment vary depending on the nature of the asset, from short life assets such as IT assets, up to long term infrastructure assets.
No residual values are typically considered.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Asset class Depreciation policy Freehold long leasehold buildings 50 years Leasehold buildings 2050 years dependent on life of lease Plant and equipment 530 years 118 MERLIN E NTERTAINME NTS PLC ANN UAL RE PORT AND ACCOU NTS 2018 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS SECTION 3 OPERATING ASSETS ANDLIABILITIES C O N T I NUE D 52 weeks ended 29 December 2018 2017: 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017 3.1 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT CONTINUED Property, plant and equipment Land and Plant and Under buildings equipment construction Total m m m m Cost At 1 January 2017 1,186 1,309 190 2,685 Additions owned assets 10 41 278 329 Additions leased assets 98 13 111 Movements in asset retirement provisions 2 1 3 Disposals 2 7 9 Transfers 70 188 258 Effect of movements in foreign exchange 29 23 5 57 Balance at 30 December 2017 1,335 1,522 205 3,062 Additions owned assets 43 37 270 350 Movements in asset retirement provisions note 3.5 8 2 6 Disposals 5 5 Transfers 153 104 257 Effect of movements in foreign exchange 49 28 7 84 Balance at 29 December 2018 1,588 1,684 225 3,497 Depreciation At 1 January 2017 281 563 844 Depreciation for the year owned assets 36 105 141 Depreciation for the year leased assets 4 4 8 Disposals 1 7 8 Effect of movements in foreign exchange 9 6 15 Balance at 30 December 2017 311 659 970 Depreciation for the year owned assets 39 117 156 Depreciation for the year leased assets 5 4 9 Disposals 5 5 Effect of movements in foreign exchange 11 12 23 Balance at 29 December 2018 366 787 1,153 Carrying amounts At 31 December 2016 905 746 190 1,841 At 30 December 2017 1,024 863 205 2,092 At 29 December 2018 1,222 897 225 2,344 Depreciation is calculated in line with the policy stated previously.
During the year the Group reviews useful economic lives and tests PPE for impairment in accordance with the Groups accounting policy, as referred to in note 3.3.
As a result no material adjustments were made in either 2017 or 2018.
The Group leases buildings and plant and equipment under finance lease agreements secured on those assets.
Additions of leased assets in 2017 were in respect of the LEGOLAND Japan finance lease entered into on the opening of the park in April 2017 note 4.4.
At 29 December 2018 the net carrying amount of leased buildings was 106 million 2017: 103 million and the net carrying amount of leased plant and equipment was 35 million 2017: 38 million.

3.2 GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS Accounting policies Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of an acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired less any contingent liabilities assumed.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to groups of cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
In respect of joint ventures, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment in the joint venture.
Where they arise on acquisition, brands have been valued based on discounted future cash flows using the relief from royalty method, including amounts into perpetuity.
Currently all such brands held are assessed as having indefinite useful economic lives.
This assessment is based upon the strong historical performance of the brands over a number of economic cycles, the ability to roll out our brands, and the Directors intentions regarding the future use of brands.
The Directors feel this is a suitable policy for a brands business which invests in and maintains the brands, and foresee no technological developments or competitor actions which would put a finite life on the brands.
The brands are tested annually for impairment.
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Other intangible assets comprise software licences, sponsorship rights and other contract based intangible assets.
They are amortised on a straight-line basis from the date they are available for use.
They are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
The estimated useful lives of other intangible assets are as follows: Asset class Estimated useful life Licences Life of licence up to 15 years Other intangible assets Relevant contractual period up to 30 years 120 MERLIN E NTERTAINME NTS PLC ANN UAL RE PORT AND ACCOU NTS 2018 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS SECTION 3 OPERATING ASSETS ANDLIABILITIES C O N T I NUE D 52 weeks ended 29 December 2018 2017: 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017 3.2 GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED Goodwill and intangible assets Intangible assets Goodwill Brands Other Total m m m m Cost At 1 January 2017 993 196 33 1,222 Additions 3 3 Effect of movements in foreign exchange 1 2 1 Balance at 30 December 2017 992 198 36 1,226 Additions 1 1 Effect of movements in foreign exchange 10 2 12 Balance at 29 December 2018 1,002 200 37 1,239 Amortisation At 1 January 2017 177 13 15 205 Amortisation for the year 2 2 Effects of movements in foreign exchange 1 1 Balance at 30 December 2017 178 13 17 208 Amortisation for the year 2 2 Effect of movements in foreign exchange 1 1 Balance at 29 December 2018 179 13 19 211 Carrying amounts At 31 December 2016 816 183 18 1,017 At 30 December 2017 814 185 19 1,018 At 29 December 2018 823 187 18 1,028 Intangible assets are tested for impairment in accordance with the Groups accounting policy, as referred to in note 3.3.

The SEA LIFE brand is related to the Groups portfolio of SEA LIFE attractions.
The London Eye, Gardaland Resort, Alton Towers Resort, THORPE PARK and Heide Park brands all arise from those specific visitor attractions.
3.3 IMPAIRMENT TESTING Accounting policies The carrying amounts of the Groups goodwill, intangible assets and PPE are reviewed at the end of each reporting period to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists or if the asset has an indefinite life, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
The process of impairment testing is to estimate the recoverable amount of the assets concerned, and recognise an impairment loss whenever the carrying amount of those assets exceeds the recoverable amount.
The level at which the assets concerned are reviewed varies as follows: Asset Goodwill Goodwill is reviewed at an Operating Group level, being the relevant grouping of cash-generating units CGUs at which the benefit of such goodwill arises.
A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates largely independent cash inflows, being the Groups individual attractions.
Brands Brands are reviewed at an individual CGU level.
PPE PPE is reviewed at an individual CGU level, being the Groups individual attractions.
For assets that are in continuing use but do not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the CGU to which the assets belong.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
They are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill, and then to reduce the carrying amount of other intangible assets and other assets on a pro rata basis.

To assess value in use, estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate, derived from the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital.
The Group uses a multiple of EBITDA to estimate fair value which is based on the Groups average market capitalisation as a multiple of the Groups underlying EBITDA.
The Groups internally approved five year business plans, being the current year and four future years, are used as the basis for these calculations, with cash flows beyond the four year outlook period then extrapolated using a long term growth rate.
Common assumptions have been adopted for the purpose of testing goodwill across the business and for testing brand values where their risk profiles are similar.
The key assumptions and estimates used when calculating the net present value of future cash flows from the Groups businesses are as follows: Estimate Future cash flows Assumed to be equivalent to the operating cash flows of the businesses less the cash flows in respect of capital expenditure.
The Group uses EBITDA less an allocation of central costs, in line with other recharges which occur in the business, as a proxy for the operating cash flows of its attractions as they are not significantly impacted by movements in working capital.
Growth in EBITDA EBITDA is forecast by an analysis of both projected revenues and costs.
Visitor numbers and revenue projections are based on market analysis, including the total available market, historic trends, competition and site development activity, both in terms of capital expenditure on rides and attractions as well as marketing activity.
Projections of operating costs are based on historical data, adjusted for variations in visitor numbers and planned expansion of site activities as well as general market conditions.
Timing and quantum of future Projections are based on the attractions long term development plans, taking into account the capital investment necessary capital and maintenance to maintain and sustain the performance of the attractions assets.
expenditure Long term growth rate A growth rate of 2.5% 2017: 2.5% was determined based on managements long term expectations, taking account of historical averages and future expected trends in both market development and market share growth.
Discount rates to reflect the risks Based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital of a market participant within the main geographical regions where involved the Group operates, these are drawn from market data and businesses in similar sectors, and adjusted for asset specific risks.
The key assumptions of the market participant include the ratio of debt to equity financing, risk free rates and the medium term risks associated with equity investments.
Net present values are calculated using pre-tax discount rates derived from the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital.
Pre-tax discount rates Post-tax discount rates 2018 2017 2018 2017 Midway Attractions 9.2% 9.8% 7.5% 7.8% LEGOLAND Parks 9.2% 10.2% 7.3% 7.6% Resort Theme Parks 9.8% 10.2% 7.9% 8.3% ST STR RA AT TE EG GIIC C R RE EP POR ORT T G GO OVE VERNAN RNANC CE E F FIIN NA AN NC CIIA AL L S ST TAT ATE EM ME EN NT TS S OTHER INFORMATION MERLIN E NTERTAINME NTS PLC 123 3.3 IMPAIRMENT TESTING CONTINUED Sensitivity analysis Impairment reviews are often sensitive to changes in key assumptions.
Sensitivity analysis has therefore been performed on the calculated recoverable amounts considering incremental changes in the key assumptions.
Particular focus is given to material amounts where headroom is more limited.
As in prior years, this solely relates to goodwill attributed to the Resort Theme Parks Operating Group RTP where the headroom is 93 million 2017:32 million.
The Midway Attractions and LEGOLAND Parks Operating Groups, as well as individual brands, show considerable headroom and are not sensitive to even significant changes in any of the key assumptions.
In undertaking sensitivity analysis for RTP, consideration has been given to movements in forecast EBITDA, increases in discount rates and reductions in long term growth rates.
At the year end the Directors consider that the forecasts used reflect the current best estimate of future trading in RTP.
It is noted, however, that the calculations are inherently sensitive to the level of growth within RTP, which may be affected by factors such as weather patterns and the wider economic trading environment.
While in the short term slower growth would be highly unlikely to affect valuations by a substantial amount, longer term shortfalls that affect the outlook for the fourth year of the plan which drives the terminal value would have a more significant impact.
If EBITDA for RTP as a whole was forecast to be 9% 2017: 3% lower than currently anticipated for 2023 2017: than anticipated for 2022, headroom would be absorbed in full.
Discount rates have been derived from market data.
As these rates are intended to be long term in nature they are expected to be reasonably stable in the short term, however market discount rates could increase in future.
If the discount rate used across RTP had been higher by a factor of 8% to 10.6% 2017: 3% to 10.5%, headroom would have been absorbed in full.
The long term growth rate, which is applied to the cash flows of the final year in the business plan, was determined based on managements long term expectations, taking account of historical averages and future expected trends in both market development and market share growth.
If circumstances caused the rate to lower to 1.4% 2017: 2.1%, headroom would be absorbed in full.
3.4 WORKING CAPITAL Accounting policies Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is measured using the first-in first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their present location and condition.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised and carried at the original invoice amount less a loss allowance calculated using the simplified expected credit loss ECL model approach.
Trade receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.
Other receivables are stated at their amortised cost less any impairment losses.
Estimated ECLs are calculated using both actual credit loss experience and forward looking projections.

The proceeds, together with surplus cash, were used to repay 250 million of Sterling and $540 million of US Dollar denominated term loans due to mature in March 2020.
The Groups facilities are: A 600 million multi-currency revolving credit facility of which 148 million had been drawn down at 29 December 2018 2017: nil.

Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption amount is amortised through the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Fixed rate borrowings, which have been hedged to floating rates, are measured at amortised cost adjusted for changes in the value attributable to the hedged risk arising from the changes in underlying market interest rates.
The interest-bearing loans and borrowings are unsecured but guaranteed by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries.
The Group is required to comply with certain customary financial and non-financial covenants in the bank facilities, including a requirement to maintain certain ratios of EBITDA to both net finance costs and net debt.
It is also required to comply with certain non-financial covenants in the 700 million and $400 million notes.
All covenant requirements were satisfied throughout the year.
4.3 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group would not have sufficient funds to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups Treasury department produces short term and long term cash forecasts to identify liquidity requirements and headroom, which are reviewed by the Groups Chief Financial Officer.
Surplus cash is actively managed across Group bank accounts to cover local shortfalls or invested in bank deposits or other short term liquid investments such as money market funds.
In some countries bank cash pooling arrangements are in place to optimise the use of cash.
As at the reporting date the Group had 110 million of cash and cash equivalents 2017: 309 million and a 600 million revolving credit facility, of which 148 million was drawn down 2017: 300 million of which nil drawn down, in order to meet its obligations and commitments that will fall due.
The following table sets out the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including interest payments.
This analysis assumes that interest rates prevailing at the reporting date remain constant.

The Group has a policy of actively managing its interest rate risk exposure using a combination of fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps.
At 29 December 2018 the Group had 700 million and $400 million of fixed rate debt 2017: 700 million.
Interest rate swaps are used to maintain a balance between fixed and floating rate debt.
In aggregate 77% 2017: 79% of the year end interest-bearing loans and borrowings is at a fixed rate for a weighted average period of 4.6 years 2017: 3.4 years.
To achieve the desired balance of fixed and floating interest rates across currencies, the Group uses both floating to fixed interest rate swaps which are part of cash flow hedging relationships and fixed to floating interest rate swaps which are part of fair value hedging relationships.
Interest rate swaps are recognised at fair value which is determined by reference to market rates.
The fair value is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to exit the swap, taking into account current interest rates, credit risks and bid ask spreads.
Following initial recognition, changes in fair value are recognised immediately in profit or loss, except where the Group adopts hedge accounting.
When hedge accounting, the Group formally documents the relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items.
It makes an assessment, at inception and on an ongoing basis, as to whether the hedging instruments are expected to be highly effective in offsetting the changes in the fair value or cash flows of the respective hedged items during the life of the hedge.
Changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve in equity.
Any ineffective portion of changes in fair value is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Cumulative gains and losses would remain in equity until either the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, or until the hedged transaction occurs, at which point they will be reclassified to profit or loss.
Changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recognised in profit or loss immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the fair value adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortised to profit and loss from that date.
At 29 December 2018 the Group had 40 million 2017: 40 million of fair value interest rates swaps with a value of less than 1 million 2017: less than 1 million, and $120 million 2017: $nil of fair value interest rates swaps with a value of 2 million 2017: nil.
A 100 basis points fall in the interest rates with a similar duration as the swaps would lead to an increase in value of 8 million 2017: 1 million and a 100 basis points rise in the interest rates with a similar duration as the swaps would lead to a decrease in value of 7 million 2017: 1 million.
All interest rate swaps held by the Group are hedge accounted.
Sensitivity analysis Based on the net debt position as at 29 December 2018, taking into account interest rate swaps, each 100 basis points fall or rise in market interest rates would result in an increase or decrease in net interest paid of 2 million 2017: less than 1 million.
This has been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the Groups variable rate cash, borrowings and derivatives.
Foreign currency risk As the Group operates internationally the performance of the business is sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates.
The Groups potential currency exposures comprise transaction and translation exposures.
The Group ensures that its net exposure to foreign currency balances is kept to a minimal level by using foreign currency swaps to exchange balances back into Sterling or by buying and selling foreign currencies at spot rates when necessary.
The fair value of foreign exchange contracts is the present value of future cash flows and is determined by reference to market rates.
At 29 December 2018 the fair value of foreign currency swap assets was less than 1 million 2017: 2 million and the foreign currency swap liabilities was 4 million 2017: 1 million, none of which are hedge accounted.
Transaction exposures The revenue and costs of the Groups operations are denominated primarily in the currencies of the relevant local territories.
Any significant cross-border trading exposures would be hedged by the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
Translation exposures The Groups results, as presented in Sterling, are subject to fluctuations as a result of exchange rate movements.
The Group does not hedge this translation exposure to its earnings but, where material, may carry out net asset hedging by borrowing in the same currencies as the currencies of its operating units or by using forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Groups debt excluding finance leases is therefore denominated in Euros, US Dollars and Sterling and at 29 December 2018 consisted of 700 million, $540 million and 38 million and there are forward foreign exchange contracts in place in respect of JPY 13,404 million.

They will predominantly relate to the retranslation of opening net assets at closing foreign exchange rates, together with the retranslation of retained foreign profits for the year that have been accounted for in the consolidated income statement at average rates at closing rates.
Exchange rates for major currencies are set out below.
Gains or losses also arise on the retranslation of foreign currency denominated borrowings designated as effective net investment hedges of overseas net assets.
These are offset in equity by corresponding gains or losses arising on the retranslation of the related hedged foreign currency net assets.
The Group also treats specific intercompany loan balances, which are not intended to be repaid in the foreseeable future, as part of its net investment.
In the event of a foreign entity being sold or a hedging item being extinguished, such exchange differences would be recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
The following exchange rates have been used in the translation of the results of foreign operations: Weighted Weighted Closing average Closing average Closing rate for rate for rate for rate for rate for 2016 2017 2017 2018 2018 US Dollar 1.24 1.29 1.35 1.34 1.27 Euro 1.17 1.14 1.13 1.13 1.11 The Sterling equivalents of financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were: Carrying value Sterling Euro US Dollar Other Total m m m m m 2018 Cash and cash equivalents 18 13 15 64 110 Floating rate bank facilities due 2023 38 110 148 700 million fixed rate notes due 2022 631 631 $400 million fixed rate notes due 2026 313 313 Finance lease liabilities 53 37 110 200 73 655 408 46 1,182 2017 Cash and cash equivalents 199 13 20 77 309 Floating rate bank facilities due 2020 250 399 649 700 million fixed rate notes due 2022 622 622 Finance lease liabilities 53 36 102 191 104 645 379 25 1,153 Sensitivity analysis on foreign currency risk A 10% strengthening of all currencies against Sterling would increase net debt by 111 million 2017: 105 million.
As described above, gains or losses in the income statement and equity are offset by the retranslation of the related foreign currency net assets or specific intercompany loan balances.
A 10% strengthening of all currencies against Sterling would reduce the fair value of foreign exchange contracts and result in a charge to the income statement of 9 million 2017: 6 million.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
Credit risk is limited to the carrying value of the Groups monetary assets.
The Group has limited credit risk with its customers, the vast majority of whom pay in advance or at the time of their visit.
There are credit policies in place with regard to its trade receivables with credit evaluations performed on customers requiring credit over a certain amount.
The Group manages credit exposures in connection with financing and treasury activities including exposures arising from bank deposits, cash held at banks and derivative transactions, by appraisal, formal approval and ongoing monitoring of the credit position of counterparties.
Counterparty exposures are measured against a formal transaction limit appropriate to that counterpartys credit position.

Level 2: uses inputs that are derived directly or indirectly from observable prices other than quoted prices.
Level 3: uses inputs that are not based on observable market data.

The fair values of the finance leases are determined by reference to similar lease agreements.
There is no difference between the carrying value and the fair value of investments that has been estimated by reference to discounted cash flows.
There have been no transfers between levels in 2018 or 2017.
4.4 LEASE OBLIGATIONS Accounting policies Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classified as finance leases.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Where land and buildings are held under finance leases the accounting treatment of the land is considered separately from that of the buildings.
Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Finance lease payments Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability.
The finance charge is allocated during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Operating lease payments Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received and predetermined non-contingent rent increases are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense over the lease term.
This therefore excludes the potential impact of future performance or rent increases based on inflationary indices.

The leases are accounted for as finance or operating leases depending on the specific circumstances of each lease and the nature of the attraction.
For certain of the sites an individual lease agreement is split for accounting purposes as a combination of finance and operating leases, reflecting the varied nature of assets at the attraction.
Each of these sale and leaseback agreements runs for a period of 35 years from inception and allows for annual rent increases based on the inflationary index in the United Kingdom and fixed increases in Continental Europe.
The Group has the option, but is not contractually required, to extend each of the lease agreements individually for two further terms of 35 years, subject to an adjustment to market rates at that time.
LEGOLAND Japan was opened during 2017.
The park was developed under the Groups operated and leased model whereby the Groups local operating company leases the site and park infrastructure from a development partner.
The development partners are related parties, being KIRKBI Invest A S and LLJ Investco K. K, a subsidiary of KIRKBI A S: with KIRKBI A S being a shareholder of the Group and a related party note 5.3.
The lease is for a period of 50 years and is accounted for partly as a finance lease and partly as an operating lease depending on the nature of the underlying assets concerned.
Land and longer life assets, for example core elements of the parks infrastructure, are accounted for as operating leases.
Finance lease assets are those elements that will be substantially or entirely consumed over the lease term.
This accounting judgement was underpinned by a review of the cost of construction by asset type together with estimates of the lives of the assets concerned.
The Group also enters into operating leases for sites within the Midway Attractions Operating Group and central areas.
These are typically of a duration between 10 and 60 years, with rent increases determined based on local market practice.
In addition to a fixed rental element, rents within the Midway Attractions Operating Group can also contain a performance related element, typically based on turnover at the site concerned.
Options to renew leases exist at these sites in line with local market practice in the territories concerned.
The key contractual terms in relation to each lease are considered when calculating the rental charge over the lease term.
The potential impact on rent charges of future performance or increases based on inflationary indices are each excluded from these calculations.
There are no significant operating restrictions placed on the Group as a result of its lease arrangements.
The impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 is explained in note 5.5.
Lease costs and commitments During 2018 107 million 2017: 106 million was recognised as an expense in the income statement in respect of operating leases.
Of this 18 million 2017:18million was contingent on performance.
The lease commitments in the following tables run to the end of the respective lease term and do not include possible lease renewals.
Where relevant, the lease commitments noted do not include the potential impact of future performance or rent increases based on inflationary indices.

The Groups objective when managing capital is to maintain a strong capital base so as to ensure investor and creditor confidence and to sustain future development of the business: to provide returns for shareholders: and to optimise the capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
There are no externally imposed capital requirements on the Group.
To enable the Group to meet its objective, the Directors monitor returns on capital through constant review of earnings generated from the Groups capital investment programme and through regular budgeting and planning processes, manage capital in a manner so as to ensure that sufficient funds for capital investment and working capital are available, and ensure that the requirements of the Groups debt covenants are met.
The Group does not routinely make additional issues of capital, other than for the purpose of raising finance to fund significant acquisitions or developments intended to increase the overall value of the Group.
Share plans have been created to allow employees of the Group to participate in the ownership of the Groups equity instruments, in order to ensure employees are focused on growing the value of the Group to achieve the aims of all the shareholders.
The Groups equity-settled share plans are settled either by the issue of shares by Merlin Entertainments plc or by the purchase of shares in the market.

4.6 SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS Accounting policy The fair value of the share plans is recognised as an expense over the expected vesting period with a corresponding entry to retained earnings, net of deferred tax.
The fair value of the share plans is determined at the date of grant.
Non-market based vesting conditions i. e. earnings per share and return on capital employed targets are taken into account in estimating the number of awards likely to vest, which is reviewed at each accounting date up to the vesting date, at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the actual awards issued.
No adjustment is made after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or are not exercised.
The Group operates cash-settled versions of the employee incentive plans for employees in certain territories.
The issues and resulting charges of these plans are not material to the financial statements.

Minority equity investments are accounted for as fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI, having taken the election available under IFRS 9.
This applies to the investments in LEGOLAND Malaysia, LEGOLAND Korea and Big Bus Tours Group Holdings Limited.
As no observable market data is available for these minority equity holdings, fair value is determined by reference to discounted future cash flows, with movements recorded in other comprehensive income.
Associates and joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control or significant influence, established by contractual agreement.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the total recognised income and expenses on an equity accounted basis, from the date that joint control or influence commences until the date that it ceases.

The investment was substantially all in the form of loan notes.
The transaction also provided Merlin with a minority equity investment valued at nil 2017: nil.
During 2017, the loan notes were modified resulting in the financial asset held at historic cost being derecognised and a minority equity investment measured at fair value being recognised instead.
No gain or loss arose as a result.
This was due to changes made to the rights of the issuer of the loan notes that resulted in them having the characteristics of an equity instrument rather than of debt.
At 29 December 2018 the investment is held at 37 million 2017: 35 million, and there have been no fair value movements recognised 2017: nil.

5.2 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS Accounting policies Defined contribution pension schemes In the case of defined contribution schemes, the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate fund on behalf of the employee and has no further obligations to them.
The risks and rewards associated with this type of scheme are assumed by the members rather than the employer.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Defined benefit pension schemes A defined benefit scheme is a post-employment benefit scheme other than a defined contribution scheme.
The Groups net obligation is calculated for each scheme by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
That benefit is discounted to determine its present value and offset by the fair value of any scheme assets.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
All actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the period they occur directly in equity through other comprehensive income.

Defined benefit pension schemes The principal scheme that the Group operates is a closed scheme for certain former UK employees of The Tussauds Group, which was acquired in 2007.
The scheme entitles retired employees to receive an annual payment based on a percentage of final salary for each year of service that the employee provided.
The pension schemes have not directly invested in any of the Groups own financial instruments or in properties or other assets used by the Group.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out as at 31 December 2015.
As a result, the Group agreed to pay annual deficit reduction contributions of 455,500, increasing at 3% per annum until 2021, together with an additional one-off payment of 2,260,000 which was paid in 2017.
The next triennial valuation is as at 31 December 2018 and is in progress.
The Group expects less than 1 million in ongoing contributions to be paid to its defined benefit schemes in 2019.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation at 29 December 2018 was 19 years 2017: 21 years.

The settlement loss arising from this was nil.
Actuarial assumptions Principal actuarial assumptions expressed as weighted averages at the year end were: 2018 2017 Discount rate 2.8% 2.5% Future salary increases n a 3.5% Rate of price inflation 3.3% 3.2% The scheme closed to future accrual for active members on 31 May 2018, therefore the link to future salary increases has been severed.
Assumptions regarding future mortality are based on published statistics and mortality tables.
For the Tussauds Group scheme the actuarial table used is S2PxA.
The mortality assumption adopted predicts that a current 65 year old male would have a life expectancy to age 87 and a female would have a life expectancy to age 89.
5.3 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Identity of related parties The Group has related party relationships with a major shareholder, key management personnel, joint ventures and other co-investors.
The defined benefit pension scheme for certain former UK employees of The Tussauds Group is also a related party see note 5.2.
All dealings with related parties are conducted on an arms length basis.
Transactions with shareholders During the year the Group entered into transactions with a major shareholder, KIRKBI Invest A S: the LEGO Group, a related party of KIRKBI Invest A S: and LLJ Investco K. K, a subsidiary of KIRKBI A S. Transactions entered into, including the purchase and sale of goods, payment of fees, royalties and rent, and trading balances outstanding at 29 December 2018 and 30 December 2017, were as follows: Goods and services Amount owed Purchases, Amount owed by related royalties to related Sales party and rent party m m m m 2018 KIRKBI Invest A S 13 3 LEGO Group 1 2 63 3 LLJ Investco K.

The remuneration of key management is disclosed in note 2.1.
Transactions with other related parties LEGOLAND Malaysia As part of the agreement for the development and operation of LEGOLAND Malaysia, the Group has subscribed for share capital in IDR Resorts Sdn.
IDR which together with its subsidiaries owns the park see note 5.1.
On this basis, IDR and its subsidiaries are deemed to be related parties.
Transactions entered into, including the purchase and sale of goods, payment of fees and trading balances outstanding at 29 December 2018 and 30 December 2017, are as follows: 2018 2017 m m Sales to related party 4 5 Amounts owed by related party 3 3 LEGOLAND Korea During the year the Group entered into transactions with LL Developments, a Korean company which acts under the direction of the Gangwon Province and which will provide funding and infrastructure support of KRW 80 billion to the development of LEGOLAND Korea.
Before the end of the reporting period LL Developments provided KRW 20 billion 14 million to the Group as the first tranche of this support, which the Group has committed to spend on costs associated with the project.
This has been recorded within deferred income see note 3.4.
The funding and infrastructure support will be accounted for as a capital grant and offset against the total project costs within property, plant and equipment.
The conditions of the funding require that Merlin completes the parks construction and operates the park for a period of time post-opening.
5.4 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES In 2017 the European Commission EC published a preliminary finding that certain elements of the UKs Controlled Foreign Company rules amount to unlawful State Aid.
If the EC confirms its preliminary finding and there are no successful appeals, the Group calculates the maximum potential liability, excluding penalties and interest, to be 36 million.
Based upon advice taken, the Group does not consider any provision is necessary at this time.
The Group continues to monitor developments and a final EC decision is expected in early 2019, but is subject to possible appeal.
5.5 NEW STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS The following standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued in the year in addition to the ones covered in note 1.1.
There has been no significant impact to the Group as a result of their issue.
IFRIC 22 Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration Amendments to IAS 40 Transfers of investment property Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification and measurement of share-based payment transactions Amendments to IFRS 4 Applying IFRS 9 Financial instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance contracts Amendments to IAS 28 Investments in associates and joint ventures EU endorsed IFRS and interpretations with effective dates after 31 December 2018 relevant to the Group will be implemented in the financial year when the standards become effective.
IFRS 16 Background IFRS 16 Leases is effective for 2019 reporting periods onwards and introduces a single, on-balance sheet lease accounting model for lessees.
IFRS 16 replaces existing leases guidance, including IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease, SIC-15 Operating leases incentives and SIC-27 Evaluating the substance of transactions involving the legal form of a lease.
Under IFRS 16 the Group, as the lessee, will recognise an asset representing its right to use the underlying leased asset, and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments.
The Group will elect to take recognition exemptions for short term leases and leases of low-value items.
Leases that fall within the Groups defined parameters for these exemptions will be excluded from the IFRS 16 lease accounting requirements and be expensed on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
140 MERLIN E NTERTAINME NTS PLC ANN UAL RE PORT AND ACCOU NTS 2018 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS SECTION 5 OTHER NOTES C O N T I NUE D 52 weeks ended 29 December 2018 2017: 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017 5.5 NEW STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS CONTINUED The Group has considered its entire lease portfolio which substantially relates to land, buildings and infrastructure assets, as follows: For leases previously classified as operating leases, the Group will recognise a new asset in the form of a right-of-use ROU asset, together with an associated lease liability.
The income statement will then reflect a depreciation charge for the ROU asset and an interest expense on the lease liability.
This will replace the previous accounting for operating leases that were expensed within operating expenses on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Existing finance leases have also been reviewed against the new standard.
As a result a number of leases entered into under historic sale and leaseback transactions have been re-assessed due to differences in the accounting treatment between IAS 17 and IFRS 16 of unguaranteed residual values.
This has required re-assessment of the values of leased assets at inception and their treatment under IFRS 16 in subsequent periods.
Regarding classification, these assets were accounted for as PPE under IAS 17 but are treated as ROU assets under IFRS 16.
Judgements and estimates IFRS 16 requires certain judgements and estimates to be made.
The most significant of these relate to the following: The discount rate used in the calculation of the lease liability, which involves estimation.
Discount rates are calculated on a lease by lease basis.
For the property leases that make up substantially all of the Groups lease portfolio this results in two approaches.
For a small volume of high value leases, the rate implicit in the lease can be calculated and is therefore adopted.
Otherwise, for the majority of leases the rate used is based on estimates of incremental borrowing costs.
These will depend on the territory of the relevant lease and hence the currency used: the date of lease inception: and the lease term.
As a result, reflecting the breadth of the Groups lease portfolio: the transition approach adopted which has required estimation of historic discount rates: and estimations as to lease lives, there are a large number of discount rates within a wide range.
IFRS 16 defines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease together with the options to extend or terminate a lease, if the lessee were reasonably certain to exercise that option.
Where a lease includes the option for the Group to extend the lease term, the Group makes a judgement as to whether it is reasonably certain that the option will be taken.
This will take into account the length of time remaining before the option is exercisable: current trading: future trading forecasts as to the ongoing profitability of the attraction: and the level and type of planned future capital investment.
This judgement will require review at each reporting period.
A small number of large leases held by the Group came into effect as part of a sale and leaseback transaction that occurred in 2007.
These leases have an initial lease period of 35 years, with an option to extend for two further periods of 35 years, subject to an adjustment to market rates at that time.
As the Group is currently less than 12 years into this period its assessment is that at this point, it is not reasonably certain that these leases will be renewed, taking into account the factors noted above.
This judgement will be reassessed at each reporting period.
A reassessment of the remaining life of the lease could result in a recalculation of the lease liability and a material adjustment to the associated balances.
Impact assessment As at 29 December 2018, the Groups future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases amounted to 1,852 million 2017: 1,897 million on an undiscounted basis see note 4.4.
Of these commitments an insignificant value relates to short term and low value leases which will continue to be recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense within the income statement.
For leases within the scope of IFRS 16 the nature of expenses will change from a straight-line operating lease expense to a depreciation charge and an interest expense.
Under existing accounting standards, during 2018 107 million was recognised as an expense in respect of operating leases.
Where the Groups rental expense is linked to turnover or other performance criteria, or relates to short term and low value leases, these elements will continue to be recorded as rent within operating expenses.
Based on 2018 results the impact on EBITDA of adopting IFRS 16 would therefore have been an increase of approximately 85 million.
Due to the Groups most significant leases being in their earlier stages, the front loading impact of the finance costs results in an initial reduction in reported earnings.
There would therefore have been a decrease in reported profit before tax of approximately 15 million.
As at 30 December 2018, the Group expects to recognise ROU assets of approximately 1,020 million, including ROU assets in respect of existing finance leases and asset retirement provisions on leased properties, both previously classified under property, plant and equipment.
The Group expects to recognise total lease liabilities of approximately 1,200 million, including existing finance lease liabilities of 200 million.
The impact of adopting IFRS 16 on net debt would therefore be approximately 1,000 million.
A net accruals and prepayments adjustment will reduce liabilities by approximately 30 million, primarily resulting from the derecognition of balances in relation to IAS 17 lease accounting where leases were expensed to the income statement on a straight-line basis.
An increase in deferred tax assets of approximately 30 million is also anticipated.
Based on information currently available the adjustments will in aggregate result in a decrease in net assets of approximately 100 million.
The numbers above are approximate as there has been a need to re-assess the accounting treatment for leases which contained elements of both operating leases and finance leases.
This has involved reviewing the historic values of leased assets at inception and their treatment under IFRS 16 in subsequent periods on an asset by asset basis.
We will refine these approximate numbers as we embed the processes for accounting under IFRS 16 into the business.
The Groups leverage threshold loan covenants are under frozen-GAAP and as such the adoption of IFRS 16 is not expected to impact the ability to comply with them.
Transition The Group plans to apply IFRS 16 initially on 30 December 2018, using the fully retrospective approach.
Therefore, the cumulative effect of adopting IFRS 16 will be recognised, in line with IAS 8 Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors, by restating the 52 week period ending 29 December 2018 and making an opening equity adjustment as at 31 December 2017.
The Group is not required to make any adjustment for leases in which it is a lessor except where it is an intermediate lessor in a sub-lease.

This means that it will apply IFRS 16 to all contracts entered into before 30 December 2018 and identified as leases in accordance with IAS 17 and IFRIC 4.
Other standards The IASB has also issued the following standards, amendments to standards and interpretations that will be effective for the Group as from 1 January 2019.
