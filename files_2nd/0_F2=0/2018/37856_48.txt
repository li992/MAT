22 FINANCIAL INSTruMENTS Overview The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: credit risk: liquidity risk: and market risk.
This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, and the Groups policies and processes for measuring and managing risk.
a Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers and investment securities.
Annual Report & Accounts 2018 144 NoTES To ThE CoNSoLIdATEd FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CoNTINuEd Exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis, with credit checks performed on all clients requiring credit over certain amounts.
Credit is not extended beyond authorised limits, established where appropriate through consultation with a professional credit vetting organisation.
Credit granted is subject to regular review, to ensure it remains consistent with the clients current creditworthiness and appropriate to the anticipated volume of business.
Investments are allowed only in liquid short-term instruments within approved limits, with investment counterparties approved by the Board, such that the exposure to a single counterparty is minimised.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of each financial asset on the balance sheet, these being spread across the various currencies and jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was: CARRYING VALUE 2018 2017 M M Cash at bank and in hand see Note 20 228 209 Short-term deposits see Note 20 225 205 Cash pool overdrafts see Note 20 78 60 Trade receivables see Note 19 45 41 Other receivables see Note 19 27 19 Equity investment at FVOCI see Note 16 39 Deposits receivable see Note 16 2 Trade receivables due from holding and associate companies see Note 19 1 489 414 The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date by geographic region was: CARRYING VALUE 2018 2017 M M New York 7 7 Regional US 4 4 Rest of Europe 10 7 Singapore 7 7 Rest of Asia 10 11 Australasia 7 5 45 41 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc 145 The ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date was: GROSS RECEIVABLE IMPAIRMENT ALLOWANCE CARRYING VALUE 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 M M M M M M Not past due 28 27 28 27 Past due 0 30 days 11 10 11 10 Past due 31 60 days 3 3 3 3 Past due 61 90 days 1 1 1 1 More than 90 days 6 3 4 3 2 49 44 4 3 45 41 The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables during the year was as follows: 2018 2017 M M Balance at 1 January 3 2 Impairment recognised 2 1 Bad debts written off 1 Balance at 31 December 4 3 Annual Report & Accounts 2018 146 NoTES To ThE CoNSoLIdATEd FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CoNTINuEd CONTRACTUAL MATURITIES OF FINANCIAL ASSETS 2018 6 MONTHS 6 MONTHS 1 - 5 MORE THAN TOTAL OR LESS - 1 YEAR YEARS 5 YEARS M M M M M Financial Assets Fixed Rate US dollar 4 4 Korean Won 8 8 Singapore dollar 108 69 39 New Taiwan dollar 24 22 2 Australian dollar 38 38 New Zealand dollar 62 62 Malaysian Ringgit 21 21 Euro 2 2 Chinese Renminbi 20 20 Non-Interest Bearing Sterling 9 9 US dollar 34 34 Singapore dollar 29 29 Australian dollar 5 5 New Zealand dollar 5 5 Malaysian Ringgit 1 1 Euro 22 22 Japanese Yen 17 17 Others 4 4 Interest Bearing Cash Pool deposits Singapore dollar 53 53 Non-Interest Bearing Cash Pool deposits Sterling 30 30 Total cash and other financial assets 496 453 41 2 Interest Bearing Cash Pool Overdrafts Sterling 24 24 Hong Kong dollar 19 19 Non-Interest Bearing Cash Pool Overdrafts Sterling 28 28 Euro 7 7 Total overdrafts Note 20 78 78 418 375 41 2 Represented by: Cash and cash equivalents Note 20 375 Financial assets Note 16 43 418 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc 147 CONTRACTUAL MATURITIES OF FINANCIAL ASSETS 2017 6 MONTHS 6 MONTHS 1 - 5 MORE THAN TOTAL OR LESS - 1 YEAR YEARS 5 YEARS M M M M M Financial Assets Fixed Rate US dollar 13 13 Korean Won 6 6 Singapore dollar 90 90 New Taiwan dollar 18 18 Australian dollar 5 5 New Zealand dollar 65 65 Malaysian Ringgit 18 18 Euro 1 1 Chinese Renminbi 17 17 Others 1 1 Non-Interest Bearing Sterling 29 29 US dollar 32 32 Singapore dollar 18 18 New Taiwan dollar 1 1 Malaysian Ringgit 1 1 Euro 17 17 Japanese Yen 14 14 Others 13 13 Interest Bearing Cash Pool deposits Singapore dollar 53 53 Japanese Yen 2 2 Total cash and other financial assets 414 414 Interest Bearing Cash Pool Overdrafts Sterling 24 24 Hong Kong dollar 22 22 Non-Interest Bearing Cash Pool Overdrafts Sterling 14 14 Total overdrafts Note 20 60 60 354 354 Represented by: Cash and cash equivalents Note 20 354 354 Annual Report & Accounts 2018 148 NoTES To ThE CoNSoLIdATEd FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CoNTINuEd b Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including estimated interest payments using the interest rates prevailing as at the reporting date.

Maturities of these facilities are set out in the following table.
The conditions precedent to the availability of these facilities are all satisfied at the balance sheet date.

Plans for refinancing the facilities are underway.
c Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The primary objectives of the treasury function are to provide secure and competitively priced funding for the activities of the Group and to identify and manage financial risks, including exposure to movements in interest and foreign exchange rates arising from those activities.
If appropriate, the Group uses financial instruments and derivatives to manage these risks, as set out below.
i Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on revenue, purchases, borrowings and cash deposits denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective Group entities.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US dollars, Singapore dollars, New Zealand dollars, New Taiwan dollars, Korean won, Chinese renminbi, Japanese yen and Euro.
The Groups principal policy, wherever possible, is to maintain a natural hedge whereby liabilities are matched with assets denominated in the same currency.
Foreign currency investment exposure is also minimised by borrowing in the currency of the investment.
To mitigate foreign currency translation exposure, an appropriate proportion of net assets are designated as hedged against corresponding financial liabilities in the same currency.
Net investment hedging The Group has US$161m 2017: US$163m US dollar loans and 7m 2017: 7m Euro loans designated as hedges of corresponding respective proportions of its net investment in foreign operations whose functional currencies are US dollars and Euros.
The risk being hedged is the foreign currency exposure on the carrying amount of the net assets of the foreign operation upon consolidation.
The fair value of the hedging instruments as at 31 December 2018 was 133m 2017: 128m.
An analysis of borrowings by currency and their fair values as at 31 December is given below: 31 dECEMBEr 2018 31 DECEMBER 2017 BooK vALuE FAIr vALuE BOOK VALUE FAIR VALUE M M M M Sterling 146 146 120 120 Singapore dollar 223 223 211 211 US dollar 468 468 432 432 New Zealand dollar 34 34 35 35 Chinese renminbi 27 27 30 30 Japanese yen 120 120 111 111 New Taiwan dollar 4 4 Korean Won 14 14 24 24 Euro 70 70 37 37 1,102 1,102 1,004 1,004 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc 151 Exchange differences arising on foreign currency loans during each accounting period are recognised as a component of equity, to the extent that the hedge is effective.
The foreign exchange exposure arising on the Groups net investment in its subsidiaries is expected to be highly effective in offsetting the exposure arising on the Groups foreign currency borrowings.
However during the year a 2m credit 2017: immaterial amount was recognised in the consolidated income statement that arose from hedges of net investments in foreign operations that were considered to be ineffective.
Foreign currency transaction exposure is primarily managed through funding of purchases from operating income streams arising in the same currency.
Hedging of transaction exposure is undertaken with approved counterparties and within designated limits, using spot or short-term forward contracts to buy or sell the currency concerned, once the timing and the underlying amount of exposure have been determined.
Foreign exchange derivatives may also be used to hedge specific transaction exposure where appropriate.

ii Interest rate risk and interest rate swaps The Group adopts a policy of ongoing review of its exposure to changes in interest rates on its borrowings, taking into account market expectations with regard to the perceived level of risk associated with each currency, the maturity profile and cash flows of the underlying debt, and the extent to which debt may potentially be either prepaid prior to its maturity or refinanced at reduced cost.
The Groups policy is to maintain a mixture of its financial liabilities on a fixed and floating-rate basis with a greater emphasis on floating rates presently as this flexibility is considered to be appropriate in the context of the Groups overall geographical diversity, investment and business cycle and the stability of the income streams, cash balances and loan covenants.
Interest rate derivatives are used to manage interest rate risk, to the extent that the perceived cost is considered to outweigh the benefit from the flexibility of variable rate borrowings, and the Group actively monitors the need and timing for such derivatives.
Where used, interest rate derivatives are classified as cash flow hedges and stated at fair value within the Groups consolidated statement of financial position.
Further details of interest rate derivatives in place at 31 December 2018 are provided hereafter.
Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc 153 Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments Assuming that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant, a change of one percentage point in the average interest rates applicable to variable rate instruments for the year would have increased decreased the Groups profit before tax for the year as shown below: 31 dECEMBEr 2018 31 DECEMBER 2017 1% 1% 1% 1% INCrEASE dECrEASE INCREASE DECREASE M M M M Variable rate financial assets 2 2 2 2 Variable rate financial liabilities 11 11 10 10 Cash flow sensitivity net 9 9 8 8 d Fair value Set out below is a comparison of the fair and book values of all the Groups financial instruments by category.

Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are either marked to market using listed market prices or by discounting the contractual forward price and deducting the current spot rate.
For interest rate swaps, bank valuations are used.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.
Finance lease liabilities The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at market interest rates for similar lease agreements.
The estimated fair values reflect changes in interest rates.
Trade and other receivables payables For receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
All other receivables payables are discounted to determine the fair value.
Interest rates used for determining fair value Prevailing market interest rates are used to discount cash flows to determine the fair value of financial assets and liabilities.
Fair value hierarchy As at 31 December 2018, the Group held certain financial instruments measured at fair value.
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly Level 3: techniques that use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data The table below provides a hierarchy analysis of financial instruments carried at fair value: 2018 2017 LEvEL 1 LEvEL 2 LEvEL 3 ToTAL LEVEL 1 LEVEL 2 LEVEL 3 TOTAL M M M M M M M M Equity investment at FVOCI 39 39 Currency derivative assets 2 2 Assets 41 41 Interest rate derivative liabilities 1 1 1 1 Liabilities 1 1 1 1 During the year ended 31 December 2018 there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements, and no transfers into and out of Level 3 fair value measures.
