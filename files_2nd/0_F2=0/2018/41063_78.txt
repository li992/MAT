10 Other 10.1 Related party transactions The Groups related party transactions in the period include the remuneration of the senior managers see note 1.7, and the Directors emoluments and pension entitlements, share awards and share options as disclosed in the audited section of the Directors remuneration report, which forms part of these financial statements.
During the year, the Group received a dividend of 8m 2017: 8m from MHE JVCo.
The Group has a 51.5% interest in MHE JVCo see note 4.2.
10.2 Guarantees and contingent liabilities Following the disposal of the land and building of its customer fulfilment centre CFC at Dordon to a third party see note 3.3 the Group continues to guarantee the lease in respect of this site.
If the lessee were to default, their lease obligations could revert back to the Group under the terms of the guarantee and become a liability of the Group.
Should the lessee default, the additional future commitment is estimated at up to 32m.
The Group has an ongoing legal case brought by a number of current and former colleagues relating to employee data theft in the 52 weeks ended 1 February 2015.
In December 2017, the High Court concluded that the Group was liable for the actions of the former employee who conducted the data theft.
The Group has since launched an appeal to this judgement and the High Court has confirmed that there will be no hearings on the level of compensation until the appeal has been concluded.
It is the Directors view that at this stage of the process the Group can not reliably assess the outcome of the case nor reasonably estimate the quantum of any loss and as such no provision has been recognised in these consolidated financial statements.
10.3 Post balance sheet events Following IAS 10 Events after the Balance Sheet Date, the Group continues to disclose events that it considers material and non-disclosure of which can influence the economic decisions of users of the financial statements.
On 19 February 2018, the Group acquired Chippindale Foods Limited, a leading supplier of free range eggs, for a consideration of 6m.
The Directors consider this event as a non-adjusting post balance sheet event.
