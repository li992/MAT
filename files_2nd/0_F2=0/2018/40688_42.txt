86 Financial Statements Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2018 4B.
PENSIONS AND SIMILAR OBLIGATIONS For defined benefit plans, operating and finance costs are recognised separately in the income statement.
The amount charged to operating cost in the income statement is the cost of accruing pension benefits promised to employees over the year, plus the costs of individual events such as past service benefit changes, settlements and curtailments such events are recognised immediately in the income statement.
The amount charged or credited to finance costs is a net interest expense calculated by applying the liability discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset.
Any differences between the expected interest on assets and the return actually achieved, and any changes in the liabilities over the year due to changes in assumptions or experience within the plans, are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
The defined benefit plan surplus or deficit on the balance sheet comprises the total for each plan of the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit liabilities using a discount rate based on high-quality corporate bonds, or a suitable alternative where there is no active corporate bond market.
All defined benefit plans are subject to regular actuarial review using the projected unit method, either by external consultants or by actuaries employed by Unilever.
The Group policy is that the most material plans, representing approximately 84% of the defined benefit liabilities, are formally valued every year.
Other material plans, accounting for a further 12% of the liabilities, have their liabilities updated each year.
Group policy for the remaining plans requires a full actuarial valuation at least every three years.
Asset values for all plans are updated every year.
For defined contribution plans, the charges to the income statement are the company contributions payable, as the companys obligation is limited to the contributions paid into the plans.
The assets and liabilities of such plans are not included in the balance sheet of the Group.
DESCRIPTION OF PLANS The Group increasingly operates a number of defined contribution plans, the assets of which are held in external funds.
In certain countries the Group operates defined benefit pension plans based on employee pensionable remuneration and length of service.
The majority of defined benefit plans are either career average, final salary or hybrid plans and operate on a funded basis.
Benefits are determined by the plan rules and are linked to inflation in some countries.
Our largest plans are in the UK and Netherlands.
In the UK, we operate a combination of an open career average defined benefit plan with a salary limit for benefit accrual, and a defined contribution plan.
In the Netherlands, we operate a collective defined contribution plan for all new benefit accrual and a closed career average defined benefit plan for benefits built up to April 2015.
The Group also provides other post-employment benefits, mainly post-employment healthcare plans in the United States.
These plans are predominantly unfunded.
GOVERNANCE The majority of the Groups externally funded plans are established as trusts, foundations or similar entities.
The operation of these entities is governed by local regulations and practice in each country, as is the nature of the relationship between the Group and the Trustees or equivalent and their composition.
Where Trustees or equivalent are in place to operate plans, they are generally required to act on behalf of the plans stakeholders.
They are tasked with periodic reviews of the solvency of the fund in accordance with local legislation and play a role in the long-term investment and funding strategy.
The Group also has an internal body, the Pensions and Equity Committee, that is responsible for setting the companys policies and decision-making on plan matters, including but not limited to design, funding, investments, risk management and governance.
INVESTMENT STRATEGY The Groups investment strategy in respect of its funded plans is implemented within the framework of the various statutory requirements of the territories where the plans are based.
The Group has developed policy guidelines for the allocation of assets to different classes with the objective of controlling risk and maintaining the right balance between risk and long-term returns in order to limit the cost to the Group of the benefits provided.
To achieve this, investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.
The plans continue to invest a good proportion of the assets in equities, which the Group believes offer the best returns over the long term, commensurate with an acceptable level of risk.
The plans expose the Group to a number of actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and, in certain markets, inflation risk.
There are no unusual entity or plan-specific risks to the Group.
For risk control, the pension funds also have significant investments in liability matching assets bonds as well as in property and other alternative assets: additionally, the Group uses derivatives to further mitigate the impact of the risks outlined above.
The majority of assets are managed by a number of external fund managers with a small proportion managed in-house.
Unilever has a pooled investment vehicle Univest which it believes offers its pension plans around the world a simplified externally managed investment vehicle to implement their strategic asset allocation models, currently for bonds, equities and alternative assets.
The aim is to provide high-quality, well diversified, cost-effective, riskcontrolled vehicles.
The pension plans investments are overseen by Unilevers internal investment company, the Univest Company.
ASSUMPTIONS With the objective of presenting the assets and liabilities of the pensions and other post-employment benefit plans at their fair value on the balance sheet, assumptions under IAS 19 are set by reference to market conditions at the valuation date.
The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the benefit liabilities vary according to the country in which the plan is situated.
The following table shows the assumptions, weighted by liabilities, used to value principal defined benefit plans representing approximately 96% of total pension liabilities and other post-employment benefit liabilities.

Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for healthcare plans.

These assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuation of the pension plans.
The years of life expectancy for 2018 above have been translated from the following tables: UK: The year of use S2 series all pensioners S2PA tables have been adopted, which are based on the experience of UK pension schemes over the period 2004-2011.
Scaling factors are applied reflecting the experience of our pension funds appropriate to the members gender and status.
Future improvements in longevity have been allowed for in line with the 2016 CMI core projections Sk 7.5 and a 1% pa long-term improvement rate.
Netherlands: The Dutch Actuarial Societys AG Prognosetafel 2018 table is used with correction factors 2017 to allow for the typically longer life expectancy for fund members relative to the general population.
This table has an in-built allowance for future improvements in longevity.
The remaining defined benefit plans are considered immaterial.
Their assumptions vary due to a number of factors including the currency and long-term economic conditions of the countries where they are situated.

The fair value of private equity, properties, derivatives and hedge funds are not based on quoted market prices in active markets.
The Group uses derivatives and other instruments to hedge some of its exposure to inflation and interest rate risk the degree of this hedging of liabilities was 55% for interest rate and 55% for inflation for the UK plan and 32% for interest rate and 29% for inflation for the Netherlands plan.
Foreign currency exposures in part are also hedged by the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
Assets included in the Other category are commodities, cash and insurance contracts which are also unquoted assets.
Equity securities include Unilever securities amounting to 12 million 0.1% of total plan assets and 14 million 0.1% of total plan assets at 31 December 2018 and 2017 respectively.

PENSIONS AND SIMILAR OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED The sensitivity analyses above have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period and may not be representative of the actual change.
It is based on a change in the key assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
When calculating the sensitivity to the assumption, the same method used to calculate the liability recognised in the balance sheet has been applied.
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared with the previous period.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS The fair value of awards at grant date is calculated using appropriate pricing models.
This value is expensed over their vesting period, with a corresponding credit to equity.
The expense is reviewed and adjusted to reflect changes to the level of awards expected to vest, except where this arises from a failure to meet a market condition.
Any cancellations are recognised immediately in the income statement.
As at 31 December 2018, the Group had share-based compensation plans in the form of performance shares, share options and other share awards.
The numbers in this note include those for Executive Directors shown in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 50 to 65 and those for key management shown in note 4A on page 86.
Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any of the share-based compensation plans.

The awards of each plan will vest between 0 and 200% of grant level, subject to the level of satisfaction of performance measures limits for Executive Directors may vary, and are detailed in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 50 to 65.
Under the GSIP, Unilevers managers receive annual awards of NV and PLC shares.
The performance measures for GSIP are underlying sales growth, underlying operating margin, and cumulative operating cash flow for the Group, although GSIP awards to certain managers below Unilever Leadership Executive level may be subject to similar performance measures specific to their business unit.
There is an additional target based on relative total shareholder return for senior executives.
GSIP awards will vest after three years.
The MCIP allows Unilevers managers to invest a proportion of their annual bonus a maximum of 67% for Executive Directors, 100% for other managers in shares in Unilever, and to receive a corresponding award of performance-related shares.
The performance measures for MCIP are underlying sales growth, underlying EPS growth, and sustainability progress index for the Group.
There is an additional target of return on invested capital for senior executives.
MCIP awards will vest after four years.
