Notes to the Group accounts 1.
Segmental analysis Revenue and profit recognition Revenue represents income derived from contracts for the provision of goods and services, over time or at a point in time, by the Group to customers in exchange for consideration in the ordinary course of the Groups activities.
Performance obligations Upon approval by the parties to a contract, the contract is assessed to identify each promise to transfer either a distinct good or service or a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer.
Goods and services are distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations in the contract if the customer can benefit from them either on their own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and they are separately identifiable in the contract.
The Group provides warranties to its customers to give them assurance that its products and services will function in line with agreed-upon specifications.
Warranties are not provided separately and, therefore, do not represent separate performance obligations.
Transaction price At the start of the contract, the total transaction price is estimated as the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods and services to the customer, excluding sales taxes.
Variable consideration, such as price escalation, is included based on the expected value or most likely amount only to the extent that it is highly probable that there will not be a reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised.
The transaction price does not include estimates of consideration resulting from contract modifications, such as change orders, until they have been approved by the parties to the contract.
The total transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations identified in the contract in proportion to their relative stand-alone selling prices.
Given the bespoke nature of many of the Groups products and services, which are designed and or manufactured under contract to the customers individual specifications, there are typically noobservable stand-alone selling prices.
Instead, stand-alone selling prices are typically estimated based on expected costs plus contract margin consistent with the Groups pricing principles.
Whilst payment terms vary from contract to contract, on many of the Groups contracts, an element of the transaction price is received in advance of delivery.
The Group therefore has significant contract liabilities note 21.
The Groups contracts are not considered to include significant financing components on the basis that there is no difference between the consideration and the cash selling price.
UK Ministry of Defence contracting rules prohibit the inclusion of financing in the sales price.
Negotiations on competitive international export contracts do not make allowance for the cash payment profile.
Revenue and profit recognition Revenue is recognised as performance obligations are satisfied as control of the goods and services is transferred to the customer.
For each performance obligation within a contract, the Group determines whether it is satisfied over time or at a point in time.
Performance obligations are satisfied over time if one of the following criteria is satisfied: the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Groups performance as it performs: the Groups performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced: or the Groups performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group and it has an enforceable right to payment forperformance completed to date.
The Group has determined that most of its contracts satisfy the over time criteria, either because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Groups performance as it performs typically services or support contracts or the Groups performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group and it has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date typically development or production contracts.
For each performance obligation to be recognised over time, the Group recognises revenue using an input method, based on costs incurred intheperiod.
Revenue and attributable margin are calculated by reference to reliable estimates of transaction price and total expected costs, after making suitable allowances for technical and other risks.
Revenue and associated margin are therefore recognised progressively ascosts are incurred, and as risks have been mitigated or retired.
The Group has determined that this method appropriately depicts the Groupsperformance in transferring control of the goods and services to the customer.
If the over time criteria for revenue recognition are not met, revenue is recognised at the point in time that control is transferred to the customer, which is usually when legal title passes to the customer and the business has the right to payment, for example, on delivery.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised immediately as an expense.
BAE Systems 148 Annual Report 2018 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 1.
Segmental analysis continued Software licences The Group sells software licences either separately or together with other goods and services, including computer hardware and implementation, hosting and support.
Revenue recognition in respect of software licences sold as part of a bundle of goods and services is considered separately when the licence is determined to be a separate performance obligation.
Software licences either represent a right to access the Groups intellectual property as it exists throughout the licence period or a right to use the Groups intellectual property as it exists at the point in time atwhich the licence is granted.
Revenue in respect of right to access licences is recognised over the licence term or, in relation to perpetual licences, over the related customer relationship and revenue in respect of right to use licences is recognised upfront on delivery to the customer.
Asoftware licence is considered to be a right to access the Groups intellectual property as it exists throughout the licence period if all of the following criteria are satisfied: the contract requires, or the customer reasonably expects, that the Group will undertake activities that significantly affect the intellectual property: and the licence directly exposes the customer to the effects of those activities: and those activities do not result in the transfer of a good or service to the customer.
Contract modifications The Groups contracts are often amended for changes in customers requirements and specifications.
A contract modification exists when the parties to the contract approve a modification that either changes existing or creates new enforceable rights and obligations.
The effect of a contract modification on the transaction price and the Groups measure of progress towards the satisfaction of the performance obligation to which it relates is recognised in one of the following ways: 1. prospectively, as an additional, separate contract: 2. prospectively, as a termination of the existing contract and creation of a new contract: or 3. as part of the original contract using a cumulative catch-up.
The majority of the Groups contract modifications are treated under either 1 for example, the requirement for additional distinct goods or services or 3 for example, a change in the specification of the distinct goods or services for a partially completed contract, although the facts and circumstances of any contract modification are considered individually as the types of modifications will vary contract-by-contract and may result in different accounting outcomes.
Costs to obtain a contract The Group expenses pre-contract bidding costs which are incurred regardless of whether a contract is awarded.
The Group does not typically incur costs to obtain contracts that it would not have incurred had the contracts not been awarded, such as sales commission.
Costs to fulfil a contract Contract fulfilment costs in respect of over time contracts are expensed as incurred.
Contract fulfilment costs in respect of point in time contracts are accounted for under IAS 2 Inventories.
Reporting segments With effect from 1 January 2018, the Group revised its reporting segments to reflect the organisational changes announced in 2017.
The five principal reporting segments are Electronic Systems: Cyber & Intelligence: Platforms & Services US : Air: and Maritime.
These align with the strategic direction of the Group.
Financial information for 2017 has been re-presented to reflect these new reporting segments.
Electronic Systems comprises the USand UK-based electronics activities, including electronic warfare systems, electro-optical sensors, military and commercial digital engine and flight controls, precision guidance and seeker solutions, next-generation military communications systems and data links, persistent surveillance capabilities, and hybrid electric drive systems: Cyber & Intelligence comprises the US-based Intelligence & Security business and UK-headquartered Applied Intelligence business, and covers the Groups cyber security, secure government, and commercial and financial security activities: Platforms & Services US, with operations in the US, UK and Sweden, manufactures combat vehicles, weapons and munitions, and delivers services and sustainment activities, including ship repair, and the management and operation of government-owned munitions facilities: Air comprises the Groups UK-based air activities for European and International Markets, and US Programmes, and its businesses in Saudi Arabia and Australia, together with its 37.5% interest in the European MBDA joint venture: Maritime comprises the GroupsUK-based maritime andland activities: and HQ comprises the Groups head office and UK-based shared services activities, together with a 49% interest in Air Astana.
The Board the chief operating decision maker as defined by IFRS 8 Operating Segments monitors the results of these reporting segments toassess performance and make decisions about the allocation of resources.

Key Performance Indicator Underlying EBITA Definition Operating profit excluding amortisation and impairment of intangible assets, finance costs and taxation expense of equity accounted investments EBITA, and non-recurring items.
Purpose Provides a measure of operating profitability that is comparable over time.
Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets are excluded because they are not related to the in-year operational performance of the business, being driven by the timing and amount of investment in acquired businesses and software.
Finance costs and taxation expense of equity accounted investments are excluded for consistency with pre-interest, pre-tax business performance.
Non-recurring items are items of financial performance which have been determined by management as being material by their size or incidence and not relevant to an understanding of the Groups underlying business performance.
The Groups definition of non-recurring items includes profit or loss on business transactions, and costs incurred which are one-off in nature, for example non-routine costs or income relating to post-retirement benefit schemes, and other exceptional items which management has determined as not being relevant to an understanding ofthe Groups underlying business performance.
2018 The non-recurring loss of 154m represents a Guaranteed Minimum Pension equalisation charge of 114m see note 22, and a loss on disposal of the Mobile, Alabama, shipyard of 40m.
2017 The non-recurring loss of 13m represented the loss on disposal of the BAE Systems San Francisco Ship Repair business.

Key Performance Indicator Order backlog Definition Funded and unfunded unexecuted customer orders including the Groups share of order backlog of equity accounted investments.
Unfunded orders include the elements of US multi-year contracts for which funding has not been authorised by the customer.
Purpose Supports future years sales performance of subsidiaries and equity accounted investments.
Performance obligations 1 The Groups order book, reconciled to order backlog as defined by the Group, is shown below.

Order book represents the transaction price allocated to unsatisfied and partially satisfied performance obligations as defined by IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts withCustomers.
As permitted under the transitional provisions of IFRS 15, comparative information in respect of the Groups order book is not disclosed.
The Group expects that approximately 35% of the order book asat31 December 2018 will be recognised as revenue during the next year, withthe remainder largely recognised over the following four years.
Revenue and attributable margin are calculated by reference to reliable estimates of transaction price and total expected costs, aftermaking suitable allowances for technical and other risks.
Revenue and associated margin are therefore recognised progressively ascosts areincurred, and as risks have been mitigated or retired.
Accordingly, revenue of 0.3bn was recognised duringtheyear ended 31 December 2018 in respect of performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in previous periods.

Taxation expense Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax.
Current and deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to a business combination or items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income.
Current tax Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable profit or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted atthe reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax is not recognised for temporary differences: on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxableprofit or loss: related to investments in subsidiaries and equity accounted investments to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future: and arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that havebeen enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

The US federal tax rate was reduced from 35% to 21% with effect from 1 January 2018, while the estimated state tax rate increased from 5% to 6%.
In line with this change, the rate applying to US deferred tax assets andliabilities at 31 December 2017 was reduced from 40% to 27%, creating a rate adjustment in 2017, which was partly reflected in the Consolidated income statement and partly intheConsolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The rate applying to US deferred tax assets andliabilities has been further reduced to 25.7% at 31 December 2018, creating a rate adjustment in 2018, which is partly reflected in the Consolidated income statement and partly in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

Earnings per share Key Performance Indicator Underlying earnings per share Definition Basic earnings per share excluding amortisation and impairment of intangible assets, non-cash finance movements on pensions andfinancial derivatives, non-recurring items and, in 2017, the impact of US tax reform enacted in December 2017.
Purpose Provides a measure of underlying performance that is comparable over time.
Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets are excluded because they are not related to the in-year operational performance of the business, being driven by the timing and quantum of investment in acquired businesses and software.
Non-cash finance movements on pensions are excluded because they are driven by external factors, such as corporate bond yields and inflation.
Non-cash finance movements on financial derivatives are excluded because they are driven by external factors, such as foreign exchange rates andinterest rates.
Non-recurring items as defined in note 1 are items of financial performance which have been determined by management as being material bytheir size or incidence and not relevant to an understanding of the Groups underlying performance.
In 2017, the impact of US tax reform enacted in December 2017 was excluded because it did not reflect the Groups in-year underlying taxrate.

Intangible assets Intangible assets are carried at cost or valuation, less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Cost or valuation Goodwill Under the acquisition method for business combinations, goodwill is the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred, less the net ofthe acquisition-date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included inintangible assets.
Goodwill on acquisitions of jointventures and associates is included in the carrying value of equity accounted investments.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Software Software includes: Computer software licences acquired for use within the Group are capitalised as an intangible asset on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software: and Software development costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, and that will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets.
Group-funded expenditure associated with enhancing or maintaining computer software programs for sale is recognised as an expense as incurred.
Development costs Development costs funded by the Group on activities applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products arecapitalised as an internally-generated intangible asset if certain conditions are met.
The costs capitalised includematerials, direct labour and related overheads.
Programme and customer-related Intangible assets recognised by the Group include those relating to ongoing programmes within businesses acquired, mainly in respect ofcustomer relationships and order backlog.
These assets are initially recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Other Other intangible assets includes patents, trademarks and licences.
Amortisation Goodwill is not amortised.
Amortisation on intangible assets, excluding goodwill, is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis overtheir estimated useful lives.
For programme-related intangibles, amortisation is set on a  basis over the life of the individual programme.
Amortisation for customer-related intangibles is also set on an individual basis.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Software 2 to 10 years Development costs up to 10 years Programme and customer-related up to 15 years Other up to 20 years The Group has no indefinite-life intangible assets other than goodwill.
Impairment of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, investment property and equity accounted investments The carrying amounts of the Groups intangible assets excluding goodwill, property, plant and equipment, investment property and equity accounted investments are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment as required by IAS36 Impairment of Assets.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
For goodwill and intangible assets thatare notyet available for use, impairment testing is performed annually.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its Cash-Generating Unit CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the greater of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash flows, the recoverable amount is determined for the CGU to which the asset belongs.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
An impairment loss in respect of other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, investment property and equity accounted investments is reversed if the subsequent increase in recoverable amount can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised or if there has been a change in the estimate used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

Intangible assets continued Impairment testing The recoverable amount of the Groups goodwill is based on value in use estimated using risk-adjusted future cash flow projections from the five-year Integrated Business Plan IBP and a terminal value based on the projections for the final year of that plan, with growth rate assumptions in the range 0% to 2% applied.
The IBP process includes the use of historical experience, available government spending data and the Groups order backlog.
Pre-tax discount rates, derived from the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 7.24% 2017 6.60% adjusted for risks specific to the market in which the Cash-Generating Unit CGU operates, have been used in discounting these projected risk-adjusted cashflows.
Significant CGUs Goodwill allocated to CGUs which are largely dependent on US government spending on defence, aerospace and security represents 8.2bn 20177.9bn of the Groups total goodwill balance.
The Group monitors changes in defence budgets on an ongoing basis.

The majority of the projected cash flows within these CGUs are underpinned by expected levels of primarily UK government spending on defence, aerospace and security, and the Groups ability to capture a broadly consistent market share.
In the case of Applied Intelligence, the future cash flow projections are based on the expectation ofgrowth in cyber and intelligence, in the UK and overseas government markets, together with increasing demand for products and services incommercial markets.
Impairment In 2017, the impairment charge of 384m reflected lower growth assumptions in the Applied Intelligence CGU.
The recoverable amount oftheApplied Intelligence CGU was based on value in use calculated using a pre-tax discount rate of 16%.
Software The software intangible assets balance includes 135m 2017 107m relating to an Enterprise Resource Planning transformation programme currently being implemented across the Air segment.
In line with the Groups amortisation policy, the intangible asset will be amortised over aperiod of 10 years as the programme becomes operational from 2019.

Property, plant and equipment Cost Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads.
The cost ofdemonstration assets iswritten off as incurred.
The reimbursement of the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment by way of a government grant is presented as deferred income and recognised in the income statement on a basis consistent with the depreciation of the asset over its estimated useful life.
Assets held for leasing out under operating leases are included inproperty, plant and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation Depreciation is provided, normally on a straight-line basis, to write off the cost of items of property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives to any estimated residual value, using the following rates: Buildings up to 50 years, or the lease term if shorter Plant and machinery: Computing equipment and motor vehicles 4 to 5 years Other equipment 10 to 20 years, or the project life if shorter For certain items of plant and equipment in the Groups US businesses, depreciation is normally provided on a basis consistent with cost reimbursement profiles under US government contracts.
Typically, this provides for a faster rate of depreciation than would otherwise arise onastraight-line basis.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land and assets in the course of construction.
The assets residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there isanyindication of impairment in accordance with the policy shown in note 8.

Equity accounted investments Equity accounted investments comprises joint ventures and associates.
A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have jointcontrol have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence.
The Group recognises its share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of equity accounted investments as a separate line in the Consolidated income statement and Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, respectively.
The carrying value of an equity accounted investment comprises the Groups share of net assets and purchased goodwill, and is assessed for impairment as a single asset.
The carrying amounts of the Groups equity accounted investments are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment in accordance with the policy shown in note 8.

Trade, other and contract receivables Trade receivables are stated at amortised cost including a provision for expected credit losses.
The Group measures the provision at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses, estimated by reference to past experience and relevant forward-looking factors.
The Group writes off a trade receivable when there is objective evidence that the debtor is in significant financial difficulty and there is no realistic prospect of recovery, for example, when a debtor enters bankruptcy or financial reorganisation.
Contract receivables represent amounts for which the Group has an unconditional right to consideration in respect of unbilled revenue recognised at the balance sheet date and comprise costs incurred plus attributable margin.

Other financial assets and liabilities Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The international nature of the Groups business means it is exposed to volatility in currency exchange rates.
In order to protect itself against currency fluctuations, the Groups policy is to hedge all material firm transactional exposures.
The Group uses interest rate derivative instruments to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings and deposits by varying the proportion of fixed rate debt relative to floating rate debt over the forward time horizon.
The Group uses foreign exchange derivative instruments to manage the Groups exposure to currency fluctuations on its borrowings and deposits with the Groups subsidiaries and equity accounted investments.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
The Group aims to achieve hedge accounting treatment for all derivatives that hedge material foreign currency exposures.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, such instruments are stated at fair value atthe balance sheet date.
The fair values are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows.
Fair value through profit or loss Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments that are not designated as cash flow hedges are recognised within finance costs in the incomestatement for the period.
Cash flow hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows relating to a highly probable forecast transaction income or expense or recognised asset or liability, the effective portion of any change in the fair value of the instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented inthehedging reserve in equity.
Amounts recognised in equity are reclassified from the hedging reserve into the cost of the underlying transaction and recognised in the income statement when the underlying transaction affects profit or loss.
The ineffective portion of any change in the fair valueof the instrument is recognised in the income statement immediately.
The Group treats the foreign currency basis element of the designated foreign exchange derivative hedging instruments as a cost of hedging and as such it is excluded from the hedge designation.
Fair value hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a fair value hedge, changes in the fair value of the underlying asset or liability attributable tothe hedged risk, and gains and losses on the derivative instrument, are recognised within finance costs in the income statement for the period.

BAE Systems Annual Report 2018 171 Notes to the Group accounts continued 14.
Deferred tax A deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and reduced tothe extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
The most significant recognised deferred tax assets relate to the deficits on the Groups pension retirement schemes see below.
This is because retirement benefit costs are deducted in determining accounting profit as service is provided by employees, but deducted in determining taxable profit either when contributions are paid to the pension retirement schemes or when retirement benefits are paid.
In reviewing the probability that taxable profits will be available in the future against which such contributions payments can be deducted, account has been taken of the deficit recovery plans agreed with the trustees of the relevant schemes in November 2017 under which the deficits are expected to be cleared between 2021 and 2026 see note 22.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to incometaxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different taxable entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.

Recognised US deferred tax balances have been calculated at a combined federal and state tax rate of 25.7% 2017 27%.
The UK current tax rate reduced from 20% to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017 and will reduce to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020.
This will reduce future UK current tax charges accordingly.
Both recognised and unrecognised UK deferred tax balances as at 31 December 2018 have been calculated at a blended rate of 17.5% 2017 17.5%.

Retirement benefits Pension schemes Defined contribution Obligations for contributions are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Defined benefit The cost of providing benefits is determined periodically by independent actuaries and charged to the income statement in the period in which those benefits are earned by the employees.
Remeasurements, including actuarial gains and losses, are recognised in the Consolidated statement ofcomprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Past service costs resulting from a plan amendment orcurtailment are recognised immediately in the income statement.
The retirement benefit surpluses and obligations recognised in the Groups balance sheet represent the fair value of scheme assets, less the present value of the defined benefit obligations calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions as set out on page 182.
The bid values of scheme assets are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised.
The present values of scheme liabilities are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are, therefore, inherently uncertain.
IAS 19 Employee Benefits, limits the measurement of a defined benefit surplus to the lower of the surplus in the defined benefit scheme and the asset ceiling.
The asset ceiling is the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the scheme or reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction, issued in 2007, provides an interpretation of the requirements of IAS 19, clarifying that a refund is available if the entity has an unconditional right to a refund in certain circumstances.
The Group has applied IFRIC 14 and has determined that there is no limit on the recognition of the surpluses in itsdefined benefit pension schemes as at 31 December 2018.
MBDA participates in the Groups defined benefit schemes and, as these are multi-employer schemes, the Group has allocated a share of the IAS19 pension surpluses and deficits to MBDA based on the relative payroll contributions of active members, which is consistent with prior years.
Whilst this methodology is intended to reflect a reasonable estimate of the share of the deficit, it may not accurately reflect the obligations of the participating employers.
In the event that an employer who participates in the Groups pension schemes fails or cannot be compelled to fulfil its obligations as a participating employer, the remaining participating employers are obliged to collectively take on its obligations.
The Group considers the likelihood of this event arising as remote.
The Groups share of the IAS 19 pension deficit allocated to equity accounted investments is included in the balance sheet within equity accounted investments.

Retirement benefits continued Background Pension schemes BAE Systems plc operates pension schemes for the Groups qualifying employees in the UK, US and other countries.
The principal schemes in the UK and US are funded defined benefit schemes, and the assets are held in separate trustee-administered funds.
Thetwo largest funded defined benefit schemes are the BAE Systems Pension Scheme Main Scheme and the BAE Systems 2000 Pension Plan 2000 Plan which, inaggregate, represent 82% 2017 81% of the UK IAS 19 defined benefit obligation at 31December 2018.
The schemes in other countries are primarily defined contribution schemes.
At 31 December 2018, the weighted average durations of the UK and US defined benefit pension obligations were 17 years 2017 18years and11years 2017 12 years, respectively.
The split of the defined benefit pension liability on a funding basis between active, deferred and pensioner members for the Main Scheme, 2000Plan and US schemes in aggregate is set out below: Active Deferred Pensioner % % % 1 Main Scheme 35 20 45 2 2000 Plan 16 30 54 3 US schemes 30 17 53 1.

Regulatory framework The funded UK schemes are registered and subject to the statutory scheme specific-funding requirements outlined in UK legislation, including thepayment of levies to the Pension Protection Fund as set out in the Pension Act 2004.
These schemes were established under trust and the responsibility for their governance lies jointly with the trustees and the Group.
The funded US schemes are tax-qualified pension schemes regulated by the Pension Protection Act 2006 and insured by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation PBGC up to certain limits.
These schemes were established under, and are governed by, the US Employee Retirement Income Security Act 1974 and the BAE Systems Administrative Committee is a named fiduciary with the authority to manage their operation.
Benefits The UK defined benefit schemes provide benefits to members in the form of a set level of pension payable for life based on members final salaries.
The benefits attract inflation-related increases both in deferment and payment.
All UK defined benefit schemes are closed to new entrants, with benefits for new employees being provided through a defined contribution scheme.
The Normal Retirement Age for active members of the Main Scheme and 2000 Plan is 65.
Specific benefits applicable to members differ between schemes.
Further details on the benefits provided by each scheme are provided on the BAE Systems Pensions website: baesystemspensions.
A UK High Court judgment was delivered on 26 October 2018 concerning gender equalisation for the effect of Guaranteed Minimum Pensions GMPs foroccupational pension schemes.
It is expected that the impact of GMP equalisation will be in the region of 121m based on an estimate asat26 October 2018 for the UK schemes that were contracted out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme between 1990 and 1997.
Thishas been treated for IAS 19 purposes as a plan amendment and resulted in an increase in the pension deficit in the balance sheet and acorresponding non-recurring past service cost in the income statement.
The Group has allocated a share of the past service cost to MBDA based on the relative payroll contributions of active members.
The Groups share of the 121m is 110m in respect of the Groups subsidiaries, plus 4m for the Groups share of MBDAs allocation.
Theremaining 7m relates to the share allocated to other participating employers.
The US defined benefit schemes ceased to be final salary schemes in January 2013.
The benefits accrued based on the final salaries ofmembers atthat point will become payable on retirement.
The Normal Retirement Age for the largest scheme in the US is 65.
Other retirement benefits The Group operates a number of non-pension retirement benefit schemes, under which certain employees are eligible to receive benefitsafter retirement, the majority of which relate to the provision of medical benefits to retired employees of the Groups subsidiaries in the US.

Retirement benefits continued Funding Introduction Disclosures in respect of pension funding are provided below.
Disclosures in respect of pension accounting under IAS 19 are provided on pages 182to 188.
The majority of the UK and US defined benefit pension schemes are funded by the Groups subsidiaries and equity accounted investments.
Theindividual pension schemes funding requirements are based on actuarial measurement frameworks set out in their funding policies.
For funding valuation purposes, pension scheme assets are included at market value at the valuation date, whilst the liabilities are measured onanactuarial funding basis using the projected unit credit method and discounted to their present value based on prudent assumptions set bythe trustees following consultation with scheme actuaries.
The funding valuations are performed by professionally qualified independent actuaries and include assumptions which differ from the actuarial assumptions used for IAS 19 accounting purposes shown on page 182.
The purpose of the funding valuations is to design funding plans which ensure that the schemes have sufficient funds available to meet future benefit payments.
UK valuations Funding valuations of the Groups nine UK defined benefit pension schemes are performed every three years.
The latest valuations were performed as at 31 March 2017.
The next funding valuations will have an effective date of no later than 31 March 2020.
In November 2017, the triennial funding valuations and, where necessary, deficit recovery plans were agreed with the trustees and certified bythescheme actuaries after consultation with the UK Pensions Regulator.
The results of the most recent triennial valuations are shown below: At 31 March 2017 Main 2000 Scheme Plan Other Total bn bn bn bn Market value of assets 12.8 4.3 4.5 21.6 Present value of liabilities 14.4 4.6 4.7 23.7 Funding deficit 1.6 0.3 0.2 2.1 Percentage of accrued benefits covered by the assetsat the valuation date 89% 93% 96% 91% The valuations were determined using the following mortality assumptions: 2017 Life expectancy of a male currently aged 65 years 86 89 Life expectancy of a female currently aged 65 years 88 90 Life expectancy of a male currently aged 45 years 88 92 Life expectancy of a female currently aged 45 years 91 93 The discount rate assumptions used in the 2017 valuations were directly based on prudent levels of expected returns for the assets held by theschemes, reflecting the planned investment strategies and maturity profiles of each scheme.
The discount rates are curves which provide adifferent rate for each year into the future.
The inflation assumptions were derived using data from the Bank of England which is based on the difference between the yields on index-linked and fixed interest long-term government bonds.
The inflation assumption is a curve which provides a different rate for each year into the future.
In aggregate, the net funding deficit across the UK schemes at 31 March 2017 was 2.1bn.
The funding valuations resulted in a significantly lowerdeficit than under IAS 19, largely due to lower liabilities reflecting the higher discount rate assumption.
Under IAS 19, the discount rate foraccounting purposes is based on third-party AA corporate bond yields whereas, for funding valuation purposes, the discount rate is based ona prudent level of expected returns from the broader and mixed types of investments reflected in the schemes investment strategies, which are expected overall to yield higherreturns than bonds.
The agreements reached are underpinned by contingency plans, which include a commitment by the Group to a further 50m of deficit funding into the largest scheme prior to the next triennial valuation in the event that the scheme funding level was to fall below pre-determined parameters.
In addition, the Group would be required to pay 187m across its schemes with deficits at the valuation date if the funding levels for those schemes were to fall significantly and were to remain at or below those levels for nine months.
There have been no changes to the contributions or benefits, as set out in the rules of the schemes, for pension scheme members as a result ofthe new funding valuations.
The results of future triennial valuations and associated funding requirements will be impacted by a number of factors, including the future performance of investment markets and anticipated members longevity.
US valuations The Groups US pension schemes are valued annually, with the latest valuations performed as at 1 January 2018.
BAE Systems 180 Annual Report 2018 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 22.
Retirement benefits continued Funding continued Contributions Under the terms of the trust deeds of the UK schemes, the Group is required to have a funding plan determined at the conclusion of the triennial funding valuations.
Equity accounted investments make regular contributions to the schemes in which they participate in line with the schedule of contributions andare allocated a share of deficit funding contributions.
In 2018, total employer contributions to the Groups pension schemes were 554m 2017 433m, including amounts funded by equity accounted investments of 38m 2017 31m, and included approximately 211m 2017 209m of deficit recovery payments in respect of the UK schemes, and 119m 2017 62m in respect of the US schemes.
Deficit contributions will further increase in line with any percentage growth in dividend payments made by the Group.
Under the deficit recovery plans, these annual payments would subsequently fall by approximately 50m in 2022 as the deficits on certain schemes are expected to be cleared.
The annual payments are expected to end in 2026 when all deficits are projected to be cleared.
Under thelast agreement made in 2014, all scheme deficits were projected to be cleared in 2026.
In 2019, the Group expects that contributions to its UK pension schemes will be broadly in line with 2018, whilst contributions to its US pension schemes are expected to reduce.
Risk management The defined benefit pension schemes expose the Group to actuarial risks, including market investment risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk andlongevity risk.
Risk Mitigation Market investment risk The investment portfolios are highly diversified, investing in a wide range of assets, in order to reduce theexposure of the total portfolio to a materially adverse impact from a single security or type of security.
Asset returns may not move To reduce volatility, certain assets are held in a matching portfolio, which largely consists of index-linked inlinewith the liabilities and bonds, gilts and swaps, designed to mirror movements in corresponding liabilities.
Some 43% 2017 47% of the Groups pension scheme assets are held in equities and pooled investment vehicles due to the higher expected level of return over the long term.
Some of the Groups pension schemes use derivative financial instruments as part of their investment strategy to manage the level of market risk.
The Main Scheme and one of the Groups other UK defined benefit pension schemes jointly have an equity option strategy protecting 1.8bn of assets against a significant fall in equity markets.
In February 2019 this protection was extended to cover 2.6bn of assets.
Interest rate risk In addition to investing in bonds as part of the matching portfolio, some of the UK schemes invest in interest rate swaps to reduce the exposure to movements in interest rates.
The swaps are held with several Liabilities are sensitive to banks to reduce counterparty risk.

rate risk than theywere in the 2014 funding valuation.
Accordingly, the 2017 approach provides a more natural hedge against interest rate risk.
The planned investment strategy, which is reflected in the discount rate and liability calculation, is for the schemes to increase their investments in bonds or other assets which match the liabilities as the schemes mature.
Under the 2017 UK funding valuation, the Group expects the schemes to be fully hedged against interest rate movements following a five-year transition period to the planned investment strategy.
Inflation risk In addition to investing in index-linked bonds as part of the matching portfolio, the principal UK schemes invest in long-term inflation swaps to reduce the exposure to movements in inflation.
The swaps are held Liabilities are sensitive to with several banks to reduce counterparty risk.
The Groups US schemes are not indexed with inflation.
movementsin inflation, with higherinflation leading to The approach to the 2017 UK funding valuation provides a more natural hedge against inflation anincrease in the valuation movements and, therefore, the liabilities are less sensitive to inflation risk than they were in the 2014 ofliabilities.
Under the 2017 UK funding valuation approach, the Group is already fully hedged against inflation movements and, under the planned investment strategy, the Group aims to maintain afully hedged position.
In 2014, the Main Scheme implemented a pension increase exchange to allow retired members to elect for a higher current pension in exchange for foregoing certain rights tofuture pension increases.
Longevity risk Longevity adjustment factors are used in the majority of the UK pension schemes in order to adjust thepension benefits payable so as to share the cost of people living longer withemployees.
Liabilities are sensitive to lifeexpectancy, with increases In 2013, with the agreement of the Company, the trustees of the 2000 Plan, Royal Ordnance Pension inlifeexpectancies leading Scheme and Shipbuilding Industries Pension Scheme entered into arrangements with Legal & General toanincrease in the valuation toinsure against longevity risk for the current pensioner population, covering a total of 4.4bn of pension ofliabilities.
These arrangements reduce the funding volatility relating to increasing life expectancy.

This inherently captures the maturity profile of the expected benefit payments.
For the UK territory, the discount rate used for future service differs from that used for past service as it only uses the cash flows relating to active members, which have a different duration.
Further information on the duration of the schemes is detailed onpage 179.
Retail Prices Index RPI inflation In the UK, the inflation assumptions are derived by reference to the difference between the yields on index-linked and fixed-interest long-term government bonds, or advice from the local actuary depending on the available information.
In the US, inflation assumptions are not relevant asthe Groups US pension schemes are not indexed with inflation.
Rate of increase in salaries The rate of increase in salaries for the UK schemes is assumed to be RPI inflation of 3.1% 2017 RPI inflation of 3.1%, plus apromotional scale.
From 1 January 2013, employees in the US schemes no longer accrue salary-related benefits.
Rate of increase in deferred pensions The rate of increase in deferred pensions for the UK schemes is based on Consumer Prices Index CPI inflation of 2.1% 2017 CPI inflation of2.1%, with the exception ofthe 2000 Plan, which is based on RPI inflation of 3.1% 2017 RPI inflation of 3.1%.
For all UK schemes, the rate ofincrease in deferred pensions is subject to inflation caps.
Rate of increase in pensions in payment The rate of increase in pensions in payment differs between UK schemes.
Different tranches of the schemes benefits increase at rates based oneither RPI or CPI inflation, and some are subject to an inflation cap.
With the exception of two smaller schemes, the rate of increase in pensionsin payment is based on RPI inflation.
Life expectancy For its UK pension schemes, the Group has used the Self-Administered Pension Schemes S2 mortality tables based on year of birth as published by the Institute of Actuaries for both pensioner and non-pensioner members in conjunction with the results of an investigation into the actual mortality experience of scheme members and information on the demographic profile of the schemes membership.
In addition, to allow for future improvements in longevity, the Continuous Mortality Investigation 2017 tables published by the Institute of Actuaries have been used in2017, the Continuous Mortality Investigation 2016 tables were used, with an assumed long-term rate of future annual mortality improvements of 1.25% 2017 1.25%, for both pensioner and non-pensioner members.
In October 2015, the Society of Actuaries in the US released updated mortality assumptions reflecting the results of its comprehensive mortality study.
For the majority of the US schemes, the mortality tables used at 31 December 2018 are a blend of the fully generational RP-2014 Aggregate table and the RP-2014 White Collar table, both projected using Scale MP-2018.
The IRS have approved the new mortality tables to be adopted forfunding valuation purposes from 2019.
US healthcare schemes The latest valuations of the principal schemes, covering retiree medical and life insurance schemes in certain USsubsidiaries, were performed by independent actuaries as at 1 January 2018.
These valuations were rolled forward to reflect the information at 31 December 2018.
The method ofaccounting for these is similar to that used for defined benefit pension schemes.
The assumption for long-term healthcare cost increases is 4.9% 2017 4.9% based on the assumptions that the increases are 7.8% in2018 reducing to 4.5% by 2026 and 4.5% each year thereafter for pre-retirement, and 8.5% in 2018 reducing to 4.5% by 2026 and 4.5% each yearthereafter for post-retirement.

Retirement benefits continued IAS 19 accounting continued Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity information has been derived using scenario analysis from the actuarial assumptions as at 31 December 2018 and keeping all other assumptions as set out on page 182.
Financial assumptions The estimated impact of changes in the discount rate and inflation assumptions on the defined benefit pension obligation, together with the estimated impact on scheme assets, is shown in the table below.
The estimated impact on scheme assets takes into account the Groups risk management activities in respect of interest rate and inflation risk.
The sensitivity analysis on the defined benefit obligation is measured on anIAS19 accounting basis and, therefore, does not reflect the natural hedging in the discount rate used for funding valuation purposes.
Increase decrease Increase decrease 1 1 inpension obligation inscheme assets bn bn Discount rate: 0.1 percentage point increase 0.5 0.2 0.1 percentage point decrease 0.5 0.2 Inflation: 0.1 percentage point increase 0.4 0.2 0.1 percentage point decrease 0.4 0.2 1.
Before allocation to equity accounted investments.
The sensitivity of the valuation of the liabilities to changes in the inflation assumption presented above assumes that a 0.1 percentage point change to expectations of future inflation results in a 0.1 percentage point change to all inflation-related assumptions rate of increase in salaries, rate of increase in deferred pensions and rate of increase in pensions in payment used to value the liabilities.
However, upper and lower limits exist on the majority of inflation-related benefits such that a change in expectations of future inflation may not have the same impact on the inflation-related benefits, and hence will result in a smaller change to the valuation of the liabilities.
Accordingly, extrapolation of the above results beyond the specific sensitivity figures shown may not be appropriate.
To illustrate this, the increase decrease in the defined benefit pension obligation resulting from larger changes in the inflation assumption would be as follows: Increase decrease 1 inpension obligation bn Inflation: 0.5 percentage point increase 1.3 0.5 percentage point decrease 1.3 1.0 percentage point increase 2.8 1.0 percentage point decrease 2.5 1.
Demographic assumptions Changes in the life expectancy assumption, including the benefit of longevity swap arrangements see longevity risk on page 181, wouldhave thefollowing effect on the total net IAS 19 deficit: Increase decrease 1 innet deficit bn Life expectancy: One-year increase 1.1 One-year decrease 1.1 1.

Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at an appropriate pre-tax discount rate.
Warranties and after-sales service Warranties and after-sales service are provided in the normal course of business with provisions for associated costs being made based on an assessment of future claims with reference to past experience.
A provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products and services are sold.
The provision is based on historical warranty data and a weighting of possible outcomes against their associated probabilities.
Reorganisations A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced to those affected.
The costs associated with the reorganisation programmes are supported by detailed plans and based on previous experience as well as other known factors.
Future operating costs are not provided for.
Legal, contractual and environmental The Group holds provisions for expected legal, contractual and environmental costs that it expects to incur over an extended period.
Management exercises judgement to determine the amount of these provisions.
Provision is made for known issues based on past experience of similar items and other known factors.
Each provision is considered separately and the amount provided reflects the best estimate of the most likely amount, being the single most likely amount in a range of possible outcomes.

Warranties and after-sales service Warranty and after-sales service costs are generally incurred within three years post-delivery.
Whilst actual events could result in potentially significant differences to the quantum, but not the timing, of the outflows in relation to the provisions, management has reflected current knowledge in assessing the provision levels.
Reorganisations Reorganisation costs are generally incurred within one to three years.
There is limited volatility around the timing and amount of the ultimate outflows related to these provisions.
Other debtors includes 46m 2017 89m which is reimbursable in respect of reorganisation costs.
Legal, contractual and environmental Reflecting the inherent uncertainty within many legal proceedings, the amount of the outflows could differ significantly from the amount provided and the timing of the outflows cannot be estimated reliably.
Other There are no individually significant provisions included within other provisions.

Fair value measurement Fair value of financial instruments Certain of the Groups financial instruments are held at fair value.
The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of financial instruments held at fair value have been determined based on available market information at the balance sheet date, and the valuation methodologies listed below: the fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts are calculated by discounting the contracted forward values and translating at the appropriate balance sheet rates: the fair values of both interest rate and cross-currency swaps are calculated by discounting expected future principal and interest cash flows andtranslating at the appropriate balance sheet rates: and the fair values of money market funds are calculated by multiplying the net asset value per share by the investment held at the balance sheetdate.
Due to the variability of the valuation factors, the fair values presented at 31 December may not be indicative of the amounts the Group would expect to realise in the current market environment.
Fair value hierarchy The fair value measurement hierarchy is as follows: Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices orindirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data i. e. unobservable inputs.

US$500m of the US$800m 3.8% bond, repayable 2024, has been converted to a floating rate bond by utilising interest rate swaps.
These derivatives have been designated as fair value hedges.
Changes in the fair value of the bond attributable to interest rate risk, and gains and losses on the derivatives are recognised in the income statement.
The bond has been included in financial instruments not measured at fair value because its carrying value has only been adjusted for the fair value attributable to interest rate risk on a portion of the bond, which has been calculated by discounting the future cash flows and translating at the appropriate balance sheet rate.
All of the financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified as level 2 using the fair value hierarchy, except for money market funds, which are classified as level 1.
There were no transfers between levels during the year.
Financial assets and liabilities in the Groups Consolidated balance sheet are either held at fair value or their carrying value approximates to fair value, with the exception of loans, most of which are held at amortised cost.
The fair value of loans presented in the table above is derived from market prices.

Financial risk management Interest rate risk The Groups objective is to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on borrowings through varying the proportion of fixed rate debt relative to floating rate debt with derivative instruments, including interest rate and cross-currency swaps.
The Groups interest rate management policy is that a minimum of 50% 2017 50% and a maximum of 90% 2017 90% of gross debt is maintained at fixed interest rates.
At 31 December 2018, the Group had 81% 2017 82% of fixed rate debt and 19% 2017 18% of floating ratedebt based on a gross debt of 4.1bn, including debt-related derivative financial assets 2017 4.0bn.
The only derivatives that have been designated as fair value hedges are the fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps converting US$500m of the US$800m 3.8% bond, repayable 2024.
These derivative liabilities have a fair value of 2m 2017 nil and will mature in October 2019.
Changes inthe fair value of the bond attributable to interest rate risk, and gains and losses on the derivatives are recognised in the income statement.
The loss arising in the income statement on fair value hedging instruments was 2m 2017 4m.
The gain arising in the income statement on thefair value of the underlying hedged item was 1m 2017 4m.
The accumulated fair value loss included within the carrying amount of the hedged item is nil 2017 1m.
Based on contracted maturities and or repricing dates, the following amounts are exposed to interest rate risk over the future as shown below: Less than Between one More than one year and two years two years m m m Cash and cash equivalents 3,232 Loans and overdrafts 784 702 702 The floating rate debt has been predominantly achieved by entering into interest rate swaps which swap the fixed rate US dollar interest payable ondebt into either floating rate sterling or US dollars.
At the end of 2018, the Group had a total of $1.0bn 2017 $1.0bn of this type of swap outstanding with a weighted average duration of 5.8 years 2017 5.6 years.
In respect of the fixed rate debt, the weighted average period in respect of which interest is fixed was 8.5 years 2017 9.5 years.
Given the level of short-term interest rates during the year, the average cost ofthe floating rate debt was 5.5% 2017 4.6% on US dollars.
Thecost of the fixed rate debt was 4.8% 2017 4.9%.
Sensitivity analysis A change of 100 basis points in short-term rates applied to the average fixed floating mix and level of borrowings would vary the interest cost tothe Group by approximately 7m 2017 7m.
In respect of cash deposits, given the fluctuation in the Groups working capital requirements, cash is generally invested for short-term periods based at floating interest rates.
A change of 100 basis points in the average interest rates during the year applied to the average cash deposits would vary the interest receivable by approximately 20m 2017 14m.
Liquidity risk Contractual cash outflows on financial liabilities The contracted cash outflows on loans and overdrafts, and derivative financial instruments at the reporting date are shown below, classified bymaturity.
The cash outflows are shown on a gross basis, are not discounted, are translated at the spot rate and include estimated interest payments where applicable.
Contracted cash outflows reflects the gross cash outflow on derivative financial instruments and excludes the broadly offsetting cash inflows for the receive leg of derivatives that are settled separately to the pay leg.

BAE Systems Annual Report 2018 195 Notes to the Group accounts continued 29.
Financial risk management continued Borrowing facilities The Groups objective is to maintain adequate undrawn committed borrowing facilities.
At 31 December 2018, the Group had a committed Revolving Credit Facility RCF of 2bn 2017 2bn.
The RCF was undrawn throughout the year.
The RCF also acts as a backstop toCommercial Paper issuedby the Group.
At 31 December 2018, the Group had no Commercial Paper inissue 2017 nil.
Cash management Cash flow forecasting is performed by the businesses on a monthly basis.
The Group monitors a rolling forecast of its liquidity requirements toensure that there is sufficient cash to meet operational needs and maintain adequate headroom.
Surplus cash held by the businesses over and above balances required for working capital management is loaned to the Groups centralised treasury department.
Surplus cash is invested in instant-access current accounts, short-term deposits and money market funds, choosing instruments with appropriate maturities or sufficient liquidity to provide adequate headroom as determined by cash forecasts.
The Groups objective is to monitor and control counterparty credit risk and credit limit utilisation.
The Group adopts a conservative approach tothe investment of its surplus cash which is deposited with financial institutions with strong credit ratings for short periods.
The cash and cashequivalents balance at 31 December 2018 of 3,232m 2017 3,271m was invested with 31 2017 33 financial institutions.
A credit limit isallocated to each institution taking account of its market capitalisation, credit rating and credit default swap price.
The cash and cash equivalents of the Group are invested in non-speculative financial instruments which are usually highly liquid, such asshort-term deposits.
The Group, therefore, believes it has reduced its exposure to counterparty credit risk through this process.
Currency risk The Groups objective is to reduce its exposure to transactional volatility in earnings and cash flows from movements in foreign currency exchangerates, mainly the US dollar, euro, Saudi riyal and Australian dollar.
The Group is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of foreign currency denominated transactions.
All material firmtransactional exposures are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts and the Group aims, where possible, to apply cash flow hedgeaccounting to these transactions.
The currency and notional amount of the designated hedging instruments match the currency and principal amounts of the forecast transactionsbeing hedged, therefore the hedging instruments and hedged items have values which will generally move in opposite directions because of the same hedged risk.
As the critical terms of the hedging instruments match those of the hedged items, an economic relationship canbe demonstrated on an ongoing basis.
The hedge ratio is 1:1 on the basis that the notional amount of the designated hedging instruments matches the principal amount of the forecastforeign currency sales purchases designated as the hedged items.
The Group considers the potential sources of hedge ineffectiveness to be: valuation adjustments for credit risk made to derivative hedging instruments at each hedge effectiveness measurement date: foreign currency basis inherent in the ongoing re-pricing of designated foreign currency derivative hedging instruments which arenotpresentinthe ongoing re-pricing of the hedged items: changes in the timing of the designated hedged items: non-occurrence of the designated hedged items.
The effect of cash flow hedges on the Groups financial position and performance for the year ended 31 December 2018 is as follows: Change in the value of Change in Weighted hedging the value of average instruments hedged items Notional hedged since 1January since 1 January amount rate m m m Purchase sale contracts: Sterling US dollar 1.37 25 25 872 Sterling euro 1.17 6 6 475 Other 17 17 35 Cash flow hedges foreign exchangecontracts 14 14 1,382 The Notional amount is the sterling equivalent of the net currency amount purchased or sold.
For example, for designated sterling US dollar cash flow hedges, the Group has purchased a net $1,195m at a weighted average rate of 1.37 costing 872m.
The hedged, highly probable forecast transactions denominated in foreign currency are predominantly expected to occur at various stages during the next five years.
Amounts charged to the hedging reserve in respect of cash flow hedges were 25m 2017 61m, including a 39m charge 2017 24m credit onreclassification toprofit and loss, and a 14m credit 2017 37m credit on contracts held at 31 December 2018.
Additional information on the Groups derivative financial instruments is provided in note 13.
BAE Systems 196 Annual Report 2018 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 29.
Financial risk management continued Sensitivity analysis The Group is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of the translation of net assets and income statements of foreign subsidiaries and equity accounted investments.
The Group does not hedge the translation effect of exchange rate movements on the income statements or balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries and equity accounted investments it regards as long-term investments.
The estimated impact on foreign exchange gains and losses in net finance costs of a ten cent movement in the closing sterling to US dollar exchange rate onthe retranslation of US dollar-denominated bonds held by BAE Systems plc is approximately 56m 2017 49m.
Credit risk For trade receivables, contract receivables and amounts due from equity accounted investments, the Group measures a provision for expected credit losses at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses, estimated by reference to past experience and relevant forward-looking factors.
The Groups assessment is that credit risk in relation to defence-related salesto government customers or sub-contractors to governments is extremely low as the probability of default is insignificant: therefore the provision for expected credit losses is immaterial in respect of receivables from these customers.
For all non-government commercial customers, the Group assesses expected credit losses, however this is not considered material to the financial statements.
The Group considers that default has occurred when a receivable is past 180 days overdue, because historical experience indicates that these receivables are generally not recoverable.
The Group recognises a provision of 100% against all receivables over 180 days past due unless there is objective evidence that individual receivables in this category are recoverable.
Excluding the UK, US and Saudi Arabian governments where credit risk is not considered an issue, no one counterparty constitutes more than 7% of the trade receivables balance 2017 2%.
The carrying amount of the Groups financial assets represents the maximum exposure to credit risk.
Movements on the provision for expected credit losses are as follows: 2018 2017 m m At 1 January 35 40 Net remeasurement of loss allowance 3 3 Amounts written off 2 1 Foreign exchange gains and losses 1 At 31 December 30 35 For contract receivables and amounts due from equity accounted investments the expected credit loss provision is immaterial as the probability ofdefault is insignificant.
None of the trade receivables that were written off during the year are still subject to enforcement activity.
The ageing of trade receivables is detailed below: 2018 2017 Gross Provision Net Gross Provision Net m m m m m m Not past due 873 873 1,119 1,119 Up to 180 days overdue 304 304 369 369 Past 180 days overdue 280 30 250 211 35 176 1,457 30 1,427 1,699 35 1,664 Trade receivables past 180 days overdue primarily relate to contracts in Saudi Arabia.
The Group has assessed the risk of default and recoverability of these receivables at the balance sheet date and the expected credit losses in respect of these balances are not considered to be material.
