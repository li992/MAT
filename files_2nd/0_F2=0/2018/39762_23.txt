In accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102, the preceding tables provide an analysis of these investments based on the fair value hierarchy described below, which reflects the reliability and significance of the information used to measure their fair value.
Fair Value Hierarchy The fair value hierarchy used to analyse the fair values of financial assets is described below.
The levels are determined by the lowest that is the least reliable or least independently observable level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement for the individual investment in its entirety as follows: Level 1 using unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in an active market: Level 2 using inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are directly or indirectly observable based on market data : and Level 3 using inputs that are unobservable for which market data is unavailable.
The valuation techniques used by the Company are explained in the accounting policies on page 48.

The cumulative effect is to increase the carrying amount of borrowings by 3,618,000 2017 4,035,000 over nominal value.
The debenture stocks are secured by a floating charge over the assets of the Company.
Unsecured loan notes During the year the Company issued the following private placement unsecured loan notes: 45 million at a coupon of 3.05% maturing on 7 April 2042 30 million at a coupon of 3.30% maturing on 6 April 2044 30 million at a coupon of 3.12% maturing on 6 April 2047 A further unsecured loan note was agreed for funding on 30 September 2020 to refinance the 20 million 814% stepped interest debenture stock maturing on 30 September 2020: 20 million at a coupon of 3.65% maturing on 6 April 2044 The unsecured loan notes are stated at the cumulative amount of net proceeds after issue.
The cumulative effect is to reduce the carrying amount of borrowing by 257,000.
Borrowing Limits Under the terms of the Articles of Association and the Debenture Trust Deeds, total borrowings should not exceed a sum equal to one half of the adjusted total of capital and reserves at the Companys year end.
Such treasury shares may be subsequently either sold for cash at, or at a premium to, net asset value per ordinary share or cancelled.
At 31 March 2018 the Company had authority to buy back a further 191,711,909 ordinary shares.
Under the provisions of the Companys Articles the share buy-backs were funded from the capital reserve.
In the year to 31 March 2018, the Company sold 50,800,000 ordinary shares from treasury at a premium to net asset value, with a nominal value of 2,540,000 raising net proceeds of 207,559,000 31 March 2017 53,050,000 ordinary shares raising net proceeds of 174,550,000.
At 31 March 2018 the Company had authority to issue or sell from treasury a further 121,286,948 ordinary shares.
Share Premium Account Where the sale of shares held in treasury results in proceeds in excess of the weighted average purchase price paid by the Company to repurchase the shares, the excess must be transferred to the Companys Share Premium Account.
In prior years, when shares held in treasury were subsequently sold, the proceeds of the sale were reflected in full in the Capital Reserve.
Consequently, an adjustment has been made between the Capital Reserve and the Share Premium Account and the prior year disclosures have been restated accordingly.
The effect of this adjustment as at 1 April 2016 has been to increase Share Premium to 116,410,000 from Nil and decrease Capital Reserve to 3,197,092,000 from 3,313,502,000.
For the year ended 31 March 2017, the credit to Share Premium for the year has been increased to 100,398,000 from Nil with the in year movement on Capital Reserve decreased to 74,152,000 from 174,550,000.

19 Financial Instruments As an Investment Trust, the Company invests in listed and unlisted securities and makes other investments so as to achieve its investment objective of maximising total return, whilst also generating dividend growth, from a focused and actively managed global portfolio.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Company is exposed to various types of risk that are associated with the financial instruments and markets in which it invests.
These risks are categorised here as market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Board monitors closely the Companys exposures to these risks but does so in order to reduce the likelihood of a permanent loss of capital rather than to minimise the short term volatility.
Risk provides the potential for both losses and gains and in assessing risk, the Board encourages the Managers to exploit the opportunities that risk affords.
The risk management policies and procedures outlined in this note have not changed substantially from the previous accounting period.
Market Risk The fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument or other investment held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and the Companys Investment Managers both assess the exposure to market risk when making individual investment decisions and monitor the overall level of market risk across the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
Details of the Companys investment portfolio are shown in note 9 and on pages 21 to 24.
Currency Risk Certain of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling the Companys functional currency and that in which it reports its results.
Consequently, movements in exchange rates may affect the sterling value of those items.
The Investment Managers monitor the Companys exposure to foreign currencies and report to the Board on a regular basis.
The Investment Managers assess the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and income of a movement in the rates of exchange to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
However, the country in which a company is listed is not necessarily where it earns its profits.
The movement in exchange rates on earnings may have a more significant impact upon a companys valuation than a simple translation of the currency in which the company is quoted.
Foreign currency borrowings can limit the Companys exposure to anticipated future changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments.
58 Annual Report 2018 Financial Report 19 Financial Instruments continued Exposure to currency risk through asset allocation, which is calculated by reference to the currency in which the asset or liability is quoted, is shown below.
A 5% weakening of sterling against all currencies, with all other variables held constant, would have had an equal but opposite effect on the Financial Statement amounts.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2017.
2018 2017 000 000 US dollar 201,461 150,919 Euro 66,770 52,800 Hong Kong dollar 25,049 15,437 Swedish krona 16,855 12,442 Indian rupee 4,244 3,927 Danish krone 2,355 Brazilian real 1,391 Indonesian rupiah 883 314,379 240,154 Interest Rate Risk Interest rate movements may affect directly: the fair value of the investments in fixed interest rate securities: the level of income receivable on cash deposits: the fair value of the Companys fixed-rate borrowings: and the interest payable on the Companys variable rate borrowings.
Interest rate movements may also impact upon the market value of the Companys investments outwith fixed income securities.
The effect of interest rate movements upon the earnings of a company may have a significant impact upon the valuation of that companys equity.
The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment decisions and when entering borrowing agreements.
The Board reviews on a regular basis the amount of investments in cash and fixed income securities and the income receivable on cash deposits, floating rate notes and other similar investments.
The Company finances part of its activities through borrowings at approved levels.
The amount of such borrowings and the approved levels are monitored and reviewed regularly by the Board.
Movements in interest rates, to the extent that they affect the market value of the Companys fixed rate borrowings, may also affect the amount by which the Companys share price is at a discount or a premium to the net asset value at fair value.
60 Annual Report 2018 Financial Report 19 Financial Instruments continued Interest Rate Risk continued The interest rate risk profile of the Companys financial assets and liabilities at 31 March is shown below: Financial Assets 2018 2018 2017 2017 2018 Weighted Weighted 2017 Weighted Weighted Fair value average average period Fair value average average period 000 interest rate until maturity 000 interest rate until maturity Floating rate: Brazilian bonds index linked 27,277 9.7% 28 years Cash and short term deposits: Other overseas currencies 29,784 n a 67,547 n a Sterling 5,190 0.3% n a 9,096 0.1% n a Based on expected maturity date.
The cash deposits generally comprise call or short term money market deposits of less than one month which are repayable on demand.
The benchmark rate which determines the interest payments received on cash balances is the Interbank market rates.
Financial Liabilities The interest rate risk profile of the Companys bank loans, debentures and loan notes at amortised cost and the maturity profile of the undiscounted future cash flows in respect of the Companys contractual financial liabilities at 31 March are shown below.
Interest Rate Risk Profile The interest rate risk profile of the Companys financial liabilities at 31 March was: 2018 2017 000 000 Floating rate US$ denominated 231,679 291,883 Fixed rate Sterling denominated 254,036 149,710 US$ denominated 67,973 485,715 509,566 Maturity Profile The maturity profile of the Companys financial liabilities at 31 March was: 2018 2018 2018 2017 2017 2017 Within Between 1 More than Within Between 1 More than 1 year and 5 years 5 years 1 year and 5 years 5 years 000 000 000 000 000 000 Repayment of loans, debentures and loan notes 231,679 95,000 155,675 359,856 20,000 125,675 Accumulated interest on loans, debentures and loan notes to maturity date 18,799 62,141 91,284 18,060 52,487 33,022 250,478 157,141 246,959 377,916 72,487 158,697 Includes 675,000 irredeemable debenture stock.
Interest Rate Risk Sensitivity An increase of 100 basis points in bond yields as at 31 March 2018 would have decreased net assets and net return after taxation by nil 2017 3,729,000 and would have increased the net asset value per share with borrowings at fair value by 2.69p 2017 increased by 0.55p.
A decrease of 100 basis points would have had an equal but opposite effect.
Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust PLC 61 Financial Report 19 Financial Instruments continued Other Price Risk Changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may also affect the value of the Companys net assets.
The Board manages the market price risks inherent in the investment portfolio by ensuring full and timely access to relevant information from the Investment Managers.
The Board meets regularly and at each meeting reviews investment performance, the investment portfolio and the rationale for the current investment positioning to ensure consistency with the Companys objectives and investment policies.
The portfolio does not seek to reproduce the index, investments are selected based upon the merit of individual companies and therefore performance may well diverge from the short term fluctuations of the benchmark.
The Board provides guidance to the Managers on the level of unlisted investments.
Other Price Risk Sensitivity Fixed asset investments are valued at bid prices which equate to their fair value.
A full list of the Companys investments is given on pages 21 to 24.
In addition, a geographical analysis of the portfolio, an analysis of the investment portfolio by broad industrial sector and a list of the 30 largest investments by their aggregate market value are contained in the Strategic Report.
91.2% 2017 93.8% of the Companys net assets are invested in quoted equities.
A 3% increase in quoted companies equity valuations at 31 March 2018 would have increased net assets and net return after taxation by 169,276,000 2017 137,125,000.
A decrease of 3% would have had an equal but opposite effect.
16.2% 2017 14.4% of the Companys net assets are invested in unlisted securities.
The fair valuation of the unlisted investments is influenced by the estimates, assumptions and judgements made in the fair valuation process see 1 b on page 48.
A sensitivity analysis is provided below which recognises that the valuation methodologies employed involve different levels of subjectivity in their inputs.
The sensitivity analysis below applies a wider range of input variable sensitivity to the multiples methodology as it involves more significant subjective estimation than the recent transaction method the risk of over or under estimation is higher due to the greater subjectivity involved, for example, in selecting the most relevant measure of sustainable revenues and identifying appropriate comparable companies.

Unlisted fund investments held at net asset values produced by the relevant fund administrators using appropriate fair valuation principles.
Liquidity Risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Liquidity risk is potentially significant but the majority of the Companys assets are investments in quoted securities that are believed to be readily realisable.
The Board provides guidance to the Investment Managers as to the maximum exposure to any one holding and to the maximum aggregate exposure to substantial holdings.
The Company has the power to take out borrowings, which give it access to additional funding when required.
62 Annual Report 2018 Financial Report 19 Financial Instruments continued Credit Risk This is the risk that a failure of a counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Company suffering a loss.
This risk is managed as follows: where the Investment Managers make an investment in a bond or other security with credit risk, that credit risk is assessed and then compared to the prospective investment return of the security in question: the Board regularly receives information from the Investment Managers on the credit ratings of those bonds and other securities in which the Company has invested: the Depositary is liable for the loss of financial instruments held in custody.
The Depositary will ensure that any delegate segregates the assets of the Company.
For the period up to the date of these Financial Statements, the Depository delegated the custody function to The Bank of New York Mellon SA NV.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of the custodian may cause the Companys rights with respect to securities held by the custodian to be delayed.
The Investment Manager monitors the Companys risk by reviewing the custodians internal control reports and reporting its findings to the Board: investment transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers whose creditworthiness is reviewed by the Investment Managers.
Transactions are ordinarily undertaken on a delivery versus payment basis whereby the Companys custodian bank ensures that the counterparty to any transaction entered into by the Company has delivered on its obligations at the same time as any transfer of cash or securities away from the Company is completed: transactions involving derivatives, and other arrangements wherein the creditworthiness of the entity acting as broker or counterparty to the transaction is likely to be of sustained interest, are subject to rigorous assessment by the Investment Managers of the creditworthiness of that counterparty.
The Companys aggregate exposure to each such counterparty is monitored regularly by the Board: and cash is held only at banks that are regularly reviewed by the Managers.
The Company owns a number of unquoted preference share securities.
Some of these may have been classified as debt by the issuer.
There are no material amounts past due in relation to these securities.
As these instruments alongside the ordinary share securities have been recognised at fair value through profit and loss, the fair value takes into account credit, market and other price risk.
Credit Risk Exposure The maximum exposure to direct credit risk at 31 March was: 2018 2017 000 000 Fixed interest investments 27,277 Cash and short term deposits 34,974 76,643 Debtors and prepayments 2,764 16,293 37,738 120,213 None of the Companys financial assets is past due or impaired.
Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust PLC 63 Financial Report 19 Financial Instruments continued Fair Value of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities The Directors are of the opinion that the financial assets and liabilities of the Company are stated at fair value in the Balance Sheet with the exception of long term borrowing.
Long term borrowings in relation to debentures are included in the accounts at the amortised amount of net proceeds after issue, plus accrued finance costs in accordance with FRS 102.
The fair value of bank loans is calculated with reference to government bonds of comparable maturity and yield.
Deducting long term borrowings at fair value would have the effect of reducing the net asset value per share from 443.5p to 439.9p.
Taking the market price of the ordinary shares at 31 March 2018 of 442.2p, this would have given a premium to net asset value of 0.5% as against a discount of 0.3% on a debt at book basis.
At 31 March 2017 the effect would have been to reduce the net asset value from 358.7p to 354.6p.
Taking the market price of the ordinary shares at 31 March 2017 of 366.1p, this would have given a premium to net asset value of 3.2% as against a premium of 2.1% on a debt at book basis.
Deducting long term borrowings at par value would have the effect of increasing the net asset value per share from 443.5p to 443.7p.
Taking the market price of the ordinary shares at 31 March 2018 of 442.2p, this would have given a discount to net asset value of 0.3% as against a discount of 0.3% on a debt at book basis.
At 31 March 2017 the effect would have been to increase the net asset value from 358.7p to 359.0p.
Taking the market price of the ordinary shares at 31 March 2017 of 366.1p, this would have given a premium to net asset value of 2.0% as against a premium of 2.1% on a debt at book basis.
