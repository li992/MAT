Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 32 Financial risk management The group has identified the financial, business and operational risks arising from its activities and has established policies and procedures to manage these items in accordance with its risk appetite, as described in the group risk committee report on pages 66 to 68.
The group categorises its financial risks into the following primary areas: i credit risk which includes counterparty default risk : ii liquidity risk: iii market risk which includes fair value interest rate risk, cash flow interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and price risk : and iv pension risk.
The group's exposures to pension risk are set out in note 28.
The groups financial risk management policies are designed to identify and analyse the financial risks that the group faces, to set appropriate risk tolerances, limits and controls and to monitor the financial risks and adherence to limits by means of reliable and up-to-date information systems.
The group regularly reviews its financial risk management policies and systems to reflect changes in the business, counterparties, markets and the range of financial instruments that it utilises.
The treasury department, reporting through the banking committee, has principal responsibility for monitoring exposure to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk.
Procedures and delegated authorities are documented in a group treasury manual and policy documents prescribe the management and monitoring of each type of risk.
The primary objective of the groups treasury policy is to manage short term liquidity requirements whilst maintaining an appropriate level of exposure to other financial risks in accordance with the groups risk appetite.
i Credit risk The group takes on exposure to credit risk, which is the risk that a counterparty will be unable to pay amounts in full when due, through its banking, treasury, trust and financial planning activities.
The principal source of credit risk arises from placing funds in the money market and holding interest-bearing securities.
The group also has exposure to credit risk through its client loan book and guarantees given on clients behalf.
It is the groups policy to place funds generated internally and from deposits by clients with a range of high-quality financial institutions and the Bank of England.
Investments with financial institutions are spread to avoid excessive exposure to any individual counterparty.
Loans made to clients are secured against clients assets that are held and managed by group companies.
Exposure to credit risk is managed through setting appropriate ratings requirements and lending limits.
Limits are reviewed regularly, taking into account the ability of borrowers and potential borrowers to meet repayment obligations.
The group categorises its exposures based on the long term ratings awarded to counterparties by Fitch or Moodys.
Each exposure is assessed individually, both at inception and in ongoing monitoring.
In addition to formal external ratings, the banking committee also utilises market intelligence information to assist its ongoing monitoring.
The group's financial assets are categorised as follows: Balances with central banks note 15 The group has exposure to central banks through its deposits held with the Bank of England.
Loans and advances to banks note 16 and debt and other securities note 18 The group has exposures to a wide range of financial institutions through its treasury portfolio, which includes bank deposits, certificates of deposit, money market funds and treasury bills.
These exposures principally arise from the placement of clients' cash, where it is held under a banking relationship, and the groups own reserves.
Balances with central banks, loans and advances to banks and debt and other securities excluding equity securities are collectively referred to as the groups treasury book.

The primary objective of the groups treasury policy is to manage short to medium term liquidity requirements.
In addition to setting the treasury policy, Rathbone Investment Management 'the Bank' performs an annual assessment of liquidity adequacy in accordance with the regulatory requirements of the Prudential Regulation Authority PRA our Individual Liquidity Adequacy Assessment.
The Bank faces two principal risks, namely that a significant proportion of client funds are withdrawn over a short period of time retail funding risk and the risk that marketable assets may not be capable of being realised in the time and at the value required marketable assets risk.
Retail funding risks are monitored by daily cash mismatch analyses and Basel Committee ratios using expected cash and asset maturity profiles and regular forecasting work.
This is supported by stress tests which cover firm-specific idiosyncratic scenarios and or the effects of unforeseen market wide stresses.
Marketable assets risk is primarily managed by holding cash and marketable instruments which are realisable at short notice.
The group operates strict criteria to ensure that investments are liquid and placed with high-quality counterparties.
A minimum liquid assets buffer to be held in eligible liquid assets is set by the board at least annually in conjunction with an amount prescribed by the PRA.
