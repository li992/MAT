RESULTS FOR THE YEAR CONTINUED 5 Earnings per share This note shows how earnings per share EPS is calculated.
EPS is the amount of post-tax profit attributable to each ordinary share.
Diluted EPS shows what the impact would be if all potentially dilutive ordinary shares in respect of exercisable share options were exercised and treated as ordinary shares at the year end.
This note also provides a reconciliation between the statutory profit figure, which ties to the consolidated income statement, and the Groups internal measure of performance, underlying profit.
See note 3.6 for details of the adjustments made between statutory and underlying profit, and note 4 for the tax impact on these adjustments.
Accounting policy Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to owners of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held as treasury shares, which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares, exercisable at the end of the year.
The Group has one class of dilutive potential ordinary shares.
They are share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.
