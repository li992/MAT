70 P Z Cussons Plc Governance and Financial Statements 2018 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 7.
Taxation continued UK corporation tax is calculated at 19.00% 2017: 19.83% of the estimated assessable profit for the year.
Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
The Group has chosen to use a weighted average tax rate rather than the UK rate for the reconciliation of the charge for the year to the profit before taxation per the Consolidated Income Statement.
The Group operates in a number of overseas jurisdictions that have tax rates in excess of the UK rate.
As such, a weighted average tax rate is believed to provide more meaningful information to users of the Financial Statements.
The approximate tax rate for this comparison is 23.05% 2017 restated: 25.11%.
Restated 2018 2017 m m Profit before tax 66.6 86.5 Tax at the weighted average tax rate of 23.05% 2017 restated: 25.11% 15.4 21.7 Adjusted for: Tax effect of expenses revenue that are not deductible taxable 4.2 4.2 Effect of UK rate change on deferred taxation 0.6 3.3 Tax effect of share of results of joint ventures 0.5 0.9 Overseas withholding tax suffered on dividends 1.8 0.3 Adjustment to amount carried in respect of unresolved tax matters 5.7 2.3 Movement in deferred tax assets not recognised Note 22 0.8 Research and development relief 0.2 0.8 Adjustments in respect of prior periods 2.1 Tax charge for the year 17.8 21.4 See Note 1 for further details.
The weighted average tax rate based on where the Group has made profits and the tax rates applicable in those countries has reduced when compared to the prior year.
This reduction is primarily driven by the reduced profitability in our Africa region where tax rates are high.
The main movements in the tax reconciliation from the tax at the weighted average rate and the actual tax charge for the year are explained as follows: Of the 4.2m non-taxable items the key component is 2.4m relating to the disposal of assets in Australia, for which the tax base cost and accounting cost differed resulting in an accounting gain with no associated tax cost.
This is due to the sale of anAustralian brand that gave rise to a taxable loss offsetting the taxable gain arising on the sale of the Dandenong site.
Changes to the UK corporation tax rates were announced on 8 July 2015.
These changes were substantively enacted as part ofFinance Bill 2015 on 26 October 2015.
These include reductions to the main rate to reduce the rate to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to 18% from 1 April 2020.
A further change to reduce the UK rate from 1 April 2020 from 18% to 17% was announced on 16March 2016.
This change was substantively enacted as part of Finance Bill 2016 on 15 September 2016.
The tax impact during the year ended 31 May 2018 was an increase of 0.6m.
During the year ended 31 May 2018, a number of dividends were paid by PZ Cussons overseas entities.
Under UK tax law any local withholding taxes are an irrecoverable cost.
The impact of the local withholding taxes was 1.8m.
PZ Cussons is subject to taxation in all of the countries in which it operates.
The tax legislation applicable in these countries is often complex and subject to interpretation both by management and government authorities.
These judgemental interpretations give rise to quantifiable risks that are provided for on the Balance Sheet.
This adjustment increases the tax charge by 5.7m.
Due to increased taxable profits in the year, together with expected future taxable profits in Poland, previously unrecognised deferred tax assets of 0.6m have now been recognised on the Groups Balance Sheet.
Additionally, previously unrecognised deferred tax assets of 0.2m have been utilised in the year.
The resulting Income Statement tax charge for the year represents a post-exceptional effective tax rate of 26.73% 2017 restated: 24.74%.
