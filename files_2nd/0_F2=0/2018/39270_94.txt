Pension commitments At 31 December 2018 the RIPS pension asset amounted to 20.5m 2017: 325.4m.
As there is no contractual agreement or stated policy for charging the net defined benefit cost of RIPS to participating entities, the net defined benefit cost is recognised fully by the Company.
On 4 December 2018 the Group signed an agreement with Pension Insurance Corporation plc PIC to take over the payment of the liabilities in the scheme via a buy-in, which is anticipated to convert to a full buy-out before the end of 2020.
For more information on pension commitments and the pension settlement, see Note A10 of the consolidated financial statements.
