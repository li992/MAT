reserves 174Mt at a grade of 1.1g t in open pit reserves 4.4Mt at a grade of 5.6g t in underground reserves DEVELOPMENT KEY FACTS Cleopatra Exploration and 2,560m of development decline completed Development Decline Cleo 20,000m of exploration drilling completed 1.2Mt at 4g t mineral resource Decline, Sukari Gold Mine 2019 exploration budget US$15 million: 10,000m drilling and 2,000m decline development Located at the north of the Sukari porphyry, the Cleo Decline has been engineered to 1Mtpa material movement capacity.
This decline provides exploration access into the Cleopatra zones, as another potential source of high-grade ore to the existing plant and to provide alternative access to the high-grade deeper levels of Ptah.
ADVANCED EXPLORATION KEY FACTS Doropo Project, Cte dIvoire 2.13Moz indicated mineral resource with significant resource upside potential Located on the northeast of Cte dIvoire, active 2 2,721km licence holding exploration commenced at Doropo in late 2014.
Mining: current resource suitable for open pit Exploration has delivered year-on-year resource expansion, while improving the geological blueprint Processing: undergoing viability studies for heap across this highly prospective land package.
leach initially to fund CIL plant development Economic feasibility study currently underway EXPLORATION KEY FACTS Batie West Project, 2 Total 1,100km licence holding: including 2 Burkina Faso exploitation permit over 64km 1.35Moz Indicated mineral resource Located in the southeast of Burkina Faso Scoping study underway KEY FACTS ABC Project, Cte dIvoire 650koz indicated maiden mineral resource delineated in 18 months of active exploration A new greenfield discovery in 2017, ABC is located along Significant resource upside within resource area the underexplored Archean-Birimian Contact zone and along the LGC mineralised signature ABC, lending the acronym to its namesake.
