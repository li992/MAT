Strategic report Governance Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2018 1.
Basis of preparation and accounting policies Basis of preparation These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee, as adopted by the EU, and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
Ascential plc the Company is a public company, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and incorporated in the United Kingdom.
The registered office is located at The Prow, 1 Wilder Walk, London W1B 5AP.
The nature of the Companys operations are business-to-business information services which provide industry-specific business intelligence, insights and forecasting through data and digital subscription tools.
The principle activities are information services for product design, marketing, sales and built environment & policy.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling GBP, which is the Companys functional currency, and have been rounded to the nearest one decimal place except where otherwise indicated.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis see page 29 and under the historical cost convention, with the exception of items that are required by IFRS to be measured at fair value, principally certain financial instruments.
The Boards assessment of prospects and stress test scenarios, together with its review of principal risks and the effectiveness of risk management procedures, show that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The Directors have assessed the Groups prospects and viability over a three-year period and the viability statement can be found on page 36.
Accordingly, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis for the preparation of the financial statements.
In forming their view, the Directors have considered the Groups prospects for a period exceeding 12 months from the date when the financial statements are approved.
Accounting policies The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and have been applied consistently to both periods presented, with new standards applied in the year for IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the parent Company, its subsidiaries and share of the results of its associates and joint ventures drawn up to 31 December 2018 using consistent accounting policies throughout the current and preceding years.
The trading results of business operations are included in profit from continuing operations from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
Intra-group balances and transactions are eliminated in full on consolidation.
Foreign currency translation The functional currency of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures is the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the presentational currency of the Group and the functional currency of the parent Company.
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rate ruling at the date of transaction.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All differences are taken to the consolidated income statement except for those on foreign currency borrowings that provide a hedge against an investment in a foreign entity.
These are taken directly to equity until the disposal of the investment, at which time they are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate in force at the date of the initial transaction.
As at the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries are translated into pounds Sterling at the rate of exchange applicable at the reporting date and their consolidated income statements are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
The exchange differences arising from the retranslation of foreign operations are taken directly to a separate component of equity.
On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that operation is recognised in the consolidated income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate at the reporting date.
Changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments entered into to hedge foreign currency net assets, and that satisfy the hedging conditions of IFRS 9, are recognised in the currency translation reserve see separate accounting policy on derivative financial instruments.
Discontinued operations The Group classifies an operation as discontinued when it has disposed of or intends to dispose of a business component that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations.
The post-tax profit or loss of the discontinued operations is shown as a single line on the face of the consolidated income statement, separate from the continuing operating results of the Group.
When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative consolidated income statement is represented as if the operation had been discontinued from the start of the comparative year.
95 Ascential plc Annual Report 2018 Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2018 1.
Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued Revenue Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer.
If multiple performance obligations exist within a contract, the revenue is allocated to the obligations based on the stand-alone selling price, with any discounts allocated evenly across the obligations.
For contracts with rebates and therefore variable consideration, revenue is recognised based on the best estimate of the revenue net of the rebated amount.
Revenue is recognised when the Group satisfies the performance obligations, the timing of which is set out in Note 3.
Pre-paid subscription and event revenues are shown as deferred income and released to the income statement in accordance with the revenue recognition criteria above.
Barter transactions are those where goods and services, rather than cash, are exchanged between two third parties and revenue is recognised at fair value for the goods or services provided.
Where goods or services are provided at a discount and dissimilar to the goods or services received, the discounted price is recorded as revenue with the corresponding amount included in operating costs.
Alternative Performance Measures The consolidated financial statements include Alternative Performance Measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, as another measure of profitability of the trading performance of the Group.
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure, defined as the Groups operating profit before expensing depreciation of tangible fixed assets and amortisation of software, exceptional items, amortisation of acquired intangible assets, impairment of tangible fixed assets and software intangibles and share-based payments.
Refer to pages 30 to 33 for further details on Alternative Performance Measures.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are those which are considered significant by virtue of their nature, size or incidence.
These items are presented as exceptional within their relevant income statement category to assist in the understanding of the performance and financial results of the Group as these types of cost do not form part of the underlying business.
Examples of items that are considered by the Directors for designation as exceptional items include, but are not limited to: Significant capital structuring costs such as for the IPO as these are material and not a reflection of the ongoing business.
Costs incurred as part of the acquisition and integration of acquired businesses as these are considered to be material.
Acquisition-related employment costs, which, absent the link to continued employment, would have been treated as consideration are designed as exceptional items.
Gains or losses on disposals of businesses are considered to be exceptional in nature as these do not reflect the performance of the Group.
Material restructuring and separation costs within a segment incurred as part of a significant change in strategy as these are not expected to be repeated on a regular basis.
If provisions have been made for exceptional items in previous years, then any reversal of these provisions is treated as exceptional.
Finance costs and income Finance costs are recognised on an effective yield basis.
Finance income is recognised on the accruals basis.
Income tax The Group is primarily subject to corporation tax in the UK, the US, Brazil and China and judgement and estimates of future profitability are required to determine the Groups deferred tax position.
If the final tax outcome is different to that assumed, resulting changes will be reflected in the consolidated income statement, unless the tax relates to an item charged to equity, in which case the changes in tax estimates on those items will be reflected in equity.
Income tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current tax and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the consolidated income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is tax payable based on taxable profits for the period, using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, along with any adjustment relating to tax payable in previous years.
Taxable profit differs from net profit in the consolidated income statement in that income or expense items that are taxable or deductible in other years are excluded, as are items that are never taxable or deductible.
Using the liability method, deferred tax is provided on temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes, except for certain temporary differences, such as goodwill that is not deductible for tax purposes.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year in which the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
The deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where they relate to the same taxing authority and the Group has a legal right to offset.
96 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 1.
Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued Business combinations In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, the fair value of consideration paid for a business combination is measured as the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of assets given and liabilities incurred or assumed in exchange for control.
The assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity are measured at fair value as at the acquisition date.
When the initial accounting for a business combination is determined, it is done so on a provisional basis with any adjustments to these provisional values made within 12 months of the acquisition date and are effective as at the acquisition date.
To the extent that deferred consideration is payable as part of the acquisition cost and is payable after one year from the acquisition date, the deferred consideration is discounted at an appropriate interest rate and, accordingly, carried at net present value in the consolidated balance sheet.
The discount component is then unwound as an interest charge in the consolidated income statement over the life of the obligation.
Where a business combination agreement provides for an adjustment to the cost of a business acquired contingent on future events, the Group accrues the fair value of the additional consideration payable as a liability at acquisition date.
This amount is reassessed at each subsequent reporting date with any adjustments recognised in the consolidated income statement.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the acquirers previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re measured at the acquisition date through the consolidated income statement.
Transaction costs are expensed to the consolidated income statement as incurred.
Acquisition related expenses include contingent consideration payments agreed as part of the acquisition and contractually linked to ongoing employment as well as business performance Acquisition-related employment costs.
Acquisition-related employment costs are accrued over the period in which the related services are received and are recorded as exceptional costs.
Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill arises where the fair value of the consideration given for a business exceeds the fair value of net identifiable assets of the business at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is allocated or grouped at the lowest levels, for which there are identifiable cash flows, known as cash generating units or CGUs.
The Group considers that a CGU is a business unit because independent cash flows cannot be identified below this level.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is capitalised and subject to impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
For goodwill impairment purposes, no CGU is larger than the reporting segments determined in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments before aggregation.
The recoverable amount of goodwill is assessed on the basis of the value-in-use estimate for CGUs to which the goodwill relates.
Where the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount the goodwill is considered impaired.
Any impairment is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Other intangibles Intangible assets other than goodwill are those that are distinct and can be sold separately or arise from legal rights.
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Intangible assets purchased separately are capitalised at cost.
The cost of intangible assets is amortised and charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Brands 130 years Customer relationships 820 years Databases 310 years Software 25 years Useful lives are examined every year and adjustments are made, where applicable, on a prospective basis.
Website development costs included under databases relating to websites which are revenue generating are capitalised and amortised over three to five years.
Development costs relating to websites which are not revenue generating are taken immediately to the consolidated income statement.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Cost comprises expenditure directly attributable to the purchase of the asset.
Assets are depreciated to their estimated residual value, on a straight-line basis, over their estimated useful life as follows: Short leasehold property over the period of the lease Office equipment 25 years Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date.
An item of property, plant or equipment is written off either on disposal or when there is no expected future economic benefit from its continued use.
Any gain or loss on derecognition of the asset calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying value of the asset is included in the consolidated income statement in the year the item is derecognised.
97 Ascential plc Annual Report 2018 Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2018 1.
Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued Investments in associates and joint ventures The Groups investments in its associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and thereafter are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at cost less any impairment in value.
The consolidated income statement reflects the Groups share of an associate or joint ventures profit after tax.
Where the Groups share of losses in an associate or joint venture exceeds its investment, the Group ceases to recognise further losses unless an obligation exists for the Group to fund the losses.
Where a change in net assets has been recognised directly in the associate or joint ventures equity, the Group recognises its share of those changes in the statement of changes in equity when applicable.
Adjustments are made to align the accounting policies of the associate or joint venture with the Groups and to eliminate the Groups share of unrealised gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures.
Trade investments Investments in equity instruments are measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost represents purchase cost, including attributable overheads, and is determined using a first-in, first-out basis.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale.
Costs relating to future exhibitions, festivals and congresses are deferred within inventories at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
These costs are charged to the consolidated income statement when the exhibition takes place.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less loss allowances.
Loss allowances are calculated for lifetime expected credit losses.
Expected credit losses are a probability weighted estimate of credit losses and are calculated on actual historical credit losses over the past three years and adjusted to reflect differences between the historical credit losses and the Groups view of the economic conditions over the expected lives of the receivables.
The amount of the loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to the consolidated income statement.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash, cash in transit, short-term deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are as defined, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Derivatives and other financial instruments Derivatives comprise interest rate swaps and caps.
Derivatives are initially recognised and subsequently measured at fair value at each reporting date.
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are classified as a separate asset or liability.
The fair value is determined by using market data and the use of established estimation techniques such as discounted cash flow and option valuation models.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged, as described below.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the consolidated income statement as they arise.
A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months.
Other derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities.
Further details of derivative financial instruments are disclosed below.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost: any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the consolidated income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method, with the exception of debt repurchases which are recognised in the consolidated income statement in the year of the repurchase.
98 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 1.
Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, when it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and when a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Where the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised only when it is virtually certain.
The expense relating to any provision is presented in the consolidated income statement net of any reimbursement.
If the time value of money has a material effect on quantifying the provision, the provision is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance charge.
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan and the restructuring either has commenced or has been announced publicly.
Future operating losses are not provided for.
Share-based payments Certain employees of the Company receive part of their remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured at fair value at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value of share awards with market-related vesting conditions is determined by an external consultant and the fair value at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Companys estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each balance sheet reporting date up to the vesting date, at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the actual outcome of awards which have vested.
No adjustment is made to the fair value after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or not exercised.
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries, it recognises an increase in the cost of investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity-settled share-based payment charge recognised in the subsidiarys financial statements with the corresponding credit being recognised directly in equity.
In cases where a subsidiary is recharged for the share-based payment expense, no such increase in investment is recognised.
Shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust The Employee Benefit Trust EBT provides for the issue of shares to Group employees under share incentive schemes.
The Company has control of the EBT and accounts for the EBT as an extension to the Company in the consolidated financial statements.
Accordingly, shares in the Company held by the EBT are included in the consolidated balance sheet at cost as a deduction from equity.
Leases Assets held by the Group under leases which transfer to the Group substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
On initial recognition, the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset.
Assets held under other leases are classified as operating leases and are not recognised in the Groups consolidated balance sheet.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The benefit of any lease incentives is recognised as a reduction in rental expense on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Accounting developments and changes IFRS 15 and IFRS 9 have been applied from 1 January 2018 as described below.
IFRS 16 has been issued and will be effective from 1 January 2019.
The impact of IFRS 16 is described below.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 is based on the principle that revenue is recognised when control of goods or services is transferred to the customer and provides a single, principle-based, five-step model to be applied to all sales contracts.
It replaces the separate models for goods, services and construction contracts under current IFRS.
It also provides further guidance on the measurement of sales on contracts which have discounts and rebates.
The Group has adopted IFRS 15 using the retrospective method with practical expedients, meaning the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard is recognised as a restatement at the start of the earliest presented period, i. e. the opening comparative balance sheet at 1 January 2017.
The practical expedient applied is that the new standard has only been applied to those contracts that are not considered completed at 1 January 2017.
IFRS 15 has had no material impact on continuing operations, but an adjustment has been made to discontinued operations.
The result of our assessment on discontinued operations is a less than 0.2% impact on revenue and a less than 0.1% impact on retained earnings and therefore we have not restated the primary statements for these effects as the impact is not deemed material.
For discontinued operations, the restatement resulted in a reduction to revenue and cost of sales of 0.9m for the year ended 31 December 2017, with no impact on profit before tax in either period.
99 Ascential plc Annual Report 2018 Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2018 1.
Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Endorsed by the EU effective 1 January 2018 IFRS 9 applies a forward-looking impairment model that replaces the current applicable incurred loss model.
In contrast to the complex and rules-based approach of IAS 39, the new hedge accounting requirements provide an improved link to risk management and treasury operations and will be simpler to apply.
The adoption of IFRS 9 did not have a material impact on the Groups consolidated results or financial position and does not require a restatement of comparative figures.
The fair value of each category of the Groups financial instruments approximates to their carrying value.
Where financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair values the measurement hierarchy, valuation techniques and inputs used are consistent with those used at 31 December 2017.
There were no movements between different levels of the fair value hierarchy in the year.
IFRS 16 Leases Endorsed by the EU effective 1 January 2019 IFRS 16 is effective from 1 January 2019 and will be adopted from that date.
It replaces all existing lease guidance and introduces a single on-balance sheet model for lessee accounting whereby a lessee recognises a right-of-use of asset and a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments.
The standard excludes leases of low-value assets and short-term leases.
Lessor accounting remains similar to the current IAS 17 guidance.
These changes will be restated in the financial statements for 2019 with the actual impact of adopting the new standard at 1 January 2019 differing as the new accounting policies are subject to change until the Group presents its first financial statements that include the date of initial application.
The Group has advanced its assessment of the potential impact on the consolidated financial statements resulting from the application of IFRS 16 and expects the impact not to be significant on profit before tax.
The impact of IFRS 16 for the year ended 31 December 2018 will be finalised and presented as a restatement along with the results for the half year ending 30 June 2019.
The current level of operating leases held by the Group is disclosed in Note 29.
Critical accounting judgements and estimates The preparation of these financial statements requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Groups accounting policies.
It also requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
The actual future outcomes may differ from these estimates and give rise to material adjustments to the reported results and financial position of the Group.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, with revisions recognised in the year in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity and assumptions or estimation are set out below and in more detail in the related notes.
Critical accounting judgements Alternative Performance Measures Note 5 The Group uses alternative performance measures which are not defined or specified under IFRS and comprises adjusting items.
Adjusting items include amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles, share-based payments and exceptional items.
The classification of exceptional items requires significant management judgement to determine the nature and presentation of such transactions.
Exceptional items are those which are considered significant by virtue of their nature, size or incidence.
These items are presented as a separate column on the face of the income statement but within their relevant income statement caption.
The Board views this as a relevant analysis to assist the reader in their understanding of the underlying performance and financial results of the Group.
Note 5 provides an analysis of exceptional items.
Key sources of estimation Business combinations Initial recognition of goodwill and intangible assets Note 12 Accounting for a business acquisition requires an assessment of the existence, fair value and expected useful economic lives of separable intangible assets such as brands, customer relationships and technology assets at the date of acquisition.
The fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed on acquisition is based on a number of estimates, including estimates of future performance of related businesses, as is determining the expected useful economic life of assets acquired.
The value attributed to these separable assets affects the amount of goodwill recognised and the value, together with the assessment of useful economic lives, determines future amortisation charges.
Acquired brands are valued using the relief-from-royalty method which requires estimation of future revenues and estimation of a royalty rate that an acquirer would pay in an arms length licensing arrangement to secure access to the same rights.
The theoretical royalty payments are discounted to obtain the cash flows to determine the asset value, which also requires estimation of an appropriate discount rate.
A TAB Tax amortisation benefit is then applied.
100 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 2.
Critical accounting judgements and estimates continued Acquired customer relationships are valued using the multi-period excess earnings method MEEM approach which starts with the total expected income streams for a business or group of assets as a whole and then deducts charges for all the other assets used to generate income.
Residual income streams are discounted and a TAB is applied.
The method requires estimation of future forecasts of the business and an appropriate discount rate.
Content and technology assets are valued using a depreciation replacement cost method, which requires an estimate of all the costs a typical market participant would incur to generate an exact replica of the intangibles asset in the context of the acquired business.
The depreciated replacement cost method takes into account factors including economic and technological obsolescence.
In establishing the fair value and useful economic lives, the Group considers, for each acquisition and each asset or liability, the complexity of the calculations, the sources of estimation uncertainty and the risk of such estimations resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
Details of those estimations that have a significant risk and the at-risk assets liabilities are disclosed as appropriate in Notes 12 and 32: the significance of the risk will depend on the size of the acquisition.
Such sources of estimation uncertainty include estimation of future cash flows, the determined weighted average cost of capital and estimated useful lives.
Valuation of contingent consideration and acquisition-related employment costs Note 22 Where a business combination agreement provides for an adjustment to the cost, contingent on future performance over the contractual earnout period, the Group accrues the fair value, based on the estimated additional consideration payable as a liability at acquisition date.
To the extent that deferred contingent consideration is payable as part of the acquisition cost and is payable after one year from the acquisition date, the deferred consideration is discounted at an appropriate discount rate and accordingly carried at net present value in the consolidated balance sheet.
The liability is measured against the contractually agreed performance targets at each subsequent reporting date with any adjustments recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Acquisition-related employment costs are contingent on future performance of the acquired business and linked to continued employment of the founders over the contractual agreed period.
They are treated as an expense and recognised as such in the consolidated income statement.
The estimation of the likely liability requires the Group to make judgements concerning the future performance of related business over the deferred contingent consideration period or the period of employment.
Taxation Note 17 Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that their utilisation is probable.
The utilisation of deferred tax assets will depend on the judgement whether it is more likely than not that the Group will generate sufficient and suitable taxable income of the correct type and jurisdiction in the future, taking into account any restrictions on the length of the loss-carry forward period.
Various factors are used to assess the probability of the future utilisation of deferred tax assets, including past operating results, operational plans and loss-carry forward periods.
In particular, utilisation of our US tax losses is subject to a limitation triggered by change of control rules in the US and this limitation is driven by the valuation of the US business at the point of change in control.
This is a key judgement area which remains uncertain until it is agreed with the tax authorities.
Operating segments Following the sale of the Exhibitions business in July 2018, the Group changed from two to four reportable segments as the information presented to the Board Chief Operating Decision Maker on a monthly basis changed.
End market risk and opportunities vary and capital allocation decisions are made on the basis of four reportable segments.
The four reportable segments are Product Design, Marketing, Sales and Built Environment & Policy.
The reportable segments offer different products and services, and are managed separately as a result of different capabilities, technology, marketing strategies and end market risk and opportunities.
The following summary describes the operations in each of the Groups reportable segments: Product Design: global trend forecasting and insight WGSN Marketing: global creative benchmark, effectiveness measurement and strategic advisory Cannes Lions, WARC, MediaLink Sales: global ecommerce data, analytics and managed services, FinTech and retail intelligence Edge, Flywheel Digital, Money20 20, RWRC Built Environment & Policy: political, construction and environment intelligence brands Groundsure, Glenigan, DeHavilland Discontinued operations: In 2018 with 2017 profit or loss comparatives restated : the Exhibitions business which was previously part of the Exhibitions & Festivals segment and which was identified as a separate cash generating unit following the announcement of its strategic review in February 2018.
The Exhibitions business was sold on 17 July 2018 see Note 10.
In 2017: the 13 Heritage brands which were all sold in 2017.
Information regarding the results of each reportable segment is included below and restated for prior periods to enhance comparability.
Reportable segment profits are measured at an adjusted operating profit level, representing reportable segment Adjusted EBITDA, less depreciation costs and amortisation in respect of software intangibles, without allocation of Corporate costs as reported in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the Board.
Reportable segment Adjusted EBITDA and reportable segment Adjusted operating profit are used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of the reportable segments relative to other comparable entities.
Total assets and liabilities for each reportable segment are not disclosed because they are not provided to the Board on a regular basis.
Total assets and liabilities are internally reviewed on a Group basis.

For shares awards and options outstanding at 31 December 2018, the weighted average remaining contractual life was 1.35 years 2017: 1.81 years.
Measurement of fair values The SIP, PSP, Sharesave and DABP are equity-settled plans, the fair value of which is determined at the date of grant and is not subsequently remeasured unless conditions on which the award was granted are modified.
The fair values of the SIP and Sharesave awards have been measured using the Black-Scholes model, while the PSP and DABP have been measured using Monte Carlo simulations.
Non-market performance conditions were not taken into account in measuring fair values.
Expected volatility is usually calculated over the period of time commensurate with the remainder of the performance period immediately prior to the date of the grant.
The principal assumptions required by these methodologies for 2018 awards were: Sharesave SIP PSP Sharesave US Expected life 3 years 3 years 3 years 2 years Risk-free interest rate n a 0.85% 0.57% 0.47% Expected volatility n a 26.25% 26.8% 19.10% Expected dividend yield 0% 1.41% 1.93% 1.93% 106 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 7.

The Groups effective tax rate is higher than the UKs statutory tax rate, mainly due to its mix of profits with increased profits coming from the US.
The impact of rate changes in the prior year arose from the enactment of US tax reform on 22 December 2017 and the continuing reduction of the UK tax rate.
The tax rate change included 17.2 million in respect of the US and 0.4 million for the UK.
The Group is subject to many different forms of taxation including, but not limited to, income and corporation tax, withholding tax and value added and sales taxes.
The Group has operations in 15 countries and multiple states in the US and sells its products and services into more than 100 countries.
Furthermore, the Group renders and receives cross-border supplies and services in respect of affiliated entities which exposes the Group to tax risk due to transfer pricing rules that apply in many jurisdictions.
108 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 9.
Taxation continued Tax law and administration is complex and often requires subjective determinations.
In addition, tax audits by their nature, can take a significant period of time to be agreed with the tax authorities.
Therefore, management is required to apply judgement to determine the level of provisions required in respect of its tax liabilities.
The Directors estimates of the level of risk arising from tax audit may change in the next year as a result of changes in legislation or tax authority practice or correspondence with tax authorities during specific tax audits.
It is not possible to quantify the impact that such future developments may have on the Groups tax positions.
Actual outcomes and settlements may differ from the estimates recorded in these consolidated financial statements.
The Group currently anticipates that the outcome of these uncertainties will only be resolved after more than one year.
However, even where uncertainties may not be resolved within one year, material adjustments may arise as a result of a reappraisal of the assets or liabilities within the next year.

Disposal of business operations On 17th July 2018 the Group disposed of the Exhibitions business.
The Group recognised a total gain on disposal of 180.6 million presented as an exceptional item within discontinued operations.
Exceptional items in discontinued operations note 10 of 176.5 million includes the gain on disposal of the Exhibitions business of 180.6 million offset by 3.6 million of separation expenses related the Exhibitions disposal, 0.3 million revaluation of contingent consideration on discontinued operations and 0.2 million of other items related to the disposal of Heritage Brands in the prior year.

In line with IAS 36, the Group determined that the most appropriate allocation method was the relative valuation of each business.
For the Exhibitions business this was the consideration received of 297.8 million and for Cannes Lions the most recent value-in-use calculation for the annual impairment review was used and an external valuation specialist reviewed the assumptions used in the value-in-use calculation.
The net inflow outflow of cash in respect of the disposal of businesses is as follows: m 2018 Cash proceeds received for current year disposals net of cash disposed of 296.4 Disposal costs paid 6.4 Net cash inflow 290.0 113 Ascential plc Annual Report 2018 Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2018 14.
As a result of the rebranding of Edge, the Group reduced the useful lives of acquired Intangibles within Edge to three years resulting in an amortisation charge of 1.5 million.
Included within software intangible assets at 31 December 2018 is 7.9 million 2017: 3.3 million of assets under construction which were not being amortised at 31 December 2018.
No individual brands, customer relationships or databases are considered to be individually material.
Goodwill As a result of the new operating model and change to reportable segments, the CGUs have been reassessed based on largely independently managed cash flows.
The intangibles of each CGUs are assessed individually for impairment each year and more frequently if there are indicators of impairment.

When testing for impairment, recoverable amounts for all of the Groups CGUs are measured at their value-in-use by discounting the future expected cash flows from the assets in the CGUs.
These calculations use cash flow projections based on Board-approved budgets and plans.
The key assumptions and estimates used for value-in-use calculations are as follows: Future expected cash flows Cash flow forecasts for years one to three are derived from the most recent Board approved three-year plan, which has been prepared after considering the current economic environment in each of our markets.
Cash flows beyond the plan period are extrapolated using a 2% 2017: 1% long-term growth rate, which is also applied for the terminal value, in line with the IMF World Economic Outlook published in October 2018 and Duff & Phelps Valuation Handbook 2018, which represents the Companys best estimate of cash flow growth beyond the three-year plan.
The estimates of future cash flows are consistent with experience adjusted for the Groups estimate of future performance.
WACC The other inputs include a risk-adjusted, pre-tax discount rate, calculated by reference to the weighted average cost of capital WACC of each country, or countries, the CGU operates in or a weighted average if the CGU operates in more than one country.
Movement year on year in the pre-tax discount rate for CGUs is due to changes in market-based inputs and the Company specific risk, which is assessed based on economic outlooks.
The discount rates applied to the risk-adjusted cash flow forecasts, are set out below.

Intangible assets and goodwill continued The Group has performed a sensitivity analysis across all CGUs which have goodwill and acquired intangible assets using reasonable possible changes in the already conservative future growth rates and increases in the pre-tax discount factors keeping all other assumptions constant.
The sensitivity testing identified no reasonable changes in key assumptions that would cause the carrying amount of any CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.

No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures as the Group is in a position to control the timing of their reversal and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The prior year movement includes the impact of the US tax rate change from 35% to 21% with effect for periods beginning after 31 December 2017.
This resulted in a revaluation of US deferred tax assets and liabilities and an overall reduction of 16.6 million in the prior year.
For the current year, the US deferred tax assets and liabilities remained valued using the Federal rate of 21% and where applicable the effective State tax rate of 5%.
117 Ascential plc Annual Report 2018 Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2018 17.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities continued US deductible intangible assets represents the value of deferred tax assets on US tax deductible intangibles and deferred consideration.
These deferred tax assets are recognised at a blended US Federal and State tax rate of 26%.
Non-deductible intangibles represent the value of the deferred tax liability which arises on the fair value of acquired intangibles which are not deductible for tax purposes.
The liability is valued at the tax rate applicable to the jurisdiction where the intangibles are located.
Deferred tax assets have been recognised on the basis that sufficient taxable profits are forecast to be available in the future to enable them to be utilised.
At 31 December 2018, the Group has the following tax losses: Recognised Recognised Unrecognised Unrecognised Total Total m 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 US net operating losses 71.3 66.0 127.0 127.1 198.3 193.1 UK non-trading losses 36.3 54.1 36.3 54.1 Irish trading losses 18.3 16.4 18.3 16.4 UK capital losses 114.9 115.1 114.9 115.1 Other Rest of World losses 3.9 3.9 Total 107.6 120.1 264.1 258.6 371.7 378.7 The above losses represent the following value at tax rates applicable at the balance sheet date: Recognised Recognised Unrecognised Unrecognised Total Total m 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 US net operating losses 15.0 13.8 26.7 26.7 41.7 40.5 UK non-trading losses 6.4 9.7 6.4 9.7 Irish trading losses 2.3 2.1 2.3 2.1 19.6 19.6 UK capital losses 19.5 19.5 Other Rest of World losses 1.1 1.1 Total 21.4 23.5 49.6 48.4 71.0 71.9 The Group has tax losses in the US totalling 198.3 million carried forward at 31 December 2018 2017: 193.1 million.
It has been agreed with the US tax authorities that these losses are available to offset against taxable profits subject to a restriction following the change of ownership that was deemed to have occurred upon the listing of Ascential plc in 2016.
In line with the US tax rules, the restriction of losses is, to a large extent, based on the valuation of the US tax group at the change of control date and this will be agreed with the US tax authorities in due course.
The valuation of the US tax group is therefore a source of estimation and an external valuation was commissioned in 2017 to support the Groups position.
The recognised deferred tax asset is sensitive to a change in this valuation.
The Board expects the deferred tax asset to be recovered over a number of years and considers it to be unlikely that there will be a consequential change in the estimates made that would lead to a material movement in the asset in the next 12 months.

Financial instruments and financial risk management Information about the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, the Groups exposure to the risks arising from financial instruments, and the Groups management of capital is disclosed below.
Market risk a Foreign exchange risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the US Dollar and the Euro.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions to which the Group is already committed, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
Foreign currency movements impact on the consolidated income statement together with its cash flow profile and leverage ratio position.
The impact depends on whether there is a surplus or deficit in each currency from operating activities together with the interest and finance charge in those currencies.
The Groups policy has been to protect its cash flow and leverage ratio position by maintaining a proportion of currency debt in proportion to its currency earnings to obtain natural offsets.
Net debt by currency was as follows: 2018 2017 Cash and Interest rate Cash and borrowings Total cap borrowings Total m m m m m Pounds sterling 63.2 63.2 53.1 53.1 US dollars 37.1 37.1 0.1 84.6 84.5 Euros 141.7 141.7 138.1 138.1 Other currencies 5.8 5.8 4.2 4.2 Total 109.8 109.8 0.1 271.6 271.5 123 Ascential plc Annual Report 2018 Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2018 32.
Financial instruments and financial risk management continued For illustrative purposes, the table below provides details of the impact on revenue and Adjusted EBITDA if the actual reported results were restated for sterling weakening by 1% against the US Dollar and Euro rates in isolation.

Each 1% movement in the US Dollar to pounds Sterling exchange rate has a circa 0.8 million impact on the carrying value of borrowings 2017: 1.0 million.
b Cash flow and interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises from medium and long-term borrowings to the extent that the underlying debt instruments are not at fixed rates of interest.
The Group has entered into interest rate caps to convert a portion of its bank borrowings from fully floating to capped rates to mitigate this risk.
As at 31 December 2018, the total notional amount of outstanding interest rate caps to which the Group is committed is 115.2 million 2017: 109.2 million.
The fair value of the interest rate caps as at 31 December 2018 was nil 2017: 0.1 million current asset.
These interest rate caps are measured at fair value through profit or loss and are Level 2 financial instruments.
These derivative instruments were not traded in an active market and the fair value is determined by using third party valuations based on forward yield curves.
This technique maximises the use of observable market data where it is available and relies as little as possible on entity-specific estimates.
All significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable.
In the year ended 31 December 2018, if interest rates had been 50 basis points higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit for the year ended 31 December 2018 would have decreased or increased by 1.4 million 2017: 1.4 million.
The effective annual interest rate at 31 December 2018 was 2.3% 2017: 1.9%.
Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a Group basis.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of the financial assets in the consolidated balance sheet as disclosed below.
a Treasury-related credit risk The Group has treasury policies in place which manage the concentration of risk with individual counterparties and do not allow significant treasury exposures with counterparties.
Each counterparty has an individual limit which comprises of their long-term and short-term ratings by Standard & Poors and Moodys as well as their individual five-year Credit Default Swap price.
As at 31 December 2018, cash and cash equivalents totalled 182 million 2017: 45.8 million, of which 97% 2017: 83% was held with banks or financial institutions with long-term ratings of AA3 or better or short-term ratings of A-1 P-1.
In accordance with the Groups treasury policies and exposure management practices, counterparty credit exposure limits are continually monitored and no individual exposure is considered significant in the ordinary course of treasury management activity.
The Company does not expect any significant losses from non-performance by these counterparties.
b Trading risk Risk arises principally from payment default by customers.
The general policy of the Group is not to risk assess all new customers and so retail credit risk information has not been included in these consolidated financial statements.
The Company does not, however, expect any significant losses in respect of receivables that have not been provided for as shown in Note 19.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity in the form of sufficient cash or funding from adequate credit facilities to meet such liabilities under both normal and stressed conditions.

The Group is required to adhere to a net leverage ratio covenant which is measured at December and June.
The covenant ratio fell to 4.0x in December 2017 and will fall to 3.5x in June 2019 where it will remain until maturity of the facilities in 2021.
The Group operated within this covenant limit during 2018.
The Group has a margin ratchet on its interest rate based on the leverage position reported in its semi-annual covenant compliance certificate.
Due to the leverage ratio increasing above 2.0x at the annual compliance certificate for 31 December 2017, the margins were increased by 0.25% from 18 April 2018 and these remained unchanged for the remainder of 2018.

Financial instruments and financial risk management continued The financial and derivative liabilities are shown in the period in which they are due to be repaid.
The interest payments on borrowings due in less than one month represents the actual interest due, while the interest due greater than one month is an estimate based on current interest rates and exchange rates.
Cash flows in respect of borrowings represent contractual payments under the Groups lending facilities in place as at 31 December 2018.
Borrowings as disclosed in Note 23 are stated net of unamortised arrangement fees of 2.3 million as at 31 December 2018 2017: 3.3 million.
Both contingent consideration and acquisition-related employment costs are based on the future performance of the acquired business to which they relate.
Performance is assessed using forecast profits and the current three-year plan which is updated annually.
Forecasts are inherently a source of management estimation, resulting in a range of outcomes.
The likely range of outcomes of the combined contingent consideration and acquisition-related employment costs are disclosed in Note 12 for current and prior year acquisitions.

The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent comprising capital, reserves and retained earnings.
The Groups policy is to borrow centrally to meet anticipated funding requirements.
These borrowings, together with cash generated from the operations, are on-lent or contributed as equity to subsidiaries at market-based interest rates and on commercial terms and conditions.

Financial instruments and financial risk management continued Financial instruments in the category fair value through profit or loss are measured in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value.
Fair value measurements can be classified in the following hierarchy: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 : inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly Level 2 : and inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs Level 3.
