PENSIONS AND OTHER INFORMATION PENSIONS AND OTHER INFORMATION 26.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits The Group participates in several defined contribution schemes and two defined benefit schemes the BCA Pension Plan within British Car Auctions Limited and the Automotive Plan within Walon Limited.
The BCA Pension Plan provides benefits based on final pensionable salary.
The plan is closed to new members.
The valuation used for these accounts is based on the results of an actuarial valuation carried out as of 5 April 2017 and updated to the year end date by Capita, independent consulting actuaries, in accordance with IAS 19.
The Automotive Plan provides benefits based on final pensionable salary.
The plan closed to future accrual from 1997.
The valuation used for these accounts is based on the results of an actuarial valuation carried out as of 5 April 2016 and updated to the year end date by Broadstone, independent consulting actuaries, in accordance with IAS 19.
The defined benefit plans are registered with HMRC and comply fully with the regulatory framework published by the UK pensions regulator.
Benefits are paid to the members from a separate fund administered by independent trustees.
The BCA Pension Plan has five trustees, three of whom are appointed by the Group and two chosen by scheme members.
The Automotive Plan has four trustees, two of whom are appointed by the Group and two chosen by scheme members.
The Trustees are required to act in the best interests of the members and are responsible for making funding and investment decisions in conjunction with the Group.
Critical accounting estimates pensions The Groups net retirement benefit obligation, which is reviewed by management using assessments from independent actuaries each period, is based on key assumptions, including discount rates, inflation, future salary increases and pension costs.
These assumptions may be different to the actual outcome.
The principal assumptions used for the BCA Pension Plan and the Automotive Plan are as follows: As at 1 April 2018 As at 2 April 2017 BCA Automotive BCA Automotive Rate of increase in salaries 3.20% n a 3.40% n a Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.20% 2.20% 2.40% 2.40% Rate of increase in pensions: LPI 5.0% Cap 3.10% n a 3.20% n a LPI 2.5% Cap 2.10% n a 2.15% n a Fixed 3.00% Nil or 3.00% 3.00% Nil or 3.00% Discount rate 2.60% 2.60% 2.50% 2.50% Rate of inflation: Retail price index 3.20% 3.20% 3.40% 3.40% Consumer price index 2.20% 2.20% 2.40% 2.40% Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on published statistics and experience.
The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The mortality assumptions adopted imply the following expected future lifetimes from age 65: As at 1 April 2018 As at 2 April 2017 BCA Automotive BCA Automotive Age Age Age Age Males 22.5 22.5 23.0 23.0 Females 24.4 24.4 25.0 25.0 114 B BC CA M A Ma ar rk ke et tp plla ac ce p e pllc A c An nn nu ua al R l Re ep po or rt a t an nd A d Acc cco ou un nt ts 2 s 20 01 18 8 S St tr ra ate tegi gic c r re ep po or rt t Governance F Fiin na an nc ciial als s Changes in the fair value of the defined benefit liability in the BCA Pension Plan are as follows: As at 1 April 2018 As at 2 April 2017 Plan Plan Plan Plan assets liabilities Total assets liabilities Total m m m m m m At start of year 73.9 90.0 16.1 68.0 73.8 5.8 Income statement expense: Current service cost 1.0 1.0 0.9 0.9 Interest income expense 1.8 2.2 0.4 2.2 2.4 0.2 Total amount charged to the income statement 1.8 3.2 1.4 2.2 3.3 1.1 Remeasurements: Actuarial gains losses due to changes in financial assumptions 2.7 2.7 17.3 17.3 Actuarial gains due to changes in demographic assumptions 2.7 2.7 Experience gains and losses 2.1 1.4 0.7 7.4 0.1 7.5 Total amount recognised in other comprehensive income 2.1 4.0 6.1 7.4 17.2 9.8 Cash: Employer contributions 0.5 0.5 0.6 0.6 Employee contributions 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 Benefits paid 4.4 4.4 4.6 4.6 Net cash 3.6 4.1 0.5 3.7 4.3 0.6 At year end 74.2 85.1 10.9 73.9 90.0 16.1 Changes in the fair value of the defined benefit asset in the Automotive Plan are as follows: As at 1 April 2018 As at 2 April 2017 Plan Plan Plan Plan assets liabilities Total assets liabilities Total m m m m m m At start of year 13.6 14.8 1.2 11.8 13.6 1.8 Income statement expense: Interest income expense 0.3 0.4 0.1 0.4 0.5 0.1 Total amount charged to the income statement 0.3 0.4 0.1 0.4 0.5 0.1 Remeasurements: Actuarial gains due to changes in financial assumptions 1.5 1.5 Experience gains and losses 0.1 0.4 0.5 3.2 3.0 0.2 Total amount recognised in other comprehensive income 0.1 1.9 2.0 3.2 3.0 0.2 Cash: Employer contributions 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 Benefits paid 1.0 1.0 2.3 2.3 Net cash 0.5 1.0 0.5 1.8 2.3 0.5 At year end 13.5 12.3 1.2 13.6 14.8 1.2 Amount recognised in the balance sheet liability represented by: BCA Pension Plan 74.2 85.1 10.9 73.9 90.0 16.1 Automotive Plan 13.5 12.3 1.2 13.6 14.8 1.2 Total 87.7 97.4 9.7 87.5 104.8 17.3 B BC CA M A Ma ar rk ke et tp plla ac ce p e pllc A c An nn nu ua al R l Re ep po or rt a t an nd A d Acc cco ou un nt ts 2 s 20 01 18 8 115 PENSIONS AND OTHER INFORMATION continued 26.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits continued At the end of the reporting period the plan assets by category had been invested as follows: As at 1 April 2018 As at 2 April 2017 BCA Automotive Total BCA Automotive Total m m m m m m Equities quoted 34.6 7.5 42.1 33.7 7.7 41.4 Corporate bonds quoted 26.8 2.1 28.9 26.7 2.0 28.7 Government bonds quoted 4.0 3.5 7.5 4.2 3.3 7.5 Diversified growth funds quoted 8.7 8.7 9.3 9.3 Other 0.1 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.6 Total plan assets 74.2 13.5 87.7 73.9 13.6 87.5 Risk management These defined benefit plans expose the Group to actuarial risks, such as mortality risk, interest rate risk and market investment risk.
The investment policies of each scheme are described below: Asset volatility Plan liabilities, in respect of defined benefit obligations, are calculated on a discounted basis using a discount rate which is set with reference to corporate bond yields.
If the plan assets underperform this yield, then this will create a deficit.
The trustees of each plan, and their advisers, carry out regular reviews of asset allocations within each plan and consider the need to switch assets in line with the investment strategies.
Currently the plans hold approximately 40% of assets as defensive assets government and corporate bonds with the intention of mitigating significant changes in yields.
As each plan matures, the level of investment risk is reduced by investing more in government and corporate bonds that better match the liabilities.
However, the Group believes that due to the long-term nature of the scheme liabilities, a level of continuing equity investment is an appropriate element of the long-term investment strategy.
In respect of Guaranteed Minimum Pension GMP obligations, the strategy has the objectives of achieving an overall rate of return that is sufficient to meet pensioners reasonable expectations, reduce investment return volatility over the short-term period to retirement where this is possible and to invest in assets that are liquid such that they enable switching between asset classes.
In order to achieve these objectives, the strategy is to invest in a mixture of on-risk assets including equities and off-risk assets including bonds, gilts and cash, with the proportionate allocation of the latter increasing according to an agreed profile as members approach their normal retirement date.
Inflation The plans pension liabilities in deferment are linked to inflation.
Higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities, although in the majority of cases there are caps on the level of inflationary increases to be applied to pension obligations in order to protect the plans from extreme inflation.
The BCA Pension Plan holds approximately 5% of the plans assets in index-linked bonds to partially hedge against this risk.
The remainder of the plans assets are either unaffected by or loosely correlated with inflation, and so an increase in inflation can lead to an increase in the plan deficit.
Mortality The plans obligation is to provide a pension for the life of their members, so realised increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans benefit payments.
Whilst future mortality rates cannot be predicted with certainty the plans adopt up to date mortality assumptions and review the overall risk as part of the triennial actuarial valuations.
Bond yields Plan assets are likely to decrease following an increase in the interest rate.
This is due to an increase in interest rates having the effect of a decrease in value of the defensive assets held by the plans.
This risk is partially mitigated by the measurement of plan liabilities being linked to bond yields.
An increase in interest rates has the effect of increasing bond yields, which in turn decreases plan liabilities.
If interest rates decrease the opposite is true for both plan liabilities and assets.
Salary changes The calculation of the BCA Pension Plan liabilities uses the future estimated salaries of plan participants.
Increases in the salary of plan participants above that assumed will increase the plan liabilities.
The Automotive Plan is closed to future accruals, so is not exposed to this risk.

The table below demonstrates the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligations to changes in the significant assumptions used for the schemes.
Impact on the defined benefit obligations: BCA Automotive BCA Automotive m m % of liability % of liability Discount rate: 0.25% 3.6 0.5 4.2% 4.3% Inflation and related assumptions: 0.25% 1.9 0.2 2.2% 1.8% Mortality: reduced by 10% 2.7 n a 3.2% n a Mortality: long-term rate of longevity improvement: 0.25% n a 0.1 n a 0.9% The above analysis is based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant, and in practice this is unlikely to occur.
The above variances have been used as they are believed to be reasonably possible fluctuations.
Expected future cash flows The Group expects the employer contributions to be made to its defined benefit plans in the 2018 19 financial year to be 1.0m.
The Groups management do not expect any material changes to the annual cash contributions over the next three years: however it keeps contributions under review in the light of movements in the funding position of the schemes.
The defined benefit obligations are based on the current value of expected benefit payment cash flows to members over the next several decades.
The average duration of the liabilities is approximately 18 years for the BCA Pension Plan and 21 years for the Automotive Plan.

Financial instruments risk management continued Financial risk management The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The responsibility for monitoring the effectiveness of risk management is carried out by the Audit and Risk Committee on behalf of the Board of Directors.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices principally exchange rates and interest rates will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
Foreign exchange risk The Group operates in the UK and continental Europe Germany, France, Spain, Portugal, Netherlands, Italy, Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange risk.
Foreign exchange risk arises primarily on recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
These overseas operations revenues and costs are mainly denominated in the currencies of the countries in which the operations are located.
The most significant of these is the Euro.
The Euro to Sterling exchange rates used by the Group are shown below: For the For the year ended year ended 1 April 2018 2 April 2017 Euro opening period start 1.1694 1.2503 Euro average 1.1363 1.1940 Euro closing 1.1410 1.1694 The functional currencies of the revenue and adjusted EBITDA of the Groups operations are as follows: For the year ended For the year ended 1 April 2018 2 April 2017 GBP Euro Other Total GBP Euro Other Total Revenue m 2,213.5 171.3 46.7 2,431.5 1,855.4 148.7 25.6 2,029.7 Revenue % 91.0% 7.1% 1.9% 100.0% 91.4% 7.3% 1.3% 100.0% Adjusted EBITDA m 126.2 22.5 10.8 159.5 106.0 22.9 6.7 135.6 Adjusted EBITDA % 79.1% 14.1% 6.8% 100.0% 78.2% 16.9% 4.9% 100.0% The Group does not have significant transactional foreign currency cash flow exposures.
The Group monitors its exposure to currency fluctuations on an ongoing basis.
The Group maintains part of its net debt in Euros to reflect the currency in which its EBITDA is generated.
The Group does not normally hedge profit translation exposures.
During the year and as at 1 April 2018 the Group did not have any hedges inplace.
For the year ended 1 April 2018, if Sterling had strengthened by 10% on average against the Euro with all other variables held constant, adjusted EBITDA for the year would have been 2.0m lower for the year ended 2 April 2017: 2.1m lower as a result of a reduction of the equivalent value in Sterling of profits denominated in Euros.
Details of the currencies in which the Groups cash, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and loans and overdrafts are denominated are set out below: As at 1 April 2018 As at 2 April 2017 GBP Euro Other Total GBP Euro Other Total m m m m m m m m Cash 66.5 47.3 21.5 135.3 45.5 29.1 9.8 84.4 Trade and other receivables 325.9 52.8 11.0 389.7 281.0 45.9 10.2 337.1 Trade and other payables 402.2 91.3 28.7 522.2 368.8 74.7 16.9 460.4 Borrowings including Partner Financeborrowings 379.8 52.6 432.4 362.6 51.3 413.9 Net 389.6 43.8 3.8 429.6 404.9 51.0 3.1 452.8 118 B BC CA M A Ma ar rk ke et tp plla ac ce p e pllc A c An nn nu ua al R l Re ep po or rt a t an nd A d Acc cco ou un nt ts 2 s 20 01 18 8 S St tr ra ate tegi gic c r re ep po or rt t Governance F Fiin na an nc ciial als s Interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk arises from the Groups borrowings as disclosed in note 21.
Interest rates have been historically low and stable in terms of both LIBOR and EURIBOR rates and consequently no structured hedging has been implemented in the current year.
The Group will continue to monitor interest rates and assess the requirement for hedging in the future.
All of the Groups finance leases are at fixed rates ofinterest.
For the year ended 1 April 2018, if the average rate on floating rate borrowings had been 50 basis points higher with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been 1.4m lower for the year ended 2 April 2017: 1.2m lower.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss in the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally through trade receivables from customers and cash balances.
The Group has policies in place to ensure that services are only provided to clients with an appropriate credit history.
Customers who have an account with BCA Partner Finance are able to finance vehicles acquired through UK Vehicle Remarketing.
Prior to opening an account and subsequently, at least on an annual basis, a credit assessment is completed and appropriate security is obtained.
In addition, legal title of the vehicle remains with the Group until the outstanding balance is settled in full.
Cash and cash equivalents are held with reputable institutions.
The cash required for working capital is held with reputable banks in each country of operation as appropriate.
All other material cash balances are deposited with financial institutions whose credit rating is at least Standard and Poors Aor equivalent.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
Cash flow forecasting is performed in the operating entities of the Group and aggregated by Group Finance.
Group Finance monitors forecasts of the Groups liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities at all times so that the Group minimises the risk of breaching borrowing limits or covenants on any of its borrowing facilities.
Such forecasting takes into consideration the Groups debt financing plan and covenant compliance requirements on itsborrowings.
The Group has a 250.0m 2017: 250.0m revolving facility.
At 1 April 2018 70.0m 2017: 90.0m of the facility had been drawn, as well as 4.4m 2017: 5.5m of the facility having been utilised to provide guarantees to third parties.
This revolving facility is considered by management to provide adequate flexibility given the current liquidity of the business.
The table below analyses the Groups non-derivative financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the tables below are the contractual undiscounted cash flows: Carrying Contractual Within Between Between Over amount total 1 year 1 and 2 years 2 and 5 years 5 years As at 1 April 2018 m m m m m m Bank borrowings 326.9 328.9 70.0 258.9 Partner Finance borrowings 105.5 105.5 105.5 Trade and other payables 522.2 456.1 430.4 7.0 16.6 2.1 Carrying Contractual Within Between Between Over amount total 1 year 1 and 2 years 2 and 5 years 5 years As at 2 April 2017 m m m m m m Bank borrowings 344.9 347.6 90.0 257.6 Partner Finance borrowings 69.0 69.0 69.0 Trade and other payables 460.4 391.6 356.2 15.7 17.3 2.4 Capital risk management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base which comprises share capital, reserves and net debt excluding finance leases and Partner Finance borrowings so as to maintain creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
There were no changes in the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
Fair value The fair values of all financial instruments are equal to their carrying value.
