Notes to the financial statements 1.
General information Woodford Patient Capital Trust Plc the Company was incorporated in England and Wales on 26 January 2015 with registered number 09405653, as a closed-ended investment Company.
The Company commenced its operations on 21 April 2015.
The Company intends to carry on business as an investment trust within the meaning of Chapter 4 of Part 24 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010.
The Companys investment objective is to achieve long-term capital growth through investing in a portfolio consisting predominantly of UK companies, both quoted and unquoted.
The Company will aim to deliver a return in excess of 10 per cent per annum over the longer term.
The Companys shares were admitted to the Official List of the UK Listing Authority with a premium listing on 21 April 2015.
On the same day, trading of the ordinary shares commenced on the London Stock Exchange.
The registered office is Beaufort House, 51 New North Road, Exeter, EX4 4EP, United Kingdom.
Accounting policies The principal accounting policies followed by the Company are set out below: a Basis of accounting The Company's financial statements have been prepared in compliance with FRS 102 as it applies to the financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2018 and the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts issued in November 2014 and updated in February 2018.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the modification to a fair value basis for certain financial instruments as specified in the accounting policies below.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis see page 42 and on assumption that approval as an investment trust will continue to be granted.
The financial statements have been presented in Sterling, which is also the functional currency of the Company.
b Investments The Company has adopted the provisions of Sections 11 and 12 of FRS 102 for measuring and disclosing its financial instruments.
"All investments held by the Company are classified as ""fair value through profit or loss"", and are valued in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation IPEVCV guidelines updated in 2015."
Investments that are quoted, but there is no trading in those investments, are, for valuation purposes, treated as if they were unquoted investments and valued using the process described below.
Purchases and sales of quoted investments are recognised on the trade date where a contract of sale exists whose terms require delivery within a time frame determined by the relevant market.
Purchases and sales of unquoted investments are recognised when the contract for acquisition or sale becomes unconditional.
Investments in the shares of individual companies that are not quoted on any Stock Exchange unquoted investments are a significant activity of the Company and represent a significant asset of the Company.
Such investments are held at fair value, which requires significant estimation in concluding on their fair value.
While there is a robust and consistent valuation process, undertaken by the AIFM, it is recognised that in stating these assets at fair value there is a significant element of estimation uncertainty.
Central to this uncertainty is the assumption that such assets will continue to progress in line with their stated business plan and will be held for the longer term until exit, generally where either the company is sold to an interested party or lists on an appropriate exchange.
However, failure of any individual unquoted investment to progress in accordance with their business plan could result in material change to the fair valuation of that company.
The assumptions and estimates made in determining the fair value of each unquoted investment are considered at least each six months or sooner if there is a triggering event, for example the failure to meet an anticipated outcome of a drug trial, or other performance against tangible development milestones.
66 Woodford Patient Capital Trust plc 2.
Accounting policies continued In determining the fair value of the unquoted investments, the AIFM, as set out in the unquoted securities valuation policy above, has done so in accordance with the following principles, which are consistent with the IPEVCV guidelines: 1. held at the price of a recent investment for an appropriate period where there is considered to have been no material change in fair value: or 2. where the basis in 1 is no longer considered appropriate, then the following factors will be considered in determining the fair value: a. where a value is indicated by a material arms-length transaction by an independent third party in the shares of a company, this value will be used, unless the rights attributable to the shares impact the overall capital structure and rights of existing investors: or b. in the absence of a and depending upon both the subsequent trading performance and investment structure of an investee company, the valuation basis will usually move to an earnings multiple basis or, if appropriate, other valuation models such as: Probability-Weighted Expected Return Method PWERM, which considers on a probability weighted basis the future outcomes for the investment.
Option Priced Modelling OPM is used to value early stage companies where outcomes are uncertain.
Adjusted recent transaction prices which consider the companys performance against key milestones and the complexity of the capital structure are also used.
These valuation methods may lead to a company being valued on a suitable price-earnings ratio to that company's historic, current or forecast post-tax earnings before interest and amortisation the ratio used being based on a comparable sector but the resulting value being adjusted to reflect points of difference identified when compared to the market sector which the investment would reside were it listed including, inter alia, a lack of marketability.
3. if the investment is in a fund then the valuation will be based on the NAV of the fund which is invariably comprised of early stage unquoted investments, or on an adjusted basis to recognise the potential for a premium or discount to be applied to the share price.
At the end of 2018, 43.1 per cent 2017: 36 per cent of the NAV was valued in accordance with 1 : 0 per cent 2017: 12 per cent in accordance with 2a : 42.8 per cent 2017: 28 per cent in accordance with 2 b and 5.6 per cent 2017: 4 per cent in accordance with 3.
Further assessment of sensitivity to key estimates can be found in note 22. c Foreign currency Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at actual exchange rates as at the date of the transaction.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the period end are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss to capital or revenue in the income statement as appropriate.
Foreign exchange movements on investments are included in the income statement within gains losses on investments.
d Derivatives Derivatives, including forward foreign exchange contracts, are non-basic financial instruments.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised in profit or loss, in the capital column of the income statement where they are taken out to protect the capital value of the investment portfolio.
e Income Investment income has been accounted for on an ex-dividend basis or when the Company's right to the income is established.
Special dividends are credited to capital or revenue in the income statement, according to the circumstances surrounding the payment of the dividend.
UK dividends are accounted for net of any tax credits.
Overseas dividends are included gross of withholding tax.
Interest receivable on deposits is accounted for on an accruals basis.
f Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis and are charged as follows: any performance fee is allocated to capital: investment transaction costs are allocated to capital: other expenses are charged wholly to revenue: direct issue costs are deducted from the share premium account: and finance costs are charged wholly to revenue.
Woodford Patient Capital Trust plc 67 Notes to the financial statements CONTINUED 2.
Accounting policies continued g Taxation The charge for taxation is based upon the net revenue for the year.
The tax charge is allocated to the revenue and capital accounts according to the marginal basis whereby revenue expenses are first matched against taxable income arising in the revenue account.
Deferred taxation will be recognised as an asset or a liability if transactions have occurred at the interim reporting date that give rise to an obligation to pay more taxation in the future, or a right to pay less taxation in the future.
An asset will not be recognised to the extent that the transfer of economic benefit is not probable.
h Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash and demand deposits readily convertible to known amounts of cash and subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts, when applicable, are shown within current liabilities.
i Finance costs Finance costs are interest costs on the overdraft facility and are recognised in the income statement within revenue.

Portfolio management fee Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2018 2017 '000 '000 Performance fee accrual: 100% charged to capital 0 0 Total 0 0 The Portfolio Manager is entitled to receive a performance fee equal to 15 per cent of any excess returns over a cumulative 10 per cent per annum hurdle rate, subject to a high watermark.
The performance fee is calculated on the following basis.
Where: PF is the performance fee, if any, payable to the Portfolio Manager: A is the adjusted NAV per ordinary share: B is the higher of: i the high watermark NAV per ordinary share and ii the hurdle: and C is the time weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue since the last performance period in respect of which a performance fee was earned, or if no performance fee has yet been earned, admission.
In the event that A-B is a negative number, it shall be taken to equal zero.
68 Woodford Patient Capital Trust plc 4.
Portfolio management fee continued For these purposes: Performance period means: i the period beginning on the date of admission and ending on 31 December 2018 and ii each subsequent period corresponding to each accounting period of the Company.
Adjusted NAV per ordinary share means the NAV per ordinary share on the last business day of each performance period, adjusted by adding back any performance fee accrual in respect of such performance period.
High watermark NAV per ordinary share means the NAV per ordinary share as at the last business day of the performance period in respect of which a performance fee was last earned, adding back the effect of any performance fee paid in respect of such performance period or, if no performance fee has yet been earned, the issue price.
Hurdle means the issue price increased, from admission, at a rate of 10 per cent per annum, compounded annually as at the last business day of each performance period pro-rated, in the case of the first performance period, from the date of admission.
As at 31 December 2018, the Hurdle amount per ordinary share was 142.73p.
The high watermark NAV per ordinary share and the hurdle will be adjusted to reflect the impact on the adjusted NAV per ordinary share from a capital return and or dividend and or distribution to shareholders at the time of such capital return and or dividend and or distribution, on a pence per ordinary share basis.
As at 31 December 2018, the high watermark NAV per ordinary share was 129.75p.
If at any time a potential adjustment event shall occur, the Portfolio Manager and the Company will discuss in good faith what adjustment would be appropriate for the purpose of calculation of the performance fee.
Failing such agreement, the Company will instruct another independent firm of accountants to report to the Company and the Portfolio Manager regarding any adjustment that, in the opinion of the independent firm of accountants, shall be appropriate to be made for the purpose of the calculation of the performance fee.
Potential adjustment event means, in relation to the Company, every issue by way of capitalisation of profits or reserves and every issue by way of rights or bonus and every consolidation or sub-division or reduction of capital or share premium or capital dividend or redemption of ordinary shares, or other reconstruction or adjustment relating to the share capital of the Company or any shares, stock or securities derived there from or convertible there into and also includes any other amalgamation or reconstruction affecting the share capital of the Company or any shares, stock or securities derived therefrom or convertible there into.
No performance fee is payable in respect of the year ended 31 December 2018 2017: nil.

Due to the Companys status as an investment trust, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided for deferred tax on any chargeable gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.
The Company has a potential deferred tax asset of approximately 1,816,710 31 December 2017: 596,833 plus non-trade loan relationship deficit of 518,037 based on the long-term prospective corporation tax rate of 17 per cent 31 December 2017: 17 per cent relating to excess management expenses of 4,723,690 31 December 2017: 3,510,780 and a non-trade loan relationship deficit of 5,962,838 31 December 2017: 3,047,277.
It is unlikely that the Company will generate sufficient taxable profits in the future to utilise these expenses and therefore no deferred tax asset in respect of these expenses has been recognised.

Related party transactions Under the Listing Rules, the Portfolio Manager and AIFM are regarded as related parties of the Company.

Fees paid to the Companys Directors are disclosed in the Directors remuneration report.
Risk management policies and procedures As an investment trust, the Company invests in equities and other investments for the long term so as to secure its investment objectives stated above.
In pursuing its investment objectives, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction of the profits available for dividends.
The Companys financial instruments comprise securities in unquoted and quoted companies, trade receivables, trade payables and cash.
The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are fluctuations in market price, interest rate, credit, liquidity, capital and foreign currency exchange rate risk.
The policies for managing each of these risks are summarised below.
a Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements currency risk see b below, interest rate risk see c below and other price risk see d below.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks.
The Companys AIFM assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision, and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
b Currency risk Some of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than Sterling the Companys functional currency, in which it reports its results.
As a result, movements in exchange rates may affect the Sterling value of those items.
The AIFM monitors the Companys exposures and reports to the Board on a regular basis.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to Sterling on receipt.

Risk management policies and procedures continued b Currency risk continued Foreign currency exposures An analysis of the Companys equity investments and liabilities at 31 December 2018 shown at fair value, except derivatives at gross exposure value that are priced in a foreign currency based on the country of primary exposure are shown below: As at 31 December 2018 Investments Derivative Net financial 000 financial assets instruments 000 000 Currency Euro 6,896 6,142 754 Norwegian Krone 11,469 10,613 856 Swiss Francs 13,899 12,151 1,748 US Dollar 326,973 287,481 39,492 Total 359,237 316,387 42,850 As at 31 December 2017 Investments Derivative Net financial 000 financial assets instruments 000 000 Currency Euro 20,638 0 20,638 Norwegian Krone 24,923 0 24,923 Swiss Francs 9,634 0 9,634 US Dollar 251,815 0 251,815 Total 307,010 0 307,010 Foreign currency sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and the equity in regard to the Company's non-monetary financial assets to changes in the exchange rates for the portfolio's significant currency exposure, being Sterling US Dollar.
It assumes the following changes in exchange rates: Sterling US Dollar 10 per cent 2017: - 10 per cent.
These percentages have been determined based on a reasonable estimate of the potential volatility.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the foreign currency financial instruments held at each statement of financial position date and assumes no foreign exchange hedging.
If Sterling had strengthened against the US Dollar, this would have had the following effect: As at 31 December 2018 2017 US Dollar US Dollar 000 000 Projected change 10% 10% Impact on capital return 32,697 25,182 Return after taxation for the period 32,697 25,182 If Sterling had weakened against the US Dollar, this would have had the following effect: As at 31 December 2018 2017 US Dollar US Dollar 000 000 Projected change 10% 10% Impact on capital return 32,697 25,182 Return after taxation for the period 32,697 25,182 In the opinion of the Directors, the above sensitivity analyses are not representative of the period as a whole, since the level of exposure changes frequently as part of the currency risk management process used to meet the Company's objectives.

Risk management policies and procedures continued c Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
The Company is exposed to interest rate risk specifically through its bank overdraft.
Interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable from any cash at bank and on deposits or payable on the bank overdraft facility see note 12b.
The effect of interest rate changes on the earnings of the companies held within the portfolio may have a significant impact on the valuation of the Companys investments.
The Company has a 150 million bank overdraft facility which was extended by 364 days to 16 January 2020.
If interest rates had been - 25 basis points and all other variables were held constant, the Company's return attributable to ordinary shareholders for the year ended 31 December 2018 would have increased decreased by approximately - 375,000. d Other price risk Other price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk, whether those changes are caused by factors specific to the individual financial instrument or its issuer, or factors affecting similar financial instruments traded in the market.
The Company is exposed to market price risk arising from its equity investments.
The movements in the prices of these investments result in movements in the performance of the Company.
The Board manages the market price risks inherent in the investment portfolio by ensuring full and timely access to relevant information from the AIFM.
The Board meets regularly and at each Board meeting reviews investment performance.
The Board monitors the AIFMs compliance with the Companys objectives.
Concentration of exposure to other price risks A sector breakdown and geographical allocation of the portfolio is contained on pages 19 and 20.
Other price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year to an increase or decrease of 10 per cent in the fair values of the Companys equities.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions.
The overall portfolio sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys total equities at the balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.
2018 2018 2017 2017 Increase in Decrease in Increase in Decrease in fair value fair value fair value fair value 000 000 000 000 Income statement return after taxation: Capital return increase decrease 96,361 96,361 90,528 90,528 Return after taxation other than arising from 96,361 96,361 90,528 90,528 interest rate or currency risk increase decrease As discussed on page 26 in relation to portfolio concentration risk, the performance of the Company's individual holdings, together with market events, may create short term volatility in the Company's NAV.
The valuation of some of the Companys larger investments, totalling approximately 15 per cent, are particularly sensitive to achieving key technological milestones.
Successful completion or failure to achieve these milestones could have a significant impact on the Companys net assets and capital return.
These investments are subject to greater risk of fluctuation in valuation than the overall portfolio sensitivity described above.

Risk management policies and procedures continued e Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Liquidity risk exposure The Companys assets comprise quoted and unquoted equity shares.
While the unquoted equity is intentionally illiquid, part of the portfolio of quoted assets comprises readily realisable securities that can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.
For the avoidance of doubt, none of the assets of the Company are subject to special liquidity arrangements.
The investment in Level 3 securities may have limited liquidity and may be difficult to realise.
At 31 December 2018, the total Level 3 securities are valued at 738,766,000 31 December 2017: 619,266,000. f Credit risk The failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Company suffering a loss.
The cash is subject to counterparty credit risk as the Companys access to its cash could be delayed should the counterparties become insolvent or bankrupt.
In summary, the exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2018 was as follows: 2018 2017 3 months 3 months or less or less 000 000 Debtors 11 4 Total 11 4 None of the above assets were impaired or past due but not impaired.
Investment transactions are carried out with a number of brokers, whose credit standing is reviewed periodically by the AIFM, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker.
Cash at bank is held only with reputable banks with high-quality external credit ratings.
g Fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities The financial assets and liabilities are either carried in the balance sheet at their fair value, or the balance sheet amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value due from brokers, dividends receivable, accrued income, due to brokers, accruals and cash balances.
The valuation techniques used by the Company are explained in the accounting policies in note 2 b above.
For financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorised into a fair value hierarchy based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurements in its entirety, which are described as follows: Level 1 The unadjusted quoted price in an active market for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable ie developed using market data for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 Inputs are unobservable ie for which market data is unavailable for the asset or liability.
