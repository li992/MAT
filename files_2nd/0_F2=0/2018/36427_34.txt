FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Glossary alternative performance measures The performance of the group is assessed using a number of alternative performance measures APMs.
The groups results are presented both before and after exceptional and non-underlying items.
Adjusted profitability measures are presented excluding exceptional and non-underlying items as we believe this provides both management and investors with useful additional information about the groups performance and aids a more effective comparison of the groups trading performance from one period to the next and with similar businesses.
Adjusted profitability measures are reconciled to unadjusted IFRS results on the face of the income statement with details of exceptional and non-underlying items provided in note 5.
In addition, the groups results are described using certain other measures that are not defined under IFRS and are therefore considered to be APMs.
These measures are used by management to monitor ongoing business performance against both shorter-term budgets and forecast but also against the groups longer-term strategic plans.
The definition of each APM presented in this report and, also, where a reconciliation to the nearest measure prepared in accordance with IFRS can be found is shown below.
