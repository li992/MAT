The calculation takes account of any available indexation on the historical cost of the properties.
Duetothe Groups REIT status, deferred tax is only provided at each balance sheet date on properties outside the REIT regime.
There have been no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 or Level 2 and Level 3 in either 2018 or 2017.
Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of all tax losses and other temporary differences where the Directors believe it is probable that these assets will be recovered.
