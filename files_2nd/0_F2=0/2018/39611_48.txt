Notes on the consolidated accounts 12 Financial instruments: fair value of financial instruments not a Contractual cash flows are discounted using a market discount carried at fair value continued rate that incorporates the current spread for the borrower or where this is not observable, the spread for borrowers of a similar credit The fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or standing.
This method is used for portfolios where counterparties paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market have external ratings: institutional and corporate lending in participants at the measurement date.
Quoted market values are used NatWest Markets.

RoI, Commercial Banking SME loans and Private Banking in Changes in these assumptions would significantly affect estimated fair order to reflect the homogeneous nature of these portfolios.
The fair values reported would not necessarily be realised in an immediate sale or settlement.
For certain portfolios where there are very few or no recent transactions, a bespoke approach is used.
The assumptions and methodologies underlying the calculation of fair values of financial instruments at the balance sheet date are as Debt securities follows: The majority of debt securities are valued using quoted prices in active markets, or using quoted prices for similar assets in active markets.
Short-term financial instruments Fair values of the rest are determined using discounted cash flow For certain short-term financial instruments: cash and balances at valuation techniques.

Loans to banks and customers Debt securities in issue and subordinated liabilities In estimating the fair value of net loans to customers and banks Fair values are determined using quoted prices for similar liabilities measured at amortised cost, RBSs loans are segregated into where available or by reference to valuation techniques, adjusting for appropriate portfolios reflecting the characteristics of the constituent own credit spreads where appropriate.
Two principal methods are used to estimate fair value: 13 Financial instruments - maturity analysis Remaining maturity The following table shows the residual maturity of financial instruments, based on contractual date of maturity.

The settlement date of debt securities in issue, issued by receipts and payments of interest of financial assets and liabilities by certain securitisation vehicles consolidated by RBS, depends on when contractual maturity.
The balances in the following tables do not agree cash flows are received from the securitised assets.
Where these directly with the consolidated balance sheet, as the tables include all assets are prepayable, the timing of the cash outflow relating to cash flows relating to principal and future coupon payments, presented securities assumes that each asset will be prepaid at the earliest on an undiscounted basis.
The tables have been prepared on the possible date.
As the repayments of assets and liabilities are linked, following basis: the repayment of assets in securitisations is shown on the earliest date that the asset can be prepaid, as this is the basis used for liabilities.
Financial assets have been reflected in the time band of the latest date on which they could be repaid, unless earlier repayment can be The principal amounts of financial assets and liabilities that are demanded by RBS.
Financial liabilities are included at the earliest date repayable after 20 years or where the counterparty has no right to on which the counterparty can require repayment, regardless of repayment of the principal are excluded from the table, as are interest whether or not such early repayment results in a penalty.

The liability is included in the time band that contains the earliest possible date on which the conditions could be fulfilled, without considering the probability of the conditions being met.
2 Other liabilities include notes in circulation.
3 RBS is only called upon to satisfy a guarantee when the guaranteed party fails to meet its obligations.
RBS expects most guarantees it provides to expire unused.
4 RBS has given commitments to provide funds to customers under undrawn formal facilities, credit lines and other commitments to lend subject to certain conditions being met by the counterparty.
RBS does not expect all facilities to be drawn, and some may lapse before drawdown.
