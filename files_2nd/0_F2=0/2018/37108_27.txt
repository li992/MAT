2 Alternative performance measures The Group uses a number of alternative non-Generally Accepted Accounting Practice non-GAAP performance measures which are not fide ned within IFRS.
The Directors use these measures in order to assess the underlying operational performance of the Group and, as such, these measures are important and should be considered alongside the IFRS measures.
The adjustments are separately disclosed and are usually items that are signi cant in size or non-underlying in nature.
The following non-GAAP measures are referred to in this Annual Report and Accounts.

The effective income tax rate on the underlying pro t before tax is 18.7% 2017: 17.2%.

At 31 December 2018, the Group had unrecognised tax losses of 11.1m 2017: 10.2m.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these losses due to the uncertainty relating to their future recovery.

The recoverable amount of these units has been assessed based on value in use calculations using cash projections based on 3 year plans approved by the Board together with projections derived from those plans for the next 2 years.
A terminal value of cash ows beyond that date has been calculated at a growth rate in line with managements long-term expectations for the relevant market, using a growth rate in the range 2.0% to 4.6%.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations include gross margin, discount rate, in ation of overheads and payroll and growth rates.
For presentation purposes the CGUs are grouped into the appropriate division.
Growth estimates are based on the levels achieved in the current and historic periods adjusted for management expectations of the impact of management actions and the future development of the relevant market.
Short-term growth rates for turnover are based on the 3 year plan and allow for signi cant growth in project based activities.
These growth rates vary depend ent on the market conditions in which the CGU operates.
Direct costs are expected to increase in line with turnover.
Discount rates applied to cash projections re ect managements estimate of the return required from the business to re ect the cost of funds plus an appropriate risk premium.
This has been determined with reference to the CGUs weighted average cost of capital WACC adjusted for risks speci c to each CGUs cash ows.
The range of pre-tax discount rates used was 5.7% to 6.7% 2017: 6.1% to 7.1%.
Effective tax rates of between nil% and 35% 2017: nil% and 30% dependent upon which jurisdiction the operations are forecast to take place in have been assumed as estimated long-term rates.
Based on the value in use calculations set out above no impairment of the goodwill of the cash generating units was identi ed.
Sensitivity to impairment The Directors have carried out sensitivity analysis to determine the impact on the carrying value of goodwill of a change in discount rate, revenue growth and terminal value growth and identi ed that the discount rate would need to be increased to 12% to give rise to an impairment to goodwill of any of the CGUs.

The financial statements incorporate the latest full actuarial valuations of the schemes which have been updated to 31 December 2018 by quali ed actuaries using assumptions set out in the table below.
The Groups obligations in respect of its pension schemes at 31 December 2018 were as follows: Group Company 2018 2017 2018 2017 m m m m Shore staff 4.6 5.8 4.6 5.8 MNOPF 5.1 6.8 3.6 5.0 MNRPF 6.4 7.2 2.3 2.9 16.1 19.8 10.5 13.7 Shore staff The assets of this scheme are held in a separate trustee administered account and do not include any of the Groups assets.
The scheme was closed to new members in October 2001 and closed to future accrual on 31 December 2010.
The most recent actuarial valuation was as at 31 July 2016.
It is valued every three years following which fide cit contributions and the repayment period are subject to agreement between the Company and the Trustees.
Estimated contributions to the scheme in 2019 are 1.6m.
MNOPF The MNOPF is an industry-wide pension scheme which is accounted for as a fide ned bene t scheme.
It is valued every three years and fide cits have typically been funded over a ten year period.
The most recent triennial actuarial valuation of the scheme was as at 31 March 2018 and no additional fide cit funding was requested by the Trustees.
The respective share of the Group and Company in the net retirement bene t obligation of the MNOPF are 3.2% 2017: 3.2% and 1.6% 2017: 1.6% respectively.
Disclosures relating to this scheme are based on these allocations.
The liability recognised represents the discounted value of committed cash ows.
Information supplied by the trustees of the MNOPF has been reviewed by the Companys actuaries.
The principal assumption in the review is the discount rate on the schemes liabilities which was 2.90% 2017: 2.50%.
The disclosures below relate to the Groups share of the assets and liabilities within the MNOPF.
Estimated contributions to this scheme in 2019 are 1.9m.
MNRPF The MNRPF is an industry-wide pension scheme which is accounted for as a fide ned bene t scheme.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the MNRPF was at 31 March 2017 and the Group and Company have recognised a liability based on the discounted value of expected cash contributions.
The share of the Group and the Company in the net retirement bene t obligation of the MNRPF are 2.20% and 0.79% respectively.
The principal assumption in the MNRPF valuation is the discount rate on the schemes liabilities which was 2.90% 2017: 2.50%.
Subject to any changes arising out of the actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2018, estimated contributions to this scheme are 5.1m in 2019.
Actuarial assumptions The schemes assets are stated at their market values on the respective balance sheet dates.
The overall expected rates of return on assets re ect the risk-free rate of return plus an appropriate risk premium based on the nature of the relevant asset category.
The principal assumptions used in updating the latest valuations for each of the schemes were: 2018 2017 Inflation % 3.19 3.15 Rate of increase of pensions in payment Shore staff % 3.04 3.05 Discount rate for scheme liabilities % 2.90 2.50 Expected rates of return on assets % 2.90 2.50 Post-retirement mortality: years Shore staff scheme Current pensioner at 65 male 20.7 20.9 Current pensioner at 65 female 22.6 22.7 Future pensioner at 65 male 21.8 21.9 Future pensioner at 65 female 23.9 24.0 The post-retirement mortality assumptions allow for the expected increase in longevity.
The current disclosures above relate to assumptions based on longevity in years following retirement at the balance sheet date, with future being that relating to a member who is currently 45 years old.
Sensitivities The key sensitivities on the major schemes may be summarised as follows: Shore staff scheme Key measure Change in assumption Change in deficit Discount rate Decrease of 0.25% Increase by 2.9% Rate of inflation Increase by 0.25% Increase by 1.3% Rate of mortality Increase in life expectancy Increase by 4.1% of 1 year 94 J ames F isher and S ons plc A nnual R eport and A ccounts 2018 21 Retirement bene t obligations continued MNOPF Key measure Change in assumption Change in deficit Discount rate Decrease of 0.25% Increase by 0.4% MNRPF Key measure Change in assumption Change in deficit Discount rate Decrease of 0.25% Increase by 0.1% In determining the discount rate, assumptions have been made in relation to corporate bond yields and the expected term of liabilities.
As noted above, a change in discount rate applied has a signi cant impact on the value of liabilities.

The Company has granted conditional awards in the form of options over shares or conditional rights to have shares transferred to certain employees under the LTIP scheme over 373,582 2017: 377,100 ordinary shares of 25p each.
For the share options outstanding at 31 December 2018, the weighted average remaining contractual life is 2 years and 2 months 2017: 2 years and 7months.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was 11.74 2017: 10.94.
For the share options outstanding at 31 December 2018, the weighted average remaining contractual life is 2 years and 0 months 2017: 2 years and 11months.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was 13.49 2017: 12.85.
The range of exercise prices for options outstanding at the end of the year was 6.02 16.31 2017: 3.54 15.67.
The fair value of share based payments has been estimated using the Black-Scholes model for the Sharesave and the earnings per share EPS element of the LTIP.
The fair value of share based payments relating to the total shareholder return TSR element of the LTIP has been estimated using the Monte Carlo model.
The inputs to the models used to determine the valuations fell within the following ranges: 2018 2017 Dividend yield % 1.8% 1.6% Expected life of option years 3 7.22 3 7.22 Share price at date of grant 15.12 15.34 15.94 16.67 Expected share price volatility % 30% 30% Risk-free interest rate % 0.94% 1.12% 0.17% Sharesave All employees, subject to the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, may apply for share options under an employee save as you earn plan which may from time to time be offered by the Company.
An individuals participation is limited so that the aggregate price payable for shares under option at any time does not exceed the statutory limit.
Options granted under the plans will normally be exercisable if the employee remains in employment and any other conditions set by the Remuneration Committee have been satis ed.
Options are normally exercisable at the end of the related savings contract but early exercise is permitted in certain limited circumstances.
The performance period will not normally be less than three and a half years or greater than seven and a half years.
Awards were made under this scheme on 5 April 2018.

The Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through operating cash ows, with borrowings in place to fund acquisitions and capital expenditure.
At 31December 2018, the Group had 92.4m 2017: 71.8m of undrawn committed facilities none of which expire within twelve months.
The Group is required under the terms of its loan agreements to maintain covenant ratios in respect of net debt to Ebitda and net interest costs to underlying earnings before interest.
The Group met its covenant ratios for the year ended 31 December 2018.
The Directors have prepared forecasts of the cash ows for the subsequent eighteen-month period which indicate that, taking into account the factors noted above, the Group will meet its covenant requirements for this period.
The total amount that it is able to borrow under existing revolving credit facilities is limited to a maximum of 225m 2017: 225m.
The Group manages its capital structure so as to maintain investor, supplier and market con dence and to provide returns to shareholders that will support the future development of the business.
Capital is monitored by measuring the gearing ratio which is net debt divided by capital.
Net debt comprises interest bearing loans and borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.
Capital represents net equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent.
Return on capital employed is also monitored.
The Groups dividend policy is based on the expected growth in sustainable income streams after making provision for the retention of capital to invest in growth and acquisitions.
In evaluating growth investment opportunities the Group has a target of a 15% pre-tax return on the capital invested.

These arise principally from the Groups receivables from customers and from cash balances held with financial institutions.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
There are no signi cant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is in uenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer and the industry and country in which each customer operates.
The Group has a number of large customers including Government agencies in the UK and overseas, major oil companies and other multinational corporations.
The ten largest customers of the Group accounted for approximately 26% of Group revenue 2017: 20%.
No customer accounted for more than 4% 2017: 3% of Group revenue.
New customers are subject to creditworthiness checks and credit limits are subject to approval by senior management.
Goods are sold subject to retention of title clauses so that in the event of non-payment the Group may have a secured claim.

Based on historic default rates, the Group believes that apart from the amounts included in the table above, no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables.
The material balances over 90 days are in respect of speci c contracts or markets where the balance is considered recoverable, except to the extent that they are already provided, and there is no material impact on expected credit losses.
b Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group manages its cash resources and borrowings to ensure that it will have suf cient liquidity to meet its liabilities as they fall due but in a manner designed to maximise the bene t of those resources whilst ensuring the security of investment resources.
The Group forecasts the pro le of its cash requirements on a monthly basis and ensures that suf cient facilities are available to meet peak requirements which occur at predictable times in the year.
The Group manages the maturity pro le of its borrowings by maintaining a regular dialogue with its lenders and ensuring that it commences the renegotiation of facilities suf ciently early to allow a comprehensive review of its requirements before completion.
The Groups revolving credit facilities extend over several accounting periods and fall due for renewal in different accounting periods ensuring that the Group negotiations with individual lenders follow an orderly process which does not expose the Group to the possibility of a signi cant reduction in available facilities in any single period.
At 31 December 2018, the Group had 92.4m 2017: 71.8m of undrawn committed bank facilities.

These transactional exposures are mainly to movement in the US Dollar and the Euro.
The Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its transactional exposures.
Most forward exchange contracts have maturities of less than one year after the balance sheet date.
Forward exchange contracts which qualify as effective cash ow hedges are stated at fair value.
The principal translation exposures relate to the Norwegian Kroner.
The following table shows the impact on earnings of a 5% strengthening in the exchange rate in the Groups key currencies against Sterling.
The obverse movements would be of the same magnitude.
These amounts have been calculated by applying changes in exchange rates to the Groups foreign currency pro ts and losses and to financial instruments denominated in foreign currency.

Both Martek and MSMC will be included in the Groups Marine Support division.
31 Signi cant accounting policies The Group has adopted IFRS15 Revenue from contracts with customers and restated its comparatives accordingly, which is set out in note 33.
The Group has adopted IFRS 9 Financial Instruments which has had no impact on comparatives.
Otherwise, the principal accounting policies, which have been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year, are set out below.
31.1 Basis of preparation of the consolidated financial statements The results of subsidiaries are consolidated for the periods from or to the date on which control has passed.
Control exists when the Company controls an investee when the investor is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investees and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
Acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting from the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is passed to the Group.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the Parent Company, using consistent accounting policies.
All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.
Payment for the future services from employees or former owners are expensed.
Any payments to employees or former owners in respect of the acquisition of the business are capitalised.
This is carefully managed during the acquisition process so that former owners and or employees do not receive any incentive payments during an earn-out period.
Joint arrangements A joint arrangement is an arrangement over which the Group and one or more third parties have joint control.
These joint arrangements are in turn classi ed as: Joint ventures whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities: and Joint operations whereby the Group has rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement.
Any investment in joint ventures is carried in the balance sheet at cost plus the Groups post acquisition share in the change in net assets of the joint ventures, less any impairment provision.
The income statement re ects the Groups share of the post-tax result of the joint ventures.
The Groups share of any changes recognised by the joint venture in other comprehensive income are also recognised in other comprehensive income.
110 J ames F isher and S ons plc A nnual R eport and A ccounts 2018 31 Signi cant accounting policies continued Non-controlling interests Non-controlling interests represent the proportion of pro t or loss and net assets not held by the Group and are presented separately in the income statement and in the consolidated statement of financial position.
On the acquisition of non-controlling interests, the difference between the consideration paid and the fair value of the share of net assets acquired is recognised in equity.
Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing so causes the non-controlling interests to have a fide cit balance.
Company investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures In its separate financial statements the Company recognises its investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures at cost.
Income is recognised from these investments when its right to receive the dividend is established.
31.2 Foreign currency Group The financial statements of subsidiary undertakings are prepared in their functional currency which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each entity are translated into UK Sterling, which is the Groups presentational currency.
i Foreign currency transactions in functional currency Transactions in currencies other than the entities functional currency are initially recorded at rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction.
At each subsequent balance sheet date: i Foreign currency monetary items are retranslated at rates prevailing on the balance sheet date and any exchange differences recognised in the income statement: ii Non-monetary items measured at historical cost are not retranslated: and iii Non-monetary items measured at fair value are retranslated using exchange rates at the date the fair value was determined.
Where a gain or loss is recognised directly in equity, any exchange component is also recognised in equity and conversely where a gain or loss is recognised in the income statement, any exchange component is recognised in the income statement.
ii Net investment in foreign operations Exchange differences arising on monetary items forming part of the Groups net investment in overseas subsidiary undertakings which are denominated in the functional currency of the subsidiary undertaking are taken directly to the translation reserve and subsequently recognised in the consolidated income statement on disposal of the net investment.
Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are used to provide an effective hedge against Group equity investments in foreign currency are taken directly to the translation reserve.
iii Translation from functional currency to presentational currency The assets and liabilities of operations, where the functional currency is different from the Groups presentational currency are translated at the period end exchange rates.
Income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the reporting period.
All other exchange differences on transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Resulting exchange differences are recognised in the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income.
Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences included in the reserve are also dealt with in the translation reserve.
Company Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on settlement of monetary items or on the retranslation of monetary items at rates different from those at which they were initially recognised are taken to the income statement.
All exchange differences on assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are taken to the income statement, other than investments in foreign operations and foreign currency borrowings used to hedge those investments, where exchange differences are taken to the translation reserve.
31.3 Financial instruments IFRS 9 Financial Instruments became effective on 1 January 2018.
This standard replaces IAS 39 and introduced new requirements for classifying and measuring financial instruments and put in place a new hedge accounting model that is designed to be more closely aligned with how entities undertake risk management activities when hedging financial and nonfinancial risk exposures.
IFRS 9 has been implemented prospectively from 1 January 2018 and the impact on the Group has not been material.
The key areas of focus for the Group under IFRS 9 are: Expected credit losses being recognised on trade debtors and contract assets recognised under IFRS 15: Hedge accounting and related hedge documentation: and Re-classi cation of assets held for sale as other investments, with these being fair valued at each reporting period.
a Financial assets Trade receivables and debt securities issued are initially recognised when they are originated.
All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
A financial asset, other than a trade receivable without a signi cant nancing component, or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue.
A trade receivable without a signi cant nancing component is initially measured at the transaction price.
111 FINANCIAL S STRATEGIC REPOR TATEMENT T S J ames F isher and S ons plc A nnual R eport and A ccounts 2018 Notes to the financial statements continued 31 Signi cant accounting policies continued Policy applicable from 1 January 2018 A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it is not designated as fair value through the pro t and loss account FVTPL and it is held to collect contractual cash ows with contractual terms that give rise on speci ed dates to cash ows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
A debt investment is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI if it is not designated as at FVTPL, and it is held with the objective of collecting contractual cash ows and selling financial assets with contractual terms that give rise on speci ed dates to cash ows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
On initial recognition of an equity investment not held for trading, the Group can irrevocably elect, on an investment by investment basis, to present subsequent changes in the investments fair value in OCI.
All financial assets not classi ed as measured at amortised cost or FVOCI, as described above, including derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value through pro t and loss.
Financial assets at fair value through pro t and loss, including any interest or dividend income, are recognised in the pro t and loss.
Financial assets at amortised cost are valued using the effective interest method with the amortised cost reduced by any impairment losses, with interest income, foreign exchange gains or losses, impairment and fide-recognition gains or losses recognised in pro t or loss.
Debt investments are measured at fair value with interest income calculated using the effective interest method with any foreign exchange gains and losses, or impairments, taken through the pro t and loss.
Other net gains or losses, and those on fide-recognition accumulated through the OCI, are re-classi ed in the pro t or loss.
Equity investments are measured at fair value with dividends recognised through the pro t and loss.
Other net gains or losses, are recognised in the OCI, and are never re-classi ed in the pro t or loss.
Before 1 January 2018 the Group classi ed its financial assets into one of the following categories: Financial assets, except those designated as hedging instruments, at FVTPL, measured at fair value with any changes therein, including any interest or dividend income, recognised in pro t or loss : Held-to-maturity financial assets measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method : Loans and receivables measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method : or Available-for-sale financial assets measured at fair value, with changes therein excluding impairment losses, interest income and foreign currency differences on debt instruments recognised in OCI and accumulated in the fair value reserve.
On fide-recognition, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is re-classi ed to pro t or loss.
b Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are classi ed as measured at amortised cost or FVTPL.
A financial liability is classi ed as at FVTPL if it is classi ed as held for trading, it is a derivative or it is designated as such on initial recognition.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognised in pro t or loss.
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Interest expense, foreign exchange gains and losses, and any gain or loss on fide-recognition are recognised in pro t or loss.
c fide-recognition The Group fide-recognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash ows from that asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash ows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred.
The Group fide-recognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire.
On fide-recognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid is recognised in pro t or loss.
d Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency and interest rate risk exposures.
Derivatives are initially measured at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes therein are generally recognised in pro t or loss.
The Group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments to hedge the variability in cash ows associated with highly probable forecast transactions arising from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates and certain derivatives and nonderivative financial liabilities as hedges of foreign exchange risk on a net investment in a foreign operation.
At inception of designated hedging relationships, the Group documents the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge and the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, including whether the changes in cash ows of the hedged item and hedging instrument are expected to offset each other.
The appropriate level of hedging is monitored by Group Treasury and the Group Board.
As part of this review process the following are assessed: the hedging effectiveness to determine that there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument: the hedge ratio: and that the hedged item and instrument are not intentionally weighted to create hedge ineffectiveness.
112 J ames F isher and S ons plc A nnual R eport and A ccounts 2018 31 Signi cant accounting policies continued Cash ow hedges When a derivative is designated as a cash ow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised in OCI and accumulated in the hedging reserve.
Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised immediately in pro t or loss.
The Group designates only the change in fair value of the spot element of forward exchange contracts as the hedging instrument in cash ow hedging relationships.
For all hedged forecast transactions, the amount accumulated in the hedging reserve is re-classi ed to pro t or loss in the same period or periods during which the hedged expected future cash ows affect pro t or loss.
Cash and short-term deposits included in the statement of financial position comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less from the original acquisition date.
Cash and cash equivalents included in the cash ow statement comprise cash and short-term deposits, net of bank overdrafts.
If the hedged future cash ows are no longer expected to occur, then the amounts that have been accumulated in the hedging reserve and the cost of hedging reserve are immediately re-classi ed to pro t or loss.
Net investment hedges When a derivative instrument or a non derivative financial liability is designated as the hedging instrument in a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, the effective portion of, for a derivative, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument or, for a nonderivative, foreign exchange gains and losses is recognised in OCI and presented in the translation reserve within equity.
Any ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivative or foreign exchange gains and losses on the non derivative is recognised immediately in pro t or loss.
The amount recognised in OCI is re-classi ed to pro t or loss as a re-classi cation adjustment on disposal of the foreign operation.
e Expected credit losses IFRS 9 introduced a new model for the recognition of impairment losses the expected credit loss ECL model.
ECL is the expected value decrease in an asset.
The expected credit loss model constitutes a change from the previous IAS 39 incurred loss model.
The key difference between incurred and expected is the requirement to consider forward looking scenarios.
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss of the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers and investments in debt securities.
The carrying amounts of financial assets and contract assets represent the maximum credit exposure.
4 Intangible assets Intangible assets, excluding goodwill arising on a business combination, are stated at cost or fair value less any provision for impairment.
Intangible assets assessed as having nite lives are amortised over their estimated useful economic life and are assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that they are impaired.
Amortisation charges are on a straight-line basis and recognised in the income statement.
Estimated useful lives are as follows: Development costs 5 years or over the expected period of product sales, if less Intellectual property 3 to 20 years Patents and licences 5 years or over the period of the licence, if less Other intangibles 5 years a Goodwill arising on a business combination Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary represents the excess of the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration over the aggregate fair value of the identi able assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is initially recognised at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Costs related to an acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities incurred in connection with a business combination are expensed to the income statement.
The carrying value of goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment but more regularly if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may be impaired.
When an impairment loss is recognised it is not reversed in a subsequent accounting period, even if the circumstances which led to the impairment cease to exist.
b Acquired intangible assets Intangible assets that are acquired as a result of a business combination including but not limited to customer relationships, supplier lists, patents and technology and that can be separately measured at fair value on a reliable basis are recorded initially at fair value and amortised over their expected useful life.
Amortisation is expensed to the consolidated income statement.
31.5 Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment losses.
Re t costs relating to vessels are capitalised when incurred and depreciated over their estimated useful economic life of 30 months.
Cost comprises expenditure incurred during construction, delivery and modi cation.
Where a substantial period of time is required to bring an asset into use, attributable finance costs are capitalised and included in the cost of the relevant asset.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment to their residual value in equal annual instalments over their estimated useful lives, as follows: Freehold property 40 years Leasehold improvements 25 years or the period of the lease, if shorter Plant and equipment Between 5 and 20 years Vessels Between 10 and 25 years No depreciation is charged on assets under construction.
Residual values of vessels are set initially at 20% of purchase cost or fair value at acquisition, which the Directors believe to be an approximation of current residual values.
Residual values and estimated remaining lives are reviewed annually by the Directors and adjusted if appropriate to re ect the relevant market conditions and expectations, obsolescence and normal wear and tear.
113 FINANCIAL S STRATEGIC REPOR TATEMENT T S J ames F isher and S ons plc A nnual R eport and A ccounts 2018 Notes to the financial statements continued 31 Signi cant accounting policies continued 31.6 Impairment of tangible and intangible assets At each reporting date the Group assesses whether there are any indications that an asset has been impaired.
If any indication exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount of the asset is made which is determined as the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
These calculations are determined for an individual asset unless that asset does not generate cash in ows independently from other assets, in which case its value is determined as part of that group of assets.
To assess the value in use, estimated future cash ows relating to the asset are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that re ects current market assessment of the time value of money and risks speci c to the asset.
Where the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered to be impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
a Impairment of goodwill Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated against the appropriate combination of business units deemed to obtain advantage from the bene ts acquired with the goodwill.
These are designated as cash generating units CGU.
Impairment is then assessed by comparing the recoverable amount of the relevant CGU with the carrying value of the CGUs goodwill.
Recoverable amount is measured as the higher of the CGUs fair value less cost to sell and the value in use.
Where the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
An impairment loss for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
b Impairment of tangible and other intangible assets If any indication of a potential impairment exists, the recoverable amount is estimated to determine the extent of any impairment loss.
Assets are grouped together for this purpose at the lowest level for which there are separately identi able cash ows.
c Research and development costs Research expenditure is expensed in the income statement as incurred.
Expenditure on development which represents the application of research to the development of new products or processes is capitalised provided that speci c projects are identi able, technically feasible, and the Group has suf cient resources to complete development.
The useful life of projects meeting the criteria for capitalisation is determined on a project by project basis.
Capitalised development expenditure is measured at cost and amortised over its expected useful life on a straight-line basis.
Other development costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
If an event occurs after the recognition of an impairment that leads to a decrease in the amount of the impairment loss previously recognised the impairment loss is reversed.
The reversal is recognised in the income statement to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date.
31.7 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes all costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition.
Raw materials, consumables stores and nished goods for sale are stated at purchase cost on a first in first out basis.
Work in progress and nished goods are stated at the cost of direct materials and labour plus attributable overheads allocated on a systematic basis based on a normal level of activity.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less the estimated costs of completion and sale or disposal.
31.8 Taxation Corporation tax is provided on taxable pro ts from activities not qualifying for tonnage tax relief and is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected corporation tax payable or receivable in respect of the taxable pro t for the year using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, less any adjustments to tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities included in the financial statements and the amounts used for tax purposes, that will result in an obligation to pay more, a right to pay less or to receive more tax, with the following exceptions: No provision is made where a deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affect neither accounting nor taxable pro t: and No provision is made for deferred tax that would arise on all taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the Directors consider that it is probable that there will be suitable taxable pro ts from which the future reversal of the underlying temporary differences and unused tax losses and credits can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset is expected to be realised or liability settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax arising on actuarial gains and losses relating to fide ned bene t pension funds is recorded in other comprehensive income.
Where the cash contributions made to the schemes exceed the service costs recognised in the income statement the current tax arising is recorded in other comprehensive income.
31.9 Leases A lease arrangement under which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership rest with the lessee are classi ed as finance leases and capitalised at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the related item or the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and a reduction in the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are expensed to the income statement.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful life of the asset.
All other leases are classi ed as operating leases and rentals payable are charged to the income statement on a straightline basis over the lease term.
In preparation for the adoption of IFRS 16, Leases, in the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2019, management are in the process of assessing the potential impact.
114 J ames F isher and S ons plc A nnual R eport and A ccounts 2018 31 Signi cant accounting policies continued 31.10 Pension plans i fide ned contribution schemes Pre-determined contributions paid to a separate privately administered pension plan are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Other than this contribution the Group has no further legal or constructive obligation to make further contributions to the scheme.
ii fide ned bene t schemes A fide ned bene t scheme is a pension plan under which the amount of pension bene t that an employee receives on retirement is fide ned by reference to factors including age, years of service and compensation.
The schemes are funded by payments determined by periodic actuarial calculations agreed between the Group and the trustees of trustee-administered funds.
The cost of providing bene ts is determined using the projected unit credit method, which attributes entitlement to bene ts to the current period current service cost and to current and prior periods to determine the present value of the fide ned bene t obligation.
Current service costs are recognised in the income statement in the current year.
Past service costs are recognised in the income statement immediately.
When a settlement which eliminates all obligations for bene ts already accrued or a curtailment which reduces future obligations as a result of a reduction in future entitlement occurs, the obligation and related plan assets are re-measured using current actuarial assumptions and any gain or loss is recognised in the income statement.
The interest element of the fide ned bene t charge is determined by applying the discount rate to the net fide ned bene t liability at the start of the period and is recognised in the income statement.
A liability is recognised in the statement of financial position which represents the present value of the fide ned bene t obligations at the balance sheet date, less the fair value of the scheme assets and is calculated separately for each scheme.
The fide ned bene t obligations represent the estimated amount of future bene ts that employees have earned in return for their services in current and prior periods, discounted at a rate representing the yield on a high quality corporate bond at the balance sheet date, denominated in the same currency as the obligations, and having the same terms to maturity as the related pension liability, applied to the estimated future cash out ows arising from these obligations.
When the calculation results in a bene t to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the total of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of economic bene ts available from any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
When the bene ts of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased bene t related to past service by employees is recognised in pro t or loss on a straightline basis over the average period until the bene ts become vested.
To the extent that the bene ts vest immediately, the expense is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Actuarial gains and losses on experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income.
31.11 Share based payments Executive share option schemes are operated under which options are granted to employees of the Group.
An expense is recognised in the income statement with a corresponding credit to equity in respect of the fair value of employee services rendered in exchange for options granted, which is determined by the fair value of the option at the date of grant.
The amount is expensed over a speci ed period until the options can be exercised the vesting period.
The fair value of an option is determined by the use of mathematical modelling techniques, including the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the Binomial model.
Non-market vesting conditions such as pro tability and growth targets are excluded from the fair value calculation but included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
An estimate is made of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable at each balance sheet date.
Any adjustments to the original estimates are recognised in the income statement and equity over the remaining vesting period with any element of any adjustments relating to prior periods recognised in the current period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition such as total shareholder return of the Group relative to an index.
These are treated as vested irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satis ed, provided that all other performance conditions are satis ed.
In addition to failure by the employee to exercise an option in accordance with the exercise period allowed by the scheme, an award made to an employee under a share option scheme is deemed to lapse when either the scheme is cancelled by the Company, or when an employee, who continues to qualify for membership of a scheme, ceases to pay contributions to that scheme.
In these circumstances the full remaining unexpired cost of the award is expensed in the period in which the option lapses.
Where the exercise of options is satis ed by the issue of shares by the Company, the nominal value of any shares issued from the exercise of options is credited to share capital with the balance of the proceeds received, net of transaction costs, credited to share premium.
31.12 Short-term employee bene ts The Group recognises a liability and an expense for short-term employee bene ts, including bonuses, only when contractually or constructively obliged.
31.13 Share capital and reserves Ordinary shares are classi ed as equity.
Costs attributable to the issue of new shares are deducted from equity from the proceeds.
a Treasury shares Shares issued by the Company which are held by the Company or its subsidiary entities including the Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT, are designated as treasury shares.
The cost of these shares is deducted from equity.
No gains or losses are recognised on the purchase, sale, cancellation or issue of treasury shares.
Consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity.

The finance costs and administration costs relating to the ESOP are charged to the income statement.
Dividend income arising on own shares is excluded in arriving at pro t before taxation and deducted from aggregate dividends paid.
The Group maintains the following reserves: Translation reserve The translation reserve comprises all foreign currency differences arising from the translation of operations whose financial statements are denominated in foreign currencies as well as from the translation of liabilities that hedge the Companys net investment in a foreign subsidiary.
Hedging reserve The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash ow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred.
31.14 Revenue recognition IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers accounting policy applied since 1 January 2018 Following the adoption of IFRS 15, the Groups accounting policy in respect of revenue is as follows: Revenue represents income derived from contracts for the provision of goods and services by the Company and its subsidiary undertakings to customers in exchange for consideration in the ordinary course of the Groups activities.
Performance obligations Upon approval by the parties to a contract, the contract is assessed to identify each promise to transfer either a distinct good or service or a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer.
Goods and services are distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations in the contract if the customer can bene t from them either on their own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and they are separately identi able in the contract.
Transaction price At the start of the contract, the total transaction price is estimated as the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods and services to the customer, excluding sales taxes.
Variable consideration, such as price escalation, is included based on the expected value or most likely amount only to the extent that it is highly probable that there will not be a reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised.
The transaction price does not include estimates of consideration resulting from contract modi cations, such as change orders, until they have been approved by the parties to the contract.
The total transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations identi ed in the contract in proportion to their relative stand-alone selling prices where appropriate.
Given the bespoke nature of many of the Groups products and services, which are designed and or manufactured under contract to the customers individual speci cations, there are typically no observable stand-alone selling prices.
In such cases, stand-alone selling prices are typically estimated based on expected costs plus contract margin consistent with the Groups pricing principles.
Revenue and pro t recognition Revenue is recognised as performance obligations are satis ed as control of the goods and services is transferred to the customer.
For each performance obligation within a contract, the Group determines whether it is satis ed over time or at a point in time.
Performance obligations are satis ed over time if one of the following criteria is satis ed: the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the bene ts provided by the Groups performance as it performs: the Groups performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced: or the Groups performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group and it has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.
Contracts that satisfy the over time criteria primarily occur in the Groups Specialist Technical business, either because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the bene ts provided by the Groups performance as it performs typically services or support contracts or the Groups performance does not create an asset with an alternative use and it has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date typically production contracts.
For each performance obligation to be recognised over time, the Group typically recognises revenue using an input method, based on costs incurred in the period.
Revenue and attributable margin are calculated by reference to reliable estimates of transaction price and total expected costs, after making suitable allowances for technical and other risks.
Revenue and associated margin are therefore recognised progressively as costs are incurred.
If the over time criteria for revenue recognition are not met, revenue is recognised at the point in time that control is transferred to the customer, which is usually when legal title passes to the customer and the business has the right to payment, for example, on delivery.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised immediately as an expense.
Bid costs All pre-contract bidding costs which are incurred irrespective of whether the contract is awarded relating to the design, manufacture or operation of assets or the provision of services are expensed when incurred.
Warranty costs Provision is made for warranties offered with products where it is probable that an obligation to transfer economic bene ts to the customer in future will arise.
This provision is based on managements assessment of the previous history of claims and probability of future obligations arising on a product by product basis.
Provisions for warranty costs are set out in note 20.

Revenue is recognised in the income statement on a straightline basis over the period of the hire.
31.15 Other investments Other investments are recognised at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Impairment losses on initial classi cation as held for sale are included in pro t or loss, as are any gains and losses on subsequent remeasurement.
31.16 Intra-group financial instruments Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtness of other companies within the Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such.
In this respect the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
32 Signi cant accounting judgements and estimates In preparing these consolidated financial statements, management has made judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the Groups accounting policies and the reported amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
The outcome may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed and revised on an on-going basis.
a Judgements Information about judgements made in applying accounting policies that have the most signi cant effects on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements is included below: Impairment of goodwill Goodwill, which is set out in note 12, of 171.4m 2017: 174.6m is tested annually for any permanent impairment in accordance with the accounting policy in note 31.6.
The value in use of the Groups cash generating units CGU requires assumptions about future levels of demand, gross margins and cost in ation.
Inherent uncertainty involved in forecasting and discounting future cash ows is a key area of judgement.
If indicators of impairment exist the carrying value of goodwill is compared to its recoverable amount which represents the higher of the net present value of the CGUs forecast cash ow and its carrying value.
The assessment also includes sensitivity analysis to identify the range of outcomes and the validity of underlying assumptions.
In the current year it is not expected that there is a risk of material misstatement based on these assessments.
Business combinations Business combinations are set out in note 23 and the Group makes an assessment of the fair values of the assets and liabilities arising in a business combination and of any related contingent consideration.
Judgement is applied in assessing appropriate fair values of the assets and liabilities required, identifying any intangible assets of the acquired business and in estimating the likelihood of contingent targets being achieved during the relevant period.
The outcome of contingent consideration arrangements depends on a number of factors outside the control of the business including, but not limited to competition, general economic conditions and the availability of resources within the business to meet its obligations to its customers.
The Group regularly assesses the likelihood of the targets being achieved during the performance period and makes appropriate adjustments to the provision for contingent consideration through the income statement.
The Group uses a discounted cash ow analysis to assess the value of contingent consideration.
Revenue Revenue is set out in notes 4 and 31.14.
Revenue is recognised when the signi cant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and recovery of the consideration is probable.
The timing of the performance obligations will vary depending on the terms of the sales agreement, the evaluation of the speci c risks associated with the performance of the contract for example design, construction and testing or generally accepted practice where there are no speci c arrangements in the contract.
Areas of judgement relate to construction contract accounting and speci cally estimating the stage of completion and forecast outturn of the contract.
Income taxes Taxation is set out in notes 8, 9 and 31.8.
The Group is subject to income taxes in several jurisdictions.
Signi cant judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes.
There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax risk issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due.
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such difference will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.
The Group has entered the UK tonnage tax regime under which tax on its ship owning and operating activities is based on the net tonnage of vessels operated.
Income and pro ts outside this regime are taxed under normal tax rules.
This means that it is necessary to make estimates of the allocation of some income and expenses between tonnage and non-tonnage tax activities.
These estimates are subject to agreement with the relevant tax authorities and may be revised in future periods.
Operating in overseas jurisdictions The Group operates in emerging markets which increases contractual, operational and financial risk with potentially uncertain or changing regulatory and political environments.
This is referred to in the Groups principal risks and uncertainties on page 25 and in note 26.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements the management form a judgement about the risk of exchange control regulations, political stability, potential changes to tax regimes and operating environments.

33 Changes in signi cant accounting policies A. IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers The Group adopted IFRS 15 on 1 January 2018 using the fully retrospective method, utilising the practical expedients available: a Expedient 1 Contracts started and completed in the same annual reporting period.
An entity need not restate completed contracts that begin and end in the same annual reporting period : b Expedient 1A Further, an entity can elect not to restate contracts that are completed contracts at the beginning of the earliest period presented : c Expedient 2 That allows an entity to use the transaction price at the date on which the contract was completed, rather than estimating the variable consideration amounts in each comparative reporting period : d Expedient 3 An entity need not separately evaluate the effect of contract modi cations before the start of the earliest reporting period presented: and e Expedient 4 An entity does not need to disclose for reporting periods presented before the date of initial application: Amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations: and An explanation of when it expects to recognise the revenue.
Two revenue streams were identi ed as requiring Group policy change to align with IFRS 15.
These were the rendering of services and delivery of construction contracts.
The main revenue streams within the Group are: Sale of goods Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of the goods.
Based on the Groups assessment, the application of IFRS 15 has not resulted in a signi cant impact.
Construction contracts Under IFRS 15 performance obligations in contracts with customers are identi ed and the total contract value is allocated to each of the performance obligations identi ed.
Revenue is recognised as each performance obligation is satis ed.
For some of the goods that the Group provides, the customer controls all of the work in progress as the products are manufactured, or the goods manufactured are of a specialised nature.
The revenue from these contracts will be recognised as the products are manufactured.
Revenue and some associated costs, for these contracts are recognised over time i. e. before the goods are delivered to the customers premises.
Rendering of services The Group is involved in providing a range of services including submarine rescue services.
The transfer of control is assumed to pass to the customer on delivery of the goods or completion of the provision of the relevant services.
Under IFRS 15, the total consideration in the service contracts is allocated to all services based on their stand-alone prices.
The stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the list prices at which the Group sells such services in separate transactions.
The impact due to these changes is set out below.
Line items that are not affected by the changes have not been included.
As a result, the sub-totals and totals disclosed cannot be recalculated from the numbers provided.
Year ended 31 December 2017 Reported Adjustments Restated m m m Revenue 505.4 6.1 499.3 Cost of sales 350.9 4.3 346.6 Gross profit 154.5 1.8 152.7 Administrative expenses 100.4 0.1 100.3 Share of posttax results of joint ventures 1.7 1.7 Acquisition related income and expense 1.3 1.3 Operating profit 54.5 1.7 52.8 Net finance expense 5.5 5.5 Profit before taxation 49.0 1.7 47.3 Income tax 8.3 0.4 7.9 Profit for the period 40.7 1.3 39.4 118 J ames F isher and S ons plc A nnual R eport and A ccounts 2018 33 Changes in signi cant accounting policies continued The main impact of IFRS 15 is within Specialist Technical on long-term contracts.
Under IAS 11, revenue under long-term contracts was recognised using the percentage of completion method.
The Group has determined that, within Specialist Technical, the performance obligations identi ed in a number of contracts will satisfy the criteria in IFRS 15 for recognition over time.
As result under IFRS 15, it is no longer deemed appropriate to recognise signi cant work in progress as an asset on the Groups balance sheet and consequently the Group will recognise revenue based on costs incurred re ecting the continuous transfer of the bene t of the Groups performance to the customer.
Year ended 31 December 2017 Reported Adjustments Restated m m m Non-current assets Deferred tax assets 3.2 1.1 4.3 Current assets Inventories 52.1 4.9 47.2 Trade and other receivables 201.9 2.6 199.3 Total assets 618.6 6.4 612.2 Current liabilities Trade and other payables 132.7 0.8 133.5 Net assets 286.2 7.2 279.0 The impact on the Groups retained earnings at 31 December 2016 is a reduction of 5.9m relating to the elimination of bid costs 0.4m, rendering of services 1.0m, recognition of revenue over time 5.2m offset by deferred taxation 0.7m.
The impact was to reduce the 2017 basic earnings per share by 1.9p, and the diluted earnings per share by 1.8p.
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers accounting policy applied since 1 January 2018 Following the adoption of IFRS 15, the Groups accounting policy in respect of revenue is as follows: Revenue represents income derived from contracts for the provision of goods and services by the Company and its subsidiary undertakings to customers in exchange for consideration in the ordinary course of the Groups activities.

B. IFRS Financial Instruments IFRS 9 Financial Instruments became effective on 1 January 2018.
This standard replaces IAS 39 and introduces new requirements for classifying and measuring financial instruments and puts in place a new hedge accounting model that is designed to be more closely aligned with how entities undertake risk management activities when hedging financial and nonfinancial risk exposures.
IFRS 9 has been implemented prospectively from 1 January 2018 and the impact on the Group has been not been material.
Expected Credit Loss Note 31.3 e describes the expected ECL.
The Group has not historically suffered signi cant levels of write offs and a review has concluded that the current level of provision is considered appropriate.
Hedge accounting The Group has elected to adopt the new General Hedge Accounting Model under IFRS 9 which requires that hedge accounting relationships are in line with its management objectives and strategy.
The Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge against the variability in cash ows in foreign exchange rates relating to sales and receivables.
Only the change in fair value of the spot element of the forward contracts is designated as the hedging instrument in cash ow hedging relationships.
The effective portion of changes in fair value of hedging instruments is held in a cash ow hedge reserve as a separate component of equity.
Re-classi cation of assets held for sale as other investment Following the transition to IFRS 9, in respect of the interest in Britannias Gold Limited BGL and SEML fide Co-operation Transmanche the Group has elected to present subsequent changes to the fair value of these investments in the consolidated OCI.
The investments are not part of the Groups core operational activities.
The investments are in unquoted entities and held at fair value see note 16.
These investments were previously classi ed as Available for Sale investments.
No dividends were received in the period in respect of these investments.
In relation to the interest in BGL a fair value adjustment was made through the OCI during the year.
Transition The Group has taken the exemption not to restate comparative periods.
All hedging relationships designated under IAS 39 met the conditions to apply hedge accounting under IFRS 9.
34 Standards issued but not yet effective The Group is required to adopt IFRS 16 Leases from 1 January 2019, and has performed an initial assessment of the estimated impact that initial application of IFRS 16 will have on its consolidated financial statements.
The actual impacts of adopting the standard on 1 January 2019 may change because the new accounting policies are subject to change until the Group presents its first financial statements that include the date of application.
IFRS 16 introduces a single, on-balance sheet lease accounting model for lessees.
A lessee recognises a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments.
There are recognition exemptions for short-term leases and leases of lowvalue items.
Lessor accounting remains similar to the current standard i. e. lessors continue to classify leases as finance or operating leases.
IFRS 16 replaces existing leases guidance, including IAS 17 Leases, and IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease.
Leases in which the Group is a lessee The Group will recognise new right-of-use assets and liabilities for some its of ces, operating leases of warehouse, vessels and factory facilities see note 28.
The nature of expenses related to those leases will now change because the Group will recognise a depreciation charge for right-of-use assets and interest expense on lease liabilities.
The interest charge will be higher in the earlier years of the lease term, but the total expense recognised in the Income Statement over the life of the lease will be unaffected by this new standard.
It will, however, result in the timing of leases expense recognition being accelerated for leases currently accounted for as operating leases.
Previously, the Group recognised operating lease expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, and recognised assets and liabilities only to the extent that there was a timing difference between lease payments and the expense recognised.
There will be no impact on cash ows, but the presentation of the Cash Flow Statement will change with an increase in cash in ows from operating activities offset by an increase in cash out ows from nancing activities.
The Group plans to apply IFRS 16 initially on 1 January 2019, using the modi ed retrospective approach.
Therefore, the cumulative effect of adopting IFRS 16 will be recognised with no restatement of comparative information.
The Group plans to apply the practical expedient to grandfather the fide nition of a lease on transition.
This means that it will apply IFRS 16 to contracts entered into before 1 January 2019 and identi ed as leases in accordance with IAS 17 and IFRIC 4.
At 31 December 2018 the Group has operating lease commitments of 38.2m, and the initial recognition of asset and liability is not expected to exceed this.
