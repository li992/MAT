DAEJAN HOLDINGS PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2018 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Significant Accounting Policies Daejan Holdings PLC is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2018 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issuance on 20 July 2018. a Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU IFRS and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland and these are presented on pages 88 to 92. b Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, the Companys functional currency and the Groups presentational currency, rounded to the nearest thousand.
They are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value: investment property, derivative financial instruments and current asset investments.
The Group has considerable financial resources and very low gearing and therefore, the Directors consider that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully in the current and foreseeable economic conditions.
Consequently, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least twelve months from the date of approving this Annual Report and Accounts.
Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
To facilitate comparisons with most other major UK listed property groups, the consolidated statement of cash flows on page 61 has been presented using the indirect method: no restatement of prior year numbers was required.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the events or amounts involved, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The areas involving a higher degree of complexity, judgement or estimation are set out in Note 1 u on pages 66 and 67.
Page 62 DAEJAN HOLDINGS PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2018 The accounting policies set out in this Note 1 have been applied consistently throughout the Group to all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements, except as described below.
Accounting standard changes The following accounting standards and guidance were adopted by the Group during the year, none of which has had a material impact on the Groups financial statements: Amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures Amendments to IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows Amendments to IAS 12 Income taxes The following standards, amendments to standards and interpretations relevant to the Group have been issued but are not yet effective.
None of these have been early-adopted by the Group and, based on the Groups ongoing assessment of each of them, none are expected to have a material impact on the Groups financial statements.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments effective year ended 31 March 2019 IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements amendment IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers effective year ended 31 March 2019 IFRS 16 Leases effective year ended 31 March 2020 IAS 19 Employee Benefits amendment IAS 23 Borrowing Costs amendment IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures amendment IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets amendment IAS 38 Intangible Assets amendment IAS 40 Investment Property amendment IFRIC 22 Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration In relation to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, the effect of any change to the Groups current accounting policies covering the measurement of financial instruments and the estimation of impairment is expected to be immaterial.
In relation to IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, the Groups revenue primarily relates to property rental income which is outside the scope of IFRS 15.
In relation to IFRS 16 Leases, the Group is primarily a lessor whereas the standard primarily affects lessees.
The Groups assessment of the impact of IFRS 16 is ongoing.
c Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to direct relevant activities of an entity and an exposure to variable returns so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable are taken into account.
d Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
e Income available for distribution Under the articles of association of certain Group investment undertakings, realised capital surpluses are not available for distribution as dividends.
Page 63 DAEJAN HOLDINGS PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2018 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued f Foreign currency translation The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated to sterling at rates approximating to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange differences arising on re-translation are recognised directly in a separate component of equity.
The cumulative translation difference for all foreign operations was deemed to be zero as at the date of transition to IFRS.
The year end and average rates used for these purposes were as follows: Year end Average 2018 2017 2018 2017 US Dollar 1.40 1.25 1.33 1.31 g Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk arising from operational and financing activities.
As these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, they are accounted for as trading instruments.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised, and subsequently recorded, at fair value.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would recover or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the credit worthiness of the swap counterparties.
The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
h Investment property IFRS defines investment properties as those which are held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or both.
All of the Groups property falls within this definition.
Investment property is initially recognised at cost and subsequently recorded at fair value.
External, independent valuation firms having appropriate recognised professional qualifications and recent relevant experience in the location and category of property being valued, value the portfolio annually at the Companys year end.
The fair values are based on market values, being the estimated amount for which a property could be exchanged on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arms length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.
The valuations are prepared either by considering the aggregate of the net annual operating income from the properties using a market yield capitalisation rate which reflects the risks inherent in the net cash flow which is then applied to the net annual operating income, or on a sales comparison basis.
Any gains or losses arising from a change in fair value are recognised in the income statement.
When the Group begins to redevelop an existing investment property for continued future use as an investment property, the property continues to be treated as an investment property, and is measured based on the fair value model.
Interest is capitalised on such developments to the extent that such interest is directly attributable to the cost of redevelopment.
A property interest under an operating lease is classified and accounted for as an investment property on a property-by-property basis when the Group holds it to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both.
Any such property interest under an operating lease classified as an investment property is carried at fair value.
Where material, the aggregate present value of the minimum future lease payments under such leases is recognised as a liability.
Acquisitions and disposals are recognised on the date that the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.
Any resulting gain or loss based on the difference between sale proceeds and valuation is included in the income statement and taxation applicable thereto is shown as part of the taxation charge.
Page 64 DAEJAN HOLDINGS PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2018 i Current investments Investments comprise equity securities and other investments held for trading and classified as current assets stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in the income statement.
j Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are initially stated at fair value and subsequently carried at cost less an allowance for impairment.
These assets are not discounted as the effect is deemed immaterial.
k Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and short term deposits.
These short term deposits are highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management.
Bank overdrafts when utilised are therefore included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
l Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved.
m Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are initially stated at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost.
n Net rental income Net rental income comprises rent and service charges receivable less applicable provisions and costs associated with the properties.
Rental income from investment property leased out under operating leases is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the certain term of the lease.
Lease incentives granted are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income.
If a rent review is due but not yet agreed with the tenant any expected rent increase is only recognised when receipt is highly probable.
Service charge income is recognised as the services are provided.
Net rental income is stated net of recoverable VAT.
The cost of repairs is written off to the income statement in the year in which the expenditure was incurred.
Lease payments under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
o Dividend income Dividend income is recognised in the income statement on the date the entitys right to receive payments is established which, in the case of quoted securities, is the ex-dividend date.
p Taxation Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
The tax charge for the year is recognised in the income statement, the statement of comprehensive income or directly in equity, depending on the accounting treatment of the related transaction.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Page 65 DAEJAN HOLDINGS PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2018 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities which, in the case of investment property, is assumed to be through sale, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
q Segmental reporting The Company has identified its operating segments on the basis of those components of the Group which engage in business activities from which they may earn revenues and incur expenses and for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker in order to allocate resources and assess performance.
The Group has determined the Chief Operating Decision Maker to be the Board of Directors.
r Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets, other than investment property see Note 1 h and deferred tax assets see Note 1 p, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists the assets recoverable amount is estimated and an impairment loss recognised whenever the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and its value-inuse.
The value-in-use is determined as the net present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset, discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
s Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
t Loans and borrowings Floating rate and fixed rate loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently recorded at amortised cost.
Transaction costs are deducted from the fair value at recognition and any differences between the amount initially recognised and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest rate basis.
When mortgages are refinanced, any redemption costs are immediately recognised in the income statement.
u Significant judgements, key assumptions and estimates The Groups significant accounting policies are set out in 1 a to 1 t on pages 62 to 66.
Not all of these policies require management to make subjective or complex judgements or estimates.
The following is intended to provide further detail relating to those accounting policies that management consider particularly significant because of the level of complexity and estimation involved in their application and their impact on the consolidated financial statements.
Page 66 DAEJAN HOLDINGS PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2018 i Property valuations The valuation of the Groups property portfolio is inherently subjective, depending on many factors, including the individual nature of each property, its location and expected future net rental values, market yields and comparable market transactions as set out in Note 9.
Therefore the valuations are subject to a degree of uncertainty and are made on the basis of assumptions which may not prove to be accurate, particularly in periods of difficult market or economic conditions.
As noted in Note 1 h, all the Groups properties are valued by external valuers with appropriate qualifications and experience.
ii Income taxes The tax treatment of some transactions and calculations cannot be determined until a formal resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authorities.
In particular, the Group is discussing the treatment of historical financing arrangements with tax authorities as set out in Note 6.
In such cases, a best estimate of the relevant tax charge or credit is made, having regard to the extent of uncertainties associated with it.
Where the final outcome of such matters is different from the amounts initially recorded, those differences will be reflected in the income and deferred taxes amounts at the time of formal resolution.
Page 67 DAEJAN HOLDINGS PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2018 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 2.
Segmental Analysis The Group is managed through two discrete geographical divisions and has only one product or service, being investment in property for the generation of rental income and or capital appreciation.
This is reflected in the Groups structure and in the segment information reviewed by the Board.

In the UK, the average number of staff provided by the property and administrative management companies who performed roles for the Group totalled 206 2017 203.
The average number of full time equivalents whose staff costs were borne by the Group during the year was 149 2017 143.
The aggregate staff cost of these persons is shown above and can be analysed as follows: 2018 2017 000 000 Salaries 5,779 5,492 NI contributions 626 593 Pensions 909 713 7,314 6,798 In addition the property and administrative management companies provide, under agency arrangements, staff to perform various caretaking roles.
Those costs totalling 1,058,000 2017 1,037,000 are included within property operating expenses Note 3 under porterage, cleaning and repairs.
Details of Directors remuneration are set out in the Remuneration Committee Report.
Financial Income and Expenses 2018 2017 000 000 Financial income: Bank interest receivable 41 44 Other financial income 540 455 581 499 Financial expenses: Interest payable on bank loans 3,136 3,053 Interest payable on mortgages 9,479 10,466 Other interest payable 179 13 12,794 13,532 Page 70 DAEJAN HOLDINGS PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2018 6.
Taxation Taxation based on the profit for the year of the Company and its subsidiaries: 2018 2017 000 000 UK corporation tax 7,787 8,026 UK prior year items 382 751 7,405 8,777 Overseas taxation 1,598 808 Total current tax 9,003 9,585 Deferred tax 29,248 33,830 Deferred tax reduction in future tax rate 39,947 7,149 Total deferred tax 10,699 26,681 Total tax credit charge 1,696 36,266 Reconciliation of tax expense Profit before taxation 201,262 198,396 Corporation tax at the standard UK rate of 19% 2017 20% 38,240 39,679 Reduction in future tax rate 39,947 7,149 Prior year items 382 751 Impact of different tax rates 2,708 6,582 Indexation and non-taxable items 2,850 3,426 Other 535 171 Total tax credit charge 1,696 36,266 Legislation changes have been enacted that mean the UK Corporation tax rate will reduce from 19% to 17% from 1 April 2020 and the USA Corporation tax rate will reduce from 35% in the current year to 21% next year.
With USA State taxes our applicable overall tax rate on USA profits is 40% in the current year and will be 28% next year.
These enacted rate changes will reduce the Groups tax charge accordingly.
The deferred tax balances at 31 March 2018 have been calculated based on the 17% rate in the UK and the 28% rate in the USA.
The Groups effective tax rate for the current year was 0.8% credit 2017: 18.3% charge.
As set out in the tables above the current year benefitted from a 39,947,000 tax credit from the recalculation of our USA deferred tax balances based on the newly enacted USA Corporation tax rate.
Removing this tax credit our effective tax rate is 19%, a rate consistent with the UK Corporation tax rate and the prior year.
The increased tax charge from our profits arising in the USA that are subject to a higher Corporation tax rate has been offset by an element of our UK property valuations not being taxable due to an indexation allowance.
Tax liabilities are recognised when it is considered probable that there will be a future outflow of funds to a tax authority.
In assessing the amount of tax due the Group uses professional advisers in both the UK and the USA to assist in assessing tax due on open tax computations.
The principal uncertain tax item relates to enquiries opened by HMRC relating to the interpretation of tax legislation regarding historical financing arrangements that had been entered into over several years in the ordinary course of business but have now ceased.
On advice of leading Counsel, we continue Page 71 DAEJAN HOLDINGS PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2018 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued actively to dispute the assessments from HMRC but at present we estimate the probable range of outcomes of the tax which may become due is 23 to 52 million.
The directors have made an accrual for tax which is within this range, included within the current tax liability and which is in their view an adequate estimate of potential tax that might arise.
An accrual has also been made for potential interest.
Due to the uncertainty associated with such items, it is possible that at a future date, on reaching a conclusion on these open tax matters, the final outcome may vary significantly.
Earnings per Share Earnings per share is calculated on the earnings, after taxation and non-controlling interests, of 202,889,000 2017 161,779,000 and the weighted average shares in issue during the year of 16,295,357 2017 16,295,357.
Dividends 2018 2017 000 000 Amounts recognised as distributions to equity holders in the year: Final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2016, paid 11 November 2016 @ 58p per share 9,452 Interim dividend for the year ended 31 March 2017, paid 10 March 2017 @ 35p per share 5,703 Final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2017, paid 10 November 2017 @ 63p per share 10,266 Interim dividend for the year ended 31 March 2018, paid 9 March 2018 @ 35p per share 5,703 15,969 15,155 The Board has recommended a final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2018 of 11,081,000, representing 68p per share.
This dividend has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.
Investment Property Long Short Total Total Freehold leasehold leasehold 2018 2017 000 000 000 000 000 Balance at 1 April 1,862,619 368,938 25,243 2,256,800 2,009,361 Disposals 1,975 2,159 4,134 1,192 New acquisitions 1,069 1,069 472 Additions to existing properties 38,832 736 39,568 29,706 Revaluation recognised in profit 143,786 5,549 2,897 146,438 144,508 Foreign exchange movements recognised in other comprehensive income 57,202 9,355 66,557 73,945 Balance at 31 March 1,987,129 363,709 22,346 2,373,184 2,256,800 External, independent professional valuations of all the Groups UK investment properties were carried out by Colliers International Property Advisers UK LLP, RICS Registered Valuers at 31 March Page 72 DAEJAN HOLDINGS PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2018 2018.
The aggregate amount of 1,799.3 million 2017 1,668.6 million is based on open market values, assessed in accordance with the RICS Valuation Professional Standards 2014.
The Groups USA investment properties were also independently professionally valued at 31 March 2018 by Joseph J. Blake and Associates, Inc. and Metropolitan Valuation Services, Inc. both USA Certified General Real Estate Appraisers.
The aggregate amount of 592.4 million 2017 602.5 million is based on open market values, assessed in accordance with the Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice of the Appraisal Institute.
All three valuers have recent experience in the location and category of the property being valued.
The aggregate professional valuations included in the above table have been reduced by an amount of 18.6 million 2017 14.3 million, relating to lease incentives included in Trade and other receivables.
As explained in Note 1 u i, property valuations are inherently subjective, depending on many factors, including the individual nature of each property, its location and expected future net rental values, market yields and comparable market transactions.
These fair value measurements are unrealised and classified as Level 3 as defined by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
There have been no transfers between the levels of fair value hierarchy during the year.
During the year 1.9 million 2017 1.0 million of unrealised property revaluation recognised in prior years was realised through the sale of properties, this is included in the underlying profit calculation on page 20.
Valuation techniques and key inputs We set out the valuation techniques used below and the key inputs used in these valuation techniques are set out in the tables over the page.
UK commercial property was valued using the income capitalisation method, requiring the application of the appropriate market based yield to net operating income.
Adjustments are made to allow for voids when less than five years are left under the current tenancy and to reflect market rent at the point of lease expiry or rent review.
Estimated fair value is sensitive to and would increase if either net operating income increased or estimated yield decreased.
UK residential property was valued using a sales valuation approach, derived from recent comparable transactions in the market, adjusted by applying discounts to reflect status of occupation and condition.
The largest discounts for the status of occupation were applied to those properties subject to registered tenancies, reflecting the relative difference in security of tenure, whilst the smallest discounts were applied to those properties subject to assured shorthold tenancies.
The base discount for condition was maintained at 10% in 2018 reflecting current estimates of costs being incurred.
It is estimated that an increase of one percentage point in this discount would result in a decrease of 8.6 million in the value of investment property.
Estimated fair value is sensitive to and would increase if the sales values increased.
USA commercial and residential properties excluding co-operative apartments have been valued using the application of a capitalisation rate, based on recent arms length transactions, to an assessment of stabilised net income, and for residential properties the values are cross-checked to recent comparative sales evidence.
USA commercial and residential estimated fair value is sensitive to and would increase if either capitalisation rates decreased or estimated rental values increased.
USA co-operative residential apartments have been valued using the application of a discount rate, based on recent arms length transactions, to an assessment of net income over the period to full reversion, cross-checked to recent comparative sales evidence.
USA unsold co-operative residential apartments estimated fair value is sensitive to and would increase if either discount rates decreased, estimated rental values increased or estimated sales values increased.
Movements in more than one input having the effect of increasing fair value could give rise to a magnifying effect on the valuation.
Due to the number of properties included in the Groups valuations, it is impracticable to disclose the extent of the possible effects of each assumption and it is possible that outcomes that are different from the current assumptions could result in a material adjustment to the valuation.

The Groups interest rate swaps are set out in Note 16 on page 83.
The interest rate profile of the Groups fixed rate mortgages was as follows: 2018 2017 000 000 Per cent.
Financial Assets and Liabilities The Groups financial instruments are analysed into categories as follows: 2018 2017 Financing Financing Carrying income Carrying income amount expense amount expense 000 000 000 000 Current asset investments 158 6 162 Current assets at fair value 158 6 162 Derivative financial instruments 1,161 1,923 3,084 86 Current liabilities at fair value 1,161 1,923 3,084 86 Trade and other receivables 62,714 540 65,062 455 Cash and cash equivalents 98,752 41 84,283 44 Current assets at amortised cost 161,466 581 149,345 499 Trade and other payables 51,328 179 48,276 13 Floating rate loans and borrowings 100,937 3,414 80,228 3,053 Fixed rate loans and borrowings 249,522 9,201 272,311 10,466 Current and non-current liabilities at amortised cost 401,787 12,794 400,815 13,532 Total financial instruments 241,324 10,284 254,392 12,947 The finance income of 1,923,000 2017: 86,000 relating to derivative financial instruments is stated net of 35,000 expense 2017: 35,000 income relating to credit risk movements.
Fair values of financial instruments With the exception of fixed rate loans and borrowings, the Groups financial instruments are shown in the table above at fair value.
Fixed rate loans and borrowings are stated at amortised cost as shown in the table above and as explained in Note 1 t. The fair value of fixed rate loans and borrowings was 260,155,000 2017 287,351,000.
At both the current and preceding year end there were no non-recurring fair value measurements.
The Group does not hedge account and all its interest rate swaps are initially recognised, and subsequently recorded, at fair value, with any movement being recorded in the consolidated income statement.
The fair values of all interest rate swaps and fixed rate loans and borrowings are determined by reference to observable inputs that are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy set out in IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
Fair values have been determined by discounting expected future cash flows using market interest rates and yield curves over the remaining term of the instrument, as adjusted to reflect the credit risk attributable to the Group and, where relevant, its counterparty.
Page 80 DAEJAN HOLDINGS PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2018 Financial instrument risk management In common with all businesses, the Group is exposed to the following types of risk which arise from its use of financial instruments: Credit risk Liquidity risk Market risk This note presents information about the nature of the Groups exposure to such risks, its objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk and the Groups management of capital.
Reference to disclosures given elsewhere in the financial statements is included as appropriate.
The Board has overall responsibility for determining the Groups risk management objectives and policies and, whilst retaining ultimate responsibility for them, has delegated to the finance function the authority for designing and operating processes that ensure the effective implementation of those objectives.
The overall objectives of the Board are to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the Groups competitiveness and flexibility.
Credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk arises from the potential financial loss if a tenant or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from the Groups trade receivables from tenants.
Trade receivables The majority of the Groups rental income is demanded quarterly in advance and demands are sent out prior to the due date.
Management monitors arrears continually and prompt action is taken to address potential defaults as appropriate.
The credit worthiness of each tenant is assessed prior to the agreement of the lease.
Where appropriate, collateral is required by the Group to support lease obligations.
In many cases this takes the form of a tenant security deposit but also includes parent company guarantees, bank or other guarantees where appropriate.
Provision is made on a sliding scale against any rental arrears where recovery is in doubt or where solicitors have been instructed to recover the debt, with full provision for impairment usually being made where a tenant is in arrears for more than a year.
Details of the Groups trade receivables and the extent of impairment provisions against them are set out in Note 11.
Due to the large number of tenants across various sectors and geographical locations, the Board does not consider there to be a significant concentration of credit risk.
Cash and derivative financial instruments The credit rating of counterparties to financial instruments is kept under review.
The Groups interest rate swaps are currently out-of-the-money: consequently, counterparty risk on swaps does not represent a major risk at the current time.
The counterparty risk on cash and short-term deposits is managed by limiting the aggregate exposure to any institution by reference to their credit rating.
Such balances are generally placed with major financial institutions where credit risk is not considered significant.
Maximum exposure The aggregate carrying amounts of the Groups financial assets, which are stated net of impairment provisions, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk, before taking into account the value of the tenant security deposits held and other collateral.
Page 81 DAEJAN HOLDINGS PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2018 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due and arises from the Groups management of its working capital and the finance charges and amortisation of its loans and borrowings.
The Groups policy is to seek to maintain cash balances to meet all short and medium term requirements.
The Group has a low level of gearing relative to the property investment sector as a whole and has long standing relationships with many leading banks and financial institutions from which the Board expect to be able to raise further funds if required.
At 31 March 2018, gearing was 13.8% 2017 14.6% on the basis of gross debt to gross assets.
Cash and short-term deposits at 31 March 2018 were 98.8 million 2017 84.3 million and 54.0 million of loans and borrowings were repayable within one year 2017 49.3 million.
In addition, at the same date, the Group had undrawn committed facilities of 63.4 million 2017 48.4 million, which expire between 2018 and 2022.
The maturity analysis of the undiscounted cash flows arising from the Groups financial liabilities at 31 March 2018 was as follows: 2018 Aggregate Due Due Due Due after Carrying undiscounted within within within more than amount cash flows one year 1-2 years 2-5 years 5 years 000 000 000 000 000 000 Bank loans 92,719 92,719 26,647 66,072 Mortgages 257,740 257,740 27,311 10,681 41,975 177,773 Interest 81,496 11,539 10,074 24,906 34,977 Interest rate swaps 1,161 3,956 918 325 973 1,740 Trade and other payables 51,328 51,328 51,328 402,948 487,239 117,743 21,080 133,926 214,490 2017 Carrying Aggregate Due Due Due Due after amount undiscounted within within within more than cash flows one year 1-2 years 2-5 years 5 years 000 000 000 000 000 000 Bank loans 80,228 80,228 2,269 26,712 51,247 Mortgages 272,311 272,311 47,028 30,514 47,891 146,878 Interest 71,774 11,206 9,857 21,870 28,841 Interest rate swaps 3,084 5,822 1,320 971 1,135 2,396 Trade and other payables 48,276 48,276 48,276 403,899 478,411 110,099 68,054 122,143 178,115 Market risk Market risk arises mainly from the impact that changes in interest rates might have on the cost of Group borrowing and the impact that changes in the US dollar sterling rate of exchange might have on the Groups recognition of its USA net assets.
Interest rates The Group seeks to reduce the interest rate risk by fixing rates on a majority of its loans and borrowings, whilst maintaining some loans at floating rates in order to retain flexibility in relation to short term interest rates.
Interest rates are fixed either through the use of fixed rate mortgage finance or through interest rate swaps.
The Group does not speculate in treasury products but uses these Page 82 DAEJAN HOLDINGS PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2018 only to limit exposure to potential interest rate fluctuations.
The interest rate profile of the Groups loans and borrowings is set out in Note 15.
It is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would decrease the Groups profit before taxation by approximately 0.6 million per annum, on the basis of the floating rate debt outstanding at 31 March 2018, after taking account of the interest swaps in place.
There also exists a risk to the income statement arising from the recognition and re-measurement of interest rate swaps at fair value.
It is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would give rise to a reduction in fair value of interest rate swaps outstanding at 31 March 2018 of 3.1 million, together with a corresponding increase in the Groups profit before taxation.
Interest rate swaps The interest rate swaps held by the Group at the year end were as follows: Contracted rate Notional principal Fair value 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 % % 000 000 000 000 Maturing within one year 5.6 5.6 25,000 25,000 766 2,084 Maturing after five years 1.6 1.6 30,000 30,000 395 1,000 55,000 55,000 1,161 3,084 Foreign exchange rates The Group seeks to reduce its exposure to foreign currency risk in relation to its USA net assets by funding its USA investment property with US dollar denominated loans and borrowings.
As the Groups investment in USA assets are held for the long term and funds are not usually returned to the UK, the Groups policy is not to hedge its residual exposure.
Management monitors exchange rates on a regular basis and elects to transfer funds only when the rate is favourable to do so.
It is estimated that a ten percentage point decrease in the value of the US dollar against sterling would result in a decrease in the sterling value of the Groups USA net assets of 30.0 million.
Capital management The capital structure of the Group consists of equity attributable to equity holders of the parent together with net debt.
This is kept under constant review to ensure the Group has sufficient capital to fund its operations and that the Groups strategy of low gearing is maintained.
The Group seeks to maintain a balance between longer-term finance appropriate to fund its long-term investment property holding strategy and medium-term finance which provides a more cost effective source of finance.
Equity comprises issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as set out in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
Net debt comprises a mix of fixed rate mortgages and shorter-term bank loans as set out in Note 15 and cash and short term deposits as set out in Note 12.
All loans and borrowings are secured against investment property and the bank loans are drawn against committed facilities.
Related Party Transactions Day-to-day management of the Groups properties and its operations in the UK is mainly carried out by Highdorn Co. Limited and by Freshwater Property Management Limited.
Mr B S E Freshwater and Mr S I Freshwater are Directors of both companies.
They have no beneficial interest in the share capital of Highdorn Co. Limited.
Mr B S E Freshwater, Mr S I Freshwater and Mr D Davis are Directors of the parent company of Freshwater Property Management Limited but have no beneficial interest in either company.
Mr C B Freshwater and Mr R E Freshwater have a beneficial interest in a trust holding interests in shares in Highdorn Co. Limited.
Page 83 DAEJAN HOLDINGS PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2018 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued In their capacity as property managing agents, Highdorn Co. Limited Highdorn and Freshwater Property Management Limited FPM collect rents and incur direct property expenses on behalf of the Group.
At 31 March 2018, the aggregate net amounts due to the Group from Highdorn and FPM was 2.7 million 2017 6.6 million.
These amounts are not secured and are payable on demand.
No guarantees have been given or received and the amounts are settled in cash.
Included in the balance above are amounts paid and payable by the Group for the provision of property and other management services to Highdorn Co. Limited and Freshwater Property Management Limited, which were as follows: 2018 2017 000 000 Balance due to related party managing agents at 1 April 1,889 2,891 Charged during the year 6,179 4,488 Paid during the year 5,557 5,490 Balance due to related party managing agents at 31 March 2,511 1,889 Mr B S E Freshwater, Mr S I Freshwater and Mr D Davis are trustees of two charities that own 6.3% of the share capital of the Company.
These charities have received dividend payments in the year of 1,001,386 2017 960,659.
The Directors interests in the Company and the principal shareholders are described on pages 31 and 32.
The Board considers that the Directors are the key management personnel of the Group and their remuneration is disclosed on page 44.
Contingent Liabilities The Group is from time to time party to legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business.
The Directors are not aware of any current actions which could have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Group.
Operating Lease Agreements The Group earns rental income by leasing its investment properties to tenants under operating leases which vary in terms and provisions between type of property and type of tenure.
Leases providing for contingent rents are rare within the Groups property portfolio and no amounts for contingent rents are included in rental income for the year 2017 Nil.
At the balance sheet date, future minimum lease payments receivable by the Group under operating leases were as follows: 2018 2017 000 000 Due within one year 75,386 76,536 Due within one to two years 44,721 49,043 Due within two to five years 95,365 105,796 Due after more than five years 233,788 273,792 449,260 505,167 Many of the Groups residential properties are let under assured shorthold tenancies which typically are for initial terms of 12 months or less, whereafter they are cancellable at short notice.
The Groups experience is that a significant proportion of such tenancies are held over after the expiry of their initial term.
