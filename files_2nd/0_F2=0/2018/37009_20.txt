Financial Statements | Notes to the financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 Significant accounting policies BASIS OF PREPARATION Accounting policies applicable to more than one section of the financial statements are shown below.
Where accounting policies relate to a specific note in the financial statements, they are set out within that note, to provide readers of the financial statements with a more useful layout to the financial information presented.
Statement of compliance Intertek Group plc is a company incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
The Group financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2018 consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the 'Group' and include the Groups interest in associates.
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU IFRSs.
The Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
The Company has elected to prepare its Company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP, comprising FRS 101 and applicable law: these are presented on pages 164 to 168.
Significant new accounting policies IFRS 9 Financial Instruments came into effect on 1 January 2018.
Management has performed its reviews of the standard, and identified the following areas of note, although there is no material impact in the year ending 31 December 2018 as a result of implementing the new standard.
The Group has applied the limited exemption in IFRS 9 and has elected not to restate comparative information in the year of adoption.
As a result, the comparative information provided has been accounted for in accordance with Group's previous accounting policy.
Classification and measurement of financial assets the Group's financial assets comprise trade receivables, contract assets and cash and cash equivalents.
The disclosures relating to both trade receivables, contract assets and cash and cash equivalents continue to be applicable and have not been affected by the adoption of IFRS 9.
There are no changes to the measurement of financial assets.
Impairment of financial assets, by introducing a forward-looking expected loss impairment model the Group's primary types of financial assets subject to IFRS 9's new expected credit loss model are trade receivables and contract assets.
For trade receivables and contract assets, the Group has applied the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, which requires the use of the lifetime expected loss provision for all receivables, whereas IAS 39 operated under an incurred loss model and would only recognise impairments when there was objective evidence.
There has been no material change to the impairment provision of receivables.
Hedge accounting the Group has continued to apply IAS 39 accounting and has provided additional IFRS 7 disclosures required for taking that option.
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers came into effect on 1 January 2018.
During the year ended 31 December 2017 the Group carried out a detailed review of the recognition criteria for revenue applying the requirements of IFRS 15 and to ensure that the same principles were being applied consistently across the Group.
Management assessed the potential impact of IFRS 15 by i discussing the changes in accounting for revenue under the new standard with major countries and business lines: ii reviewing a cross-section of different revenue contracts across the Group: and iii considering the impact of IFRS 15 on both short-term and long-term contracts.
Specifically, the Group's revenue streams are two-fold: Revenue from services rendered on short-term projects is generally recognised in the income statement when the relevant service is completed, usually when the report of findings or test inspection certificate is issued.
The adoption of IFRS 15 has no material impact on the recognition of such revenue.
On long-term projects the Group records transactions as revenue on the basis of value of work done, with the corresponding amount being included in trade receivables if the customer has been invoiced, or in contract assets if billing has yet to be completed.
Long-term projects consist of two main types: time incurred is billed at agreed rates on a periodic basis, such as monthly.
"The current recognition approach is based on timesheets evidencing work done, this is consistent with the ""over time"" recognition criteria under IFRS 15 using those timesheets as the input basis: or staged payment invoicing occurs, requiring an assessment of percentage completion, based on services provided and revenue accrued accordingly."
"Assessment of percentage completion has continued in the same way, this is in line with the ""over time"" recognition under IFRS 15."
Whilst IAS 18 is based on deliverables and risks and rewards of transfer, IFRS 15 identifies performance obligations.
There may be more than one performance obligation per contract, for example Alchemy Training Solutions contracts have multiple elements which are split between recognising revenue at a point in time for services such as software licences and over time for other services delivered under the same contract.
The application to the Group's longand short-term contracts remains the same.
IFRS 15 provides guidance on variable consideration that was not included under IAS 18, however no material variable consideration exists within the Group.
120 Intertek Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial Statements 1 Significant accounting policies continued IFRS 15 has been implemented retrospectively, but the comparative figures have not been restated because the new standard does not have a material impact on the timing of revenue recognition based on the Groups current revenue streams.
The economic factors affecting revenue for both short-term and long-term contracts are consistent within each.
The operating segment revenue disclosures note 2 provided under IFRS 8 are consistent with the disaggregated revenue disclosure and recognition and measurement requirements of IFRS 15.
IFRSs announced but not yet effective IFRS 16 Leases effective 1 January 2019 requires that, to the extent that a right-of-control exists over an asset subject to a lease, with a lease term exceeding one year and subject to exceptions for leases of low-value assets, a right-of-use asset, representing the Group's right to use the underlying leased asset and a lease liability representing the Group's obligation to make lease payments, are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position at the commencement of the lease.
The Group will be applying the modified retrospective approach, where the cumulative effect of applying IFRS 16 is recognised in retained earnings with no restatement to prior years.
On transition, the majority of leases will be recognised using modified retrospective B, whereby the right-of-use asset is equal to the lease liability at 1 January 2019, being the present value of the remaining future minimum lease payments at the date of initial application, including any early termination or extension options if they are deemed reasonably certain to be adopted.
For certain leases the modified retrospective A approach will be applied, whereby the right-of-use asset recognised at 1 January 2019 is equal to the right-of-use asset had IFRS 16 been applied since the beginning of the lease.
The Group has applied the practical expedient within the standard whereby IFRS 16 has been applied to contracts that were previously identified as leases when applying IAS 17 Leases and IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease.
Management has completed the data collection exercise to determine the estimated quantitative impact of IFRS 16 on the Groups net assets and income statement as a result of IFRS 16 coming into effect from 1 January 2019: The Groups assets would increase by between 230m and 250m and liabilities would increase by between 250m and 270m.
The overall impact on the Groups statement of financial position as at 31 December 2018 is expected to be a reduction in the Groups net assets of 20m.
Operating lease rental charges for those leases accounted for under IFRS 16 are replaced by depreciation and finance costs.
The impact on the Groups 2018 income statement is not material.
IFRS 16 will primarily affect the accounting for the Groups operating leases, to which the Group had commitments of 303.6m at 31 December 2018 as reported in note 8.
This is the gross value and does not reflect a discounting of the commitments to their present value, as required by IFRS 16.
IFRS 16 will not have any impact on the underlying commercial performance of the Group, nor the cash flows generated in the year.
There are no other standards that are not yet effective and that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group in the current or future reporting periods and on future transactions.
Changes in accounting policies The accounting policies set out in these financial statements have been applied consistently to all years presented except for the policy on the useful economic lives of intangible assets that has been updated to reflect the longer useful economic lives of the intangibles assets recognised following the acquisition of Alchemy.
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, but do not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
Details of these standards can be found on page 120.
Measurement convention The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except as discussed in the relevant accounting policies.
Functional and presentation currency These consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Companys functional currency.
All information presented in sterling has been rounded to the nearest 0.1m.
Going concern The Board has reviewed forecasts, including forecasts adjusted for significantly worse economic conditions.
The Board has also reviewed the Groups funding requirements and the available debt facilities.
As a result of these reviews the Board remains satisfied with the Groups funding and liquidity position and believes that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
In addition, on the basis of its forecasts, both base case and stressed, and available facilities, which are described in note 14, the Board has concluded that the going concern basis of preparation continues to be appropriate.
Intertek Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 121 Financial Statements | Notes to the financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 1 Significant accounting policies continued BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has power to direct the relevant activities, exposure to variable returns from the investee and the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of investor returns.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
For purchases of non-controlling interest in subsidiaries, the difference between the cost of the additional interest in the subsidiary and the non-controlling interests share of the assets and liabilities reflected in the consolidated statement of financial position at the date of acquisition, is reflected directly in shareholders equity.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
FOREIGN CURRENCY Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities for example cash, trade receivables, trade payables denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are generally recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
For the policy on hedging of foreign currency transactions see note 14.
Foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated to sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the reporting date.
The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into sterling at cumulative average rates of exchange during the year.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of foreign operations are taken directly to equity in the translation reserve.
They are released to the income statement upon disposal.
For the policy on net investment hedging see note 14.
The most significant currencies for the Group were translated at the following exchange rates: Assets and liabilities Income and expenses Actual rates Cumulative average rates Value of 1 31Dec 2018 31Dec 2017 2018 2017 US dollar 1.26 1.34 1.34 1.29 Euro 1.11 1.13 1.13 1.14 Chinese renminbi 8.69 8.79 8.84 8.72 Hong Kong dollar 9.90 10.47 10.47 10.05 Australian dollar 1.80 1.72 1.79 1.68 USE OF JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make judgements and estimates that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in which the estimates are revised and in any future years affected.
During the year, management reassessed its critical estimates and judgements and resolved that the following disclosure was no longer considered critical, as management does not expect there to be a significant risk of material change to the carrying value of those liabilities within the next year.
Put option over non-controlling interest The calculation of the fair value of put options over the non-controlling interest in the Groups businesses in the relevant countries required the use of judgement in the application of key assumptions around the future performance of those businesses: the riskadjusted discount rate taking into account the risk-free rate and the gross domestic product growth in those countries.
122 Intertek Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial Statements 1 Significant accounting policies continued JUDGEMENTS In applying the Groups accounting policies, management has applied judgement in the following areas that have a significant impact on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Income and deferred tax The tax on profits is determined according to complex tax laws and regulations.
Where the effect of these laws and regulations is unclear, judgements are used in determining the liability for the tax to be paid.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities require management judgement in determining the amounts to be recognised, with consideration given to the timing and level of future taxable income.
The main areas of judgement in the Group tax calculation are reassessment of the uncertain tax provisions for the full year and reassessment of the recognition and recoverability of the UK deferred tax asset see note 6.
Basis of consolidation Judgement is applied when determining if the Group controls a subsidiary.
In assessing control, the Group considers whether it has the power to direct the relevant activities, whether it has exposure to variable returns from the investee and whether it has power over the investee to affect the amount of investor returns.
Our original assessments are subsequently revisited on a rolling basis see Basis of Consolidation policy.
In 2018 the Group made a number of acquisitions, as disclosed in note 10, and it was determined that the Group has control over all subsidiaries acquired in the year.
Intangible assets When the Group makes an acquisition, e. g. Aldo Abela Surveys Limited, Proasem S. A. S. NTA Monitor Limited and Alchemy Investment Holdings, Inc. in 2018, management determines initially whether any intangible assets e. g. customer relationships, trade names and technology should be recognised separately from goodwill, and the provisional amounts at which to recognise those assets.
Certain assumptions are used in determining the provisional values for such intangible assets, including, but not limited to, future growth rates and customer attrition rates.
During the first 12 months of ownership, intangible assets are reviewed to determine whether any additional information exists that supports amendments to that original assessment, including new intangible assets.
Management has performed this subsequent review for the 2017 acquisitions of KJ Tech Services GmbH and Acumen Security LLC during the current year see note 10.
Restructuring In making a provision and classifying costs as restructuring as part of our 5x5 differentiated strategy for growth, management has used its judgement to assess the specific circumstances of each local and regional restructuring proposal as to whether it meets the Group definition of this SDI, including an estimate of future costs and the timing of completion see note 3.
Claims In making provision for claims, management has used its judgement to assess the circumstances relating to each specific event, internal and external legal advice, knowledge of the industries and markets, prevailing commercial terms and legal precedents see note 13.
ESTIMATES Discussed below are key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation at the reporting date, that could have a risk of causing a significant material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
Impairment of goodwill Following recognition of goodwill as a result of acquisitions, the Group determines, as a minimum on an annual basis and including current year acquisitions e. g. Alchemy, whether goodwill is impaired, which requires an estimation of the future cash flows of the cash generating units to which the goodwill is allocated, as well as assumptions on growth rates and discount rates see note 9.
No risk has been identified of a goodwill impairment in the next twelve months, as detailed in the sensitivity analysis in note 9.
Contingent consideration When the Group acquires businesses, the total consideration may consist of an amount paid on completion plus further amounts payable on agreed post completion dates.
These further amounts are contingent on the acquired business meeting agreed performance targets.
At the date of acquisition and at subsequent reporting periods, the Group reviews the profit and cash forecasts for the acquired business and estimates the amount of contingent consideration that is likely to be due.
Further details and sensitivity analysis are included in note 10.
Employee post-retirement benefit obligations For material defined benefit plans, the actuarial valuation includes assumptions such as discount rates, return on assets, salary progression and mortality rates.
Further details and sensitivity analysis are included in note 16.
Recoverability of trade receivables Trade receivables are reflected, net of an estimated provision for impairment losses.
This provision considers the past payment history and the length of time that the debts have remained unpaid and forward-looking judgmental factors, such as specific customer knowledge and country-specific risk factors.
Further details are included in note 11.
Intertek Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 123 Financial Statements | Notes to the financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 1 Significant accounting policies continued Accounting policies relating to a specific note in the financial statements are set out within that note as follows: Note Revenue 2 Separately Disclosed Items 3 Taxation 6 Property, plant and equipment 8 Goodwill and other intangible assets 9 Trade and other receivables 11 Trade and other payables 12 Provisions 13 Borrowings and financial instruments 14 Capital and reserves 15 Employee benefits 16 Share schemes 17 Non-controlling interest 20 2 Operating segments and presentation of results ACCOUNTING POLICY Revenue Revenue represents the total amount receivable for services rendered when there is transfer of control to the customer, excluding sales related taxes and intra-group transactions.
Revenue from services rendered on short-term projects is generally recognised in the income statement when the relevant service is completed, usually when the report of findings or test inspection certificate is issued.
Short-term projects are considered to be those of less than two months' duration.
On long-term projects revenue is recognised using the five steps for revenue recognition.
The majority of contracts are for less than one year.
The Group records transactions as sales on the basis of value of work done, with the corresponding amount being included in trade receivables if the customer has been invoiced, or in contract assets, if billing has yet to be completed.
Performance obligations vary across business lines and regions, and on a contract-by-contract basis.
Long-term projects consist of two main types: time incurred is billed at agreed rates on a periodic basis, such as monthly: or staged payment invoicing occurs, requiring an assessment of percentage completion, based on services provided and revenue accrued accordingly.
Expenses are recharged to clients where permitted by the contract.
Payments received in advance from customers are recognised in contract liabilities where services have not yet been rendered.
The Group does not expect to have any contracts where the period between the transfer of promised goods or services to the customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year.
As a consequence, the Group does not adjust any of the transaction prices for the time value of money.
The Group has applied practical expedients in i recognising assets from the costs incurred to obtain or fulfil a contract: and ii in disclosing unsatisfied performance obligations in contracts as contracts have an expected duration of less than a year.
OPERATING SEGMENTS The Group is organised into business lines, which are the Groups operating segments and are reported to the CEO, the chief operating decision maker.
These operating segments are aggregated into three divisions, which are the Groups reportable segments, based on similar nature of products and services and midto long-term structural growth drivers.
When aggregating operating segments into the three divisions we have applied judgement over the similarities of the services provided, the customer-base and the midto long-term structural growth drivers.
The costs of the corporate head office and other costs which are not controlled by the three divisions are allocated appropriately.
Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arms length basis.
There is no significant seasonality in the Groups operations.
Segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
124 Intertek Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial Statements 2 Operating segments and presentation of results continued The performance of the segments is assessed based on adjusted operating profit which is stated before Separately Disclosed Items.
A reconciliation to operating profit by division and Group profit for the year is included overleaf.
The principal activities of the divisions, and the customers they serve, are as follows: Products Our Products division consists of business lines that are focused on ensuring the quality and safety of physical components and products, as well as minimising risk through assessing the operating process and quality management systems of our customers.
As a trusted partner to the worlds leading retailers, manufacturers and distributors, our Products business lines support a wide range of industries including textiles, footwear, toys, hardlines, home appliances, consumer electronics, information and communication technology, automotive, aerospace, lighting, building products, industrial and renewable energy products, food and hospitality, healthcare and beauty, and pharmaceuticals.
Across these industries we provide a wide range of ATIC services including laboratory safety, quality and performance testing, second-party supplier auditing, sustainability analysis, products assurance, vendor compliance, process performance analysis, facility plant and equipment verification and third party certification.
Trade Our Trade division consists of three global business lines with similar global and regional trade-flow structural growth drivers with demand driven by population and GDP growth, the development of regional trade, increased traceability and growth in port and transport infrastructure.
The division provides differing services which reflect the breadth of our ATIC offering, but the services provided are similar in nature and include analytical assessment, inspection and technical services that are delivered to the customers through issuing certificates or reports.
The three business lines all assist our Trade-related customers in protecting the value and quality of their products during their custody-transfer, storage and transportation, globally.
Our Trade-related customers are all dependent on, and intrinsically linked to, global shipping and trade flows.
Our Caleb Brett business provides cargo inspection, analytical assessment, calibration and related research and technical services to the worlds petroleum and biofuels industries.
Our Government & Trade Services 'GTS' business provides inspection services to governments and regulatory bodies to support trade activities that help the flow of goods across borders, predominantly in the Middle East, Africa and South America.
Our AgriWorld business provides analytical and testing services to global agricultural trading companies and growers.
Resources Our Resources division consists of two business lines demonstrating similar midto long-term structural growth drivers closely linked to our end-customer capital investment.
Demand is driven by long-term energy demand, supply chain risk management, sustainability of energy supply, infrastructure investments, growth in alternative energy and focus on health and safety.
The division offers similar services across our range of Total Quality Assurance solutions to the oil, gas, nuclear, power and minerals industries.
Our Resources customers typically extract natural resources from the ground and our services enable our customers to optimise the use of their assets and to minimise risk in their supply chains.
Delivery of our services is through issuing certificates or reports.

126 Intertek Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial Statements 3 Separately Disclosed Items ACCOUNTING POLICY Adjusted results In order to present the performance of the Group in a clear, consistent and comparable format, certain items are disclosed separately onthe face of the income statement.
Separately Disclosed Items are items which by their nature or size, in the opinion of the Directors, should be excluded from the adjusted result to provide readers with a clear and consistent view of the business performance of the Group and its operating divisions.
When applicable, these items include amortisation of acquisition intangibles: impairment of goodwill and other assets: the profit orlosson disposals of businesses or other significant non-current assets: costs of acquiring and integrating acquisitions: the cost of any fundamental restructuring: material claims and settlements: significant recycling of amounts from equity to the income statement: andunrealised market or fair value gains or losses on financial assets or liabilities, including contingent consideration.
Adjusted operating profit, which is a non-GAAP measure, excludes the amortisation of acquired intangible assets, primarily customer relationships, as we do not believe that the amortisation charge in the Income Statement provides useful information about the cash costs of running our business as these assets will be supported and maintained by the ongoing marketing and promotional expenditure, which is already reflected in operating costs.
Amortisation of software, however, is included in adjusted operating profit as it is similar in nature to other capital expenditure.
The costs of any restructuring as part of our 5x5 differentiated strategy for growth are excluded from adjusted operating profit where they represent fundamental changes in individual operations around the Group and where they reflect the refinement of our operational structure identified as part of the Group's strategy that are not expected to recur in those operations.
The impairment of goodwill and other assets that by their nature or size are not expected to recur: the profit and loss on disposals of businesses or other significant assets: and the costs associated with successful, active or aborted acquisitions are excluded from adjusted operating profit to provide useful information regarding the underlying performance of the Groups operations.
"SEPARATELY DISCLOSED ITEMS The Separately Disclosed Items are described in the table below: 2018 2017 m m Operating costs: Amortisation of acquisition intangibles a 24.6 16.0 Acquisition costs b 8.5 3.2 Restructuring costs c 13.6 12.4 Gain on disposal of business d 1.1 Impairment of goodwill and other assets e 16.8 Material claims and settlements f 3.4 Total operating costs 45.6 45.0 Net financing costs g 6.4 0.5 Total before income tax 52.0 45.5 Income tax credit on Separately Disclosed Items 13.5 20.6 Total 38.5 24.9 a Of the amortisation of acquisition intangibles in the current year, 3.6m 2017: nil relates to the customer relationships, trade names, technology and non-compete covenants acquired with the purchase of Alchemy Investment Holdings, Inc ""Alchemy"" in 2018. b Acquisition costs comprise 8.5m 2017: 3.6m for transaction costs in respect of successful, active and aborted acquisitions in the current year, and nil  acquisitions 2017: 0.4m income."

e N o impairment charges have been recorded in 2018.
"Consistent with the corporate 5x5 strategy objective of ""Superior Technology"" announced in 2016, the Group recorded an impairment of other assets of 8.0m in 2017 following a comprehensive strategic review of the Global IT organisation structure and system finalised in April 2017."
In addition, in 2017 8.8m of plant and equipment was impaired in full, related to a specific service line in the Resources division that is no longer an area of focus for the Group.
f Material claims and settlements relate to a commercial claim that is separately disclosable due to its size.
g Net financing costs of 6.4m 2017: 0.5m relate to the change in fair value of contingent consideration and the unwinding of discount on put options related to acquisitions.

Current tax Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on estimates of the additional taxes that are likely to become due.
Amounts are accrued based on managements interpretation of specific tax law and the likelihood of settlement.
Where the outcome of discussions with tax authorities is different from the amount initially recorded, this difference will impact the tax provisions in the period the determination is made.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes, except for: recognition of consolidated goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and interest in joint ventures, the reversal of which isunder the control of the Group and where it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, for the periods when the asset is realised or the liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different taxable entities which intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.
Any additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of dividends are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay the related dividend.
TAX EXPENSE The Group operates across many different tax jurisdictions.
Income and profits are earned and taxed in the individual countries in whichthey occur.
The income tax expense for the profit before tax for the 12 months ended 31December 2018 is 99.3m 2017: 86.9m.
The Groups consolidated effective tax rate for the 12 months ended 31December 2018 is 24.5% 2017: 22.1%.
The income tax expense for the adjusted profit before tax for the 12 months ended 31December 2018 is 112.8m 2017: 107.5m.
The Groups adjusted consolidated effective tax rate for the 12 months ended 31December 2018 is 24.7% 2017: 24.5%.
Differences between the consolidated effective tax rate of 24.5% and notional statutory UK rate of 19.0% include, but are not limited to: the mix of profits: the effect of tax rates in foreign jurisdictions: non-deductible expenses: the effect of utilised tax losses: and under over provisions in previous periods.
The Group receives tax incentives in certain jurisdictions, resulting in a lower tax charge to the income statement.
Without these incentives the adjusted effective tax rate would be 27.1% 2017: 27.0%.
The Groups tax rate is affected by its financing arrangements that are in place to fund business operations in overseas territories.
There is no guarantee that these reduced rates will continue to be applicable in future years see note 22.

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable profits will be available in certain jurisdictions against which the Group can utilise the benefits from them.
There is a temporary difference of 235.8m 2017: 240.0m which relates to unremitted post-acquisition overseas earnings.
Nodeferred tax is provided on this amount as the distribution of these retained earnings is under the control of the Group and there is no intention to either repatriate from, or sell, the associated subsidiaries in the foreseeable future.
7 Earnings per ordinary share The calculation of earnings per ordinary share is based on profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue on the assumption of conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
Potential ordinary shares shall be treated as dilutive when, and only when, their conversion to ordinary shares would decrease earnings per share or increase loss per share from continuing operations.
In addition to the earnings per share required by IAS 33 Earnings Per Share, an adjusted earnings per share has also been calculated and is based on earnings excluding the effect of amortisation of acquisition intangibles, goodwill impairment and other Separately Disclosed Items.
It has been calculated to allow shareholders a better understanding of the trading performance of the Group.
Details of the adjusted earnings per share are set out below: 2018 2017 m m Profit attributable to ordinary shareholders 284.4 287.4 Separately Disclosed Items after tax note 3 38.5 24.9 Adjusted earnings 322.9 312.3 Number of shares millions Basic weighted average number of ordinary shares 160.9 160.9 Potentially dilutive share awards 1.9 2.1 Diluted weighted average number of shares 162.8 163.0 Basic earnings per share 176.8p 178.6p Potentially dilutive share awards 2.1 p 2.3 p Diluted earnings per share 174.7p 176.3p Adjusted basic earnings per share 200.7p 194.1p Potentially dilutive share awards 2.4 p 2.5 p Adjusted diluted earnings per share 198.3p 191.6p 132 Intertek Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial Statements 8 Property, plant and equipment ACCOUNTING POLICY Property, plant and equipment Owned assets Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset.
Leased assets Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Where land and buildings are held under finance leases, the accounting treatment of the land is considered separately from that of the buildings.
Leased assets acquired by way of finance leases are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Other leases are operating leases These leased assets are not recognised in the Groups statement of financial position.
Depreciation Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment.
Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the expected lease term and their useful lives.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Freehold buildings and long leasehold buildings 50 years Short leasehold buildings Term of lease Fixtures, fittings, plant and equipment 3 to 10 years Depreciation methods, residual values and the useful lives of assets are reassessed at each reporting date.
Impairment Non-financial assets The carrying amounts of the Groups non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, then the assets recoverable amount is estimated to determine the level of any impairment.

9 Goodwill and other intangible assets ACCOUNTING POLICY Goodwill Goodwill arises on the acquisition of businesses.
Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of acquisition and the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units CGUs and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
Acquisitions on or after 1January 2010 From 1 January 2010, the Group has prospectively applied IFRS 3 Business Combinations revised 2008. Business combinations areaccounted for using the acquisition method at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is obtained.
The Group measures goodwill as the fair value of the consideration transferred less the net recognised amount generally fair value ofthe identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, all measured as of the acquisition date.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred.
Costs relating to acquisitions are shown in Separately Disclosed Items.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date with subsequent changes recognised in profit or loss.
If at the reporting date the fair values of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities can only be established provisionally, then these values are used.
Adjustments to the fair values can be made within 12 months of the acquisition date and aretaken as adjustments to goodwill.
Acquisitions between 1January 2004 and 31December 2009 For acquisitions between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2009, goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition overthe Groups interest in the recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities oftheacquiree.
Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurred in connection withbusiness combinations were capitalised as part of the cost of the acquisition.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption permitted by IFRS 1 and has not restated goodwill on acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, goodwill represents the amount recognised under the Groups previous accounting framework.
Intertek Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 135 Financial Statements | Notes to the financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 9 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued Other intangible assets When the Group makes an acquisition, management review the business and assets acquired to determine whether any intangible assets should be recognised separately from goodwill.
If, based on managements judgement, such an asset is identified, then it is valued by discounting the probable future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, over the estimated life of the asset.
Where there is uncertainty over the amount of economic benefit and the useful life, this is factored into the calculation.
Intangible assets arising on acquisitions and computer software are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Identifiable intangibles are those which can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights regardless of whether those rights are separable, and which have finite useful lives.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives.
The estimated useful lives areas follows: Computer software Up to 7 years Customer relationships Up to 20 years Technology and know-how Up to 15 years Trade names Up to 18 years Licences Contractual life Covenants not to compete Contractual life Impairment Goodwill is not subject to amortisation and is tested annually for impairment and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
Other intangible assets are subject to amortisation and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the amount carried in the statement of financial position may be less than its recoverable amount.
Any impairment is recognised in the income statement.
Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each asset or group of assets, i. e. cash generating unit, to which the goodwill relates.
A CGU represents an asset grouping at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.
The recoverable amount of an asset or a CGU is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
The estimation process is complex due to the inherent risks and uncertainties and if different estimates were used this could materially change the projected value of the cash flows.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
Licence additions of 2.2m 2017: nil relates to separately acquired intangible assets.
The other acquisition intangibles of 53.4m 2017: 11.9m consist of guaranteed income, order backlog, covenants not to compete and know-how.
The average remaining amortisation period for customer relationships is eight years 2017: six years.
Computer software net book value of 93.5m at 31December 2018 2017: 79.0m includes software in construction of 48.5m 2017:38.5m.
Research and development expenditure of 31.6m 2017: 26.9m was recognised as an expense in the year.
Goodwill Goodwill arising from acquisitions in the current and prior year has been allocated to reportable segments as follows: 2018 2017 m m Products 275.0 29.0 Trade 3.3 0.9 Resources At 31December 278.3 28.1 Intertek Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 137 Financial Statements | Notes to the financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 9 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued Goodwill continued The total carrying amount of goodwill by CGU is as follows, which is also used for the assessment of the Groups impairment review.

Additions during the year are converted at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction and the goodwill at the end ofthe year is stated at closing exchange rates.
Impairment review In order to determine whether impairments are required, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of each CGU.
The calculation is based on projecting future cash flows over a five-year period and using a terminal value to incorporate expectations of growth thereafter.
A discount factor is applied to obtain a value in use which is the recoverable amount.
Goodwill arising in year from acquisitions is assessed for impairment separately from the above CGUs and on an  basis.
No impairments were required on goodwill arising in 2018.
Key assumptions The key assumptions include the rate of revenue and profit growth within each of the territories and business lines in which the Group operates.
These are based on the Groups approved budget and five-year Strategic Plan.
The long-term growth rate is also key since it is used in the perpetuity calculations.
Finally, the discount rate used to bring the cash flow back to a present value varies depending on the location of the operation and the nature of the operations.
The estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
The calculation of the value in use is sensitive to long-term growth rates and discount rates.
Long-term growth rates predict growth beyond the Groups planning cycle, and range from 1.8% to 2.5% 2017: 1.7% to 2.5%.
The discount rate for each CGU reflects the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the risks specific to the CGU.
Sensitivity analysis None of the reasonable downside sensitivity scenarios on key assumptions would cause the carrying amount of each CGU to exceed itsrecoverable amount.
The sensitivities modelled by management include: i Assuming revenues decline each year by 1% in 2020 to 2023 from the 2019 budgeted revenues, with margins increasing with baseassumptions.
ii Assuming zero growth in operating profit margins in 2019 to 2023 with revenues increasing per base assumptions.
iii Assuming an increase in the discount rates used by 1%.
Management considers that the likelihood of any or all of the above scenarios occurring is low.
138 Intertek Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial Statements 10 Acquisitions ACQUISITIONS IN 2018 On 20 August 2018, the Group acquired Alchemy Investment Holdings, Inc. 'Alchemy', an industry leader in People Assurance solutions for the food industry, for an estimated purchase price of 378.5m, 375.3m net of cash acquired, generating goodwill of 270.6m.

Cash consideration includes cash and debt acquired of 5.6m.
The estimated purchase price net of cash and debt acquired was 388.6m, of which 0.7m has been paid in January 2019.
Contribution of acquisitions to revenue and profits In total, acquisitions made during 2018 contributed revenues of 18.5m and a statutory net loss after tax of 4.3m from their respective dates of acquisition to 31December 2018.
The Group revenue and statutory profit after tax for the year ended 31December 2018 would have been 2,829.6m and 298.7m respectively if all the acquisitions were assumed to have been made on 1January 2018.

Key assumptions The key assumptions in deriving the contingent consideration to be recognised include the weighted probability of making a payout and the discount rate used to bring the cash flow back to present values.
The discount rates used for the calculation are aligned with the discount rates used for impairment purposes as set out in Note 9.
Sensitivity analysis It is estimated that an increase of 1% in the discount rate used to calculate the contingent consideration would have decreased the financial liability by 0.4m, and a 1% decrease in the discount rate would have increased the financial liability by 0.4m.
It has also been estimated that an increase of 10% in the probability used to calculate the contingent consideration would have increased the financial liability by 0.2m, whilst a decrease of 10% in the probability used would have decreased the financial liability by 1.5m.
140 Intertek Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial Statements 11 Trade and other receivables ACCOUNTING POLICY Trade receivables are recognised initially at the value of the invoice sent to the customer and subsequently at the amounts considered recoverable amortised cost.
Estimates are used in determining the level of receivables that will not, in the opinion of the Directors, be collected.
The Group applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, which requires the use of the lifetime expected loss provision for all receivables, including contract assets.
The provision calculations are based on historic credit losses and specific country-risk classifications with higher default rates applied to older balances.
This approach is followed for all receivables unless there are specific circumstances, such as the bankruptcy of a customer or emerging market risks, which would render the receivable irrecoverable and therefore require a specific provision.
A provision is made against trade receivables and contract assets until such time as the Group believes the amount to be irrecoverable, after which the trade receivable or contract assets balance is written off.
In 2017, under IAS 39, impairment losses only related to trade receivables and were calculated based on historical default rates.
No impairment allowance was made for trade receivables less than six months outstanding and the Group provided for trade receivables over 12 months old that were considered irrecoverable, 25% of balances 6 to 12 months old and specific provisions for known doubtful debts regardless of age.
TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES Trade and other receivables are analysed below: 2018 2017 m m Trade receivables 485.2 469.6 Contract assets 99.7 90.4 Other receivables 62.7 51.3 Prepayments 36.8 30.4 Total trade and other receivables 684.4 641.7 Trade receivables and contract assets are shown net of allowance for impairment losses of 16.3m 2017: 24.0m and 9.6m 2017: nil respectively and are all expected to be recovered within 12 months.
Impairment on trade receivables and contract assets charged as part of operating costs was 1.3m 2017: 8.8m and 3.5m 2017: nil respectively.
There is no material difference between the above amounts for trade and other receivables and their fair value, due to their short-term duration.
There is no concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables as the Group has a large number ofcustomers who are internationally dispersed.
The ageing of trade receivables and contract assets at the reporting date was as follows: 2018 2017 m m Under 3 months 489.1 473.3 Between 3 and 6 months 54.2 52.9 Between 6 and 12 months 30.0 24.7 Over 12 months 37.5 33.1 Gross trade receivables and contract assets 610.8 584.0 Allowance for impairment 25.9 24.0 Trade receivables and contract assets, net of allowance 584.9 560.0 Included in trade receivables under three months of 404.9m 2017: 397.0m are trade receivables of 351.9m 2017: 340.6m that are not yet due for payment.
The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables and contract assets during the year was as follows: 2018 2017 Impairment allowance for doubtful trade receivables and contract assets m m At 1January 24.0 23.9 Exchange differences 0.3 2.0 Acquisitions 0.6 Impairment loss recognised 4.8 8.8 Receivables written off 3.8 6.7 At 31December 25.9 24.0 Sensitivity analysis Trade receivables and contract assets are assessed for impairment using a calculated credit loss assumption.
A 0.25% variance in the assumed credit risk factor would impact impairment by 1.9m.
There were no material individual impairments of trade receivables or contract assets.
Intertek Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 141 Financial Statements | Notes to the financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 12 Trade and other payables ACCOUNTING POLICY Trade payables Trade payables are recognised at the value of the invoice received from a supplier.
The carrying value of trade payables is considered approximate to fair value.
Put option over non-controlling interest Put options held by non-controlling interests that arise on acquisition are recognised initially at the present value of the redemption amount.
They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The discount is unwound through SDIs as a finance charge.
TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES Trade and other payables are analysed below: Current Current Non-current Non-current 2018 2017 2018 2017 m m m m Trade payables 154.0 126.7 Other payables 57.3 45.5 18.6 17.5 Accruals 240.0 227.1 2.3 3.6 Contract liabilities 63.8 52.9 5.6 0.5 Total trade and other payables 515.1 452.2 26.5 21.6 The Groups exposure to liquidity risk related to trade payables is disclosed in note 14.
40.8m of contract liabilities at the end of 2017 was recognised in revenue in 2018.
The key assumptions in arriving at the value of the put options over shares held by non-controlling interests are the performance of those businesses: the risk-adjusted discount rate taking into account the risk-free rate and the gross domestic product growth in the countries of those underlying businesses.
13 Provisions ACCOUNTING POLICY A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.

The Group is involved in various claims and lawsuits incidental to the ordinary course of its business.
Theoutcome of such litigation and the timing of any potential liability cannot be readily foreseen, as it is often subject to legal proceedings.
Based on information currently available, the Directors consider that the cost to the Group of an unfavourable outcome arising from such litigation is unlikely to have a materially adverse effect on the financial position of the Group in the foreseeable future.
The provision for claims of 10.4m 2017: 14.0m represents an estimate of the amounts payable in connection with identified claims from customers, former employees and other plaintiffs and associated legal costs.
The timing of the cash outflow relating tothe provisions is uncertain, but is likely to be within one year.
Details of contingent liabilities in respect of claims are set out in note22.
The other provision of 15.7m 2017: 12.6m includes restructuring provisions.
The timing of the cash outflow is uncertain, but islikely to be within one year.
142 Intertek Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial Statements 14 Borrowings and financial instruments ACCOUNTING POLICY Net financing costs Net financing costs comprise interest expense on borrowings: facility fees: interest receivable on funds invested: net foreign exchange gains or losses: interest income and expense relating to pension assets and liabilities: unrealised market or fair value gains or losses on financial assets or liabilities, including contingent consideration: and gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement.
Interest income and interest expense are recognised as they accrue usingthe effective interest rate method.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables.
Loans and receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost less impairment losses including bad debt provision.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Net debt comprises borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.
Non-derivative financial liabilities Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at their amortised cost.
Interest-bearing borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
The fair value of put option liabilities over non-controlling interests is calculated using a present value calculation, incorporating observable and non-observable inputs.
This valuation technique has been adopted as it most closely mirrors the contractual arrangement.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments, including cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign currency forwards, to hedge economically its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational, financing and investment activities.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially and subsequently at fair value: attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss when incurred.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value at each period end is recognised immediately in the income statement except where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting.
The fair value of cross currency interest rate swaps is estimated using the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves.
The fair value of foreign currency forwards is estimated using present value of future cash flows based on the forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
Hedging Hedge of monetary assets and liabilities Where a derivative financial instrument is used economically to hedge the foreign exchange exposure of a recognised monetary asset or liability, no hedge accounting is applied and any gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement in the same caption as the foreign exchange on the related item.
Hedge of net investment in foreign operations The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk exposure arising from its net investment in foreign currency operations and net assets.
The Group uses a combination of debt and cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge foreign exchange risks.
The portion of the gain or loss on an instrument designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity in the translation reserve.
The value in relation to the hedge instrument that is held within the cumulative foreign currency translation reserve is recycled through the income statement.
If the instrument is no longer deemed effective, then future movements in fair value are posted to the income statement.
Cash flow hedges Cash flow hedges comprise derivative financial instruments designated in a hedging relationship to manage interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk to which the cash flows of certain assets and liabilities are exposed.
The Group is exposed to the variability in cash flows arising from the foreign exchange risk exposure in a USD private placement bond.
In accordance with the Groups hedging strategy, the Group has cross currency interest rates swaps designated as cash flow hedges.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative that is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting is recognised in other comprehensive income.
The value in relation to the hedge instrument that is held within the cumulative cash flow hedge reserve disclosed within other reserves is recycled through the income statement.
Intertek Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 143 Financial Statements | Notes to the financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 14 Borrowings and financial instruments continued Impairment A financial asset is assessed for impairment at each reporting date by application of an expected loss model in line with IFRS 9 requirements.
In previous periods an assessment was made to determine whether there was any objective evidence that a balance was impaired.
In line with IAS 39, afinancial asset was considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicated that one or more events had a negative effect onthe estimated future cash flows of that asset.

FINANCIAL RISKS Details of the Groups treasury controls, exposures and the policies and processes for managing capital and credit, liquidity, interestrate and currency risk are set out below, and in the Strategic Report Financial Review that starts on page 60. Credit risk Exposure to credit risk Credit risks arise mainly from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed.
The Group monitors the creditworthiness of customers on an ongoing basis.
The Groups credit risk is diversified due to the large number ofentities, industries and regions that make up the Groups customer base.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
At the reporting date this was as follows: 2018 2017 m m Trade receivables, net of allowance note 11 485.2 469.6 Cash and cash equivalents 203.2 135.9 Total 688.4 605.5 The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date by geographic region was as follows: 2018 2017 m m Asia Pacific 134.1 127.1 Americas 191.8 180.6 Europe, Middle East and Africa 159.3 161.9 Total 485.2 469.6 Counterparty risk Cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing facilities are at risk in the event that the counterparty is not able to meet its obligations in regards to the cash held or facilities available to the Group.
The Group also enters into transactions with counterparties in relation to derivative financial instruments.
If the counterparty was not able to meet its obligations, the Group may be exposed to additional foreign currency or interest rate risk.
Counterparty credit risk inherent in all hedge relationships is monitored throughout the period of the hedge but this risk is not expected to be significant.
The Group, wherever possible, enters into arrangements with counterparties who have robust credit standing, which the Group defines as a financial institution with a credit rating of at least investment grade.
The Group has existing banking relationships with a number ofrelationship banks that meet this criterion, and seeks to use their services wherever possible while avoiding excessive concentration of credit risk.
Given the diverse geographic nature of the Groups activities, it is not always possible to use a relationship bank.
Therefore the Group has set limits on the level of deposits to be held at non-relationship banks to minimise the risk to the Group.
It is also Group policy to remit any excess funds from local entities back to Intertek Group Treasury in the UK.
Given the controls in place, and based on a current assessment of our banking relationships, management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
146 Intertek Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial Statements 14 Borrowings and financial instruments continued Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its obligations as and when they fall due.
The Groups policy is to: ensure sufficient liquidity is available to Group companies in the amounts, currencies and locations required to support the Groups operations: ensure the Group has adequate available sources of funding to protect against unforeseen internal and external events: and avoid excess liquidity which restricts growth and impacts the cost of financing.
To ensure this policy is met, the Group monitors cash balances on a daily basis, projects cash requirements on a rolling basis andfunds itself using debt instruments with a range of maturities.
The following are the contractual cash flows of financial liabilities assets including interest for floating rate instruments, interest payments are based on the interest rate at 31December 2018.

Intertek Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 147 Financial Statements | Notes to the financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 14 Borrowings and financial instruments continued Interest rate risk The Groups objective is to manage the risk to the business from movements in interest rates, and to provide stability and predictability of the near term 12 month horizon interest expense.
Under the Groups Treasury policy, management may fix the interest rates on up to 80% of the Groups debt portfolio for the period of the current financial year.
The Groups debt portfolio beyond this period is to be managed within the range of a 20%-60% fixed-to-floating rate ratio.
To achieve this, the Group uses bank debt facilities, US private placements and cross currency interest rate swaps.
Sensitivity At 31December 2018, it is estimated that the impact on variable rate net debt of a general increase of 3% in interest rates would be a decrease in the Groups profit before tax of approximately 9.6m 2017: 5.4m.
This analysis assumes all other variables remain constant.
Foreign currency risk The Groups objective in managing foreign currency risk is to safeguard the Groups financial assets from economic loss due to fluctuations in foreign currencies, and to protect margins on cross currency contracts and operations.
To achieve this, the Groups policy is to hedge its foreign currency exposures where appropriate.
The net assets of foreign subsidiaries represent a significant portion of the Groups shareholders funds and a substantial percentage of the Groups revenue and operating costs are incurred in currencies other than sterling.
Because of the high proportion of international activity, the Groups profit is exposed to exchange rate fluctuations.
Two types of risk arise as a result: i translation risk, that is, the risk of adverse currency fluctuations in the translation of foreign currency operations and foreign assets and liabilities into sterling: and ii transaction risk, that is, the risk that currency fluctuations will have a negative effect on the value of the Groups commercial cash flows in various currencies.
The foreign currency profiles of cash, trade receivables and payables subject to translation risk and transaction risk, at the reporting date were as follows: Carrying Chinese Hong Kong Other amount Sterling US dollar renminbi dollar currencies 2018 m m m m m m Cash 203.2 26.3 26.4 49.7 1.5 99.3 Trade receivables note 11 485.2 42.6 162.6 48.0 15.6 216.4 Trade payables note 12 154.0 14.0 63.0 16.4 3.4 57.2 2017 Cash 135.9 13.7 10.3 24.3 3.4 84.2 Trade receivables note 11 469.6 43.6 156.7 44.6 14.5 210.2 Trade payables note 12 126.7 13.6 39.8 17.1 3.5 52.7 RECOGNISED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Changes in the fair value of foreign currency forwards that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, and for which no hedge accounting is applied, are recognised in the income statement.
CASH FLOW HEDGE The Group holds a US$150m fixed interest rate USD private placement bond maturing in December 2020.
A proportion of the bond is hedged using 100m USD GBP fixed-to-fixed cross currency swaps maturing in December 2020 to eliminate the changes in the cash flows of the repayment of coupon and principal related to changes in foreign exchange rates.
The timings of both hedge and bond cash flows are expected to match since the maturity profile and coupon profile for bond and hedge matches.
In 2018, 4.4m of the cash flow hedge reserve was recycled through to the income statement to offset the impact of the hedged US$100m bond.
The remaining balance of the cash flow hedge reserve is expected to be recycled through to the income statement up to the expiry of the bond in December 2020.
HEDGE OF NET INVESTMENT IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS The Groups foreign currency denominated loans are designated as a hedge to protect the same amount of net investment in the Group's foreign currency operations and net assets, against adverse changes in exchange rates.
The carrying amount of these loans at 31 December 2018 was 902.8m 2017: 580.4m.
93.8m EUR GBP fixed-to-fixed cross currency swaps maturing in December 2020, including all coupons, are designated as a hedge to protect the same amount of net investment in the Group's Euro operations and net assets, against adverse changes in exchange rates.

The cross currency interest rate swaps are bifurcated into two relationships: 1 A cash flow hedge of US$100m versus GBP foreign currency and interest rate risks in USD denominated borrowings: and 2 A net investment hedge of EUR versus GBP foreign currency risk in EUR denominated net assets of the group.
The weighted average exchange rates of the swaps are GBP USD 1.5207 and EUR GBP 0.7009.
The cross currency interest rate swaps are disclosed within other payables in the statement of financial position.
The critical terms of the swap contracts and their corresponding hedged items are matched and the Group expects highly effective hedging relationships.
Net ineffectiveness on the cash flow and net investment hedges recognised in the income statement was nil.
The carrying values of the hedging instruments: US$ 505m senior notes and RCF drawings US$418m, EUR12.5m, CHF6.5m, AUD45m and CAD22m are included within long-term borrowings within the statement of financial position.

Foreign exchange gains recycled from the cash flow hedge reserve are presented as finance expenses within the income statement.
SENSITIVITY It is estimated that an increase of 10% in the value of sterling against the US dollar the main currency impacting the Group would have decreased the Groups profit before tax for 2018 by approximately 21.1m 2017: 21.6m.
It is estimated that an increase of 10% in the value of sterling against the currencies of the hedging instruments would have increased OCI by approximately 89.8m 2017: 60.6m which would be offset by the retranslation of the Group's investment in foreign operations in the same currencies.

RESERVES Translation reserve The translation reserve comprises foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations as well as the translation of liabilities that hedge the Groups net investment in foreign operations.
Other This reserve includes a merger difference that arose in 2002 on the conversion of share warrants into share capital, as well as the cash flow hedge reserve.
16 Employee benefits ACCOUNTING POLICY Pension schemes Defined contribution plans A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in the income statement as incurred.
Defined benefit plans A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan.
The Groups net obligation in respect of material defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating theamount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior years: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value.
The fair value of any plan assets are deducted.
In calculating the defined benefit deficit, the discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on AA credit-rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Groups obligations and that are denominated in the same currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid.
The calculation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the Projected Unit credit method.
The increase in the present value of the liabilities expected to arise from the employees services in the accounting period is charged to the operating profit in the income statement.
The expected return on the schemes assets and the interest on the present value of the schemes liabilities, during the accounting period, are shown as finance income and finance expense respectively.
The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
In most locations, these are defined contribution arrangements.
However, there are significant defined benefit schemes in the United Kingdom, Hong Kong and Switzerland.
TheUnited Kingdom Scheme and Hong Kong Scheme are funded, with assets held in separate trustee-administered funds and the Switzerland Scheme is an insured scheme.
The schemes in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong were closed to new entrants in 2002 and 2000, respectively.
Other funded defined benefit schemes are not considered to be material and are therefore accounted for as if they were defined contribution schemes.
The Group recognises all actuarial remeasurements in each year in equity through the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
In June 2011, the International Accounting Standards Board issued revisions to IAS 19 Employee Benefits IAS 19 that provide changes inthe recognition, presentation and disclosure of post-employment benefits.
The Group has adopted the revised accounting standard from 1January 2013.
TOTAL PENSION COST The total pension cost included in operating profit for the Group was: 2018 2017 m m Defined contribution schemes 43.1 46.9 Defined benefit schemes current service cost and administration expenses 2.9 3.2 Pension cost included in operating profit note 5 46.0 50.1 The pension cost for the defined benefit schemes was assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries.
The last full triennial actuarial valuation of The Intertek Pension Scheme in the United Kingdom United Kingdom Scheme was carried out asat 1April 2016, and for IAS 19 accounting purposes has been updated to 31December 2018.
The last full actuarial valuation of the Hong Kong Scheme was carried out as at 31December 2016, for local accounting purposes and hasbeen updated to 31December 2018 for IAS 19 purposes.
The Switzerland Scheme was valued for IAS 19 purposes as at31December 2018.
The average duration of the schemes are 20years, 10 years and 15 years for the United Kingdom, Hong Kong and Switzerland schemes respectively.

The pooled investment vehicles are held under a managed fund policy in the name of the Scheme.
Pooled investment vehicles including the Absolute Return Fund LDI Funds which are not traded on active markets, but where the investment manager has provided a monthly trading price, are valued using the last single price, provided by the investment manager at or before the year end.
The Absolute Return Fund aims to provide positive investment returns in all conditions over the mediumto long-term.
The investment managers have a wide investment remit and look to exploit market inefficiencies through active allocation to a diverse range of market positions.
The Fund uses a combination of traditional assets and investment strategies based on derivatives and is able to take longand short-term positions in markets.
The LDI Fund provides the hedge against adverse movements in inflation and interest rates.
It seeks to match the sensitivity of the Schemes liability cash flow tochanges in interest rates and inflation: it is invested in gilts, swaps, futures, repo contracts and money market instruments.
The United Kingdom Scheme had bank account assets of 0.9m as at 31December 2018 2017: 0.5m.
The United Kingdom Scheme invested assets comprise both quoted and unquoted assets.
The value of quoted assets in 2018 was 24.0m 2017: 24.9m, included within equities in the above table, with the remaining assets being unquoted.
All of the invested assets of the Hong Kong Scheme are unquoted.
The Switzerland Scheme is fully insured.

Intertek Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 153 Financial Statements | Notes to the financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 16 Employee benefits continued Life expectancy assumptions at year end for: United Kingdom Scheme Hong Kong Scheme Switzerland Scheme 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 Male aged 40 48.8 49.0 n a n a 42.8 42.8 Male aged 65 22.0 22.1 n a n a 19.7 19.8 Female aged 40 50.9 50.9 n a n a 45.4 45.4 Female aged 65 23.9 24.0 n a n a 21.9 21.9 The retirement arrangement in Hong Kong pays a lump sum to members instead of a pension at the point of retirement.
Since the amount of the lump sum is not related to the life expectancy of the member, the post-retirement mortality is not a relevant assumption for the Hong Kong Scheme.
The table above shows, for the United Kingdom Scheme, the number of years a male or female is expected to live, assuming they were aged either 40 or 65 at 31December.
The mortality tables adopted in 2018 for the United Kingdom Scheme are the S2PA projected by year of birth, based on the CMI 2016 mortality projection model with a 1.25% long-term annual rate for future improvement.
In 2017 the S2PA tables were used, based on the CMI 2016 mortality projection model.
For the Switzerland Scheme, the mortality table adopted in both 2018 and 2017 is the BVG2015, anindustry standard in Switzerland which is based on statistical evidence of major Switzerland pension funds.
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS The table below sets out the sensitivity on the United Kingdom and Hong Kong pension assets and liabilities as at 31December2018 of the two main assumptions: UK Scheme Hong Kong Scheme Increase Increase decrease decrease Liabilities in deficit Liabilities in deficit Change in assumptions m m m m No change 114.5 24.8 0.25% rise in discount rate 109.5 5.0 24.3 0.5 0.25% fall in discount rate 119.8 5.3 25.4 0.6 0.25% rise in inflation 118.2 3.7 n a n a 0.25% fall in inflation 111.0 3.5 n a n a The United Kingdom Scheme is also subject to the mortality assumption.
If the mortality tables used are rated up down one year, the value placed on the liabilities increases by 5.1m and decreases by 5.2m respectively.
FUNDING ARRANGEMENTS United Kingdom Scheme The Trustees use the Projected Unit credit method with a three-year control period.
Currently the scheme members pay contributions at the rate of 8.5% of salary.
The employer pays contributions of 16.4% of salary, plus 0.2m per year to fundscheme expenses, and has made an additional contribution of 2.0m in 2019 to reduce the deficit disclosed by the 2016valuation.
Hong Kong Scheme The Trustees use the Attained Age funding method.
The last actuarial valuation was as at 31December 2016.
Scheme members do not contribute to the scheme.
The employer pays contributions of 11.5% of salaries including 0.6% in respect of schemeexpenses.
Funding Risks The main risks for the schemes are: Investment return risk: If the assets underperform the returns assumed in setting the funding targets then additional contributions may be required at subsequent valuations.
Investment matching risk: The schemes invest significantly in equities, whereas the funding targets are closely related to thereturns on bonds.
If equities fall in value relative to the matching asset of bonds, additional contributions may be required.
Longevity risk: If future improvements in longevity exceed the assumptions made for scheme funding then additional contributions may be required.
Role of Third Parties The United Kingdom Scheme is managed by Trustees on behalf of its members.
The Trustees take advice from appropriate third parties including investment advisors, actuaries and lawyers as necessary.
Guaranteed Minimum Pension Liability On 26 October 2018, the High Court of Justice of England and Wales issued a judgement in a claim between Lloyds Banking Group Pension Trustees Limited the claimant and Lloyds Bank plc defendant that UK pension schemes should equalise pension benefits for men and women for the calculation of their guaranteed minimum pension liability.
This court ruling impacts with the majority of companies with a UK defined benefit plan, including the Intertek Pension Scheme.
Formal calculation of the impact will be undertaken during 2019 as part of the schemes three-yearly valuation process, however, the scheme actuary estimates the impact will not be meaningful to both the Scheme and the Group, based on the schemes demographics.
154 Intertek Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial Statements 17 Share schemes ACCOUNTING POLICY Share-based payment transactions The share-based compensation plans operated by the Group allow employees to acquire shares of the Company.
The fair value of the employee services, received in exchange for the grant of shares, is measured at the grant date and is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The charge is calculated using the Monte Carlo method and expensed to the income statement over the vesting period of the relevant award.
The charge for the Deferred Share Awards is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of vesting for service conditions.
The expense of the LTIP Share Awards is calculated using the Black-Scholes method and is adjusted for the probability of EPS performance conditions being achieved.
The Group has taken advantage of the provisions of IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, andhas recognised an expense only in respect of share awards granted since 7 November 2002.
SHARE PLANS 2011 Long Term Incentive Plan The Deferred Bonus Plan 2005 was replaced in 2011 with the Intertek 2011 Long Term Incentive Plan the 'LTIP'.
Deferred Share Awards previously Share Awards and LTIP Share Awards previously Performance Awards have been granted under this plan.
The first awards were granted on 7 April 2006.
The awards under these plans vest three years after grant date, subject to fulfilment of the performance conditions.
Of the 590,502 awards vested in 2018, 2,587 were satisfied by the issue of shares and 402,266 by the transfer of shares from the ESOT see note 15.
The balance of 185,649 awards represented a tax liability of 9.3m which was settled in cash on behalf of employees by the Group, of which 8.5m was settled by the Company.
Deferred Share Plan Awards may be granted under the Deferred Share Plan 'DSP' ' to employees of the Group other than the Executive Directors of the Company selected by the Remuneration Committee over existing, issued ordinary shares of the Company only.
The DSP was adopted primarily to allow for the deferral of a proportion of selected employees annual bonus into shares in the Company, but may also be used for the grant of other awards such as incentive awards and buy-out awards for key employees in circumstances that the Remuneration Committee deems appropriate.
Awards will normally have a three-year vesting period.
Awards may be made subject to performance conditions and are subject to normal good and bad leaver provisions and malus and clawback.
Of the 32,098 awards vested in 2018, 19,557 were satisfied by the transfer of shares from the ESOT see note 15.
The balance of 12,541 awards represented a tax liability of 0.6m which was settled in cash on behalf of employees by the Group, of which 0.5m was settled by the Company.

19 Capital management The Directors determine the appropriate capital structure of Intertek: specifically how much capital is raised from shareholders equity and how much is borrowed from financial institutions debt in order to finance the Groups activities.
These activities include ongoing operations as well as acquisitions as described in note 10.
The Groups policy is to maintain a robust capital base including cash and debt to ensure the market and key stakeholders retain confidence in the capital profile.
Debt capital is monitored by Group Treasury assessing the liquidity buffer on a shortandlonger-term basis as discussed in note 14.
The Group uses key performance indicators, including return on invested capital and adjusted diluted earnings per share to monitor the capital position ofthe Group to ensure it is being utilised effectively.
The dividend policy also forms part of the Boards capital management policy, and the Board ensures there is appropriate earnings cover for the dividend proposed at both the interim and year end.

In some jurisdictions the Group receives tax incentives see note 6 which are subject to renewal and review and reduce the amount of tax payable.
Where the effect of the laws and regulations is unclear, estimates are used in determining the liability for the tax tobepaid.
The Group considers the estimates, assumptions andjudgements to be reasonable but this can involve complex issues which may take a number of years to resolve.
The Group is also monitoring developments in relation to EU State Aid investigations following the EU Commission opening a State Aid investigation into the Group Financing Exemption in the UKs Controlled Foreign Company regime in October 2017.
In line with current UK tax law, the Group applies this regime.

Basis of preparation These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101.
In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRSs, but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken.
In these financial statements, the Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures: a Cash Flow Statement and related notes: comparative period reconciliations for share capital: disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries: disclosures in respect of capital management: the effects of new, but not yet effective, IFRSs: an additional balance sheet for the beginning of the earliest comparative period following the retrospective change in accounting policy: disclosures in respect of the compensation of Key Management Personnel: and certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement and the disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instrument Disclosures on the basis that the consolidated financial statements include the equivalent disclosures.
As the consolidated financial statements include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken the exemptions under FRS 101 available in respect of IFRS 2 Share Based Payments in respect of Group-settled share-based payments.
The Company proposes to continue to adopt the reduced disclosure framework of FRS 101 in its next financial statements.
Under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and lossaccount.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded to the Companys functional currency, Sterling, using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date.
All foreign exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the profit and loss account except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
