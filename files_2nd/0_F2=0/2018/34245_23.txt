Notes to the financial statements The notes have been grouped into sections under five key categories: 1.
Land bank and other operating assets and liabilities 4. Financing 5.
Other disclosures The key accounting policies have been incorporated throughout the notes to the financial statements adjacent to the disclosure to which they relate.
All accounting policies are included within an outlined box.
1.0 Basis of preparation 1.1 General information Bovis Homes Group PLC the Company is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2018 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and the Groups interest in joint ventures.
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 28 February 2019.
1.2 Basis of accounting The consolidated financial statements of the Company and the Group have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRS IC interpretations as adopted by the European Union and Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Company has elected to take the exemption under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 to not present the Company income statement and statement of comprehensive income.
The Group has applied the following standards for the first time for its annual reporting period commencing 1 January 2018: IFRS9 Financial instruments IFRS15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers The impact of these changes on the Groups financial statements is described in Note 1.7.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently to the Company and the Group where relevant.
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis.
1.3 Going concern The Directors are satisfied that the Group has sufficient resources to continue in operation for the 12 months from date of approval of these financial statements.
The Directors reviewed detailed financial and covenant compliance forecasts covering the period to December 2019 and summary financial forecasts for the following two years.
Having started the year with net cash of 144.9 million, the Group generated a strong operating cash flow during 2018 but also made significantly increased dividend payments, decreasing the net cash position to 126.8 million.
As at 31 December 2018, the Group held cash and cash equivalents of 163.2 million and had borrowings of 36.4 million.
On 3 December 2015, the Group entered into a new 250.0 million committed revolving credit facility that was extended for a further year both during 2016 and early in 2018.
This facility now expires in December 2022 and was fully available for drawdown at 31 December 2018.
For these reasons, the Directors consider it appropriate to prepare the financial statements of the Group and the Company on a going concern basis.
1.4 Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries made up to 31 December.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that are currently exercisable.
The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Associates are any entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the comprehensive income and expense of associates on an equity accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
A joint arrangement is an arrangement over which the Group and one or more third parties have joint control.
These joint arrangements are in turn classified as: Joint ventures whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities: and Joint operations whereby the Group has rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the comprehensive income and expense of its joint ventures on an equity accounted basis and its share of income and expenses of its joint operation within the corresponding lines of the income statement, from the date that joint control commenced.
| Bovis Homes Group PLC 123 Notes to the financial statements continued 1.5 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty The preparation of financial statements in conformity with adopted IFRSs requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
No individual judgements have been made that have a significant impact on the financial statements, other than those involving estimates, which are outlined below.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty for the Group Land held for development and housing work in progress The Group holds inventories which are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
To assess the net realisable value of land held for development and housing work in progress, the Group completes a financial appraisal of the likely revenue which will be generated when these inventories are combined as residential properties for sale and sold.
Where the financial appraisal demonstrates that the revenue will exceed the costs of the inventories and other associated costs of constructing the residential properties, the inventories are stated at cost.
Where the assessed revenue is lower, the extent to which there is a shortfall is written off through the income statement leaving the inventories stated at a realisable value.
To the extent that the revenues which can be generated change, or the final cost to complete for the site varies from estimates, the net realisable value of the inventories may be different.
A review taking into account estimated achievable net revenues, actual inventory and costs to complete as at 31 December 2018 has been carried out, which has identified no material net movement in the carrying value of the provision.
These estimates were made by local management having regard to actual sales prices, together with competitor and marketplace evidence, and were further reviewed by Group management.
Should there be a future significant decline in UK house pricing, then further writedowns of land and work in progress may be necessary.
Further detail on the carrying value of inventories is laid out in note 3.1.
Margin recognition The gross margin from revenue generated on each of the Groups individual sites within the year is recognised based on the latest forecast for the gross margin expected to be generated over the remaining life of that site.
The remaining life gross margin is calculated using forecasts for selling prices and all land, build, infrastructure and overhead costs associated with that site.
There is inherent uncertainty and sensitivity to external forces predominantly house prices and labour costs in these forecasts, which are reviewed regularly throughout the year by management and are addressed on pages 32 to 35.
Dened benefit pension scheme The Group has an active defined benefit pension scheme, which is subject to estimation uncertainty.
Note 5.8 outlines the way in which this Scheme is recognised in the Groups Financial Statements, the associated risks and sensitivity analysis showing the impact of a change in key variables on the defined benefit obligation.
The Company has no sources of estimation uncertainty.
1.6 Segment reporting The Chief Operating Decision Maker, which is the Board, notes that the Groups main operation is that of a housebuilder and it operates entirely within the United Kingdom.
There are no separate segments, either business or geographic, to disclose, having taken into account the aggregation criteria provisions of IFRS8.
1.7 Impact of standards and interpretations effective for the first time The Group has adopted the following new standards and amendments to standards, including any consequential amendments to other standards, with a date of initial application of 1 January 2018: IFRS 9 Financial instruments replaced IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and was effective from 1 January 2018.
Consistent with the disclosure made in the Groups 2017 Annual Report and Accounts, the implementation of the standard has not had a material impact on the Groups or the Companys 2018 financial statements for the following reasons: i.
The Group disposed of its shared equity available for sale assets during 2017 ii.
The Group does not presently hold any complex financial instruments iii.
Any investments in equities for outside of the Bovis Homes Group are immaterial iv.
Any trade debtors are held under standards terms agreed with the customer v. The Group has experienced a low level of default events on its debtors historically and currently has no reason to expect this to change significantly in future vi.
The Group has no reason to expect any impairment or losses on the intercompany balance held between Bovis Homes Group and Bovis Homes Limited | 124 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued IFRS 15, Revenue from contracts with customers replaced IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 Construction contracts, setting out new revenue recognition criteria particularly with regard to performance obligations.
Consistent with the disclosure made in the Groups 2017 Annual Report and Accounts, the implementation of the standard has not had a material impact on the revenue and cash flows reported by the Group for the year ended 31 December 2018.
The reasons for this are outlined by each of the Groups main revenue types below: i.
Private housing: the impact is immaterial as housing revenue is recognised on completion of the single performance obligation of supplying a house ii.
Affordable housing: no or minimal impact as the significant majority of the Groups contracts give the Housing Association control over houses as they are built and the Group the right to payment for work done, and therefore revenue will continue to be recognised over time by reference to the stage of completion of the building works.
Contracts continue to be assessed individually as they are entered into to confirm that these criteria are met.
Where land sales to Housing Associations are fide-linked from housebuilding contracts, land sale revenue will be recognised separately, as was the case prior to the implementation of the new standard iii.
Land Sales: the Group will continue to separate land sales revenue from any significant  performance obligations that may exist within contracts Properties taken in part exchange as consideration for private house sales and then subsequently sold on by the Group will continue to be recognised through cost of sales within the income statement based on the profit or loss made on the resale as they are seen to be incidental to the operations of the business and not a part of its core activities.
Additional disclosure of the Groups contracts with customers is required within the standard and this is included in note 2.0.
Amendment to IFRS 2 Share-based payments, amendment to IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts regarding the implementation of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, amendment to IAS 40 Investment Property, and annual Improvements 2014-2016, have all come into effect with no significant impact on the Group.
1.8 Impact of standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2018, and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements: IFRS16 Leases replaces IAS17 Leases and is effective from 1 January 2019.
The new standard requires all assets held by the Group under lease agreements of greater than 12 months in duration to be recognised as assets within the Balance Sheet, unless they are considered to be of low value.
Similarly, the present value of future payments to be made under those lease agreements must be recognised as a liability.
The Group incorporated the new standard into its accounting policies from 1 January 2019, with the effect that any lease agreements are reviewed against the criteria within the standard to determine whether identifiable assets exist that should be recognised on the Group balance sheet, along with any associated liabilities.
These assets are depreciated over the remaining term of the lease agreement with the cost being taken to the Income Statement, along with service charges and the interest charge calculated on the liability.
Any agreements that are short-term being of less than 12 months duration or low-value less than 3,000 in value in nature are excluded and will continue to be expensed to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis.
Only existing agreements considered to contain leases under IAS17 will be reviewed against the new standard: those not considered to be assets under IAS17 will not be impacted by the new standard.
Based on the Groups analysis of the lease agreements that are currently in place, it is estimated that the new standard will have the effect of increasing the Groups assets by around 4.5m, with a marginally higher increase in the Groups liabilities, resulting in a small reduction in the Groups net assets.
The new standard is also expected to increase the Groups Operating Profit by around 1.5m with an increase of similar magnitude in Financial Expenses.
There will not be any impact on the Groups cash flows.
The Group will adopt the modified retrospective transition approach, whereby an adjustment will be made to equity on 1 January 2019 and prior period financial information will not be restated for the impact of the standard.
Amendment to IAS 28 Investments in Associates and joint ventures, effective from 1 January 2019, which is not expected to have a significant impact on the Groups financial statements.
IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over income tax treatments, effective 1 January 2019, which is not expected to have a significant impact on the Groups financial statements.
| Bovis Homes Group PLC 125 Notes to the financial statements continued 2.0 Result for the year Revenue Revenue is recognised in the income statement when control of each home has passed to the purchaser, which is when legal title is transferred.
Revenue in respect of the sale of residential properties is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of value added tax and discounts, on legal completion.
In certain instances, property may be accepted in part consideration for a sale of a residential property.
The fair value is established by independent surveyors, reduced for costs to sell.
Net sale proceeds generated from the subsequent sale of part exchange properties are recorded as an adjustment to cost of sales.
The original sale is recorded in the normal way, with the fair value of the exchanged property replacing cash receipts.
Cash incentives are considered to be a discount from the purchase price offered to the acquirer and are therefore accounted for as a reduction to revenue.
The Group applies its policy on contract accounting when recognising revenue and profit on contracts.
Revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of contract activity at the balance sheet date.
This is normally measured by surveys of work performed to date.
When it is probable that the total costs on a construction contract will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense in the Income Statement immediately.
The application of this policy requires judgements to be made in respect of the total expected costs to complete for each site.
The Group has in place established internal control processes to ensure that the evaluation of costs and revenues is based upon appropriate estimates.
Revenue is recognised on land sales and commercial property sales from the point of unconditional exchange of contracts as long as there are no significant obligations remaining.
Where the Group still has significant obligations to perform under the terms of the contract, revenue is recognised when the obligations are performed.
When the Group makes sales to joint ventures in which it owns an interest, it will only recognise revenue and profit in the period of the initial transaction to the extent of third parties interests in the joint venture.
The unrecognised element of revenue and profit will be deferred and released to the income statement when the joint venture has sold the assets to which the original transaction with the Group related.
Rental income is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives granted are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income.

Assets and liabilities related to contracts with customers The Group has recognised the following assets and liabilities relating to its existing contracts with customers: 2018 2017 000 000 Contract assets included in inventory 47,546 35,452 Amounts recoverable on contracts 24,160 45,191 Payments on account 11,296 41,352 Contract assets included in inventory relate to work in progress which has not yet been recognised in the Income Statement, in line with the Groups policy for recognition for long term contracts.
Amounts recoverable on contracts represent amounts where the revenue recognised on a long term contract exceeds the value of stage payments that have been made on that contract and payments on account represents positions where stage payments exceed revenue recognised on contracts.
Based on historical trends, management expects in excess of 90% of the payment on account total to be recognised as revenue in the next reporting period.
For contracts in progress at the balance sheet date, contract costs incurred plus recognised profit minus recognised losses to date amounted to 490,022,000 2017: 425,147,000.

The average number of shares is increased by reference to the average number of potential ordinary shares held under option during the year.
This reflects the number of ordinary shares which would be purchased using the aggregate difference in value between the market value of shares and the share option exercise price and fair value of future employee services.
The market value of shares has been calculated using the average ordinary share price during the year.
Only share options which are expected to meet their cumulative performance criteria have been included in the dilution calculation.

Liabilities relating to the Groups financing activities are addressed in section 4.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are shown in section 5.2.
3.1 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads, not including any general administrative overheads, that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value represents the estimated net selling price less estimated total costs of completion of the finished units.
Land held for development, including land in the course of development until legal completion of the sale of the asset, is initially recorded at cost along with any expected overage.
Where, through deferred purchase credit terms, cost differs from the nominal amount which will actually be paid in settling the deferred purchase terms liability, an adjustment is made to the cost of the land, the difference being charged as a finance cost.
Options purchased in respect of land are capitalised initially at cost and written down on a straight-line basis over the life of the option.
Should planning permission be granted and the option be exercised, the option is not amortised during that year and its carrying value is included within the cost of land purchased.
Investments in land without the benefit of planning consent, either through purchase of freehold land or non refundable deposits paid on land purchase contracts subject to residential planning consent, are capitalised initially at cost.
Regular reviews are completed for impairment in the value of these investments, and provision made to reflect any irrecoverable element.
The impairment reviews consider the existing use value of the land and assesses the likelihood of achieving residential planning consent and the value thereof.
Ground rents are held at an estimate of cost based on a multiple of ground rent income, with a corresponding credit created against cost of sales, in the year in which the ground rent first becomes payable by the leasehold purchaser.
Part exchange properties are held at the lower of cost and net realisable value, and include a carrying value provision to cover the costs of management and resale.
Any profit or loss on the disposal of part exchange properties is recognised within cost of sales in the Group Income Statement.

3.2 Trade and other receivables Trade receivables, amounts recoverable on contracts and other debtors do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables and contract assets.
To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables and contract assets have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the age of the outstanding amounts.
The contract assets relate to unbilled work in progress on affordable housing contracts described in note 2.0 and have a historically low level of default, similar to the Groups low default levels on trade receivables.
Other debtors include amounts receivable from the Government in relation to the Help To Buy scheme.

The Groups standard invoice payment terms are 30 days.
The carrying value of amounts due from subsidiary undertakings represents the Companys maximum credit risk.
Interest is charged on these amounts at a rate of 2.3% per annum.
The Directors consider these amounts to be fully receivable at year end.
Receivables which are past due but not impaired are not material.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade receivables approximates to their fair value.
| Bovis Homes Group PLC 129 Notes to the financial statements continued 3.3 Trade and other payables Trade payables Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Trade payables on extended terms, particularly in respect of land, are recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition of the asset to which they relate.
The discount to nominal value which will be paid in settling the deferred purchase terms liability is recognised over the period of the credit term and charged to finance costs using the effective interest rate method.
Government grants Government grants are recognised in the income statement so as to match with the related costs that they are intended to compensate.
Government grants are included within deferred income.
An ageing of land creditor repayments is provided in note 4.7.
4.0 Financing This section outlines how the Group manages its capital and related financing activities.
4.1 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.

| 130 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 4.2 Available for sale financial assets During the year ended 31 December 2017, the Group disposed of or redeemed assets with a fair value of 27.6m, at a profit of 1.2m.
Included within these figures is the disposal of assets with a fair value of 22.3m to PMM Group on 31 October 2017 for 21.5m, net of transaction costs, generating a loss on disposal of 0.8m.
4.3 Bank and other loans Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at fair value, net of direct issue costs, and subsequently at amortised cost.
Finance charges are accounted for on an accrual basis to the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Government grants The benefit on loans with an interest rate below market is calculated as the difference between interest at a market rate and the below market interest.
The benefit is treated as a Government grant.

The facility syndicate comprises six banks.
The facility includes a covenant package, featuring three covenants covering the Groups gearing ratio, consolidated tangible net worth and interest cover.
These covenants are tested semiannually as per the previous facility agreement.
The overall financing cost of the new arrangement is marginally better than the previous facility.
On 11 April 2017 the Group entered into a loan facility agreement with the Homes and Communities Agency in relation to its development at Stanton Cross, Wellingborough.
The facility has a total aggregate of 35 million which the Group has now fully drawn down in order to support the funding of its infrastructure investment on the development with accrued interest making up the balance of the carrying value at 31 December 2018.
The Group will then use an agreed proportion of its proceeds from the development to repay the loan once the aggregate proceeds exceed a threshold level.
The Groups latest estimates indicate that repayments of the loan will begin in 2021 and that the majority of the repayments will be made in periods beyond 5 years from 31 December 2018.
4.4 Net nancing costs Finance costs are included in the measurement of borrowings at their amortised cost to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
The Group is required to capitalise borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction and production of a qualifying asset, as part of the costs of that asset.
Inventories which are produced in large quantities on a repetitive basis over a short period of time are not qualifying assets.
The Group does not generally produce qualifying assets.

| 132 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 4.6 Financial risk management Group The Group seeks to manage its capital in such a manner that the Group safeguards its ability to continue as a going concern and to fund its future development.
In continuing as a going concern, it seeks to provide returns for shareholders over the housing market cycle as well as enabling repayment of its liabilities as a trading business.
The Groups capital comprises its shareholders equity, added together with its net borrowings, or less its net cash, stated before issue costs.
A five year record of its capital employed is displayed on page 151.
Whilst the blended cost of capital is a factor in the Groups decision making in assessing the right blend of shareholders equity and debt financing, the Group has typically preferred to operate within a framework that features relatively low gearing or cash in hand.
This is because the Group recognises that housebuilding can be cyclical, and higher levels of gearing can create profound liquidity risks.
The Group would seek to manage its capital base through control over expenditure, maintenance of adequate banking facilities, control over dividend payments and in the longer term through adjustments to its capital structure.
An important part of capital management for the Group is its financial instruments, which comprise cash, bank and other loans and overdrafts.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group also utilises financial assets and liabilities such as trade payables or receivables that arise directly from operations.
The use of these carries risk: interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Given that the Group trades exclusively in the UK, there is no material currency risk.
Company The Company only trades with other Group entities and is only exposed to credit risk on those intercompany balances.
Interest rate risk Exposure to interest rate risk arises in the normal course of the Groups business and interest rate swaps are used where appropriate to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.
The Group has no exposure to currency risk as all its financial assets and liabilities are denominated in sterling.
Throughout the year, the Groups policy has been that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Effective interest rates and repricing analysis The interest rate profile of the Groups interest bearing financial instrument is set out in note 4.3.
Sensitivity analysis In managing interest rates, the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations in the Groups earnings, given that Group borrowings are variable in terms of interest rate.
Over the longer-term, however, permanent changes in interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings.
For the year ended 31 December 2018, a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates applying for the full year would not have a material impact on the financial statements.
Credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk is limited by the fact that the Group generally receives cash at the point of legal completion of its sales of private houses.
There are certain categories of revenue where this is not the case: for instance, housing association revenues or land sales.
The largest single amount outstanding at the year end was 5.2 million 2017: 4.8 million, which is payable by the end of March 2019.
The Group retains these outstanding balances as trade and other receivables.
The carrying value of trade and other receivables equates to the Groups exposure to credit risk.
The Groups trade and other receivables are secured against the following: 2018 2017 000 000 Consented land 400 7,027 Second charge against property 611 832 Unsecured 64,105 69,659 65,116 77,518 In managing risk the Group assesses the credit risk of its counterparties before entering into a transaction.
This assessment is based upon management knowledge and experience.
In the event that land is disposed of the Group seeks to mitigate any credit risk by retaining a charge over the asset disposed of, so that in the event of default, the Group is able to seek to recover its outstanding asset.
| Bovis Homes Group PLC 133 Notes to the financial statements continued Company The Companys exposure to credit risk is limited as a result of all outstanding balances relating to companies within the Group.
c. Liquidity risk The Groups banking arrangements outlined in note 4.3 are considered to be adequate in terms of flexibility and liquidity for its medium term cash flow needs, thus mitigating its liquidity risk.
The Groups approach to assessment of liquidity risk is outlined in the going concern sub-section in the risk management section on page 30. d. Housing market price risk The performance of the UK housing market affects the valuation of certain of the Groups non-financial assets and liabilities and the critical judgements applied by management in these financial statements, including the valuation of land and work in progress.

Estimation of fair values The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments: Land purchased on extended payment terms When land is purchased on extended payment terms, the Group initially records it at its fair value with a land creditor recorded for any outstanding monies based on this fair value assessment.
Fair value is determined as the outstanding element of the price paid for the land discounted to present day.
The difference between the nominal value and the initial fair value is amortised over the period of the extended credit term and charged to finance costs using the effective interest rate method, increasing the value of the land creditor such that at the date of maturity the land creditor equals the payment required.
Balance at Total contracted Due within Between Between Between Between Due beyond Land creditor 31 Dec cash payment 1 year 1-2 years 2-3 years 3-4 years 4-5 years 5 years estimated ageing 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 2018 293,297 298,186 112,744 105,745 62,725 16,912 15 45 2017 246,742 252,183 168,297 44,377 11,248 8,321 4,390 15,550 Bank and other loans Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest flows.
See note 4.3 for further details.
Trade and other receivables payables Other than land creditors, the nominal value of trade receivables and payables is deemed to reflect the fair value.
This is due to the fact that transactions which give rise to these trade receivables and payables arise in the normal course of trade with industry standard payment terms.
5.0 Other disclosures This section includes all disclosures which are required by IFRS or the Companies Act which have not been included elsewhere in the financial statements.
5.1 Income tax expense Income tax comprises the sum of the tax currently payable or receivable and deferred tax.

The Group does not have any open corporation tax enquiries with the tax authorities.
Recognised directly in Group statement of changes in equity or in the Group statement of comprehensive income 2018 2017 Note 000 000 Relating to actuarial movements on pension scheme Group statement of comprehensive income 5.2 1,083 1,630 Relating to share-based payments Group statement of changes in equity 5.2 113 49 Relating to available for sale financial assets Group statement of comprehensive income 5.2 - 288 Deferred tax recognised directly in Group statement of changes in equity or the Group 970 1,869 statement of comprehensive income 5.2 Tax assets and liabilities The tax currently payable or receivable is based on taxable profit or loss for the year and any adjustment to tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years.
Taxable profit or loss differs from net profit or loss as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability or asset for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from non-tax deductible goodwill, from the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit, and from differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to reserves, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in reserves.
| 136 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued Current tax assets and liabilities The current liability of 18,060,000 2017: 16,855,000 represents the remaining balance of income taxes payable in respect of current and prior years.

This will reduce the Companys future current tax charge accordingly.
The deferred tax asset at 31 December 2018 has been calculated based on these rates.

The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees in the form of share options over shares in the Parent Company.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant calculated using an independent option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The fair value is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest, with a corresponding credit to equity except when the sharebased payment is cancelled where the charge will be accelerated.

In 2014, Bovis Homes Limited entered into a joint venture arrangement with IIH Oak Investors LLP to hold 190 homes under a private rental scheme.
As at 31 December 2018, loans of 1,598,319 2017: 3,714,314 are outstanding with IIH Oak Investors at an interest rate of 6%.
Interest charges made in respect of loans were 118,000 2017: 214,000 In December 2018, Bovis Homes Limited entered into a joint venture arrangement with Clarion Housing Group, with the joint venture purchasing the Groups interest in its land at Plymouth, near Sherford.
Part of this consideration was financed by debt from the Group, with the associated loan balance between the Group and Bovis Latimer Sherford LLP being 22,256,000 at 31 December 2018.
5.7 Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.

5.8 Employee benets The Group accounts for pensions and similar benefits under IAS 19 Revised : Employee benefits.
In respect of defined benefit schemes, the net obligation is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, such benefits measured at discounted present value, less the fair value of the scheme assets.
The discount rate used to discount the benefits accrued is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the Projected Unit Method.
The operating and financing costs of such plans are recognised separately in the income statement: service costs are spread systematically over the lives of employees and financing costs and credits are recognised in the periods in which they arise.
All actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Pension cost note The Company operates a UK registered trust based pension scheme, Bovis Homes Pension Scheme, that provides defined benefits.
Pension benefits are linked to the members final pensionable salaries and service at their retirement or date of leaving if earlier.
The Trustees are responsible for running the Scheme in accordance with the Schemes Trust Deed and Rules, which sets out their powers.
The Trustees of the Scheme are required to act in the best interests of the beneficiaries of the Scheme.
There is a requirement that at least one-third of the Trustees are nominated by the members of the Scheme.
There are two categories of pension scheme members: Deferred members: former active members of the Scheme, not yet in receipt of pension Pensioner members: in receipt of pension.
The defined benefit obligation is valued by projecting the best estimate of future benefit outgoings, allowing for revaluation to retirement for deferred members and annual pension increases for all members and then discounting to the balance sheet date.
The majority of benefits receive increases linked to inflation subject to a cap of no more than 5% pa.
The valuation method used is known as the Projected Unit Method.
The approximate overall duration of the Schemes defined benefit obligation as at 31 December 2018 was 18 years.
| 146 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued Risks Through the Scheme, the Company is exposed to a number of risks: Asset volatility: the Schemes defined benefit obligation is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields, however the Scheme invests significantly in equities and other growth assets.
These assets are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, but provide volatility and risk in the short term.
Changes in bond yields: a decrease in corporate bond yields would increase the Schemes defined benefit obligation, however this would be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Schemes LDI holdings.
Inflation risk: a significant proportion of the Schemes defined benefit obligation is linked to inflation, therefore higher inflation will result in a higher defined benefit obligation subject to the appropriate caps in place.
The majority of the Schemes assets are either unaffected by inflation, or only loosely correlated with inflation, therefore an increase in inflation would also increase the deficit.
However, the caps in place limit the potential impact of higher inflation and the Schemes LDI holdings hedge inflation rate changes to some extent.
Life expectancy: if Scheme members live longer than expected, the Schemes benefits will need to be paid for longer, increasing the Schemes defined benefit obligation.
Liquidity: the Scheme holds a significant direct property investment with low liquidity.
However the majority of the Schemes assets are liquid.
The Trustees and Company manage risks in the Scheme through the following strategies: Diversification: investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.
Investment strategy: the Trustees are required to review their investment strategy on a regular basis.
LDI: the Scheme invests in LDI assets, whose long term investment returns are expected to partially hedge interest rates and inflation movements.
Retirement benefit obligations The Group makes contributions to one defined benefit scheme that provides pension benefits for employees upon retirement.

As a result, all schemes with GMP rights will have to act to allow for equalisation of benefits for the effect of unequal GMPs.
The impact of this change on the Groups obligations has been estimated and is shown as the past service cost in the table above.
Change in scheme assets over the year 2018 2017 000 000 Fair value of scheme assets at beginning of year 126,355 119,004 Interest income 2,976 3,051 Actual benefit payments by the scheme 9,883 4,016 Actual Group contributions 5,798 876 Actual member contributions 19 114 Loss gain on assets 8,018 7,629 Administration costs 651 303 Fair value of scheme assets at end of year 116,596 126,355 The major categories of scheme assets are as follows: 2018 2017 000 000 Return seeking Equities 58,626 77,698 Other Property 11,282 10,724 Cash 1,624 233 Liability driven instruments 45,064 37,700 Total market value of assets 116,596 126,355 All pension scheme assets have a quoted market price in an active market, apart from property investments, which are directly held.
During 2016, scheme assets were invested in cash and liability driven instruments LDIs, moving away from bonds and gilts, and in 2017 and 2018 further scheme assets were invested in LDIs in order to increase the level of liability hedging.
The liabilities within a defined benefit pension scheme are particularly sensitive to changes in the discount rate applied to future liabilities which is determined by the long term yield on investment grade corporate bonds or gilts and the level of inflation see sensitivity analysis table below.
LDIs aim to reduce the exposure of a pension scheme to these risks by holding assets which behave in the same way as the schemes liabilities when interest rates or inflation, or future expectations of them, change.
Sensitivity analysis Change in Change in defined Assumption assumption benefit obligation Discount rate 0.5%pa -0.5%pa -8% 9% RPI and CPI inflation 0.5%pa -0.5%pa 4% -3% Assumed life expectancy 1 year 3% | 148 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued Limitations of the sensitivity analysis These calculations provide an approximate guide to the sensitivity of results and may not be as accurate as a full valuation carried out on these assumptions.
Each assumption change is considered in isolation, which in practice is unlikely to occur, as changes in some of the assumptions are correlated.
The Scheme invests in LDI assets which aim to hedge changes in the value of the Schemes liabilities.
Changes in the discount rate and inflation would therefore be partially offset by a change in the value of the Schemes assets.

The results have been updated to 31 December 2018 for accounting purposes by a qualified independent actuary.
As part of this valuation exercise, the mortality assumptions for the scheme are now based on the SAPS 2 all tables and Core CMI 2016 projections with a long-term rate of improvement of 1.5% pa.
These tables imply the following remaining life expectancy at age 63.
Remaining years of life at 63 Current age at 43 Current age at 63 Men 26.6 24.8 Women 28.6 26.7 The Trustees are required to carry out an actuarial valuation every 3 years.
The latest actuarial valuation of the Scheme was performed by the Scheme Actuary for the Trustees as at 30 June 2016.
This valuation revealed a funding shortfall of 36.1 million however allowing for changes in market conditions and in particular the strong returns on the Schemes assets, the Scheme Actuary estimated that the Schemes shortfall had decreased to around 25m as at 31 December 2017.
In addition, the closure of the Scheme to future accrual was agreed with effect from 28 February 2018.
To eliminate the shortfall at 31 December 2017, the Trustee and the Company agreed that three contributions of 5.5m will be paid into the Scheme by the Company.
The first of these was made on 28 February 2018, with further payments following on 31 January 2019 and 31 January 2020.
Alongside the latest valuation and the recovery plan the Company has also agreed the principles of a longer-term plan to fide-risk the pension scheme assets and liabilities position.
