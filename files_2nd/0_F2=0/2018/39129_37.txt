co. uk Annual Report 2018 Prudential plc 207 B Earnings performance continued B2 Acquisition costs and other expenditure continued B2.2 Share-based payment continued The compensation costs for all awards and options are recognised in net income over the plans respective vesting periods.
The Group uses the Black-Scholes model to value all options and awards other than those which have TSR performance conditions attached some Prudential LTIP and RSP awards for which the Group uses a Monte Carlo model in order to allow for the impact of these conditions.
These models are used to calculate fair values for share options and awards at the grant date based on the quoted market price of the stock at the measurement date, the amount, if any, that the employees are required to pay, the dividend yield, expected volatility, risk-free interest rates and exercise prices.
For all options and awards, the expected volatility is based on the market implied volatilities as quoted on Bloomberg.
The Prudential specific at-the-money implied volatilities are adjusted to allow for the different terms and discounted exercise price on SAYE options by using information on the volatility surface of the FTSE 100.
Risk-free interest rates are taken from government bond spot rates with projections for two-year, three-year and five-year terms to match corresponding vesting periods.
Dividend yields are determined as the average yield over a period of 12 months up to and including the date of grant.
For awards with a TSR condition, volatilities and correlations between Prudential and a basket of 15 competitor companies is required.
For grants in 2018, the average volatility for the basket of competitors was 21.32 per cent.
Correlations for the basket are calculated for each pairing from the log of daily TSR returns for the three years prior to the valuation date.
Market implied volatilities are used for both Prudential and the basket of competitors.
Changes to the subjective input assumptions could materially affect the fair value estimate.
