The net debt to EBITDA ratio is calculated as follows: 2018 2017 m m Adjusted operating profit 264.9 235.5 Depreciation and amortisation of property, plant and equipment, software and development 32.9 32.6 Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation 297.8 268.1 Net debt 235.8 373.6 Net debt to EBITDA 0.8 1.4 The components of net debt are disclosed in Note 25.
Organic measures As we are a multi-national group of companies, which trade in a large number of foreign currencies and regularly acquire and sometimes dispose of companies, we also refer to organic performance measures throughout the Annual Report.
These strip out the effects of the movement of foreign currency exchange rates and of acquisitions and disposals.
The Board believes that this allows users of the accounts to gain a further understanding of how the Group has performed.
Exchange translation movements are assessed by re-translating prior period reported values to current period exchange rates.
Exchange transaction impacts on operating profit are assessed on the basis of transactions being at constant currency between years.
Any acquisitions and disposals that occurred in either the current period or prior period are excluded from the results of both the prior and current period at current period exchange rates.
A reconciliation of the movement in revenue and adjusted operating profit compared to the prior period is given below.

The blended tax rate is calculated using each subsidiary companys headline tax rate as a proportion of its respective profit.
The Groups tax charge includes a credit of 5.0m in relation to certain items excluded from adjusted operating profit as detailed in Note2.
The tax impacts of these items are: amortisation of acquisition-related intangible assets 6.6m tax credit : post-retirement benefit plan in the USA being frozen to future accrual 1.4m tax charge : profit on disposal of subsidiary 0.3m tax charge : and equalising guaranteed minimum pensions GMP for the UK post-retirement benefit plans 0.1m tax credit.
Excluding these adjustments the tax on profit and the effective tax rate are 70.4m and 27.6% respectively.
The other reconciling items credit of 11.5m arises from the sale of the German subsidiary Hygromatik GmbH 10.4m, where 5% of the chargeable gain arising is subject to tax in Germany and from the sale of the Singapore property 1.1m, the gain on which is exempt from tax in Singapore.
A reduction in the US federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective from 1st January 2018, was enacted as part of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on 22nd December 2017.
As a result the US deferred tax assets and liabilities at 31st December 2017 were calculated based on the future blended federal and state tax rate, with a federal tax element of 21%.
This resulted in a deferred tax credit to the Consolidated Income Statement of 24.4m: this is included within the overall credit of 32.1m.
The UK corporation tax rate reduced from 20% to 19% on 1st April 2017.
A further reduction to 17% effective from 1st April 2020 was substantially enacted on 15th September 2016.
This will reduce the Groups future current tax charge accordingly.
Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc 151 Annual Report 2018 Financial Statements Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 9 Taxation continued The UK deferred tax assets and liabilities at 31st December 2018 have been calculated based upon rates of 19% and 17% in respect of deferred tax expected to reverse before 1st April 2020 and after this date respectively.
The Group is aware of the on-going review by the European Commission into the UK Controlled Foreign Company CFC rules that exempts certain transactions by multinational groups from a full CFC apportionment.
Due to the uncertainty of the outcome of this review no provision for any UK corporation tax has been recognised at the date of the Statement of Financial Position, however the potential contingent liability is estimated at approximately 7.1m.
No UK tax after double tax relief for underlying tax is expected to be payable on the future remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries.
The effective tax rate is calculated as a percentage of profit before tax and share of profit of Associate.

These have been estimated using cash flows based on forecast information for the next financial year which have been approved by the Board.
In the case of recent acquisitions detailed four year forecasts are also used: the key assumptions on which the impairment tests are based are the discount and growth rates and the forecast cash flows: pre-tax discount rates range from 10-15% 2017: 10-16% : short-term growth rates vary between 2-8% depending on detailed forecasts 2017: 2-8%.
The short-term is defined as not more than five years: and long-term growth rates are set using IMF forecasts and vary between 0.8-3.0% 2017: 0.8-5.0%.
No impairments were identified as a result of this exercise.
The principal value in use assumptions for the three largest goodwill balances were as follows: Pre-tax Short-term Long-term Cash-generating unit discount rate growth rate growth rate Chromalox 10.6% 5.5-6.1% 2.5% Gestra 11.4% 3.8-5.3% 2.5% Aflex 9.6% 8.0-12.0% 2.5% The results of the Groups impairment tests are dependent upon estimates, particularly in relation to the key assumptions described above.
Sensitivity analysis to potential changes in the key assumptions has been undertaken based on the following reasonably possible sensitivities in isolation: 156 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report 2018 14 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued Key assumption change: A 1.0 % increase in the pre-tax discount rate applied to each cash-generating unit: A 1.0 % reduction in the short and long term growth rates used in the cash flow projections For each cash generating unit, the Directors do not consider that there are any reasonably possible sensitivities for the business that could arise in the next 12 months that would result in an impairment charge being recognised.

A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 3.0m 2017: 2.7m.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 6.9m 2017: 5.7m as it is not considered probable that there will be future taxable profits available against which the relevant deduction can be offset.
The losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
Deferred tax of 1.7m recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income page 134 comprises 1.2m associated with the remeasurement of defined benefit obligations and 0.5m relating to exchange movements.
Other temporary differences mostly consist of deferred tax liabilities recognised on acquired intangibles from acquisitions.
As a result, the US deferred tax assets and liabilities at 31st December 2017 were calculated based on the future blended federal and state tax rate, with a federal tax element of 21%.
This resulted in a reduction in the net deferred tax liability of 21.9m of which 24.4m was recognised as a credit in the income statement and 2.5m recognised as a debit in OCI.

160 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report 2018 24 Employee benefits Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates a wide range of retirement benefit arrangements, which are established in accordance with local conditions and practices within the countries concerned.
These include funded defined contribution and funded and unfunded defined benefit schemes.
Defined contribution arrangements The majority of the retirement benefit arrangements operated by the Group are of a defined contribution structure, where the employer contribution and resulting Income Statement charge is fixed at a set level or is a set percentage of employees pay.
Contributions made to defined contribution schemes and charged to the Income Statement totalled 14.3m 2017: 10.9m.
In the UK, following the closure ofthe defined benefit schemes to new entrants, the main scheme for new employees is a defined contribution scheme.
Defined benefit arrangements The Group operates several funded defined benefit retirement schemes where the benefits are based on employees length of service.
Whilst the Groups primary schemes are in the UK, it also operates other material benefit schemes in the USA as well as less material schemes elsewhere.
In funded arrangements, the assets of defined benefit schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds or similar structures in the countries concerned.
UK defined benefit arrangements The defined benefit schemes in the UK account for approximately half of the Groups net liability for defined retirement benefit schemes.
Spirax-Sarco operates three UK schemes: the Spirax-Sarco Employees Pension Fund, the Spirax-Sarco Executives Retirement Benefits Scheme and the Watson-Marlow Pension Fund.
These are all final salary pension schemes.
The UK schemes are closed to new members but are open to future accrual.
There is a mix of different inflation-dependent pension increases in payment and deferment which vary from member to member according to their membership history and which scheme they are a member of.
All three schemes have been set up under UK law and are governed by a Trustee committee, which is responsible for the schemes investments, administration and management.
A funding valuation is carried out for the Trustees of each scheme every three years by an independent firm of actuaries.
Depending on the outcome of that valuation a schedule of future contributions is negotiated with Spirax Sarco.
Further information on the contribution commitments is shown in the Financial Review on page 53.
During 2018 an assessment of the estimated impact of equalising for the effects of unequal Guaranteed Minimum Pensions GMP was performed resulting in a past service cost of 0.7m recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
US defined benefit schemes The Group operates a pension scheme in the USA, which is closed to new entrants.
During 2018 the pension scheme was frozen to future accrual, which led to a reduction in the Defined Benefit Obligation as benefits are no longer linked to salary increases.
This plan amendment was recognised as a past service credit, of 6.0m, in the Consolidated Income Statement during 2018.
The pension scheme defines the pension in terms of the highest average pensionable pay for any five consecutive years prior to retirement.
No pension increases in payment and deferment are offered by this scheme.
It also operates a post-retirement medical plan in the USA, which is unfunded, as is typical for these plans.
Principal risks The pension schemes create a number of risk exposures.
Annual increase in benefits are, to a varying extent from scheme to scheme, dependent on inflation so the main uncertainties affecting the level of benefits payable are future inflation levels including the impact of inflation on future salary increases and the actual longevity of the membership.
Benefits payable will also be influenced by a range of other factors including member decisions on matters such as when to retire and the possibility to draw benefits in different forms.
A key risk is that additional contributions are required if the investment returns fall short of those anticipated when setting the contributions to the pension schemes.
All pension schemes are regulated by the relevant jurisdictions.
These include extensive legislation and regulatory mechanisms that are subject to change and may impact on the Groups pension schemes.
The IAS 19 liability measurement known as Defined Benefit Obligation DBO and the Service Cost are sensitive to the actuarial assumptions made on a range of demographic and financial matters that are used to project the expected benefit payments, the most important of these assumptions being the future inflation and salary growth levels and the assumptions made about life expectation.
The DBO and Service Cost are also very sensitive to the IAS 19 discount rate, which determines the discounted value of the projected benefit payments.
The discount rate depends on market yields on high-quality corporate bonds.
Investment strategies are set with funding rather than IAS 19 considerations in mind and do not seek to provide a specific hedge against the IAS 19 measurement of DBO.
As a result the difference between the market value of the assets and the IAS 19 DBO may be volatile.
Further information on the investment strategy for the UK schemes can be found in the Financial Review on page 53.
Sensitivity analysis to changes in discount rate and inflation are included on page 165.

Awards were determined by the Remuneration Committee whose objective was to align the interests of employees with those of shareholders by giving an incentive linked to added shareholder value.
Options are subject to performance conditions, which if met make the options exercisable between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
For options granted before 2007 the performance condition is an increase in earnings per share EPS of more than 9% greater than the increase in the UK Retail Price Index over a consecutive three-year period between grant and ten years from date of grant.
From 2007 the performance condition needs to be met over the three-year period from 1st January prior to the date of the grant.
If the condition is not met at the end of the three-year period the option will lapse.

Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc 165 Annual Report 2018 Financial Statements Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 24 Employee benefits continued Performance Share Plan Awards under the Performance Share Plan are made to Executive Directors and other senior managers and take the form of contingent rights to acquire shares, subject to the satisfaction of a performance target.
To the extent that they vest, awards may be satisfied in cash, in shares or an option over shares.
The performance criteria is split into two separate parts.
For awards granted from 2014 40% of the award is based on a TSR measure where the performance target is based on the Companys total shareholder return TSR relative to the TSR of other companies included in the FTSE All-Share Industrial Engineering Sector over a three-year performance period where awards will vest on a sliding scale.
All shares within an award will vest if the Companys TSR is at or above the upper quartile.
25% will vest if the TSR is at the median and the number of shares that will vest will be calculated pro-rata on a straight line basis between 25% and 100% if the Companys TSR falls between the median and the upper quartile.
No shares will vest if the Companys TSR is below the median.
For awards granted from 2014 the second part, amounting to 60% of the award, is subject to achievement of a target based on aggregate EPS over a three-year performance period.
25% will vest if the compound growth in EPS is equal to the growth in the UK Retail Price Index plus 3% and 100% will vest if the compound growth in EPS is equal to or exceeds the growth in the UK Retail Price Index plus 9%, there is pro-rata vesting for actual growth between these rates.
Awards made prior to 2014 had a weighting of 60% TSR and 40% EPS.
From 2015 a change has been made to measure EPS on a point to point basis over the three-year performance period.
From 2016 EPS growth is measured against the growth of global industrial production IP, as published by CHR Economics with thresholds of plus 2% and plus 8%.
Shares awarded under the Performance Share Plan have been valued using the Monte Carlo simulation valuation methodology.

There were no other related party transactions in either 2017 or 2018.
27 Purchase of businesses 2018 In January 2018, we acquired 100% of the share capital of a small German pre-revenue company within the Watson-Marlow Fluid Technology business.
The acquisition method of accounting has been used.
Total consideration on a cash-free, debt-free basis at the acquisition date was expected to be 8.4m 9.5m.
This includes 0.3m to repay a bank overdraft and 0.2m which was deemed to be contingent remuneration rather than consideration under IFRS 3.
2.7m of the total 8.4m was paid on the acquisition date, with a further 5.7m deferred.
The deferred payment is dependent on satisfactory compliance with agreed conditions.
Separately identified intangibles are recorded as part of the provisional fair value adjustment.
The fair value of net assets on acquisition under IFRS 3 were 5.9m consisting of: Acquired intangibles, valued at 7.8m, relating to manufacturing designs, core technology and non-compete undertakings: A deferred tax liability of 1.8m recognised on the acquired intangibles: Property, plant and equipment of 0.2m: and A bank overdraft of 0.3m.
Goodwill of 2.0m was recognised and is not expected to be tax deductible.
Total consideration under IFRS 3 is therefore 7.9m.
In the 12 months ending 31st December 2018 the acquisition generated nil of revenue and a loss of 1.3m.
Had the acquisition been made on the 1st January 2018 the revenue and loss would have been the same.
During the period the deferred consideration we expect to pay was reassessed resulting in a reduction of 0.6m to 5.1m.
During the period the fair value of the assets acquired as part of the acquisition of Chromalox Inc. and associated businesses on 3rdJuly2017 were finalised.
The outcome was an increase to goodwill of 2.2m.
During the period the Group acquired several distributors creating acquired intangibles of 1.3m.

The acquisition of 100% of Chromalox Inc. and associated businesses was completed on 3rd July 2017.
Consideration of 338.6m was paid on completion.
The acquired intangibles relate to brand names and trademarks, manufacturing designs and core technology and customer relationships.
The goodwill recognised represents the skilled workforce acquired and the opportunity to achieve synergies from being part of a larger Group.
Goodwill arising is not expected to be tax deductible.
The acquisition generated 75m of revenue and 14m of adjusted pre-tax profit in 2017 since acquisition.
Had the acquisition been made on the 1st January 2017, the Chromalox revenue and adjusted pre-tax profit in 2017 would have been approximately 146m and 26m respectively.
Chromalox, which has its headquarters in Pittsburgh, USA, is a well-established provider of thermal energy management solutions for industrial process heating and temperature management.
Chromalox is highly complementary to our Steam Specialties business with the decision between using steam or electricity as a heating medium being driven by differing needs of the application or customer circumstances.

Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc 169 Annual Report 2018 Financial Statements Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 29 Derivatives and other financial instruments The Group does not enter into significant derivative transactions.
The Groups principal financial instruments comprise loans, cash and short-term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade debtors and trade creditors, which arise directly from its operations.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
Credit risk The Group sells products and services to customers around the world and its customer base is extremely varied in size and industry sector.
The Group operates credit control policies to assess customers credit ratings and provides for any debt that is identified as noncollectable.
Interest rate risk The Group borrows in desired currencies at both fixed and floating rates of interest as appropriate to the purposes of the borrowing.
Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts, loans, facilities and finance leases as appropriate.
Foreign currency risk The Group has operations around the world and therefore its Consolidated Statement of Financial Position can be affected significantly by movements in the rate of exchange between sterling and various other currencies particularly the US dollar and euro.
The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of this structural currency exposure by borrowing in these currencies where appropriate while maintaining a low cost of debt.
The Group also has transactional currency exposures principally as a result of trading between Group companies.
Such exposures arise from sales or purchases by an operating unit in currencies other than the units functional currency.
Net cash flows between any two currencies of less than 1.0 million per annum would not usually be considered sufficiently material to warrant forward cover.
Forward cover is not taken out more than 24 months in advance or for more than 90% of the next 12 months and 60% of the following 12 months forecast exposure.

Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value.
Fair value of derivative financial instruments are calculated based on discounted cash flow analysis using appropriate market information for the duration of the instruments.
Financial instruments fair value disclosure Fair value measurements are classified into three levels, depending on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from other observable inputs for the asset or liability: and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.
We consider that the derivative financial instruments fall into Level 2.

Currency exposures As explained on page 170, the Groups objectives in managing the currency exposures arising from its net investment overseas in other words, its structural currency exposures are to maintain a low cost of debt while partially hedging against currency depreciation.
All gains and losses arising from these structural currency exposures are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Transactional or non-structural exposures give rise to net currency gains and losses that are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Such exposures include the monetary assets and monetary liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved.

Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc 175 Annual Report 2018 Financial Statements Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 29 Derivatives and other financial instruments continued Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Fair values of financial assets and liabilities at 31st December 2018 are not materially different from book values due to their size or the fact that they were at short-term rates of interest.
Fair values have been assessed as follows: Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are marked to market by discounting the future contracted cash flows using readily available market data.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.
Finance lease liabilities The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at market interest rates for homogeneous lease agreements.
The estimated fair values reflect change in interest rates.
Trade and other receivables payables For receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
Sensitivity analysis In managing interest rate and currency risks, the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the Groups earnings.
Over the longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings.
At the year end borrowings totalled 422.9m 2017: 525.7m.
At 31st December 2018, it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would decrease the Groups profit after tax and equity by approximately 3.1m 2017: 1.5m.
For the year ended 31st December 2018, it is estimated that a decrease of one percentage point in the value of sterling weighted in relation to the Groups profit and trading flows would have increased the Groups profit before tax by approximately 2.3m 2017: 1.8m.
The effect can be very different between years due to the weighting of different currency movements.
Forward exchange contracts have been included in this calculation.
