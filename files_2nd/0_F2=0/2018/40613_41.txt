The Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.
The Companys Ordinary Shares are admitted to the official list of the UK Listing Authority, a division of the Financial Conduct Authority, and traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The registered address of the Company is disclosed in the CompanyInformation.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the StrategicReport.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial information has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB as adopted by the European Union and in accordance with the Companies Act2006and Article 4of the IASRegulations.
The comparative information disclosed relates to the year ended 31December2017.
The Groups financial information has been prepared on a historical cost basis, as modified for the Groups investment properties and interest rate derivatives, which have been measured at fair value through the Group Statement of ComprehensiveIncome.
The consolidated financial information is presented in Sterling, which is also the Groups functional currency, and all values are rounded to the nearest million m, except where otherwiseindicated.
The Group has chosen to adopt EPRA European Public Real Estate Association best practice guidelines for calculating key metrics such as net asset value and earnings pershare www.
Going concern The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis as explained withinAccountability.
Significant accounting judgements,  The preparation of the Groups financial information requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the reporting date.
However, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in futureperiods.
Judgements In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financialinformation: For Company Information, see page 164 For Strategic Report, see pages 1-69 116 Tritax Big Box REIT plc Annual Report 2018 For Accountability, see pages 88-89 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Businesscombinations The Group acquires subsidiaries that own investment properties.
At the time of acquisition, the Group considers whether each acquisition represents the acquisition of a business or the acquisition of an asset.
Under IFRS3, a business is defined as an integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return in the form of dividends, lower costs or other economic benefits directly to investors or other owners, members or participants.
A business will usually consist of inputs, processes and outputs.
Therefore, the Group accounts for an acquisition as a business combination where an integrated set of activities is acquired in addition to theproperty.
Where such acquisitions are not judged to be the acquisition of a business, they are not treated as business combinations.
Rather, the cost to acquire the corporate entity is allocated between the identifiable assets and liabilities of the entity based upon their relative fair values at the acquisition date.
Accordingly, no goodwill or additional deferred taxarises.
In the current and preceding year all acquisitions were accounted for as asset acquisitions as none of the acquisitions included the acquisition of an integrated set of activities.
Estimates Fair valuation of investmentproperty The fair value of investment property is determined, by independent property valuation experts, to be the estimated amount for which a property should exchange on the date of the valuation in an arms length transaction.
Properties have been valued on an individual basis.
The valuation experts use recognised valuation techniques, applying the principles of both IAS40and IFRS13.
The valuations have been prepared in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS Valuation Global Standards July2017 the Red Book.
Factors reflected include current market conditions, annual rentals, lease lengths and location.
The significant methods and assumptions used by valuers in estimating the fair value of investment property are set out in note15.
Summary of significant accounting policies 4.1.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the audited financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, as at the year-enddate.
Subsidiaries Where the Company has control over an investee, it is classified as a subsidiary.
The Company controls an investee if all three of the following elements are present: power over the investee, exposure to variable returns from the investee and the ability of the investor to use its power to affect those variable returns.
Control is reassessed wherever facts and circumstances indicate that there may be a change in any of these elements ofcontrol.
Segmental information The Directors are of the opinion that the Group is engaged in a single segment business, being the investment in the United Kingdom in Big Box assets.
The Directors consider that these properties have similar economic characteristics and as a result these individual properties have been aggregated into a single reportable operatingelement.

Investment property and investment property under construction Investment property comprises completed property that is held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation, or both.
Property held under a lease is classified as investment property when it is held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both, rather than for sale in the ordinary course of business or for use in production or .
The corresponding entry upon recognising lease incentives or fixed minimum rental uplifts is made to investment property.
For further details please see Accounting Policy note4.9.
Investment property is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred and is measured initially at cost including transaction costs.
Transaction costs include transfer taxes, professional fees for legal services and other costs incurred in order to bring the property to the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating.
Subsequent to initial recognition, investment property is stated at fair value.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair values are included in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year in which they arise under .
Investment properties under construction are financed by the Group where the Group enters into contracts for the development of a pre-let property under a funding agreement.
All such contracts specify a fixed amount of consideration.
The Group does not expose itself to any speculative development risk as the proposed building is pre-let to a tenant under an agreement for lease and the Group enters into a fixed price development agreement with the developer.
It does, however, undertake certainworks including demolition, remediation and other site preparatory works to bring a site to the condition ready for construction of an asset.
Investment properties under construction are initially recognised at cost including any associated costs, which reflect the Groups investment in the assets.
Subsequently, the assets are remeasured to fair value at each reporting date.
The fair value of investment properties under construction is estimated as the fair value of the completed asset less any costs still payable in order to complete, which include an appropriate developersmargin.
Additions to properties include costs of a capital nature only.
Expenditure is classified as capital when it results in identifiable future economic benefits, which are expected to accrue to the Group.
All other property expenditure is expensed in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income asincurred.
Investment properties cease to be recognised when they have been disposed of or withdrawn permanently from use and no future economic benefit is expected from disposal.
The difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset would result in either gains or losses at the retirement or disposal of investment property.
Any gains or losses are recognised in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year of retirement ordisposal.

Financial Instruments Fair value hierarchy Level 1: Quoted unadjusted market prices in active markets for identical assets orliabilities.
Level 2: Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectlyobservable.
Level 3: Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement isunobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by reassessing categorisation at the end of each reportingperiod.
Financial assets The Group classifies its financial assets into one of the categories discussed below, depending on the purpose for which the asset was acquired.
The Groups accounting policy for each category is as follows: Fair value through profit or loss This category comprises in-the-money derivatives and out-of-money derivatives where the time value offsets the negative intrinsic value see Financial liabilities section for out-of-money derivatives classified as liabilities.
They are carried in the Statement of Financial Position at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income in the finance income or expense line.
Other than derivative financial instruments which are not designated as hedging instruments, the Group does not have any assets held for trading nor does it voluntarily classify any financial assets as being at fair value through profit orloss.
Amortised cost These assets arise principally from the provision of goods and services to customers eg trade receivables, but also incorporate other types of financial assets where the objective is to hold these assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest.
They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to their acquisition or issue and are subsequently carried at amortised cost being the effective interest rate method, less provision forimpairment.
Impairment provisions for current and non-current trade receivables are recognised based on the simplified approach within IFRS 9 using a provision matrix in the determination of the lifetime expected credit losses.
During this process the probability of the non-payment of the trade receivables is assessed.
This probability is then multiplied by the amount of the expected loss arising from default to determine the lifetime expected credit loss for the trade receivables.
For trade receivables, which are reported net, such provisions are recorded in a separate provision account with the loss being recognised within cost of sales in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
On confirmation that the trade receivable will not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset is written off against the associatedprovision.
The Groups financial assets measured at amortised cost comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.

Summary of significant accounting policies continued 4.5.
Financial Liabilities The Group classifies its financial liabilities into one of two categories, depending on the purpose for which the liability was acquired.
The Groups accounting policy for each category is as follows: Fair value through profit or loss This category comprises out-of-the-money derivatives where the time value does not offset the negative intrinsic value see Financial assets for in-the-money derivatives and out-of-money derivatives where the time value offsets the negative intrinsic value.
They are carried in the Group Statement of Financial Position at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Other than these derivative financial instruments, the Group does not have any liabilities held for trading nor has it designated any financial liabilities as being at fair value through profit or loss.
Other financial liabilities Other financial liabilities include the following items: Bank borrowings and the Groups loan notes are initially recognised at fair value net of any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the instrument.
Such interest bearing liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, which ensure that any interest expense over the period to repayment is at a constant rate on the balance of the liability carried in the Group Statement of Financial Position.
For the purposes of each financial liability, interest expense includes initial transaction costs and any premium payable on redemption, as well as any interest or coupon payment while the liability is outstanding.
Forward funded prelet investments The Group enters into forward funding development agreements for pre-let investments.
The Group will enter into a forward funding agreement with a developer and simultaneously enter into an agreement for lease with a prospective tenant willing to occupy the building oncecomplete.
Licence fees receivable During the period between initial investment in a forward funded agreement and the rent commencement date under the lease, the Group receives licence fee income.
This is payable by the developer to the Group throughout this period and typically reflects the approximate level of rental income that is expected to be payable under the lease, as and when practical completion isreached.
IAS40.20states that investment property should be recognised initially at cost, being the consideration paid to acquire the asset, therefore such licence fees are deducted from the cost of the investment and are shown as a receivable.
Any economic benefit of the licence fee is reflected within the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income as a movement in the fair value of investment property and not within gross rental income.
In addition, IAS16.21indicates that income and expenses from operations that are not to bring an asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended, should be recognised in profit orloss.
Share based payments The expense relating to share based payments is accrued over the year in which the service is received and is measured at the fair value of those services received.
The extent to which the expense is not settled at the reporting period end is transferredto a liability with a view that there is an expectation that the payment will be settled in cash.
Contingently issuable shares are treated as dilutive to the extent that based on market factors prevalent at the reporting period date, the shares would beissuable.
120 Tritax Big Box REIT plc Annual Report 2018 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 4.8.
Dividends payable to Shareholders Equity dividends are recognised when they become legally payable.
Interim equity dividends are recognised when paid.
Final equity dividends are recognised when approved by the Shareholders at an Annual GeneralMeeting.
Rental income Rental income arising from operating leases on investment property is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in gross rental income in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income.
A rental adjustment is recognised from the rent review date in relation to unsettled rent reviews, where the Directors are reasonably certain that the rental uplift will beagreed.
Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are recognised as an expense over the lease term on the same basis as the lease income.
Rental income is invoiced, either monthly or quarterly in advance and, for all rental income that relates to a future period, this is deferred and appears within current liabilities on the Group Statement of FinancialPosition.
For leases, which contain fixed or minimum uplifts, the rental income arising from such uplifts is recognised on a straight-line basis over the leaseterm.
Tenant lease incentives are recognised as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease together with any further term for which the tenant has the option to continue the lease where, at the inception of the lease, the Directors are reasonably certain that the tenant will exercise thatoption.
Amounts received from tenants to terminate leases or to compensate for dilapidations are recognised in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income when the right to receive themarises.
When the Group enters into a forward funded transaction, the future tenant signs an agreement for lease.
No rental income is recognised under the agreement for lease, but once practical completion has taken place the formal lease is signed, at which point rental income commences to be recognised in the Group Statement of ComprehensiveIncome.
Service charges, insurances and other expenses recoverable from tenants Income arising from expenses recharged to tenants is recognised in the year in which the compensation becomes receivable.
Service and insurance charges and other such receipts are included in net rental income gross of the related costs, as the Directors consider that the Group acts as principal in thisrespect.
Finance income Finance income is recognised as interest accrues on cash balances held by the Group.
Interest charged to a tenant on any overdue rental income is also recognised within financeincome.
Finance costs Finance costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with bank and other borrowings.
Any finance costs that are separately identifiable and directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of an asset that takes aperiod of time to complete are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset.
All other finance costs are expensed to the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which theyoccur.
Taxation Taxation on the profit or loss for the period not exempt under UK REIT regulations comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax is expected tax payable on any non-REIT taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the period end date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previousyears.

Standards issued and effective from 1January2018 The following new standards are effective and have been adopted for the year ended 31December2018.
Standards in issue and effective from 1January 2018 IFRS9: Financial Instruments IFRS9 has replaced IAS 39 Financial lnstruments: Recognition and Measurement lAS 39.
Management have reviewed the requirements of IFRS9.
The Groups principal financial assets comprise interest rate derivatives which will continue to be measured at fair value, and trade receivables, which will continue to be measured at amortised cost.
The following changes have been identified.
a The Group adopted the expected credit loss model when calculating impairment losses on its financial assets measured at amortised costs such as trade and other receivables both current and non-current.
This resulted in greater judgement due to the need to factor in forward looking information when estimating the appropriate amount of provisions.
To measure expected credit losses the Group considered the probability of a default occurring over the contractual life of its trade receivables.
Historically the Group has not had to provide or write off any debt from tenants.
The specific situation of each tenant has been evaluated using a provision matrix as allowed under IFRS9.
Based on this assessment the impact is notmaterial.
b ln 2017, the Group renegotiated some of the terms and conditions of a long-term loan, but that did not result in derecognition of the loan as the revised terms were neither qualitatively nor quantitatively different from the original terms.
Therefore this was considered a modification rather than an extinguishment.
Under IAS39, the effective interest rate was updated so as to amortise the revised expected cash flows over the revised term.
In accordance with IFRS9 it is not appropriate to revise the original effective interest rate.
The impact of this change was not material.
IFRS15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS15 has replaced IAS18 Revenue and IAS11 Construction Contracts.
The majority of the Groups revenue is derived from leases that are outside the scope of IFRS15 and accordingly the adoption has not had a materialimpact.
Standards issued but not yet effective IFRS16: Leases effective 1January2019 The Directors are currently assessing the impact on the financial statements of this standard: however, at present they do not anticipate that the adoption of this will have a material impact on the Groups financial statements as the Group does not hold any material operating leases aslessee.

126 Tritax Big Box REIT plc Annual Report 2018 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Adjusted earnings is a performance measure used by the Board to assess the level of the Groups dividend payments.
The metric reduces EPRA earnings by interest paid to service debt that was capitalised and removes other non-cash items credited or charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Licence fees receivable during the year are added to earnings on the basis noted below as the Board sees these cash flows as supportive of dividend payments.
The Board compares the Adjusted earnings to the available distributable reserves when considering the level of dividend topay.
The adjustment for licence fees receivable is calculated by reference to the fraction of the total period of completed construction during the year, multiplied by the total licence fee receivable on a given forward funded asset.
Licence fees will convert into rental income once practical completion has occurred and therefore the rental income will flow into Adjusted earnings from thispoint.
Fixed rental uplift adjustments relate to adjustments to net rental income on leases with fixed or minimum uplifts embedded within their review profiles.
The total minimum income recognised over the lease term is recognised on a straight-line basis and therefore not supported by cash flows during the early term of the lease, but this reverses towards the end of thelease.

Investment property In accordance with IAS40: Investment Property, the investment property has been independently valued at fair value by CBRE Limited CBRE, an accredited independent valuer with a recognised and relevant professional qualification and with recent experience in the locations and categories of the investment properties being valued.
The valuations have been prepared in accordance with the RICS Valuation Global Standards July2017 the Red Book and incorporate the recommendations of the International Valuation Standards and the RICS valuation Professional Standards UK January2014 Revised April2015 which are consistent with the principles set out inIFRS13.
The Valuer in forming its opinion make a series of assumptions, which are typically market related, such as net initial yields and expected rental values and are based on the Valuers professional judgement.
The Valuer has sufficient current local and national knowledge of the particular property markets involved and has the skills and understanding to undertake the .
The valuations are the ultimate responsibility of the Directors.
Accordingly, the critical assumptions used in establishing the independent valuation are reviewed by theBoard.
All corporate acquisitions during the year have been treated as asset purchases rather than business combinations.

The valuations have been prepared on the basis of Market Value MV, which is defined in the RICS Valuation Standards, as: The estimated amount for which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arms-length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and withoutcompulsion.
Market Value as defined in the RICS Valuation Standards is the equivalent of fair value underIFRS.
The following descriptions and definitions relating to valuation techniques and key unobservable inputs made in determining fair values areasfollows: Valuation techniques: market comparable method Under the market comparable method or market comparable approach, a propertys fair value is estimated based on comparable transactions in themarket.
Unobservable input: passing rent The rent per square foot at which space could be let in the market conditions prevailing at the date of valuation range: 4.05-10.75 perannum.
Passing rents are dependent upon a number of variables in relation to the Groups property.
These include: size, location, tenant covenant strength and terms of thelease.
Unobservable input: rental growth The estimated average increase in rent based on both market estimations and contractual arrangements.
A reduction of the estimated future rental growth in the valuation model would lead to a decrease in the fair value of the investment property and an inflation of the estimated future rental growth would lead to an increase in the fair value.
No quantitative sensitivity analysis has been provided for estimated rental growth as a reasonable range would not result in a significant movement in fairvalue.
Unobservable input: net initial yield The net initial yield is defined as the initial gross income as a percentage of the market value or purchase price as appropriate plus standard costs of purchase range:3.75%-6.47%.

The Group applies the IFRS9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses using a lifetime expected credit loss provision for trade receivables.
To measure expected credit losses on a collective basis, trade receivables are grouped based on similar credit risk andageing.
The expected loss rates are based on the Groups historical credit losses experienced over the three-year period prior to the period end.
The historical loss rates are then adjusted for current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the Groups customers.
Both the expected credit loss provision and the incurred loss provision in the current and prior year are immaterial.
Noreasonably possible changes in the assumptions underpinning the expected credit loss provision would give rise to a material expected credit loss.

Interest rate derivatives To mitigate the interest rate risk that arises as a result of entering into variable rate loans, the Group has entered into a number of interest rate derivatives.
A number of interest rate caps and one interest rate swap have been taken out in respect of the Groups variable rate debt to fix or cap the rate to which 3month Libor can rise.
Each runs coterminous to the initial term of the respectiveloans.
The weighted average capped rate, excluding any margin payable, for the Group as at the year end was 1.26% 2017: 1.26%, which effectively caps the level to which Libor can rise to, therefore limiting any effect on the Group of an interest rate rise.
The interest rate derivatives mean that the Groups borrowing facilities at the year end have an all-inclusive interest rate payable of 2.63% 2017: 2.66%.

The fair value is determined by comparing the discounted future cash flows using the contracted yields with the reference gilts plus the margin implied.
The reference Gilts used were the Treasury 4.25% 2027Gilt and Treasury 4.75%2030Gilt respectively, with an implied margin that is unchanged since the date of fixing.
The loans are considered to be a Level 2fair value measurement.
For all other bank loans there is considered no other difference between fair value and carryingvalue.
The fair value of financial liabilities traded on active liquid markets, including the 2.625% Bonds2026and 3.125% Bonds2031, is determined with reference to the quoted market prices.
These financial liabilities are considered to be a Level 1fair valuemeasure.

Risk management The Group is exposed to market risk including interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Board of Directors oversees the management of these risks.
The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks that are summarisedbelow.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair values of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
The financial instruments held by the Group that are affected by market risk are principally the Groups cash balances, bank borrowings along with a number of interest rate derivatives entered into to mitigate interest raterisk.
The Group monitors its interest rate exposure on a regular basis.
A sensitivity analysis performed to ascertain the impact on the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income and net assets of a 50basis point shift in interest rates would result in an increaseof 0.59million 2017:0.30million or a decrease of 0.86million 2017: 0.30million.
The difference between the increase and decrease absolute figure is due to the interest rate caps in place.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss.
The Group is exposed to credit risks from both its leasing activities and financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions.
Credit risk is mitigated by tenants being required to pay rentals in advance under their lease obligations.
The credit quality of the tenant is assessed based on an extensive credit rating scorecard at the time of entering into a leaseagreement.
Outstanding trade receivables are regularly monitored.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financialasset.
Trade receivables Trade receivables, primarily tenant rentals, are presented in the Group Statement of Financial Position net of allowances for doubtful receivables and are monitored on a case by case basis.
Credit risk is primarily managed by requiring tenants to pay rentals in advance and performing tests around strength of covenant prior toacquisition and on an ongoing annual basis.
Please refer to note17 for details regarding credit risk management of tradereceivables.
Tritax Big Box REIT plc Annual Report 2018 137 Financial Statements: Notes to the Consolidated Accounts 22.
Financial risk management continued Credit risk related to financial instruments and cash deposits One of the principal credit risks of the Group arises with the banks and financial institutions.
The Board of Directors believes that the credit risk on short-term deposits and current account cash balances is limited because the counterparties are banks, who are committed lenders to the Group, with high credit ratings assigned by international .
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk arises from the Groups management of working capital and, going forward, the finance charges, principal repayments on its borrowings and its commitments under forward funded development arrangements.
It is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due, as the majority of the Groups assets are property investments and are therefore not readily realisable.
The Groups objective is to ensure it has sufficient available funds for its operations and to fund its capital expenditure.

Capital management The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure that it remains a going concern and continues to qualify for UK REITstatus.
The Board, with the assistance of the Investment Manager, monitors and reviews the Groups capital so as to promote the long-term success of the business, facilitate expansion and to maintain sustainable returns for Shareholders.
The Group considers proceeds from share issuances, bank borrowings and retained earnings as capital.
The Groups policy on borrowings is as set outbelow: The level of borrowing will be on a prudent basis for the asset class, and will seek to achieve a low cost of funds, while maintaining flexibility in the underlying security requirements, and the structure of both the portfolio and the REITGroup.
The Directors intend that the Group will maintain a conservative level of aggregate borrowings with a medium-term limit of 40% of the Groups grossassets.
The Group has complied with all covenants on its borrowings up to the date of this report.
All of the targets mentioned above sit comfortably within the Groups covenant levels, which include loan to value LTV, interest cover ratio and loan to projected project cost ratio.
Debt is secured at the asset and corporate level, subject to the assessment of the optimal financing structure for the Group and having consideration to key metrics including lender diversity, debt type and maturityprofiles.
