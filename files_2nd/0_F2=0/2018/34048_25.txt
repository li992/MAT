CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING This section details the Groups capital structure and associated distributions.
This includes amounts available and utilised in the form of external borrowings.
Net debt as defined by the Group represents the external borrowings utilised, less available cash.
This does not include Partner Finance borrowings or finance lease liabilities, which are asset-backed facilities and are therefore presented separately.
This section also includes the amounts raised from shareholders in the form of share capital and the capital transactions which have occurred during the year, which include dividends paid.
The Group uses share based incentive schemes as part of its overall remuneration policy.
These are discussed in more detail in accounting policy q and note 25.
Bank borrowings As at As at 1 April 2018 2 April 2017 m m Non-current Bank borrowings 256.9 254.9 Current Bank borrowings 70.0 90.0 In February 2017 the Group agreed a 500m multi-currency facility, including a 250m revolving facility and a 250m term loan.
The term loan was drawn down in full and 90m of the revolving facility was initially drawn down, net of transaction costs of 2.9m, and used to repay the previous debt facility held within the Group.
The facility will run until February 2021 with an option for a further 12 months by mutual consent, with no repayment of the term loan due before that time.
Carrying amounts are stated net of unamortised transaction costs.
The transaction costs, together with the interest expense, are being allocated to the income statement over the term of the facility at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
The fair value of bank borrowings is equal to the nominal value of the bank loan as the impact of discounting is not significant.
The fair value of gross bank borrowings is 328.9m 2017: 347.6m which is equal to the nominal value.
The effective interest rate including the impact of non-utilisation fees on the revolving facility and the utilisation fees for the letters of credit drawn down from the revolving facility, as well as the amortisation of debt issue costs is 2.3% 2017: 3.0%.
The Groups principal bank loans at 1 April 2018 were denominated in Sterling 276.3m 2017: 296.3m and Euros 60.0m 2017: 60.0m, and bear variable interest based on LIBOR and EURIBOR respectively.
They were secured by a fixed and floating charge over the Groups present and future assets.
At 1 April 2018, the Group had issued letters of credit in the ordinary course of business of 4.4m 2017: 5.5m and had drawn down 70.0m 2017: 90.0m on the revolving facility, leaving the following as undrawn borrowing facilities: As at As at 1 April 2018 2 April 2017 m m Floating rate borrowings Expiring beyond one year 175.6 154.5 For more information about the Groups exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risk see note 27.
Partner Finance borrowings The Group has an asset-backed finance facility to fund the Partner Finance business.
During the year, Partner Finance completed the syndication and extension of the BCA Partner Finance facility, increasing the facility to 200.0m on comparable terms.
The amount is advanced solely to a Partner Finance subsidiary in respect of specific receivables.
Interest is charged on the drawn down element of the facility at a variable rate of interest, based on the Bank of England base rate.

Share based payments During the year ended 1 April 2018, share based incentives were in place for senior executives within the Group.
These arrangements were based around shares in H. I. J.
Limited H. I. J. and were subject to the Share Incentive Scheme Cap the Incentive Cap, which restricts the aggregate value of all share incentives in place to a maximum value of 10% of the growth in Shareholder Value, which is broadly defined as the increase in market capitalisation of all Ordinary shares of the Company issued up to the date of vesting, allowing for any dividends and other capital movements.
The Group had the option to settle all incentives in issue either for cash or in exchange for Ordinary shares at its discretion.
Throughout their existence it has been assumed that the incentives would be equity settled and the accounting treatment has been applied accordingly.
There were two incentive schemes in place during the year ended 1 April 2018, the H. I. J. scheme which applies to the Company and the Group and the Performance based scheme which applies to the Group only.
a The H. I. J. scheme The H. I. J. scheme was subject to both a growth condition and the satisfaction of at least one of the vesting conditions.
Growth condition The growth condition required that the average compound annual growth of the Companys equity value must be at least 10% per annum.
The growth condition was measured from 10 November 2014, when the Company was admitted to trading on AIM AIM Admission and took into account new shares issued, dividends and capital returned to shareholders.
Vesting conditions At least one of the vesting conditions must be and continue to be satisfied: a sale of all or a material part of the business of H. I. J. Ltd: a sale of all of the issued Ordinary shares of H. I. J. Ltd occurring: a winding up of the H. I. J. Ltd occurring: a sale or change of control of the Company: or it is later than the third anniversary of AIM Admission.
b The performance based scheme The performance based scheme was subject to the same growth condition and vesting conditions described above and in addition was also subject to further performance conditions.
Performance conditions The performance conditions were based on the businesss key performance indicators KPIs' including volumes, average revenue unit and EBITDA.
Under these measures, points accrued over a three year period ending 1 April 2018, which determined the proportion of the scheme to vest, up to a maximum of 1.5% of the growth in Shareholder Value.
Scheme movements The H. I. J. scheme was exercised in full on 18 December 2017.
This resulted in the issue of 24,009,071 Ordinary shares, which were issued in exchange for the H. I. J. shares held.
At the time of exercise the share price was 2.08.
The performance based scheme qualified in full for the 1.50% participation in increase in Shareholder Value and was settled on 18 April 2018, by the transfer of 2,254,554 Ordinary shares held in treasury by the Company, representing the net amount after deduction of income tax and employee National Insurance contributions.
No exercise price was payable in respect of these shares, which were issued when the share price was 1.78.

The Groups share based payments were valued at inception by independent valuation experts.
The share based incentives were assumed to be equity-settled and have been accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2.
The value of the services received in exchange for the share based incentives is measured by reference to the fair value of the incentives at their grant date.
The fair value is recognised in the consolidated income statement, together with a corresponding increase in shareholders equity, on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will ultimately vest.
Vesting conditions, other than market conditions, are not taken into account when estimating the fair value.
Market conditions are those conditions that are linked to the share price of the Group.
At the end of each reporting period the Group revises its estimates of the number of shares that are expected to vest due to non-market conditions.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the consolidated income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to shareholders equity.
At the year end, all outstanding share based incentives were expected to vest in full.
During the year, 2.0m year ended 2 April 2017: 1.6m has been recognised in the consolidated income statement as a charge in relation to the share based incentives.
