Gross deductible temporary differences of 596.9m 2017: 522.9m have not been recognised due to restrictions in the availability of their use.
This includes 178.0m of accumulated tax losses at Virgin Trains East Coast which have not been recognised as an asset in the consolidated financial statements due to significant doubt over the Groups ability to access and utilise these losses.
This also includes 410.6m of accumulated tax losses in North America which have not been recognised as an asset in the consolidated financial statements due to the uncertainty on the Groups ability to utilise these losses in the foreseeable future.
Of these losses, 81.3m expire before 27 April 2019.
The deferred tax balances have been calculated with reference to the enacted UK corporation tax rates of 19% from 1 April 2017 and 17% from 1 April 2020 2017: as 2018 except for 20% to 31 March 2017 and a combined US federal and state tax rate of 26%.
