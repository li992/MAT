C Balance sheet notes continued C8 Tax assets and liabilities continued C8.1 Deferred tax continued The taxation regimes applicable across the Group often apply separate rules to trading and capital profits and losses.
The distinction between temporary differences that arise from items of either a trading or capital nature may affect the recognition of deferred tax assets.
For the 2018 results and financial position at 31 December 2018 the following tax benefits have not been recognised: 31 Dec 2018 31 Dec 2017 Tax benefit m Losses bn Tax benefit m Losses bn Capital losses 49 0.2 79 0.4 Trading losses 49 0.2 74 0.3 Of the unrecognised trading losses, losses of 34 million will expire within the next 10 years, the rest have no expiry date.
Some of the Groups businesses are located in jurisdictions in which a withholding tax charge is incurred upon the distribution of earnings.
Deferred tax liabilities of 117 million 2017: 120 million have not been recognised in respect of such withholding taxes as the Group is able to control the timing of the distributions and it is probable that the timing differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
C8.2 Current tax Of the 618 million 31 December 2017: 613 million current tax recoverable, the majority is expected to be recovered in one year or less.
The current tax recoverable includes 112 million in relation to the litigation relating to the historic tax treatment of dividends received from overseas portfolio investments of life insurance companies.
The Prudential Assurance Company Limited PAC was the test case for the litigation.
In July 2018, the UK Supreme Court ruled in PACs favour on most of the substantive issues.
PAC and HM Revenue & Customs HMRC are working through the mechanics of implementing the Supreme Court decision.
PAC expects to receive full and final repayment from HMRC in 2019.
The current tax liability of 568 million 31 December 2017: 537 million includes 149 million 31 December 2017: 139 million of provisions for uncertain tax matters.

C9 Defined benefit pension schemes i Background and summary economic and IAS 19 financial positions The Groups businesses operate a number of pension schemes.
The specific features of these schemes vary in accordance with the regulations of the country in which the employees are located, although they are, in general, funded by the Group and based either on a cash balance formula or on years of service and salary earned in the last year or years of employment.
The largest defined benefit scheme is the principal UK scheme, namely the Prudential Staff Pension Scheme PSPS.
PSPS accounts for 82 per cent 2017: 82 per cent of the underlying scheme liabilities of the Groups defined benefit schemes.
The Group also operates two smaller UK defined benefit schemes in respect of Scottish Amicable SASPS and M&G M&GGPS.
In addition, there are two small defined benefit schemes in Taiwan which have negligible deficits.
Under IAS 19, Employee Benefits and IFRIC 14, IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction, the Group is only able to recognise a surplus to the extent that it is able to access the surplus either through an unconditional right of refund or through reduced future contributions relating to ongoing service of active members.
The Group has no unconditional right of refund to any surplus in PSPS.
Accordingly, the PSPS surplus recognised is restricted to the present value of the economic benefit to the Group from the difference between the estimated future ongoing contributions and the full future cost of service for the active members.
In contrast, the Group is able to access the surplus of SASPS and M&GGPS.
Therefore, the amounts recognised for these schemes are the IAS 19 valuation amount either a surplus or deficit.

Deficit funding, where applicable, is apportioned in the ratio of 70 30 between the UK with-profits fund and shareholder-backed business following detailed considerations in 2005 of the sourcing of previous contributions.
Employer contributions for ongoing service of current employees are apportioned in the ratio relevant to current activity.
b The deficit of SASPS has been allocated 40 per cent to the UK with-profits fund and 60 per cent to the shareholders fund as at 31 December 2018 and 2017. c The underlying position on an economic basis reflects the assets including investments in Prudential insurance policies that are offset against liabilities to policyholders on the Group consolidation and the liabilities of the schemes.
d At 31 December 2018, the PSPS pension asset of 231 million 31 December 2017: 236 million and the other schemes pension liabilities of 174 million 31 December 2017: 180 million are included within Other debtors and Provisions respectively on the consolidated statement of financial position.
Triennial actuarial valuations Defined benefit pension schemes in the UK are generally required to be subject to full actuarial valuations every three years in order to assess the appropriate level of funding for schemes in relation to their commitments.
These valuations include assessments of the likely rate of return on the assets held within the separate trustee administered funds.
The actuarial valuation differs from the IAS 19 accounting basis valuation in a number of respects, including the discount rate assumption where IAS 19 prescribes a rate based on high-quality corporate bonds while a more prudent assumption is used for the actuarial valuation.
The information on the latest completed actuarial valuation for the UK schemes is shown in the table below: PSPS SASPS M&GGPS Last completed actuarial 5 April 2017 31 March 2017 31 December 2014 valuation date Valuation actuary, all Fellows C G Singer Jonathan Seed Paul Belok of the Institute and Faculty Towers Watson Limited Xafinity Consulting Limited AON Hewitt Limited of Actuaries Funding level at the last 105 per cent 75 per cent 99 per cent valuation Deficit funding arrangement No deficit or other funding Deficit funding of 26 million No deficit funding required from agreed with the Trustees required.

The deficit funding 5 million per annum will be reviewed every three excluding expenses years at subsequent valuations The triennial valuation for M&GGPS as at 31 December 2017 is currently in progress.
co. uk Annual Report 2018 Prudential plc 285 C Balance sheet notes continued C9 Defined benefit pension schemes continued i Background and summary economic and IAS 19 financial positions continued For PSPS, the market value of the scheme assets as at the 5 April 2017 funding valuation was 7,766 million.
The actuarial assumptions used in determining benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs for the purposes of the 2017 valuation were as follows: % Rate of increase in salaries Nil Rate of inflation: Retail Prices Index RPI 3.4 Consumer Prices Index CPI 2.6 Rate of increase of pensions in payment for inflation: Guaranteed maximum 5% 2.6 Guaranteed maximum 2.5% 2.5 Discretionary Nil Expected returns on plan assets 1.5 Mortality assumptions: The tables used for PSPS pensions in payment at 5 April 2017 were: Base post-retirement mortality For male female members and male dependants 95 per cent 105 per cent of the SAPS S2 Pensioner Amounts table.
For female dependants 89 per cent of the SAPS S2 Dependants Amounts table.
Allowance for future improvements to post-retirement mortality Assumed improvements up to 2017 are based on the CMI 2015 Core projections model with a 1.5 per cent per annum long-term trend.
From 2018 onwards, assumed improvements for males females are based on the CMI 2015 Core projections model with a 1.75 per cent per annum 1.5 per cent per annum long-term trend.
Risks to which the defined benefit schemes expose the Group Responsibility of making good of any deficit that may arise in the schemes lies with the employers of the schemes, which are subsidiaries of the Group.
Accordingly, the pension schemes expose the Group to a number of risks and the most significant of which are interest rate and investment risk, inflation risk and mortality risk.
Corporate governance The Groups UK pension schemes are established under trust and are subject to UK legal requirements: this includes being subject to regulation by The Pension Regulator in accordance with the Pension Act 1995.
Each scheme has a corporate trustee to which some directors are appointed by Group employers with the remaining directors nominated by members in accordance with UK legal requirements.
The trustees have the ultimate responsibility to ensure that the scheme is managed in accordance with the Trust Deed & Rules.
The trustees act in the best interests of the schemes beneficiaries: this includes taking appropriate account of each employers legal obligation and financial ability to support the schemes, when setting investment strategy and when agreeing funding with the employers.
The employers contribution commitments are formally updated at each triennial valuation: between valuations funding levels and employer strength continue to be monitored, with the Trustees being able to bring forward the next triennial valuation if they consider it appropriate to do so.
All of the Groups three UK defined benefit pension schemes PSPS, SASPS and M&GGPS are final salary schemes, which are closed to new entrants.
The Trustees of each scheme set the general investment policy and specify any restrictions on types of investment and the degrees of divergence permitted from the benchmark, but delegate the responsibility for selection and realisation of specific investments to the Investment Managers.
The Trustees consult the Principal Employer eg The Prudential Assurance Company Limited for PSPS on the investment principles, but the ultimate responsibility for the investment of the assets of the scheme lies with the Trustees.
286 Prudential plc Annual Report 2018 www.
co. uk 01 Groupoverview 02 Strategicreport 03 Governance 04  05 Financialstatements 06  EEV basisresults 07  The Trustees of each of the schemes manage the investment strategy of the scheme to achieve an acceptable balance between investing in the assets that most closely match the expected benefit payments and assets that are expected to achieve a greater return in the hope of reducing the contributions required or providing additional benefits to members.
For PSPS, a significant portion of the scheme assets are invested in liability matching assets such as bonds and gilts, including index-linked gilts, to partially hedge against inflation.
In addition, PSPS has maintained a portfolio of interest rate and inflation swaps to match more closely the duration and inflation profile of its assets to its liabilities.
The risks arising from SASPS and M&GGPS are managed through a diversified mix of investments.
Both schemes have invested in a mix of both return-seeking assets, such as equities and property and matching assets including leveraged liability driven investment portfolios to reflect the liability profile of the scheme.
ii Assumptions The actuarial assumptions used in determining benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs for the years shown were as follows: 31 Dec 31 Dec 2018 % 2017 % Discount rate 2.8 2.5 Rate of increase in salaries 3.3 3.1 Rate of inflation Retail prices index RPI 3.3 3.1 Consumer prices index CPI 2.3 2.1 Rate of increase of pensions in payment for inflation: PSPS: Guaranteed maximum 5% 2.5 2.5 Guaranteed maximum 2.5% 2.5 2.5 Discretionary 2.5 2.5 Other schemes 3.3 3.1 The discount rate has been determined by reference to an AA corporate bond index, adjusted where applicable to allow for the difference in duration between the index and the pension liabilities.
The rate of inflation reflects the long-term assumption for UK RPI or CPI depending on the tranche of the schemes.
The calculations are based on current mortality estimates with an allowance made for expected future improvements in mortality.
This allowance reflected the CMI 2015 Core projections model 2017: CMI 2014 projections model, with scheme-specific calibrations.
In 2018, for members post retirement long-term mortality improvement rates of 1.75 per cent per annum 2017: 1.75 per cent per annum and 1.50 per cent per annum 2017: 1.25 per cent per annum were applied for males and females, respectively.

d The actuarial gains and losses attributable to policyholders and shareholders as shown in the table above are analysed as follows: 2018 m 2017 m Actuarial gains and losses Return on the scheme assets less amount included in interest income 221 119 Gains losses on changes in demographic assumptions 168 10 Gains losses on changes in financial assumptions 330 101 Experience gains on scheme liabilities 26 111 303 119 Effect of derecognition of PSPS surplus 179 87 Consolidation adjustment for investments in Prudential insurance policies and other adjustments 10 6 134 200 e In October 2018, the High Court ruled that pension schemes are required to equalise benefits for the effect of guaranteed minimum pensions GMPs.
GMPs are a minimum benefit that schemes that were contracted-out on a salary-related basis between 1978 and 1997 are required to provide.
In light of this Court ruling, at 31 December 2018, the Group has recognised an estimated allowance for GMP equalisation within the IAS 19 valuation for all the three UK schemes 31 million for PSPS, 17 million for SASPS and 5 million for M&GGPS.
These costs are allocated between the UK with-profits fund and the shareholders fund on the basis of 70:30 for PSPS, 40:60 for SASPS and with M&GGPS being wholly attributable to the shareholders fund.
The impact on shareholders profit before tax is 24 million before taking into account any charge to PSPS surplus restriction and on shareholders equity post tax is 12 million.
iv Sensitivity of the pension scheme liabilities to key variables The sensitivity information below is based on the core scheme liabilities and assumptions at the balance sheet date.
The sensitivities are calculated based on a change in one assumption with all other assumptions being held constant.
As such, interdependencies between the assumptions are excluded.
The impact of the rate of inflation assumption sensitivity includes the impact of inflation on the rate of increase in salaries and rate of increase of pensions in payment.
The sensitivities of the underlying pension scheme liabilities as shown below do not directly equate to the impact on the profit or loss attributable to shareholders or shareholders equity due to the effect of the application of IFRIC 14 on PSPS and the allocation of a share of the interest in the financial position of PSPS and SASPS to the UK with-profits fund as described above..
