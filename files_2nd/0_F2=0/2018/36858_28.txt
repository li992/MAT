Hunting PLC | 2018 Annual Report and Accounts 103 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1.
Basis of Preparation continued IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 Leases replaces IAS 17 Leases and its related interpretations.
IFRS 16 establishes new principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases and is effective for the Group on 1 January 2019.
Throughout the years ended 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2018, all of the Groups leases, as a lessee, were operating leases.
Consequently, the Group recognised a lease charge in the income statement in 2018 of $13.8m 2017 $11.9m based on straight-line recognition of the lease payments payable on each lease after adjustment for lease incentives received.
IFRS 16 requires lessees to recognise a lease liability in respect of the obligation to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset in respect of the lessees right to the exclusive use and control of the asset.
In the income statement, the operating lease charge as recognised under the current rules will be replaced with a straight-line depreciation charge on the right-of-use asset and an interest cost on the lease liability.
Under IFRS 16, the lease payments will be charged directly against the lease liability.
The Directors have elected to apply both of the IFRS 16 exemptions that permit lessees, under pre-defined conditions, to not recognise a lease liability and a right-of-use asset in respect of certain leases.
The exemptions, which are voluntary, will be applied to all leases: that have a lease term of 12 months or less: or that are in respect of assets that have a low value purchase price when new, typically US$5,000 or less.
The recognition of these exempted leases will therefore continue unchanged an operating lease charge will be recognised in the income statement based on straight-line recognition of the lease payments payable on each lease after adjustment for lease incentives received.
The Directors have selected the modified retrospective approach for the adoption of IFRS 16.
Using this approach, together with managements selected practical expedients that accompany it, the Group will: not restate the 2018 or earlier financial information.
apply IFRS 16 to leases previously identified in accordance with IAS 17 Leases and IFRIC 4 Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease.
calculate a lease liability as at 1 January 2019 based on the remaining lease payments payable after that date.
calculate the lease term according to managements appetite for exercising any available extension break purchase options.
discount the remaining gross lease payments using the applicable interest rate, which will generally be the incremental borrowing rate, as at 1 January 2019 applicable to each relevant business unit, asset type, currency of the arrangement and weighted average length of the lease term starting on the commencement date.
recognise right-of-use assets as at 1 January 2019 as if IFRS 16 had always been applied.
exclude any initial direct costs from the measurement of the right-of-use assets that are recognised on adoption of IFRS 16 as at 1 January 2019. recognise the net difference between the carrying values of the right-of-use assets and the lease liabilities as an adjustment to equity as at 1 January 2019. recognise an impairment charge against right-of-use assets that are impaired in value by virtue of being unused by the Group in its usual business operations and that generate rental income lower than the rental payments.
The expected impact on the year ended 31 December 2018 of adopting IFRS 16 as at 1 January 2018, applying the same modified retrospective approach as described above, would have been, approximately to: recognise a right-of-use asset as at 31 December 2018 of between $37m and $43m: recognise a lease liability of between $46m and $52m, with a consequent increase in net debt: reduce total equity as at 31 December 2018 by between $3m and $9m: increase underlying EBITDA, as defined by the Group in NGM A, for the year ended 31 December 2018 by between $7m and $11m: increase operating profit for the year ended 31 December 2018 by between $1m and $3m: and increase finance costs for the year ended 31 December 2018 by between $1m and $3m.
The tax effects of the adoption of IFRS 16 are still being assessed pending the finalisation of the tax treatment in certain jurisdictions.

Segmental Reporting For the year ended 31 December 2018, the Group reports on seven operating segments in its internal management reports, which are used to make strategic decisions by the Hunting PLC Board, the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
The Groups operating segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services to international oil and gas companies and undertake exploration and production activities.
The Board assesses the performance of the operating segments based on revenue and operating results.
Operating results is a profit-based measure and excludes the effects of amortisation of intangible assets recognised as part of a business combination and any exceptional items see note 6.
The Directors believe that using the underlying operating result provides a more consistent and comparable measure of the operating segments performance.
Interest income and expenditure are not allocated to segments, as this type of activity is overseen by the central treasury function, which manages the funding position of the Group.
Inter-segment sales are priced in line with the Groups transfer pricing policy on an arms-length basis.
Costs and overheads are apportioned to the operating segments on the basis of time attributed to those operations by senior executives.
Further, the Board is also provided revenue information by product group, in order to help with an understanding of the drivers of Group performance trends.
Hunting Titan: This segment manufactures and distributes perforating products and accessories.
The segments products include the H-1 Perforating System and the EQUAfrac shaped charge technology.
The business has manufacturing facilities in the US and Mexico, and is supported by strategically located distribution centres across North America.
US: The US businesses supply premium connections, oil country tubular goods OCTG, drilling tools, subsea equipment, intervention tools, electronics and complex deep hole drilling and precision machining services for the US and overseas markets.
The segment also produces perforating system products for Hunting Titan.
Canada: Huntings Canadian business manufactures premium connections and accessories for oil and gas operators in Canada, often focused on heavy oil plays which require specialist tubing technologies.
Canada also manufactures perforating guns.
Europe: This segment derives its revenue primarily from the supply of OCTG and well intervention equipment to operators in the North Sea.
Asia Pacific: Revenue from the Asia Pacific segment is primarily from the manufacture of premium connections and OCTG supply.
Asia Pacific also manufactures perforating guns.
Middle East, Africa and Other: Revenue from this segment is generated from the sale and rental of in-field well intervention products across the region, and the operations also act as sales hubs for other products manufactured globally by the Group, including OCTG and Perforating Systems.
Exploration and Production: The Exploration and Production business comprises the Groups exploration and production activities in the Southern US and offshore Gulf of Mexico.
Due to its size and nature of operations, Hunting Titans activities are reported separately.
Huntings non-core Exploration and Production business unit is also reported separately as its activities are different in nature to the Groups other reporting segments.
Although the Canada and Exploration and Production segments do not meet the quantitative thresholds required by IFRS 8 for reportable segments, these segments are separately reported and monitored by the Board.
Accounting policies used for segmental reporting reflect those used for the Group.
The UK is the domicile of Hunting PLC.

An impairment of property, plant and equipment totalling $7.6m was recorded in the 2017 financial statements, together with other costs of $2.4m relating to the closure of the facility.
In 2018, the Group has reversed $2.0m of the impairment provision for property, plant and equipment in relation to the closure of the South African facility in Cape Town.
The Group received $8.0m in relation to the disposal of property, plant and equipment from the South African facility.
Hunting will retain a small sales office for the foreseeable future.

Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share EPS is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to Ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of Ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of outstanding Ordinary shares is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential Ordinary shares.
The dilution in respect of share options applies where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys Ordinary shares during the year and the possible issue of shares under the Groups long-term incentive plans.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of Ordinary shares used in the calculations are set out below: Restated 2018 2017 $m $m Reported earnings loss attributable to Ordinary shareholders 89.3 26.1 i Add: amortisation and exceptional items after taxation note 6 4.5 39.1 Underlying earnings attributable to Ordinary shareholders 84.8 13.0 millions millions Basic weighted average number of Ordinary shares 164.1 163.3 Long-term incentive plans 6.6 6.8 Adjusted weighted average number of Ordinary shares 170.7 170.1 cents cents Reported earnings loss per share Basic EPS 54.4 16.0 ii Diluted EPS 52.3 16.0 Underlying earnings per share Basic EPS 51.6 8.0 ii Diluted EPS 49.6 8.0 i.
For the year ended 31 December 2017, the effect of dilutive share options and long-term incentive plans was anti-dilutive and, therefore, they have not been used to calculate diluted earnings per share.

Oil and gas productive and development assets are tested for impairment at least annually.
Following a valuation of oil and gas reserves at 31 December 2018, performed for impairment purposes, no impairment charges were required 2017 $nil.
The recoverable amount of oil and gas development expenditure is based on value-in-use.
These calculations use discounted cash flow projections based on estimated oil and gas reserves, future production and the income and costs in generating this production.
Cash flows are based on productive lives between one and 15 years and are discounted using a nominal pre-tax rate of 10% 2017 10%.
The carrying value of PPE assets in certain CGUs remains sensitive to reasonably foreseeable declines in future revenue growth as measured by changes in compound annual growth rates CAGRs.
These sensitivities are based on the impairment test process described in note 13.
For Canada, if the CAGR for 2018 to 2023 is below 4% this will result in impairment 2017 11% CAGR for 2017 to 2022.
An increase in discount rates of 60 basis points would also trigger impairment.
The net book value of PPE in Canada is $2.7m 2017 $3.4m.
For Aberdeen Netherlands OCTG if the CAGR for 2018 to 2023 is below 6% this will result in impairment 2017 2% CAGR for 2017 to 2022.
The net book value of PPE in Aberdeen Netherlands OCTG is $5.7m 2017 $7.6m.
There are no other reasonably foreseeable changes in revenue growth rates that would give rise to impairment charges in other CGUs.

Goodwill continued a Impairment Tests for Goodwill continued The recoverable amount for each CGU has been determined using a fair value less costs of disposal FVLCD method, which represents the value of the CGU in a sales transaction on an arms-length basis.
As there is no active market for the Groups CGUs, the FVLCD is determined using discounted cash flow techniques based on the estimated future gross cash flows that are expected to be generated by the CGU and are discounted at a rate that is determined for each CGU in isolation by consideration of their business risk profiles.
This method allows approved capital projects that are in progress to be included.
The recoverable amount calculations use discounted pre-tax nominal cash flow projections.
The FVLCD is a Level 3 measurement as per the fair value hierarchy as defined within IFRS 13 due to unobservable inputs used in the valuation.
The key assumptions for the recoverable amount calculations are revenue growth rates, taking into account the impact these have on margins, terminal growth rates and the discount rates applied.
For 2019, cash flows are based on the approved Board budget.
For 2020 to 2023, management has made revenue projections using Spears and Associates Drilling and Production Outlook independent reports as a default basis, selecting the most appropriate geographic markets and drivers rig count, footage drilled or E&P spend for each CGU.
Management has then applied judgemental changes to revenue growth expectations, if appropriate, to reflect circumstances specific to the CGU.
Having determined the projected revenues, management has then modelled the expected impact on margins and cash flow from the resulting revenue projections.
2018 has seen a continuation of the recovery for the Group, in particular as a result of the growth of the US onshore market and has seen modest improvements in US offshore and some international markets.
This mixed picture impacts CGUs differently depending on their exposure to these markets and compound annual growth rates CAGR for revenue for the CGUs from 2018 to 2023 vary between 3% and 13% 2017 CAGR from 2017 to 2022 between 9% and 19%.
These growth rates should be seen in the context of the year-on-year declines in revenue in 2015 and 2016, which were 42% and 44% respectively, and the growth in revenue during 2017 and 2018 of 59% and 26% respectively.
After 2023, a terminal value has been calculated assuming growth of 50 basis points above assumed inflation, giving nominal growth rates between 2% and 3% 2017 between 2% and 3%.
Cash flows have been discounted using nominal pre-tax rates between 10% and 11% 2017 9% and 11%.
The discount rates reflect current market assessments of the equity market risk premiums, the volatility of returns, the risks associated with the cash flows, the likely external borrowing rate of the CGU and expected levels of leverage.
Consideration has also been given to other factors such as currency risk, operational risk and country risk.
No impairment charges have been recorded as a result of the impairment review carried out in the year 2017 $nil.
b Material CGU Hunting Titan Hunting Titan represents 78% of the goodwill balance at the year-end 2017 78% and has a carrying value, including amounts recognised on consolidation such as goodwill, of $500.8m 2017 $459.5m.
Projected annual growth rates from 2018 to 2023 vary between 2% and 5% 2017 growth rates from 2017 to 2022 between 2% and 12%.
Growth rates are lower following the record performance during 2018.
Cash flows have been discounted at a nominal pre-tax rate of 11% 2017 10%.
There is no reasonably foreseeable change in revenue growth rates, or terminal growth rates, or discount rates, which will give rise to impairment charges.
c Sensitivities Management has reviewed various downside sensitivities versus the base case assumptions used in our projections.
These covered revenue growth rates, terminal revenue growth rates and discount rates.
For our European Well Intervention CGU, if our CAGR from 2018 to 2023 is below 6% this will result in an impairment to the $4.5m goodwill carrying value.
For the other CGUs, management has concluded that there are no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions that will give rise to an impairment.

Hunting PLC | 2018 Annual Report and Accounts 117 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 16.
Trade and Other Receivables continued Impairment of Trade and Other Receivables The Group has chosen to apply lifetime expected credit losses ECLs to trade receivables, accrued revenue, contract assets and lease receivables, both short term and long term, upon their initial recognition.
Each entity within the Group uses provision matrices for recognising ECLs on its receivables, which are based on actual credit loss experience over the past two years, at a minimum.
Receivables are appropriately grouped by geographical region, product type or type of customer, and separate calculations produced, if historical or forecast credit loss experience shows significantly different loss patterns for different customer segments.
Actual credit loss experience is then adjusted to reflect differences in economic conditions over the period the historical data was collected, current economic conditions, forward-looking information and the Groups view of economic conditions over the expected lives of the receivables.
The Group assesses, on a forward-looking basis, the ECLs at each balance sheet date associated with its loan note that is carried at amortised cost.
The impairment methodology applied, following the adoption of the general model under IFRS 9, will depend on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.
To assess whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk, the risk of default occurring on the loan as at 31 December 2018 is compared with the risk of default occurring as at the date of initial recognition, being 31 March 2015.
Indications of a significant increase in credit risk include events that have a negative impact on the estimated future cash flows and if any payments under the terms of the debt are more than 30 days overdue.
Macroeconomic information is also considered, including the current state of the tanker shipping market.
The terms of the loan note were revised during 2017.
There have been no breaches of the revised terms during 2018.
Therefore, the Group does not consider there to have been a significant increase in credit risk.
During the year, the movements on the provision for impairment were as follows: 2018 Contracts with Rental Other customers receivables receivables Total $m $m $m $m At 1 January calculated under IAS 39 4.4 0.4 4.8 Amounts restated through opening retained earnings note 38 b 0.2 0.2 At 1 January restated calculated under IFRS 9 4.6 0.4 5.0 Exchange adjustments 0.1 0.1 Charge to the income statement lifetime expected credit losses 0.9 0.6 0.1 1.6 Unused provisions released to the income statement 0.3 0.2 0.5 Utilised against receivables written off 2.4 0.5 2.9 2.7 0.3 0.1 3.1 2017 Contracts with Rental Other customers receivables receivables Total $m $m $m $m At 1 January 4.1 0.3 4.4 Charge to the income statement 1.7 0.1 1.8 Unused provisions released to the income statement 1.2 1.2 Utilised against receivables written off 0.2 0.2 4.4 0.4 4.8 Default on a financial asset is usually considered to have occurred when any contractual payments under the terms of the debt are more than 90 days overdue and no further deliveries are made or services provided to that customer unless there is a valid reason to do so.
Receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.
Indicators that receivables are generally not recoverable include the failure of the debtor to engage in a repayment plan, failure to make contractual payments for a period greater than 180 days past due and the debtor being placed in administration.
Where receivables have been written off, the entity will continue to try and recover the outstanding receivable.
Impairment losses on receivables are presented net of unused provisions released to the income statement within operating expenses.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Groups wide and unrelated customer base.
The Groups maximum exposure to any single trade debtor does not exceed $9.8m.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying amount of each class of financial assets mentioned above.
The carrying value of each class of receivable approximates their fair value as described in note 26.

In determining an estimate of net realisable value, management makes judgements in respect of the durability and general high quality of the Groups products, which provide a degree of protection against adverse market conditions and competitor product development and pricing activity.
Gross inventories have increased $63.5m from $309.2m restated at 31 December 2017 to $372.7m at 31 December 2018.
Additions to inventories were $670.4m 2017 $534.2m, which were offset by foreign exchange losses of $6.8m 2017 $8.0m gains, inventories expensed to cost of sales of $592.8m 2017 $514.7m restated, inventories written off of $7.3m 2017 $4.2m against the inventory provision and inventories transferred to PPE of $nil 2017 $0.5m.
The inventory provision has decreased by $3.7m from $28.2m restated at 31 December 2017 to $24.5m at 31 December 2018, as a result of an impairment charge included in cost of sales of $6.2m 2017 $6.6m, offset by foreign exchange gains of $0.6m 2017 $0.9m losses, $7.3m 2017 $4.2m of the provision being utilised in the year against inventories written off and the reversal of previous write-downs of $2.0m 2017 $1.4m also included in cost of sales.
The reversal of previous write-downs occurred when inventory was sold for an amount higher than its net realisable value and also where older inventories, which had previously been written off, were sold as market conditions improved in the oil and gas sector.
Overall, Huntings provision for inventory losses has reduced from 9% of gross inventory balances at 31 December 2017 to 7% at 31 December 2018, as improving market conditions have lead to a lower proportion of inventories having a recoverable value less than their cost.

a Significant Changes in Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities Contract assets have increased from $6.8m in 2017 to $11.8m due to increased levels of bespoke customer work-in-progress in Hunting Dearborn.
Contract liabilities represent deposits received on contracts relating to the purchase of pipe in the Asia Pacific businesses, prior to Hunting placing an order with the steel mills, and have decreased from $9.1m in 2017 to $5.5m due to a change in the mix of orders at the year-end, whereby customers were not required to pay a deposit when placing an order.
b Revenue Recognised in Relation to Contract Liabilities The following table shows how much of the revenue recognised in the current reporting period relates to carried-forward contract liabilities and how much relates to performance obligations that were satisfied in a prior year.

Changes in Net Cash Debt Hunting operates a centralised treasury function that manages all cash and loan positions throughout the Group and ensures funds are used efficiently through the use of cash concentration account structures and other such measures.
As the Group manages funding on a net cash debt basis, internal reporting focuses on changes in net cash debt and this is presented in the Strategic Report.
The net cash debt reconciliation provides an analysis of the movement in the year for each component of net debt split between cash and non-cash items.
Net cash debt comprises cash at bank and in hand, short-term deposits and Money Market Funds less bank overdrafts, current and non-current borrowings.

The provision for onerous contracts reflects the uncertainty of future conditions in the sub-letting market.
It is expected that $1.1m of the provision will be utilised in 2019 and the remaining balance of $3.0m will be utilised from 2020 to 2023.
Provision is made on a discounted basis, at a risk-free rate of between 0.72% and 0.86% p. a.
2017 between 0.22% and 0.72% p. a., for the net rental deficit on these properties to the end of the lease term.

The asset decommissioning provision reflects uncertainty in the timing and amounts of the costs expected to arise in meeting this obligation.
Provision is made on a discounted basis, the majority of which is estimated to be utilised over a period of 14 years.
Derivatives and Hedging a Currency Derivatives The Group uses derivatives for economic hedging purposes and no speculative positions are entered into by the Group.
The Group has used spot and forward foreign exchange contracts, together with foreign currency swaps to hedge its exposure to exchange rate movements during the year.
Fair values of outstanding derivative financial instruments: 2018 2017 Total Total Total Total assets liabilities assets liabilities $m $m $m $m Forward foreign exchange contracts in a cash flow hedge 0.1 Forward foreign exchange contracts in a fair value hedge 0.1 Forward foreign exchange contracts not in a hedge 0.2 0.1 0.1 Foreign currency swaps in a fair value hedge 0.2 0.4 Foreign currency swaps not in a hedge 0.3 0.3 Total 0.7 0.1 1.0 Gains on contracts that are not designated in a hedge relationship of $0.3m 2017 $0.1m gain have been recognised in the income statement during the year and gains of $0.6m 2017 $nil on contracts not designated in a hedge relationship have been recognised in exceptional items, which has been included in the $2.0m credit on the closure of the South African facility in note 6. b Fair Value Hedge During the year, foreign currency swaps have been designated in a fair value hedge to hedge the foreign exchange changes in a pseudo-equity Canadian dollar inter-company loan by the entity with the loan receivable, where the functional currency of the lending entity is US dollars.
The value of the foreign currency swap and the value of the Canadian dollar-denominated pseudo-equity loan move in the opposite direction as a result of movements in the CAD USD exchange rate, being the hedged risk.
There was no ineffectiveness in the fair value hedge.
The pseudo-equity loan does not appear in the Groups statement of financial position as it is an inter-company loan and is therefore eliminated on consolidation.
Hunting PLC | 2018 Annual Report and Accounts 123 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 25.
Derivatives and Hedging continued b Fair Value Hedge continued The effects of the outstanding foreign currency swap on the Groups financial position and performance are as follows: 2018 Carrying amount of the foreign currency swap asset note 16 $m 0.2 Notional amount of the foreign currency swap $m 14.2 Maturity date 07.01.19 i Hedge ratio 1:1 Carrying amount of the pseudo-equity loan $m 14.2 Change in value of hedged item used to determine hedge effectiveness $m 0.2 i.
The foreign currency swap is denominated in the same currency as the pseudo equity loan to match the exposed currency risk, therefore the hedge ratio is 1:1.
Forward foreign exchange contracts have also been designated in a fair value hedge to hedge the foreign exchange movement in foreign currency trade payables.
The value of the forward foreign exchange contract matches the value of the trade payables and they move in opposite directions as a result of movements in the CAD USD exchange rate, being the hedged risk.
Immaterial fair value losses have been recognised in the income statement during the year.
c Cash Flow Hedge The Group has entered into contracts to purchase materials from suppliers in US dollars, where the entitys functional currency is Canadian dollars.
Certain of these highly probable forecast transactions have been designated in a cash flow hedge relationship and hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts during the year.
The value of the forward foreign exchange contract matches the value of the forecast inventory purchase and they move in opposite directions as a result of movements in the CAD USD exchange rate, being the hedged risk.
It is anticipated that the materials will be sold within 12 months after purchase, at which time the amount deferred in equity will be reclassified to profit or loss as part of the cost of inventories sold.
The Group also entered into a contract to purchase an item of property, plant and equipment from a supplier in US dollars, where the entitys functional currency is Canadian dollars.
This highly probable forecast transaction was hedged using a forward foreign exchange contract.
The value of the forward foreign exchange contract matched the value of the forecast property, plant and equipment purchase and they move in opposite directions as a result of movements in the CAD USD exchange rate, being the hedged risk.
The amount deferred in equity will be reclassified to profit or loss as part of the depreciation charge over the items useful life.
The Group also entered into a contract to purchase an item of property, plant an equipment from a supplier in Euros, where the entitys functional currency is US dollars.
This highly probable forecast transaction has been hedged using a forward foreign exchange contract.
The value of the forward foreign exchange contract matched the value of the forecast property, plant and equipment purchase and they move in opposite directions as a result of movements in the EUR USD exchange rate, being the hedged risk.
The Groups cash flow hedge reserve, which is disclosed as part of other reserves in note 31, relates to the spot component of forward foreign exchange contracts, as follows: $m Balance as at 1 January 2017 Fair value losses of forward foreign exchange contracts recognised in OCI 0.2 Reclassified from OCI to profit or loss 0.1 Balance as at 31 December 2017 0.1 Fair value gains of forward foreign exchange contracts recognised in OCI 0.3 Reclassified to the carrying value of inventory 0.2 Balance as at 31 December 2018 124 Hunting PLC | 2018 Annual Report and Accounts Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 25.
Derivatives and Hedging continued c Cash Flow Hedge continued The effects of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts on the Groups financial position and performance are as follows: 2018 Carrying amount of the forward foreign exchange contracts asset $m 0.1 Notional amount of the forward foreign exchange contracts $m 2.2 Maturity date 25.01.19 to 24.10.19 iii Hedge ratio 1:1 Change in value of hedged item used to determine hedge effectiveness $m 0.1 iii.
The forward foreign exchange contracts are denominated in the same currency as the highly probable forecast transactions to match the exposed currency risk, therefore the hedge ratio is 1:1.
Immaterial changes in the forward points, the differential between the forward rate and the market spot rate, have been recognised in the income statement during the year and previous year.
d Hedge Effectiveness Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic hedge relationship exists between the hedged item and the hedging instrument.
For hedges of the pseudo-equity loan, the Group enters into hedge relationships where the value of the foreign currency swap matches exactly with the value of the loan.
The Group, therefore, performs a qualitative assessment of effectiveness.
Ineffectiveness will arise if the pseudo-equity loan is partially or fully repaid prior to the maturity of the foreign currency swap.
For hedges of foreign currency purchases, the Group enters into hedge relationships where the critical terms of the hedging instrument match exactly with the terms of the hedged item.
If changes in circumstances affect the terms of the hedged item such that the critical terms no longer match exactly with the critical terms of the forward foreign exchange contract, then the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method to assess effectiveness.
Ineffectiveness may arise if there is a change in the timing of the forecast transaction from what was originally estimated or from a change in the US$ amount charged and invoiced.
A possible source of ineffectiveness is also a change in credit risk of either party to the derivative, however any change in credit risk is not expected to be material.
There was no ineffectiveness during 2018 or 2017.
Financial Instruments: Fair Values The carrying value of investments, the loan note, contract assets, trade receivables, accrued revenue, other receivables, short-term deposits, cash and cash equivalents, trade payables, accruals, other payables, provisions considered to be financial liabilities, bank overdrafts and other unsecured loans approximates their fair value.
Drawdowns under the revolving credit facility are typically for periods of one month or less and, as a result, the carrying value and the fair value are considered to be the same.
The following tables present the Groups other financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at the year-end and show the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements are categorised.
There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the year.

The fair value hierarchy has the following levels: Level 1 inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined by comparing the cash flows generated by the contract with the coterminous cash flows potentially available in the forward exchange market on the balance sheet date.
The fair value of Money Market Funds and listed equities and mutual funds is based on their current bid prices in an active market, which is considered to be the most representative of fair value, at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of non-US dollar denominated financial instruments are translated into US dollars using the year-end exchange rate.
The inputs used to determine the fair value of derivative financial instruments are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable and so the fair value measurement is categorised in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
The fair value of Money Market Funds and listed equity investments and mutual funds is based on quoted market prices and so the fair value measurement is categorised in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
Financial Risk Management The Groups activities expose it to certain financial risks, namely market risk including currency risk, fair value interest rate risk and cash flow interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups risk management strategy seeks to mitigate potential adverse effects on its financial performance.
As part of its strategy, both primary and derivative financial instruments are used to hedge certain risk exposures.
There are clearly defined objectives and principles for managing financial risk established by the Board of Directors, with policies, parameters and procedures covering the specific areas of funding, banking relationships, foreign currency and interest rate exposures and cash management.
The Groups treasury function is responsible for implementing the policies and providing a centralised service to the Group for funding, foreign exchange and interest rate management and counterparty risk management.
It is also responsible for identifying, evaluating and hedging financial risks in close co-operation with the Groups operating companies.
a Market Risk: Foreign Exchange Risk The Groups international base is exposed to foreign exchange risk from its investing, financing and operating activities, particularly in respect of Sterling, Canadian dollars and Chinese Yuan Renminbi.
Foreign exchange risks arise from future transactions and cash flows, and from recognised monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the Groups local operations.
The Groups material foreign exchange rates are: Sterling Canadian dollar 2018 2017 2018 2017 Average exchange rate to US dollars 0.75 0.78 1.30 1.30 Yearend exchange rate to US dollars 0.79 0.74 1.37 1.25 i Transactional Risk The exposure to exchange rate movements in significant future transactions and cash flows is hedged by using forward foreign exchange contracts.
Certain forward foreign exchange contracts have been designated as hedging instruments of highly probable forecast transactions.
Operating companies prepare quarterly rolling 12-month cash flow forecasts to enable working capital currency exposures to be identified.
Exposures are also identified and hedged, if necessary, on an ad-hoc basis, such as when a purchase order in a foreign currency is placed.
Currency exposures arise where the cash flows are not in the functional currency of the entity.
Exposures arising from committed long-term projects beyond a 12-month period are also identified.
The currency flows to be hedged are committed foreign currency transactions greater than $50,000 equivalent.
Exposures of less than $50,000 equivalent will also be hedged but only where the underlying foreign currency cash flow is expected to occur 60 days or more from the point of entering into the transaction.

ii Translational Risk Foreign exchange risk also arises from financial assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency of an entitys operations and forward foreign exchange contracts are used to manage the exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates.
Where appropriate, hedge accounting is applied to the forward foreign exchange contracts and the hedged item to remove any accounting mismatch.
Foreign exchange risk also arises from the Groups investments in foreign operations.
During the year, foreign currency swaps have been designated in a fair value hedge to hedge the foreign exchange rate changes in a pseudo-equity Canadian dollar inter-company loan.
The foreign exchange exposure arising from the translation of its net investments in foreign operations into the Groups presentation currency of US dollars has also previously been managed by designating any borrowings that are not US dollar denominated as a hedge of the net investment in foreign operations.
The foreign exchange exposure primarily arises from Sterling and Canadian dollar denominated net investments.
b Market Risk: Interest Rate Risk Variable interest rates on cash at bank, short-term deposits, overdrafts and borrowings expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk and fixed interest rates on loans and short-term deposits expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The treasury function manages the Groups exposure to interest rate risk and uses interest rate swaps and caps, when considered appropriate.
Hunting PLC | 2018 Annual Report and Accounts 127 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 27.
Financial Risk Management continued c Credit Risk The Groups credit risk arises from its cash at bank and in hand, Money Market Funds, short-term deposits, investments, derivative financial instruments, the loan note, accrued revenue, outstanding trade receivables and contract assets.
At the year-end, the Group had credit risk exposures to a wide range of counterparties.
Credit risk exposure is continually monitored and no individual exposure is considered to be significant in the context of the ordinary course of the Groups activities.
Exposure limits are set for each approved counterparty, as well as the types of transactions that may be entered into.
Approved institutions that the treasury function can invest surplus cash with must all have a minimum A2, P2 or F2 short-term rating from Standard and Poors, Moodys or Fitch rating agencies respectively and AAAm S&P rating for Money Market Funds.
The Net Asset Value of the Money Market Funds aims be a minimum of 1 this means that for every $1 that is in the fund there will be an asset to cover it and the funds have overnight liquidity.
At the year-end, deposits in Money Market Funds totalled $26.1m 2017 $nil.
At the year-end, cash at bank and in hand totalled $32.4m 2017 $36.4m, with $18.0m 2017 $25.1m deposited with banks with Fitch short-term ratings of F1 to F1.
Of the remaining $14.4m 2017 $11.3m, $13.5m 2017 $9.9m was held with two financial institutions within mainland China which, given the Groups operations in this jurisdiction, were deemed necessary.
Despite not having formal credit ratings, an internal assessment determined that the banks credit profiles were appropriate for the amounts held on deposit.
There are no formal restrictions on this cash as such, however, prior approval would be required from various state authorities in China before any cash could be paid offshore.
Surplus cash held in short-term deposits totalled $9.4m 2017 $nil and are held with banks with Fitch short-term ratings of F1.
The credit risk of foreign exchange contracts is calculated before the contract is acquired and compared to the credit risk limit set for each counterparty.
Credit risk is calculated as a fixed percentage of the nominal value of the instrument.
Trade and other receivables are continuously monitored.
Credit account limits are primarily based on the credit quality of the customer and past experience through trading relationships.
To reduce credit risk exposure from outstanding receivables, the Group has taken out credit insurance with an external insurer, subject to certain conditions.
The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme in the US, which is unfunded.
Contributions are paid into a separate investment vehicle and invested in a wide portfolio of US mutual funds that are recognised as current and non-current investments.
Investments at the year-end amounted to $1.7m 2017 $12.2m and are expected to be fully recovered.
d Liquidity Risk The Group needs to ensure that it has sufficient liquid funds available to support its working capital and capital expenditure requirements.
All subsidiaries submit weekly and bi-monthly cash forecasts to the treasury function to enable them to monitor the Groups requirements.
The Group has sufficient credit facilities to meet both its longand short-term requirements.
The Groups credit facilities are provided by a variety of funding sources and total $164.9m 2017 $205.0m at the year-end.
The facilities comprise $159.5m of secured committed facilities 2017 $200.0m and $5.4m secured uncommitted facilities 2017 $5.0m.
On 12 December 2018, Hunting PLC completed a refinancing of the Groups $200m Revolving Credit Facility by way of an amend and extend of the existing syndicate facility arrangements.
The transaction enabled Hunting to extend the maturity of the RCF from October 2020 out until December 2022, with an option to extend for a further one year to December 2023.
Furthermore, this refinancing event provided an opportunity for Hunting to amend, and formally remove any reference to, many of the terms and conditions that had been introduced as part of the 2016 refinancing.
However, as previously communicated, most of these terms had ceased to be effective as of 18 January 2018.
The main features of the RCF are as follows: Committed facilities reduced to $160.0m to reflect anticipated funding requirements of the Group going forward.
A slight uplift in the base margin on amounts drawn under the facility from 0.85% to 1.00%, reflecting a general upward shift in bank loan pricing.
Maintaining the market standard financial covenants of the existing facility, as discussed below.
A review of and uplift to other limits within the facility such as Negative Pledge and Subsidiary Financial Indebtedness.
Introduction of a $75.0m accordion feature, providing Hunting with additional flexibility to increase the size of the bank facility to $235.0m, subject to approval of its bank lending group.
Security continues to be granted over certain properties, plant and equipment, receivables and inventory.
The covenants to 31 December 2018 include: The ratio of net debt to consolidated EBITDA permitted under the revolving credit facility must not exceed a multiple of three times.
Consolidated EBITDA must also cover relevant finance charges by a minimum of four times.
For covenant testing purposes, the Groups definition of consolidated EBITDA is adjusted to exclude exceptional items, include the share of associates post-tax results and exclude the fair value charge for share awards.
Similarly, net cash debt and finance expenses are adjusted to accord with the definition within the facility agreement.
Consolidated EBITDA, for covenant test purposes, is based on the previous 12-month period, measured twice yearly at 30 June and 31 December.
Throughout the year and at 31 December 2018 both these covenants were met.
As the revised facility size and terms are significantly different, the existing $200m RCF is deemed to have been extinguished and replaced by the new $160m RCF.
The deferred bank fees of $0.4m relating to the $200m RCF have been recognised in the income statement during the year and $1.1m of deferred bank fees relating to the $160m RCF have been recognised in prepayments at the end of the year.

The Group had undrawn committed borrowing facilities available at the year-end totalling $159.5m 2017 $199.5m, which expire between one and five years from 31 December 2018.
The following tables analyse the Groups non-derivative financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date of the financial liabilities.
The amounts are the contractual, undiscounted cash flows.
The carrying amounts in the balance sheet are the discounted amounts.
Balances due within one year have been included in the maturity analysis at their carrying amounts, as the impact of discounting is not significant.

Financial Instruments: Sensitivity Analysis The following sensitivity analysis is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables on the Groups financial instruments and show the impact on profit or loss and shareholders equity.
Financial instruments affected by market risk include cash at bank and in hand, Money Market Funds, short-term deposits, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables, borrowings and derivative financial instruments.
The sensitivity analysis relates to the position as at 31 December 2018.
The analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of pension and other post-retirement obligations, provisions and non-financial assets and liabilities of foreign operations.
The following assumptions have been made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: Foreign exchange rate and interest rate sensitivities have an asymmetric impact on the Groups results, that is, an increase in rates does not result in the same amount of movement as a decrease in rates.
For floating rate assets and liabilities, the amount of asset or liability outstanding at the balance sheet date is assumed to be outstanding for the whole year.
Fixed-rate financial instruments that are carried at amortised cost are not subject to interest rate risk for the purpose of this analysis.
The carrying values of financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost do not change as interest rates change.
Positive figures represent an increase in profit or equity.
a Interest Rate Sensitivity The sensitivity rate of 0.5% 2017 0.75% for US interest rates represents managements assessment of a reasonably possible change, based on historical volatility and a review of analysts research and banks expectations of future interest rates.
The post-tax impact on the income statement, with all other variables held constant, at 31 December, for an increase or decrease of 0.5% 2017 0.75% in US interest rates, is not material 2017 not material.
There is no impact on other comprehensive income OCI for a change in interest rates.
b Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitivity The sensitivity rate of 10% 2017 10% for Sterling and 10% 2017 5% for Canadian dollar exchange rates represents managements assessment of a reasonably possible change, based on historical volatility and a review of analysts research and banks expectations of future foreign exchange rates.
The table below shows the post-tax impact for the year of a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates, with all other variables held constant, at 31 December.
2018 2017 Income Income statement OCI statement OCI $m $m $m $m Sterling exchange rate 10% 2017: 10% 0.4 0.3 Sterling exchange rate -10% 2017: -10% 0.4 0.3 Canadian dollar exchange rates 10% 2017: 5% 0.2 0.7 0.2 Canadian dollar exchange rates -10% 2017: -5% 0.7 0.2 The movements in the income statement mainly arise from cash, intra-Group balances, trade and other receivables, payables, accrued expenses and provisions, where the functional currency of the entity is different from the currency that the monetary items are denominated in.
The movements in OCI mainly arise from foreign exchange contracts designated in a cash flow hedge.
The post-tax impact on the income statement of reasonably possible changes in the Singapore dollar and UAE Dirham exchange rates were considered and were immaterial.
Post-Employment Benefits a UK Pensions Within the UK, the Group operates a defined contribution DC plan, which is open to current employees.
Contributions to the plan and other Group defined contribution arrangements are charged directly to profit and loss.
Historically, the Group operated a funded pension scheme, which provided benefits on both a defined benefit DB and defined contribution DC basis.
That scheme was wound up during the year and, as part of that process, the bulk annuity policies held with insurers to cover members DB benefits have been transferred into individual policies for the members.
Payments totalling $16.4m were made from the Scheme on 6 December 2018 as part of the wind-up process, of which $10.6m was paid to the Group and $5.8m was paid to HMRC in relation to tax due.
No further payments are due to or from the Scheme.

Post-Employment Benefits continued a UK Pensions continued Risk exposures and investment strategy At the previous year-end, the assets of the DB section of the scheme were invested in a range of deferred annuity and immediate annuity policies with a range of insurers.
These policies matched the benefits to be paid to members of the Scheme.
This strategy removed the Groups investment, inflation and demographic risks relating to the Schemes obligations.
As the trustees bulk annuity policies held with insurers to cover members benefits were transferred into individual policies for the members during 2018, this has removed the Groups risks relating to an insurer no longer being able to meet its obligations.
The Group has no further legal responsibility to fund these benefits.

In addition, employer contributions of $7.6m 2017 $7.1m for various Group defined contribution arrangements including the defined contribution section of the UK scheme and UK plan are recognised in the income statement.
Special events The following special events occurred during the year: The bulk annuity policies held with insurers to cover members benefits were transferred to individual members during the year.
As a result, these policies are no longer assets of the scheme and the members benefits in respect of these policies are no longer liabilities of the scheme.
As part of the schemes wind-up process, members Additional Voluntary Contributions AVCs funds were transferred to other providers.
To compensate members with AVCs for potential losses on transfer, $0.3m of the schemes surplus funds were used to augment their AVC funds on transfer.
This has been recognised as part of the past service cost.
In addition to this, the Trustee held various historic insurance annuity policies as at 31 December 2017.
As part of the process of winding up the scheme, the Trustee has also assigned these policies to individual members with a small augmentation of $0.1m made to these members.
Payments of $10.6m to the Group and $5.8m to HMRC were made from the scheme on 6 December 2018.
This has reduced the surplus of the scheme by the combined total of the payments.
There are no remaining assets of the scheme at 31 December 2018.

c 2014 Hunting Performance Share Plan HPSP i Performance-Based Awards The Company now grants performance-based share awards annually to executive Directors and senior employees under the HPSP.
Awards are granted at nil cost under the HPSP.
Up to 2017, the performance-based HPSP awards to the executive Directors were divided equally into three tranches.
From 2018, the performance-based HPSP awards were divided into four tranches of differing proportions.
Each tranche is subject to a three-year vesting period, and is also subject to performance conditions.
Up to 2017, the three conditions were Company performance over a three-year period against i the TSR of a bespoke comparator group, ii underlying diluted earnings per share EPS growth, and iii average underlying Return on Capital Employed ROCE achieved.
The fourth performance condition added in 2018 is based on a Balanced Scorecard, comprising of non-financial KPIs including Quality and Safety performance.
The 2018 award weightings are EPS 25%: TSR 25%: ROCE 35% and the Balanced Scorecard 15%.
The performance period for the 2018 awards granted under the HPSP is 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2020.
The vesting date of the 2018 award is 19 April 2021.

There were no exercises in 2017. ii Time-Based Awards The Company also grants time-based share awards annually under the HPSP.
Annual awards of shares may be made to employees subject to continued employment during the vesting period.
There are no performance conditions attached.
Details of the time-based HPSP awards movements during the year are set out below: 2018 2017 Number of Number of shares shares Outstanding at the beginning of the year 3,462,942 2,815,860 Granted during the year 787,667 1,260,452 Vested and exercised during the year 868,167 518,469 Lapsed during the year 133,016 94,901 Outstanding at the end of the year 3,249,426 3,462,942 The weighted average share price at the date of exercise during 2018 was 797.3 pence 2017 542.0 pence.

The assumptions used in this model were as follows: 2018 2017 Date of grant valuation date 19.04.18 03.03.17 Weighted average share price at grant 785.0p 571.5p Exercise price nil nil Expected dividend yield nil nil Expected volatility 48.9% 53.5% Risk-free rate 0.85% 0.11% Expected life 3 years 3 years Fair value 616.0p 369.0p Hunting PLC | 2018 Annual Report and Accounts 137 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 34.
Share-Based Payments continued c 2014 Hunting Performance Share Plan HPSP continued 2 The fair value of performance-based awards not subject to a market-related performance condition, include the EPS and ROCE performance targets and the time-based HPSP awards, with the fair value being calculated using the Black-Scholes pricing model.
The assumptions used in this model were as follows: 2018 2017 Date of grant valuation date 19.04.18 03.03.17 Weighted average share price at grant 785.0p 571.5p Exercise price nil nil Expected dividend yield nil nil Expected volatility 48.9% 53.5% Risk-free rate 0.85% 0.11% Expected life 3 years 3 years Fair value 785.0p 571.5p The methods to calculate the assumptions for both models are: The expected volatility was calculated using historic weekly volatility, equal in length to the remaining portion of the performance period at the date of grant.
The expected life of the award has been calculated commensurate with the vesting period.
The risk-free rate is based on the UK gilt rate commensurate with the vesting period prevailing at the date of grant.
Participants are entitled to a dividend equivalent over the number of shares that make up their award.
It is accumulated over the vesting period and released subject to the achievement of the performance conditions.
This is factored into the fair value calculation and as a result the dividend yield assumption is set to zero.
The initial accounting charge of the performance-based HPSP awards granted under the HPSP incorporates an estimate of the number of shares that are expected to lapse for those participants who cease employment during the vesting period.
The estimate of the expected forfeiture rate is 5% per annum.
The subsequent accounting charge includes an adjustment to the initial accounting charge to allow for actual lapses rather than estimated lapses.
The amount charged to the income statement attributable to the performance-based HPSP awards is $5.4m 2017 $3.5m and the charge to the income statement in respect of time-based HPSP awards is $7.7m 2017 $8.1m.
These are recognised in operating expenses.
d Other Share Awards On 15 May 2018 12,005 shares were awarded to certain employees and were satisfied by shares held in the Hunting Employee Benefit Trust.

The ownership interests in associates and subsidiaries are set out in notes C18 and C19 to the Company financial statements.
The key management of the Group comprises the Hunting PLC Board and members the Executive Committee.
Details of their compensation are disclosed in note 8.
The Hunting PLC Directors and the members of the Executive Committee had no material transactions other than as a result of their service agreements.
Hunting PLC | 2018 Annual Report and Accounts 139 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 37.
Principal Accounting Policies The Groups principal accounting policies are described below: a Consolidation The Group financial statements include the results of the Company and its subsidiaries, together with its share of associates.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are fide-consolidated from the date control ceases.
The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations.
Consequently, the consideration is determined as the fair value of the net assets transferred to the vendor and includes an estimate of any contingent consideration.
The net assets acquired are also measured at their respective fair values for initial recognition purposes on the acquisition date.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed to the income statement as incurred.
b Revenue i Revenue from Contracts with Customers Revenue from contracts with customers is measured as the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the provision of goods and services in the ordinary course of business, net of trade discounts, volume rebates, and sales taxes.
Revenue is recognised when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customer.
Consequently revenue for the sale of a product is recognised either: 1. w holly at a single point in time when the entity has completed its performance obligation, which is most commonly indicated by delivery of the products: or 2. p iecemeal over time during the period that control incrementally transfers to the customer while the good is being manufactured or the service is being performed.
Huntings activities that require revenue recognition over time comprise: 1.
W ork undertaken to enhance customer-owned products most commonly the lathing of a thread onto the ends of customer-owned plain-end pipe.
T he manufacture of goods that are specifically designed for and restricted to the use of a particular customer, such as the manufacture of bespoke specialised circuitry and housing, and for which Hunting is entitled to a measure of recompense that reflects the fair value of the stage of production prior to their completion.
T he provision of services in which the customer obtains the benefit while the service is being performed most commonly the storage and management services of customer-owned pipe.
Huntings activities that require revenue recognition at a point in time comprise: 1.
T he sale of goods that are not specifically designed for use by one particular customer.
Products include tubulars acquired by Hunting as plain-end pipe on which lathing work has been applied and which is resold as threaded pipe.
T he manufacture of goods that are specifically designed for one particular customer but for which Hunting is not entitled to a measure of recompense that reflects the fair value of the stage of production prior to completion.
ii Rental Revenue Rental revenue is measured as the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the provision of rental equipment in the ordinary course of business, net of trade discounts and sales taxes.
Revenue from the rental of plant and equipment is recognised as the income is earned.
c Amortisation and Exceptional Items Exceptional items are items of income or expense that the Directors believe should be separately disclosed by virtue of their significant size or nature to enable a better understanding of the Groups financial performance.
The Group discloses such items in the middle column of the income statement.
In applying this policy, the following items have been treated as exceptional: Costs of restructuring the Groups operations, including the cost of business closures and redundancies, in response to the decline in regional opportunities for growth.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment.
The tax effect of any transaction considered to be exceptional is also treated as exceptional.
Amortisation expenses for intangible assets recognised as part of a business combination are also shown in the middle column due to the significance of these amounts and to clearly identify the effect on profits, which will arise as current balances become fully written-off, or as new acquisitions give rise to new expenses.
The post-acquisition profits of acquired businesses shown in the underlying column do not, therefore, reflect these costs.
d Interest Interest income and expense is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
140 Hunting PLC | 2018 Annual Report and Accounts Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 37.
Principal Accounting Policies continued e Foreign Currencies i Individual Subsidiaries and Associates Financial Statements The financial statements for each of the Groups subsidiaries and associates are denominated in their functional currency.
The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates.
Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities, except borrowings designated as a hedging instrument in a net investment hedge, denominated in nonfunctional currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date and exchange differences are taken to the income statement.
Borrowings designated as a hedging instrument in a net investment hedge are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date and exchange differences are taken direct to equity.
ii Group Consolidated Financial Statements The presentation currency of the Group is US dollars.
The net assets of non-US dollar denominated subsidiaries and associates are translated into US dollars at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The income statements of subsidiaries and associates are translated into US dollars at the average rates of exchange for the year.
Exchange differences are recognised directly in equity in the currency translation reserve CTR, together with exchange differences arising on foreign currency loans used to finance foreign currency net investments.
Upon adoption of IFRS on 1 January 2004, accumulated exchange differences arising on consolidation prior to 31 December 2003 were reset to zero and the CTR recommenced under IFRS on 1 January 2004.
The balance on the CTR represents the exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-US dollar amounts into US dollars since 1 January 2004.
On the disposal of a business, the cumulative exchange differences previously recognised in the CTR relating to that business are transferred to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
f Taxation The taxation recognised in the income statement comprises current tax and deferred tax arising on the current years result before tax and adjustments to tax arising on prior years results.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable arising in the current year on the current years result before tax, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, plus adjustments to tax in respect of prior years results.
Deferred tax is the tax that is expected to arise when the assets and liabilities recognised in the Groups balance sheet are realised, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date that are expected to apply when the asset is realised or the liability is settled.
Full provision is made for deferred taxation, using the liability method, on all taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised separately on the balance sheet and are reported as non-current assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that they are expected to be recoverable.
Deferred taxation on unremitted overseas earnings is provided for to the extent a tax charge is foreseeable.
When items of income and expense are recognised in other comprehensive income, the current and deferred tax relating to those items is also recognised in other comprehensive income.
Tax arising on the discharge of share options and awards is recognised directly in equity.
g Segmental Reporting Financial information on operating segments that corresponds with information regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM is disclosed in the financial statements.
Consequently, the Groups principal segmental reporting is established on a geographical basis.
The geographical information is based on the location of where the sale originated and where the non-current assets are located.
Revenue is also disclosed by product group, which is provided to assist in investor understanding of the underlying performance trends.
Each product group consists of goods and services that are similar in nature or serve similar markets.
h Property, Plant and Equipment i General Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition and installation of the asset.
Land, pre-production oil and gas exploration costs and assets under construction are not depreciated.
With the exception of drilling tools and rental tools, which are depreciated using the units of production method, and oil and gas exploration and production equipment see ii below, assets are depreciated using the straight-line method at the following rates: Freehold buildings 2% to 10% Leasehold buildings life of lease 1 Plant, machinery and motor vehicles 6% to 33 3% The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
Hunting PLC | 2018 Annual Report and Accounts 141 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 37.
Principal Accounting Policies continued h Property, Plant and Equipment continued ii Exploration Expenditure Oil and gas exploration and appraisal costs are initially capitalised pending determination of the existence of commercial reserves and are included in the asset category Oil and Gas Exploration and Development.
Upon determination that commercially viable quantities of hydrocarbons are not found, the costs are charged immediately to the income statement.
Depreciation of oil and gas expenditure commences when production commences.
The costs are depreciated using the unit of production method.
i Goodwill Goodwill arises when the fair value of the consideration paid for a business exceeds the fair value of the Groups share of the net assets acquired.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.
The allocation is made to the cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
On the disposal of a business, goodwill relating to that business that remains on the balance sheet at the date of disposal is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
j Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets, whether obtained through acquisition or internal development, are capitalised when it is probable that the future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will be generated, provided the cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Capitalisation only occurs from the point technical and commercial feasibility of the asset has been established.
Prior to this costs are expensed.
For internally generated assets, only costs directly attributable to the development of the asset are capitalised.
This typically includes employee remuneration and the cost of materials and services, such as testing, consumed in generating the intangible asset.
Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses where applicable.
These assets have a finite life and are amortised in accordance with the pattern of expected future economic benefits, or when this cannot be reliably estimated, by using the straight-line method.
Intangible assets are amortised over the following periods: Customer relationships eight to ten years Patents eight to ten years Unpatented technology eight to ten years Trademarks and domain names one to five years k Impairments The Group performs goodwill impairment reviews at least annually.
The Group also assesses at least annually whether there have been any events or changes in circumstances that indicate that property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill may be impaired.
An impairment review is carried out whenever the assessment indicates that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable.
For the purposes of impairment testing, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.
Where impairment exists, the asset is written down to the higher of a its fair value minus costs to sell: and b its value in use.
Impairments are recognised immediately in the income statement.
An impairment to goodwill is never reversed.
When applicable, an impairment of any other asset is reversed, but only to the extent that the consequent carrying value does not exceed what would have been the carrying value had the impairment not originally been made.
l Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined using the first-in-first-out method and net realisable value is the estimated selling price less costs of disposal in the ordinary course of business.
The cost of inventories includes direct costs plus production overheads.
m Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, short-term deposits with a maturity of less than three months from the date of deposit and Money Market Funds.
Short-term deposits and Money Market Funds have been classified as cash and cash equivalents as they are short-term, highly liquid, are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.
For cash flow statement purposes, cash and cash equivalents include bank overdrafts.
In the balance sheet, bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.
142 Hunting PLC | 2018 Annual Report and Accounts Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 37.
Principal Accounting Policies continued n Financial Assets At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL, transaction costs.
Transaction costs of financial assets at FVTPL are expensed immediately to the income statement.
Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on each Group entitys business model for managing the asset in order to generate cash flows and the cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.
The Groups debt instruments are classified either into amortised cost or fair value through profit or loss.
Debt instruments that are held for the collection of contractual cash flows, where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest method.
If collection is expected in one year or less they are classified as current assets, otherwise they are presented as non-current assets.
Debt instruments held for collection of contractual cash flows include the loan note, contract assets, trade receivables, accrued revenue and other receivables.
Any other debt instruments, including Money Market Funds, that are subsequently not measured at amortised cost have been measured at fair value through profit or loss.
The Groups financial assets that are equity instruments are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Changes in the fair value of the equity instruments are recognised in other operating income, operating expenses, finance income or finance expense, as appropriate.
Financial assets that are equity instruments comprise listed equity investments and mutual funds.
The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses ECLs at each balance sheet date associated with its loan note that is carried at amortised cost.
The Group has chosen to apply lifetime ECLs to trade receivables, accrued revenue, contract assets and lease receivables, both short-term and long-term, upon their initial recognition.
Previous Accounting Policy In 2017, the Group classified its financial assets under IAS 39 as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, as loans and receivables and as available-for-sale financial assets.
Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value at the trade date, which is normally the consideration paid plus transaction costs.
Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether a loan or receivable is impaired and, if necessary, the carrying amount is reduced to the appropriate value.
The loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Loans and receivables cease to be recognised when the right to receive cash flows has expired or the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
o Financial Liabilities Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value at the trade date which is normally the consideration received less, in the case of financial liabilities that are not measured at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs.
The Group subsequently remeasures all of its non-derivative financial liabilities, including trade payables, at amortised cost.
Payables are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year, otherwise they are presented as non-current liabilities.
p Derivatives and Hedging Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period.
The full fair value of a derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months from the balance sheet date.
The accounting for subsequent changes in fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
Where the derivatives are not designated in a hedge and accounted for using hedge accounting, they are classified as held for trading and are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss, with changes in the fair value recognised immediately within the income statement.
The Group designates certain derivatives as either: i hedges of the fair value of recognised assets and liabilities: or ii hedges of a particular risk associated with the cash flows of highly probable forecast transactions.
i Fair Value Hedges Fair value gains or losses on derivatives designated in a fair value hedge are recognised immediately in the income statement if the changes in the fair value of the hedged item are taken to the income statement.
Hunting PLC | 2018 Annual Report and Accounts 143 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 37.
Principal Accounting Policies continued p Derivatives and Hedging continued ii Cash Flow Hedges When forward foreign exchange contracts are designated in a cash flow hedge of forecast transactions, the Group generally designates only the change in fair value of the forward contract relating to the spot component as the hedging instrument.
Gains or losses relating to the effective portion of the change in the spot component of the forward contracts are recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve within equity.
The Group has chosen to recognise the change in the forward element of the contract that relates to the hedged item, defined as the forward points, within the income statement immediately rather than in equity.
The forward points are discounted, where material.
Where the hedged item subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset, such as inventory or PPE, the deferred hedging gains and losses in equity are included within the initial cost of the asset.
The deferred amounts are subsequently recognised in profit or loss when the hedged item affects profit or loss for example through cost of sales or depreciation.
When a hedging instrument expires, or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative deferred gain or loss in equity at that time remains in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.
When the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss of hedging that was reported in equity is immediately reclassified to the income statement.
q Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation.
The measurement of a provision is based on the most likely amount and timing of the expenditures.
Payments that are expected to arise after more than one year are discounted to their present value using a risk-free interest rate that is relevant to the region in which the past event occurred.
The risk-free interest rate is based on the redemption yields of government securities.
r Post-Employment Benefits i Defined Contribution Retirement Schemes Payments to defined contribution retirement schemes are charged to the income statement when they fall due.
ii Defined Benefit Retirement Schemes Payments to defined benefit retirement schemes were recognised as increments to the assets of the schemes.
The amount charged to the income statement with respect to these schemes, within profit from operations, is the increase in the retirement benefit obligation resulting from the additional service provided by the participating employees during the current year, which for the funded scheme was measured using the Projected Unit method and for the unfunded scheme is equal to the contributions paid.
Net interest arising on the net assets of the schemes was also recognised in the income statement within net finance costs.
Curtailment gains and losses were recognised fully and immediately in the income statement.
Remeasurement gains and losses were recognised fully and immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
The assets of the funded scheme, which were invested in insurance policies, were valued using the same methodology and assumptions used to calculate the defined benefit obligation so that, where the assets matched the liabilities, the value of the assets was equal to the value of the corresponding obligation.
s Share-Based Payments The Group issues equity-settled, share-based payments HPSP awards to certain employees as consideration for services received from the employees.
The fair value of the employees services is recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Groups estimate of awards that will ultimately vest.
The obligation to settle these awards is recognised within other components of equity.
t Share Capital The Companys share capital comprises a single class of Ordinary shares, which are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are charged to equity as a deduction from the proceeds, net of tax.
u Merger Reserve The merger reserve comprises the proceeds received, net of transaction costs, in excess of the nominal value of the Ordinary shares issued by way of the share placing completed on 31 October 2016.
In accordance with section 612 of the Companies Act 2006, the premium was credited to the merger reserve, instead of to the share premium account, because the share placing was pursuant to the Company securing over 90% of another entity.
The proceeds were used to pay down the Groups borrowings at that time.
The reserve is currently nondistributable and will be transferred to distributable retained earnings when the proceeds meet the definition of a qualifying consideration.
v Dividends Dividends to the Groups shareholders are recognised as liabilities in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
All dividends are dealt with in the statement of changes in equity.

Change in Accounting Policies This note explains the impact of the adoption of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments on the Groups financial statements.
a Impact on the Financial Statements As a result of the changes in the Groups accounting policies, the prior year financial statements have been restated for the effects of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
IFRS 9 Financial Statements has been adopted without restating comparative information.
The reclassifications and adjustments arising from the new impairment rules are therefore not reflected in the restated balance sheet as at 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2017, but are recognised in the opening balance sheet on 1 January 2018.
The tables below show the adjustments that have been made to each individual line item.
Line items that have not been affected by the changes have not been included separately, but instead have been grouped together.

IFRS 15 replaces IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 Construction Contracts and related interpretations.
The new accounting policies are set out in note 37.
The standard is effective for the Group from 1 January 2018.
IFRS 15 must be applied retrospectively.
However, an entity can choose whether to apply the standard retrospectively to each period presented or apply the modified retrospective method, whereby the cumulative effect of applying the standard is recognised in equity at the date of initial application.
In accordance with the transition provisions in IFRS 15, the Group has adopted the new rules fully retrospectively, rather than the modified retrospective method as indicated in the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts, and has restated the comparatives for the 2017 financial year, as this is considered to enhance the clarity of the financial statements.
The following adjustments were made to the amounts recognised in the balance sheet at the date of initial application, 1 January 2018.

Change in Accounting Policies continued b Impact of Adoption of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers continued IFRS 15 requires an entity to recognise revenue when control of promised goods or services is passed to its customers for an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
Revenue will either be recognised at a point in time, when the entity has completed its performance obligation or over time as, while and when the promise is performed.
Consequently, revenue that was previously recognised at a point in time may now have to be recognised over time.
Huntings revenue is principally generated from the following sources: Sales of goods to customers: products include manufactured goods and OCTG supplies.
Performance of services, which is principally comprised of threading plain-end pipe.
Licensed use of Huntings thread designs.
Rental of equipment such as mud motors and drilling tools.
Rental revenue does not fall within the scope of IFRS 15 and is unaffected by the requirements of the new accounting standard.
Management has identified two principal revenue streams that require an amendment to the Groups revenue accounting policies following the adoption of IFRS 15.
These activities involve: 1 the manufacture of products that have been designed with the customer to their bespoke specifications and for which Hunting has an enforceable right to payment if the customer were to prematurely withdraw from the contract without cause: and 2 work performed by Hunting that enhances customer-owned products, such as lathing customer-owned plain-end pipe.
Under IFRS 15, apportionment of revenue between different financial reporting periods is required when Huntings satisfaction of performance obligations straddles two or more financial reporting periods.
The majority of Huntings performance obligations are relatively short and consequently very few in number straddle two financial reporting periods.
As a result, only a small proportion of the Groups annual revenue needs to be apportioned between financial reporting periods such that the impact on the Groups financial statements is minimal.
The impact on the Groups retained earnings as at 1 January 2017 is as follows: 2017 $m Opening retained earnings at 1 January 2017 before restatement for IFRS 15 800.0 Point in time sales recognised as over time sales under IFRS 15 1.0 Restated opening retained earnings at 1 January 2017 under IFRS 15 801.0 The impact on the Groups retained earnings as at 1 January 2018 is as follows: 2018 $m Restated opening retained earnings at 1 January 2018 under IFRS 9 before restatement for IFRS 15 note 38 c 780.4 Point in time sales recognised as over time sales under IFRS 15 1.6 Restated opening retained earnings at 1 January 2018 under IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 782.0 Prior to the adoption of IFRS 15, the majority of the Groups revenue was recognised at the point in time when the goods or services were completed delivered.
IFRS 15 requires the Group to now recognise revenue when control of the goods or services transfers to the customer.
For some of the Groups activities as described above, this requires the Group to recognise revenue while the goods are still being manufactured or the services are still being performed.
Consequently, revenue on these activities is recognised earlier under IFRS 15 than it is recognised under the previous accounting standards.
At 31 December 2017, the fair value of the accelerated revenue amounted to $6.8m and this is recognised as a contract asset, within current receivables, on the balance sheet and as additional revenue within the year ended 31 December 2017.
As a result of control of the goods and services transferring to the customer, the Group must also fide-recognise the costs incurred to date in producing the goods or performing the services.
As at 31 December 2017, the carrying value of the goods and services that had transferred to the customer, and which under the previous accounting standards was recognised as inventory, amounted to $5.2m.
The net impact of recognising an additional asset of $6.8m, carried at fair value, and fide-recognising the associated cost of $5.2m, is to increase the Groups net assets by $1.6m, which is recognised as a $1.6m increase in retained earnings.
As a result of the Groups tax position, the tax impact of these adjustments is $nil.
The presentation of certain amounts in the balance sheet has been changed to reflect the terminology of IFRS 15, as follows: Net trade receivables of $148.0m have now been presented as net trade receivables from revenue from contracts with customers of $135.5m and net trade receivables from revenue from leasing contracts of $12.5m.
Accrued revenue of $6.2m has now been presented as accrued revenue arising from contracts with customers of $4.5m and accrued revenue arising from leasing contracts of $1.7m.
Contract liabilities of $9.1m were previously presented as payments on account from customers in other payables.
Hunting PLC | 2018 Annual Report and Accounts 149 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 38.
Change in Accounting Policies continued c Impact of Adoption of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9 Financial Instruments replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and establishes principles for the recognition, derecognition, classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities, together with new requirements relating to the impairment of financial assets and new simplified hedge accounting rules.
IFRS 9 became effective for the Group on 1 January 2018 and is generally applied retrospectively, except as described below.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 9 7.2.
15, comparative figures have not been restated in respect of IFRS 9s classification and measurement including impairment requirements.
Any differences in the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities as a result of adopting IFRS 9 are recognised in retained earnings as at 1 January 2018.
Accordingly, the information presented for the year ended 31 December 2017 does not generally reflect the requirements of IFRS 9 but rather those of IAS 39.
There was, therefore, no impact on the Groups retained earnings as at 1 January 2017 as a result of adopting IFRS 9.
The determination by each entity of the business model within which a financial asset is held has been made on the basis of the facts and circumstances that existed at the date of initial application, 1 January 2018.
The impact on the Groups retained earnings as at 1 January 2018 is as follows: 2018 Note $m Closing retained earnings at 31 December 2017 as previously reported under IAS 39 and IAS 18 780.6 Increase in provision for trade receivables and contract assets 38 c ii 0.2 Restated opening retained earnings at 1 January 2018 under IFRS 9 before restatement for IFRS 15 780.4 i Derivatives and Hedging There is a new hedge accounting model, which has been simplified and is more closely aligned to the businesss risk management activities.
Any changes to hedge accounting under IFRS 9 are to be applied prospectively by Hunting from 1 January 2018 as Hunting has not taken the option to continue applying IAS 39 to its hedge accounting.
The Group had forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency swaps in place to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange rate movements at 31 December 2017.
Certain forward foreign exchange contracts had been designated in a cash flow hedge as at 31 December 2017 to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with forecast inventory purchases.
These cash flow hedges have qualified as cash flow hedges under IFRS 9.
At 31 December 2017, forward foreign exchange contracts were designated in fair value hedges to hedge the foreign exchange movement in foreign currency trade payables.
These fair value hedges have qualified as fair value hedges under IFRS 9.
A foreign currency swap was also designated in a fair value hedge to hedge the foreign exchange movements in a Canadian dollar-denominated pseudo equity loan at 31 December 2017.
This fair value hedge has qualified as a fair value hedge under IFRS 9.
The Groups risk management strategies and hedge documentation are aligned with the requirements of IFRS 9 and these relationships are treated as continuing under IFRS 9.
Under IAS 39, the Group designated the spot component of the change in fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts in a cash flow hedge.
Changes in the forward points, the differential between the forward rate and the market spot rate, were recognised in the income statement in finance costs.
Under IFRS 9, changes in the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts attributable to forward points can be recognised as a cost of hedging in the hedging reserve.
The Group has chosen to continue recognising the costs of hedging in the income statement immediately rather than deferring these in equity.
Under IAS 39, the amounts accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve relating to the spot component were reclassified and included in the initial cost of the inventory item when it was recognised.
The same approach applies under IFRS 9 to the amounts accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve.

Change in Accounting Policies continued c Impact of Adoption of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments continued ii Impairment of Financial Assets IAS 39s incurred loss model has been replaced with a new impairment model, the expected loss model.
An entity will recognise a loss allowance from the point of initial recognition for all financial assets based on expected credit losses, which will result in the earlier recognition of credit losses, i. e. a day one loss, will be recognised.
This will result in the earlier recognition of bad debt provisions.
Trade receivables, contract assets and accrued revenue The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified impairment model, which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance, to short-term trade receivables, accrued revenue, contract assets and lease receivables and long-term trade receivables, accrued revenue and contract assets.
To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables, accrued revenue and contract assets have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due.
Contract assets represent the Groups right to consideration for goods or services that have been transferred to a customer while the right remains on condition that Hunting completes its promise.
Accrued revenue represents unbilled revenue that is recognised after Hunting has completed its promise to a customer.
As contract assets and accrued revenue have substantially the same credit risk characteristics as trade receivables for the same types of contracts, it was concluded that the expected loss rates for trade receivables are a reasonable approximation for the loss rates for contract assets and accrued revenue.
As at 31 December 2017, the impact on the Groups financial performance and position has been an increase in the bad debt provision of $0.2m.
A reconciliation of the bad debt provision as at 31 December 2017 and 1 January 2018 is shown below.
2018 $m At 31 December 2017 calculated under IAS 39 4.8 Additional impairment recognised at 1 January 2018 on trade receivables as at 31 December 2017 0.2 Opening bad debt provision as at 1 January 2018 calculated under IFRS 9 5.0 The bad debt provision decreased to $3.1m by 31 December 2018.
The decrease would not have been materially different under the incurred loss model of IAS 39.
Trade receivables and contract assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of sale.
Indicators that the debt will not be recovered include defaults in payment and the debtor is in financial difficulty or the debtor has been placed into administration and is no longer trading.
Investments The Groups listed equity investments and mutual funds are carried at fair value through profit or loss and are considered to have a low credit risk as they have a low risk of default.
Funds are invested in a wide portfolio of US mutual funds and no individual exposure is considered to be significant.
Other financial assets at amortised cost Other financial assets carried at amortised cost include the loan note, a receivable from the liquidators of an associate for the Groups share of net assets and other receivables.
The loss allowance at 1 January 2018, as a result of applying the expected credit risk model under IFRS 9, was $nil and by 31 December 2018 the receivable from the liquidators of $1.3m had been collected in full.
iii Classification and Measurement The classification and measurement of financial assets is now driven by the cash flow characteristics of the asset and the business model of the individual company.
On 1 January 2018, the date of initial application of IFRS 9, management has assessed which business models apply to the financial assets held by the Group and has classified its financial instruments into the appropriate IFRS 9 categories.
All of the Groups entities have a hold to collect business model and therefore the classification of financial assets has not changed following the adoption of IFRS 9.
As a result, there has been no impact on the Groups retained earnings.
The effect of adopting IFRS 9 on the carrying amounts of financial assets at 1 January 2018 relates solely to the new impairment requirements.
The classification of the Groups non-current and current investments under IFRS 9 has not changed from the classification under IAS 39 at fair value through profit or loss.
Non-current and current other receivables, the loan note, net trade receivables, accrued revenue and cash at bank and in hand were previously classified as loans and receivables under IAS 39 are now classified as at amortised cost under IFRS 9.
The carrying amounts for financial assets under IFRS 9 have not changed from the carrying amounts under IAS 39, except for trade and other receivables.
An increase of $0.2m in the bad debt provision was recognised in opening retained earnings at 1 January 2018 on transition to IFRS 9 and the carrying amount of net trade receivables reduced from $148.0m to $147.8m.
These trade and other receivables do not include the additional contract assets of $6.8m that were recognised on the adoption of IFRS 15, see note 38 b above.
