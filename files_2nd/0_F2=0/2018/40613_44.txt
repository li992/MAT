Financial assets The Company classifies its financial assets into one of the categories discussed below, depending on the purpose for which the asset was acquired.
The Companys accounting policy for each category is as follows: Fair value through profit or loss This category comprises in-the-money derivatives and out-of-money derivatives where the time value offsets the negative intrinsic value see Financial liabilities section for out-of-money derivatives classified as liabilities.
They are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the finance income or expense line.
Other than derivative financial instruments which are not designated as hedging instruments, the Company does not have any assets held for trading nor does it voluntarily classify any financial assets as being at fair value through profit orloss.
Amortised cost These assets arise principally from the provision of goods and services to customers eg trade receivables, but also incorporate other types of financial assets where the objective is to hold these assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest.
They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to their acquisition or issue and are subsequently carried at amortised cost being the effective interest rate method, less provision forimpairment.
Impairment provisions for current and non-current trade receivables are recognised based on the simplified approach within IFRS 9 using a provision matrix in the determination of the lifetime expected credit losses.
During this process the probability of the non-payment of the trade receivables is assessed.
This probability is then multiplied by the amount of the expected loss arising from default to determine the lifetime expected credit loss for the trade receivables.
For trade receivables, which are reported net, such provisions are recorded in a separate provision account with the loss being recognised within cost of sales in the statement of comprehensive income.
On confirmation that the trade receivable will not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset is written off against the associatedprovision.
Impairment provisions for receivables from related parties and loans to related parties are recognised based on a forward-looking expected credit loss model.
The methodology used to determine the amount of provision is based on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition of the financial asset, twelve month expected credit losses along with gross interest income are recognised.
For those for which credit risk has increased significantly, lifetime expected credit losses along with the gross interest income are recognised.
For those that are determined to be credit impaired, lifetime expected credit losses along with interest income on a net basis are recognised.
The Companys financial assets measured at amortised cost comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the Company Balance Sheet.
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Investments in subsidiaries The investments in subsidiary companies are included in the Companys Balance Sheet at cost less provision forimpairment.

Accounting policies continued Share based payments The expense relating to share based payments is accrued over the year in which the service is received and is measured at the fair value of those services received.
The extent to which the expense is not settled at the reporting period end is recognisedas a liability as any shares outstanding remain contingently issuable.
Contingently issuable shares are treated as dilutive to the extent that, based on market factors prevalent at the reporting year-end, the shares would beissuable.
Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions The preparation of the Companys financial information requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the reporting date.
However, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in future years.
There were no significant accounting judgements, estimates or assumptions in preparing these financialstatements.
Standards issued and effective from 1January2018 The following new standards are effective and have been adopted for the year ended 31December2018.
Standards in issue and effective from 1January 2018 IFRS9: Financial Instruments IFRS9 has replaced IAS 39 Financial lnstruments: Recognition and Measurement lAS 39.
Management have reviewed the requirements of IFRS9.
The Groups principal financial assets comprise interest rate derivatives which will continue to be measured at fair value, and trade receivables, which will continue to be measured at amortised cost.
The following changes have been identified.
a The Company adopted the expected credit loss model when calculating impairment losses on its financial assets measured at amortised costs such as loans to group companies both current and non-current.
This resulted in increased judgement being required in order to assess the requirement for an impairment provision due to the need to factor in forward looking information when estimating the appropriate amount of provisions.
No material impairment provisions were recognised as a result of the adoption of IFRS9.
IFRS15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS15 has replaced IAS18 Revenue and IAS11 Construction Contracts.
The Companys revenue is derived from income from subsidiaries that is outside the scope of IFRS15 and accordingly the adoption has not had a materialimpact.
