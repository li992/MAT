Taxation on profit loss on ordinary activities continued Factors affecting tax credit for the year The tax rate applied to profit on ordinary activities in preparing the reconciliation below is the UK corporation tax rate applicable to the Groups non-upstream UK profits.
The difference between the total tax expense credit shown above and the amount calculated by applying the standard rate of UK corporation tax applicable to UK profits of 19 per cent 2017: 19 per cent to the profit loss before tax is as follows: 2018 2017 $m $m Group profit loss on ordinary activities before tax 260.5 285.9 Tax on Group profit loss on ordinary activities at the standard UK corporation tax rate of 19% 2017: 19% 49.5 54.3 Effects of: Non-deductible exploration expenditure 20.8 21.6 Fair value movements on derivatives 32.0 Other non-deductible expenses 12.8 10.1 Derecognition of deferred tax previously recognised 37.3 Recognition of deferred tax previously unrecognised 21.5 Utilisation of tax losses not previously recognised 10.6 0.3 Net losses not recognised 7.7 18.4 Adjustment relating to prior years 1.0 1.9 Adjustments to deferred tax relating to change in tax rates 2.1 12.6 Higher rate of taxation on Norway losses 10.0 13.1 Other tax rates applicable outside the UK and Norway 52.4 88.0 PSC income not subject to corporation tax 8.8 15.4 Tax incentives for investment 2.8 Other income not subject to corporation tax 6.9 6.0 Group total tax expense credit for the year 175.1 110.6 The Finance Act 2016 further reduced the main rate of UK corporation tax applicable to all companies subject to corporation tax, except for those within the oil and gas ring fence, to 19 per cent from 1 April 2017 and 17 per cent from 1 April 2020.
These changes were substantively enacted on 6 September 2016 and hence the effect of the change on the deferred tax balances has been included, depending upon when deferred tax is expected to reverse.
The Groups profit before taxation will continue to arise in jurisdictions where the effective rate of taxation differs from that intheUK, such as Ghana 35 per cent, Gabon 50 per cent, and Equatorial Guinea 35 per cent.
Furthermore, unsuccessful exploration expenditure is often incurred in jurisdictions where the Group has no taxable profits, such that no related tax benefit arises.
Accordingly, the Groups tax charge will continue to vary according to the jurisdictions in which pre-tax profits and exploration costs written off arise.
The Group has tax losses of $3,581.3 million 2017: $3,642.0 million that are available for offset against future taxable profits inthe companies in which the losses arose.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as they maynot be used to offset taxable profits elsewhere in the Group due to uncertainty of recovery.
The Group has recognised deferred tax assets of $527.5 million 2017: $530.0 million in relation to tax losses only to the extent of anticipated future taxable income or gains in relevant jurisdictions.
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of $7.8 million 2017: $7.9 million relating to unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Tax relating to components of other comprehensive income During 2018 $nil 2017: $24.3 million of tax has been recognised through other comprehensive income of which $nil 2017:$24.9 million is current and $nil 2017: $0.6 million is deferred tax relating to all debit 2017: debit on cash flow hedgesarising in the year.

During 2018 and 2017 the Group applied the following nominal oil price assumptions for impairment assessments: Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Year 6 onwards 2018 Forward curve Forward curve $66 bbl $68 bbl $75 bbl $75 bbl inflated at 2% 2017 Forward curve Forward curve $59 bbl $66 bbl $68 bbl $75 bbl inflated at 2% Oil prices statedabove are benchmark prices to which an individual field price differential is applied.
All impairment assessments are prepared on a value-in-use basis using discounted future cash flows based on 2P reserves profiles.
A reduction or increase in the two-year forward curve of $15 bbl, based on the approximate volatility of the oil price over the previous two years, and a reduction or increase in the medium and long-term price assumptions of$15 bbl, based on the range seen inexternal oil price market forecasts, are considered to be reasonably possible changes for the purposes of sensitivity analysis.
Decreases to oil prices specified above would increase the impairment charge by $934.2 million, whilst increases to oil prices specified above would result in a credit to the impairment charge of $850.7 million.
A 1 per cent increase in the pre-tax discount rate would increase the impairment by $115.6 million.
A 1 per cent decrease in the pre-tax discount rate would decrease the impairment by$115.6 million.
The Group believes a 1 per cent change in the pre-tax discount rate to be a reasonable possibility based on historical analysis of the Groups and a peer group of companies impairment discount rates.

Assets classified as held for sale In 2017, Tullow announced that it had agreed a substantial farm-down of its assets in Uganda.
Under the Sale and Purchase Agreement, Tullow has agreed to transfer 21.57 per cent of its 33.33 per cent Uganda interests for a total consideration of $900million.
Upon completion, the farm-down will leave Tullow with an 11.76 per cent interest in the upstream and pipeline projects.
This is expected to reduce to a 10 per cent interest in the upstream project when the Government of Uganda formally exercises its back-in right.
Although it has not yet been determined what interests the Governments of Uganda and Tanzania willtake in the pipeline project, Tullow expects its interests in the upstream and pipeline projects to be aligned.
The consideration is split into $200 million in cash, consisting of $100 million payable on completion of the transaction, $50 million payable at FID and $50 million payable at First Oil.
The remaining $700 million is in deferred consideration and represents reimbursement in cash of a proportion of Tullows past exploration and development costs.
The deferred consideration is payable to Tullow as the upstream and pipeline projects progress and these payments will be used by Tullow to fund its share of the development costs.
Tullow expects the deferred consideration to cover its share of upstream and pipeline development capex toFirst Oil and beyond.
Following meetings in January 2019 between the CEOs of both Tullow and Total and H. E. President Museveni of Uganda, Tullow has agreed the basis for Capital Gains Tax on its $900 million Uganda farm-down to CNOOC and Total.
The Government and the JV Partners are now engaged in discussions to finalise an agreement reflecting this tax treatment that will enable completion of the farm-down to take place.
Any Capital Gains Tax is expected to be phased and partly linked to project progress.
At completion of the farm-down, Tullow anticipates receiving a cash payment of $100 million and a payment of the working capital completion adjustment and deferred consideration for the pre-completion period of $108 million.
A further $50 million cash consideration is due to be received when FID is taken on the development project.
The estimated fair value of the consideration was $829.7 million on recognition.
The fair value of the deferred consideration was calculated using expected timing of receipts based on managements best estimate of the expected capital profile of the project discounted at the relevant counterpartys cost of borrowing.
Additions to the value initially recognised related to capitalised interest transferred from intangible exploration and evaluation assets, which were $41.6 million in 2018 2017: $43.4 million.
The present value of the consideration was re-assessed as $840.2 million as at 31 December 2018.
The difference to the carrying value of the net assets of the disposal group has been recognised as an exploration write-off refer to note 10.
Assets classified as held for sale represent a level 3 financial asset.

On 23 March 2018, the Group completed its offering of $800 million of Senior Notes due 2025.
The offering was significantly oversubscribed and increased from the initial offering of $650 million.
Proceeds have been used to redeem, in full, Senior Notesdue in 2020 and repay drawings on the RBL facility.
In April 2018, commitments under the Corporate Revolving Credit Facility RCF reduced from $600 million to $500 million inline with the amortisation schedule: in addition, the Group voluntarily cancelled a further $150 million of commitments, reducing financing costs of undrawn committed facilities.
In November 2018, the Group voluntarily cancelled the remaining facility, which was undrawn, in full to realise further cost savings from reduced commitment fees.
The Group has a Reserves Based Lending RBL facility which is split between a commercial bank facility and an International Finance Corporation IFC facility.
During the year, commitments under the commercial bank facility remained at $2,400 million, and commitments under the IFC facility reduced from $100 million to $64 million in line with the amortisation schedule.
The RBL facility incurs interest on outstanding debt at US dollar LIBOR plus an applicable margin.
The outstanding debt is repayable in line with the amortisation of aggregate commitments over the period to the final maturity date of 21 November 2024, with an initial three-year grace period relating to the $2,400 million commercial bank facility, or such time as is determined by reference to the remaining reserves of the assets, whichever is earlier.
The Group has identified that retrospective application of IFRS 9 has increased the carrying value of the Reserves Based Lending credit facility by $110.8 million and resulted in the need to record a modification loss due to the refinancing of the facility in November 2017.
Given the refinancing occurred in November 2017, implementation of IFRS 9 has reduced retained earnings on 1 January 2018.
This will lower the finance costs recognised over the remaining life of the facility compared to the treatment under IAS 39.
At 31 December 2018, available headroom under the RBL amounted to $974 million.
At 31 December 2017, the available headroom under the facilities amounted to $945 million: $345 million under the RBL and $600 million under the RCF.
Capital management The Group defines capital as the total equity and net debt of the Group.
Capital is managed in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits to stakeholders and to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern.
Tullow is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may put in place new debt facilities, issue new shares for cash, repay debt, engage in active portfolio management, adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, or undertake other such restructuring activities as appropriate.
No significant changes were made to the capital management objectives, policies or processes during the year ended 31 December 2018.
The Group monitors capital onthe basis of the gearing, being net debt divided by adjusted EBITDAX, and maintains a policy target of between 1x and 2x.
Asummary of the gearing calculation and a reconciliation of the metric to IFRS measures can be found in the Finance Review on page 39. www.

Financial instruments Financial risk management objectives The Group is exposed to a variety of risks including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, foreign currency risk andliquidity risk.
The Group holds a portfolio of commodity derivative contracts, with various counterparties.
The Group holds a mix of fixed and floating rate debt to manage its interest rate risk.
A portfolio of interest rate derivatives was held and matured during the year.
The use of derivative financial instruments is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of Directors.
Compliance with policies and exposure limits are monitored and reviewed internally on a regular basis.
The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivatives, for speculative purposes.
Fair values of financial assets and liabilities With the exception of the Senior Notes and the convertible bonds, the Group considers the carrying value of all its financial assets and liabilities to be materially the same as their fair value.
The fair value of the Senior Notes, as determined using market values at 31 December 2018, was $1,373.0 million 2017: $1,310.7 million compared to the carrying value of $1,434.2 million 2017: $1,286.0 million.
The fair value of the convertible bonds, as determined using market values as at 31 December 2018, was $326.9 million 2017:$374.0 million compared to the carrying value of $267.0 million 2017: $256.9 million.
The Group has no material financial assets that are past due.
No material financial assets are impaired at the balance sheet date.
All financial assets and liabilities with the exception of derivatives are measured at amortised cost.
Fair values of derivative instruments All derivatives are recognised at fair value on the balance sheet with valuation changes recognised immediately in the income statement, unless the derivatives have been designated as a cash flow hedge.
Fair value is the amount for which the asset or liability could be exchanged in an arms length transaction at the relevant date.
Where available, fair values are determined using quoted prices in active markets.
To the extent that market prices are not available, fair values are estimated by reference to market-based transactions, or using standard valuation techniques for the applicable instruments and commodities involved.
The Groups derivative carrying and fair values were as follows: 2018 2018 2017 2017 Less than 13 2018 Less than 13 2017 1 year years Total 1 year years Total Assets liabilities $m $m $m $m $m $m Cash flow hedges Oil derivatives 137.9 78.6 216.5 3.7 4.4 0.7 Interest rate derivatives 0.8 0.8 137.9 78.6 216.5 2.9 4.4 1.5 Deferred premium Oil derivatives 61.0 27.4 88.4 49.4 28.4 77.8 61.0 27.4 88.4 49.4 28.4 77.8 Total assets 79.7 51.2 130.9 1.8 0.8 2.6 Total liabilities 2.7 2.7 53.1 25.8 78.9 Derivatives maturity and the timing of their recycling into income or expense coincide.
The following provides an analysis of the Groups financial instruments measured at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1: fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets orliabilities: Level 2: fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 which are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3: fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques which include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
All the Groups derivatives are Level 2 2017: Level 2.
There were no transfers between fair value levels during the year.
For financial instruments which are recognised on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels by re-assessing categorisation based on the lowest-level input which is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole at the end of each reporting period.

Financial instruments continued Offset of financial assets and financial liabilities Deferred premiums on derivatives are settled at maturity of the derivative contracts, with the cash flows settled on a net basis.
Netting agreements are also in place to enable the Group and its counterparties to set off liabilities against available assets in the event that either party is unable to fulfil its contractual obligations.
The following tables provide the offsetting relationship within assets and liabilities in the balance sheet.

Such commodity derivatives tend to be priced using benchmarks, such as Dated Brent, which correlate as far as possible to the underlying oil revenue.
There is an economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments as the terms of the derivative contracts are closely aligned to the terms of the expected highly probable forecast transactions.
The Group has established a hedge ratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships as the underlying risk of the commodity derivatives are identical to the hedged risk components.
To test the hedge effectiveness, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method and compares the changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments against the changes in fair value of the hedged items attributable to the hedged risks.
The Group hedges its estimated oil revenues on a portfolio basis, aggregating its oil revenues from substantially all of its African oil interests.
As at 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017, all of the Groups oil derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedges.
TheGroups oil hedges have been assessed to be highly effective.
There is, however, the potential for a degree of ineffectiveness inherent in the Groups oil hedges arising from, among other factors, the differential on the Groups underlying African crude relative to Dated Brent and the timing of oil liftings relative to the hedges.
The ineffectiveness recognised in the group income statement was a gain of $2.4 million 2017: $1.4 million gain.
The following table demonstrates the timing, volumes and average floor price protected for the Groups commodity hedges: Hedging position as at 31 December 2018 2019 2020 2021 Oil volume bopd 55,732 24,997 Average floor price protected $ bbl 56.25 59.31 Hedging position as at 31 December 2017 2018 2019 2020 Oil volume bopd 45,000 22,232 997 Average floor price protected $ bbl 52.23 48.87 50.00 The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of the Groups derivative financial instruments to reasonably possible movements in Dated Brent oil prices: Effect on equity Market 2018 2017 movement $m $m Brent oil price 25% 14.2 139.0 Brent oil price 25% 486.9 115.5 The following assumptions have been used in calculating the sensitivity in movement of oil price: the pricing adjustments relate only to the point forward mark-to-market MTM valuations, the price sensitivities assume there is no ineffectiveness related to the oil hedges and the sensitivities have been run only on the intrinsic element of the hedge as management considers this to be the material component of oil hedge valuations.

Financial instruments continued Cash flow and interest rate risk Subject to parameters set by management, the Group seeks to minimise interest costs by using a mixture of fixed and floating debt.
Floating rate debt comprises bank borrowings at interest rates fixed in advance from overnight to three months at rates determined by US dollar LIBOR.
Fixed rate debt comprises Senior Notes and convertible bonds, bank borrowings at interest rates fixed in advance for periods greater than three months or bank borrowings where the interest rate has been fixed through interest rate hedging.
Following maturity of the Groups interest rate hedges in November 2018, the mark-to-market position of the Groups interest rate hedge portfolio as at 31 December 2018 is nil 2017: $0.8 million asset.
The interest rate profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities, excluding trade and other receivables and trade and other payables, at 31 December 2018 and 2017, was as follows: 2018 2018 2017 2017 2018 Fixed rate Floating rate 2018 2017 Fixed rate Floating rate 2017 Cash at bank debt debt Total Cash at bank debt debt Total $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m US$ 149.7 1,750.0 1,490.0 3,090.3 219.4 1,900.0 1,855.0 3,535.6 Euro 0.4 0.4 3.1 3.1 Sterling 10.9 10.9 21.4 21.4 Other 18.8 18.8 40.1 40.1 179.8 1,750.0 1,490.0 3,060.2 284.0 1,900.0 1,855.0 3,471.0 Cash at bank consisted mainly of deposits which earn interest at rates set in advance for periods ranging from overnight to one month by reference to market rates.

The primary credit exposures for the Group are its receivables generated by the marketing of crude oil and amounts due from JV Partners including in relation to their share of the TEN FPSO finance lease.
These exposures are managed at the corporate level.
The Groups crude sales are predominantly made to international oil market participants including the oil majors, trading houses and refineries.
JV Partners are predominantly international major oil and gas market participants.
Counterparty evaluations are conducted utilising international credit rating agency and financial assessments.
Where considered appropriate, security in the form of trade finance instruments from financial institutions with an appropriate credit rating, such as letters of credit, guarantees and credit insurance, are obtained to mitigate the risks.
The Group generally enters into derivative agreements with banks which are Lenders under the Reserves Based Lending facility.
Security is provided under the facility agreement which mitigates non-performance risk.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties.
The maximum financial exposure due to credit risk on the Groups financial assets, representing the sum of cash and cash equivalents, investments, derivative assets, trade receivables, current tax assets and other current assets, as at 31 December 2018 was $1,569.6 million 2017: $2,217.7 million.
Foreign currency risk The Group conducts and manages its business predominantly in US dollars, the operating currency of the industry in which it operates.
The Group also purchases the operating currencies of the countries in which it operates routinely on the spot market.
From time to time the Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in other currencies.
These exposures are often managed by executing foreign currency financial derivatives.
There were no material foreign currency financial derivatives in place as at 31 December 2018 2017: nil.
Cash balances are held in other currencies to meet immediate operating and administrative expenses or to comply with local currency regulations.

Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has established an appropriate liquidity risk management framework covering the Groups short-, mediumand long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group closely monitors and manages its liquidity risk.
Cash forecasts are regularly produced and sensitivities run for different scenarios including, but not limited to, changes in commodity prices, different production rates from the Groups producing assets and delays to development projects.
In addition to the Groups operating cash flows, portfolio management opportunities are reviewed to potentially enhance the financial capability and flexibility of the Group.

The present value of the lease liabilities unwinds over the expected life of the lease and is reported within finance costs as interest on obligations under finance leases.
The present value of the TEN FPSO lease obligations at 31 December 2018 was $1,389.6 million 2017: $1,521.0 million.
A receivable from Joint Venture Partners of $656.9 million 2017: $719.0 million was recognised in other assets to reflect the value of future payments that will be met by cash calls from partners.
The present value of the receivable from Joint Venture Partners unwinds over the expected life of the lease and is reported within finance revenue.
The net cash outflows of $117.4 million 2017: $62.6 million related to the lease agreement since its recognition as a finance lease have been reported in the repayment of obligations under finance leases line in the cash flow statements.
Prior to recognition as a finance lease, it was accounted for as an operating lease, and included as operating lease payments within cost of sales note 4.
The fair value of the Groups lease obligations approximates the carrying amount.
The average expected remaining lease term as at 31 December 2018 was six years 2017: seven years.
For the year ended 31 December 2018, the effective borrowing rate was 7.1 per cent 2017: 7.1 per cent.
Following a trial in the English Commercial Court in May 2018, the court ruled on 3 July that Tullow was not entitled to terminate its West Leo rig contract with Seadrill on 4 December 2016 by invoking the contracts force majeure provisions.
Following advice from counsel, Tullow will not be appealing this ruling.
Tullow has now paid Seadrill a contractual termination fee, other standby fees that accrued in the 60 days prior to termination of the contract and interest amounting to $248 million in aggregate and a further $11million of Ghana withholding tax.
Although Tullow regards these as Joint Venture costs, Kosmos disputed separately, through an International Chamber of Commerce arbitration against Tullow, its share of the liability c. 20 per cent of any costs related to the use of the West Leo rig beyond 1 October 2016.
On 17 July 2018, the arbitration tribunal delivered a final and binding award in favour of Kosmos which determined that Kosmos is not liable for its share of the Seadrill costs.
The arbitration award also provided that Tullow reimburses Kosmos $8.4 million for rig demobilisation costs and certain of its legal costs.
Inrelation to this matter, and several smaller provisions, the Group recorded an additional pre-tax income statement charge of$167.4 million 2017: credit of $1.0 million.

Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent it is considered probable that those assets will be recoverable.
This involves an assessment of when those deferred tax assets are likely to reverse, and a judgement as to whether or not there will be sufficient taxable profits available to offset the tax assets when they do reverse.
This requires assumptions regarding future profitability and is therefore inherently uncertain.
To the extent assumptions regarding future profitability change, there can be an increase or decrease in the level of deferred tax assets recognised which can result in a charge or credit in the period in which the change occurs.

The Company makes a matching contribution to acquire Tullow shares Matching Shares on a one-for-one basis.
Under the UK SIP, Matching Shares are subject to time-based forfeiture over three years on leaving employment in certain circumstances or if the related Partnership Shares are sold.
The fair value of a Matching Share is its market value whenit is awarded.
Under the UK SIP: i Partnership Shares are purchased at the lower of their market values at the start of the accumulation period and the purchase date which is treated as a three-month share option for IFRS 2 purposes and therefore results in an accounting charge, and ii Matching Shares vest over the three years after being awarded resulting in their accounting charge being spread over that period.
Under the Irish SIP: i Partnership Shares are bought at the market value at the purchase date which does not result in any accounting charge, and ii Matching Shares vest over the two years after being awarded resulting in their accounting charge being spread over that period.

com 151 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018 Note 30.
New International Financial Reporting Standards adopted and yet to be adopted continued IFRS 9 Financial Instruments continued The classification and measurement of financial assets have changed with the implementation of IFRS 9.
However, this has not materially changed the measurement of financial assets of the Group.
The IFRS 9 impairment model requiring the recognition of expected credit losses, in contrast to the requirement to recognise incurred credit losses under IAS 39, has not had a material impact on the Groups Financial Statements.
Trade receivables are generally settled on a short time frame and the Groups other financial assets are due from counterparties without material credit risk concerns at the time of transition.
IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 eliminates the current dual accounting model for lessees, which distinguishes between on-balance sheet finance leases and off-balance sheet operating leases.
Instead, there is a single, on-balance sheet accounting model that is similar tocurrent finance lease accounting.
The adoption of IFRS 16 Leases, which the Group will adopt for the year commencing 1January 2019, will impact both the measurement and disclosures of leases over a low-value threshold, with terms longer thanone year, but exclude any leases to explore for oil and gas i. e. mineral rights.
The Group has completed an assessment oflease agreements.
On adoption of IFRS 16, the Group will recognise lease liabilities in relation to leases which are currently classified as operating leases under the principles of IAS 17 Leases.
These liabilities will be measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease if available, or the Groups incremental borrowing rate as of 1 January 2019, which was 6.9 per cent.
The determination of whether there is an interest rate implicit inthe rate, the calculation of the Groups incremental borrowing rate, and whether any adjustments to this rate are required forcertain portfolios of leases involve some judgement and are subject to change over time.
Adjustments to the Groups incremental borrowing rate for individual leases have not been made as the Group does not enter in to financing arrangements at the subsidiary level, leases are largely denominated in US Dollars, and the impact of any other adjustments have been calculated to be immaterial.
A 1 per cent change in the Groups incremental borrowing rate would increase decrease the value of lease liabilities on transition by around $8 million.
In accordance with the transition provisions in IFRS 16 the modified retrospective approach has been adopted, with the cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard recognised on 1 January 2019.
Comparatives for the 2018 financial year will not be restated.
The expected financial impact of transition to IFRS 16 has been summarised within this note.
In applying IFRS 16 for the first time, the Group has used the following practical expedients permitted by the standard on transition: - the use of a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics: - the accounting for operating leases with a remaining lease term of less than 12 months as at 1 January 2019 as short-term leases:and - to not separate non-lease components from all leases with a right-of-use asset less than $2 million.
The Group has identified lease portfolios for property, oil and gas production and support equipment, transportation equipment, and other equipment.
Gross value on transition Lease portfolio $m Property leases 77.4 Oil and gas production and support equipment leases 345.2 Transportation equipment leases 31.7 Other equipment 0.1 Total 454.4 Financial impact of the transition Income statement Property leases: These leases are currently included as administrative expenses.
On transition to IFRS 16 the expense will decrease, offset by an increase in finance costs and depreciation of other fixed assets.
Oil and gas production and support equipment leases: These leases are currently either treated as operating costs or capitalised as property, plant and equipment or intangible assets.
On transition to IFRS 16 operating costs will decrease, offset by an increase in finance costs and depletion and amortisation of oil and gas assets.
Transportation equipment leases: These leases are currently included as administrative expenses or operating costs.
Ontransition to IFRS 16 these expenses will decrease, offset by an increase in finance costs, depreciation of other fixed assetsand depletion and amortisation of oil and gas assets.
Other equipment: These leases are currently included as administrative expenses or operating costs.
On transition to IFRS 16 these expenses will decrease, offset by an increase in finance costs and depreciation of other fixed assets and depletion and amortisation of oil and gas assets.

New International Financial Reporting Standards adopted and yet to be adopted continued Financial impact of the transition continued Balance sheet The Group expects the impact of the transition to result in higher property, plant and equipment, current and non-current otherassets and current and non-current lease liabilities.
The amounts on transition stated below are in addition to contracts accounted for as finance leases at 31 December 2018 refer to note 21.

The assessment of whether a lease liability incurred by an operator should be recorded net or gross, in accordance with IFRS 16, IFRS 11 and IFRS 15, is currently under a review and comment letter process with IFRIC.
Tullow will continue to monitor the outcome of this process in 2019.
Non-IFRS measures Gearing and adjusted EBITDAX are expected to be impacted by the transition to IFRS 16.
As discussed above, the reductions to operating costs and administrative expenses will increase adjusted EBITDAX.
Increases in finance costs, depreciation of other fixed assets and depletion and amortisation of oil and gas assets will not decrease adjusted EBITDAX as they are items that are adjusted for in Tullows calculation.
This expected increase to adjusted EBITDAX will decrease gearing.
The changes are not expected to impact capital investment or net debt, as lease additions and lease liabilities, respectively, will be excluded from the calculation of these metrics.
Similarly, adjustments will be made to present underlying cash operating costs excluding the impact of the change to leases, as this is how management will monitor operating costs.
Detailed reconciliations showing the impact of leases will be disclosed in future periods.
The Groups leasing activities and how these are accounted for: - Lease contracts are typically made for fixed periods of two to five years but may have extension options.
Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions.
The lease agreements do not impose any covenants, but leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes.
- Leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset, plus Joint Venture receivable where applicable, and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by the Group.
Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost.
The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate ofinterest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.
The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter ofthe assets useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis, and the Joint Venture receivable is allocated against themonthly Joint Venture billing cycle.
Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis.
Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments: - fixed payments, less any lease incentives receivable for example rent-free periods : - variable lease payments that are based on an index or rate: and - amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees.
The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be determined, or the Groups incremental borrowing rate.

New International Financial Reporting Standards adopted and yet to be adopted continued Financial impact of the transition continued Non-IFRS measures continued Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following: - the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability, less any amount receivable from Joint Venture Partners: - any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received: - any initial direct costs, and - restoration or dilapidation costs.
Payments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss.
Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less.
Low-value assets are leases with an annual cost of $5,000 or less.
Over the course of a lease contract, there will be taxable timing differences that could give rise todeferred tax, subject to local tax laws and regulations.
