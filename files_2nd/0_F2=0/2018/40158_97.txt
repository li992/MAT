Transition to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Accounting policies applied to financial instruments prior to 1 January 2018.
Impairment of financial instruments Impairment of financial instruments is performed on an incurred loss basis, when there is objective evidence of impairment.
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events occurring after the initial recognition of the asset a loss event, and that loss event or events has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
Impairment of loans and receivables and held-to-maturity financial instruments.
Corporate & Institutional Banking and Commercial Banking The assessment of the credit risk of corporate and commercial loans is done by the Credit Risk department, based upon counterparty information they receive from various sources including relationship managers and on external market information, or as soon as payment of interest or principal is 90 days overdue.
Once a loan starts to exhibit credit deterioration, it will move along the credit grading scale in the performing book and when it is classified as Credit Grade CG 12, the credit assessment and oversight of the loan will be performed by Group Special Asset Management GSAM.
Where GSAMs assessment indicates that a loan is impaired, GSAM will calculate an Individual Impairment Provision IIP based on estimated cash flows revised to reflect anticipated recoveries.
GSAMs assessment and calculation of impairment involves a significant level of judgement.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on a loan and receivable or a held-to-maturity asset has occurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred, discounted at the assets original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement.
If a loan and receivable or held-to-maturity asset has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract.
As a practical expedient, the Group may measure impairment on the basis of an instruments fair value using an observable market price.
The individual circumstances of each client are taken into account when GSAM estimates future cash flows.
All available sources, such as cash flow arising from operations, selling assets or subsidiaries, realising collateral or payments under guarantees are considered.
In any decision relating to the raising of provisions, the Group attempts to balance economic conditions, local knowledge and experience, and the results of independent asset reviews.
The calculation of the present value of the estimated future cash flows of a collateralised financial asset reflects the cash flows that may result from foreclosure, less costs for obtaining and selling the collateral, whether or not foreclosure is probable.
In cases where the impairment assessment indicates that there will be a loss of principal, the loan is graded CG14 while other impaired loans will be graded CG13.
Loans graded CG13CG14 are classified as non-performing loans.
The performing loan portfolio is subject to a Portfolio Impairment Provision PIP to cover latent losses i. e. those that are not specifically identified but are known, by experience, to be present in any performing portfolio.
The PIP is based on models using risk sizing including probability of default and loss given default, environmental parameters and exceptional adjustment overlays.
The calculation of the PIP uses regulatory expected credit loss ECL models.
ECL is subject to an emergence risk factor that is generally understood as the hypothetical amount of time between a loss event occurrence and the bank recognition of impairment.
The emergence risk factor is the principal means of translating a risk position to an impairment estimate, and the main scaling factor to adjust the conservative regulatory expected loss to an effective PIP level, as the regulatory ECL models are more punitive than the incurred loss model under IAS 39.
On a portfolio basis, the emergence risk factor ranges between two and three months based on structural economic drivers that might influence the accurate and timely discovery of credit issues in each country.
Retail Banking An IIP is recognised for Retail Banking when an account meets a defined threshold condition in terms of overdue payments contractual default or meets other objective conditions such as bankruptcy, debt restructuring, fraud or death as further described above in the assessment factors.
The threshold conditions are set at the point where empirical evidence suggests that the client is unlikely to meet their contractual obligations or a loss of principal is expected.
A credit obligation in Retail Banking clients portfolio that is more than 150 Days Past Due DPD or, a credit obligation secured by Wealth Management products that is 90DPD, is recognised as impaired and IIP is provided for accordingly.
There are, however, exceptions to this rule for portfolios where empirical evidence suggests that they should be set more conservatively.
In addition, the credit account is recognised as impaired immediately if the borrower files for bankruptcy or other equivalent forbearance programme, or the borrower is deceased, or the business is closed in the case of small business clients, or the borrowers other credit accounts with the Group are impaired.
The core components of the IIP calculation are the value of gross charge-off and recoveries.
Gross charge-off and or provisions are recognised when it is established that the account is unlikely to pay.
Recovery of unsecured debt post-impairment is recognised based on actual cash collected, either directly from clients or through the sale of defaulted loans to third-party institutions.
Provision release of secured loans post-impairment is recognised if the loan outstanding is paid in full release of full provision, or the provision is higher than the loan outstanding release of the excess provision, or the loan is paid to current and remains in current for more than 180 days release of full provision.

Transition to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments continued Retail Banking continued Retail Banking PIP, covering the inherent losses in the portfolio that exist at the balance sheet date but have not been individually identified, is computed on performing loans no IIP, using Expected Loss EL rates, to determine latent losses in the portfolio.
The EL utilises probability of default and loss given default inherent within the portfolio of impaired loans or receivables and the historical loss experience for assets with credit risk characteristics similar to those in the Group.
For defaulted yet non-impaired accounts greater than 90 days past due full EL is used, while for non-defaulted accounts, a three month emergence period is applied.
An adjustment is added to the PIP calculation to take into the account instances where the EL-based PIP is deemed imprecise due to under-prediction or over-prediction of EL by underlying models.
An overlay in the form of Special Risk Adjustment SRA is added to the EL-based PIP calculation to take into account instances where EL-based PIP is deemed insufficient to incorporate the impact of a specific credit event.
An overlay in the form of Business Cycle Adjustment BCA is taken to account for the impact of cyclical volatility in the operating environment, which is not adequately covered in the underlying models.
Impairment of available-for-sale financial instruments Where objective evidence of impairment exists for available-for-sale financial assets, the cumulative loss measured as the difference between the amortised cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the income statement is reclassified from equity and recognised in the income statement.
Classification and measurement of financial instruments The Group classifies its financial assets into the following measurement categories: financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss: loans and receivables: held-to-maturity: or available-for-sale.
Financial liabilities are classified as either held at fair value through profit or loss or at amortised cost.
Management determines the classification of its financial assets and liabilities at initial recognition.
The following details the approach for the categories: a Financial assets and liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss: This category has two sub-categories: Financial assets and liabilities held for trading: A financial asset or liability is classified as held for trading if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term, or forms part of a portfolio of financial instruments which are managed together and for which there is evidence of short-term profit-taking or is a derivative excluding qualifying hedging relationships Designated at fair value through profit or loss: Financial assets and liabilities may be designated at fair value through profit or loss when: The designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities on a different basis for example, the Group may designate certain fixed rate loans and receivables that are managed with derivative interest rate swaps A group of financial assets and or liabilities is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis for example, the Group may designate issued debt to fund a portfolio of trading assets and liabilities that are all managed on a fair value basis The assets or liabilities include embedded derivatives and such derivatives are required to be recognised separately b L oans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market and it is expected that apart from credit deterioration substantially all of the initial investment will be recovered.
c H eld-to-maturity assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the Groups management has the intention and ability to hold to maturity.
d A vailable-for-sale assets are those non-derivative financial assets intended to be held for an indefinite period of time, which may be sold in response to liquidity requirements or changes in interest rates, exchange rates, commodity prices or equity prices.
e F inancial liabilities held at amortised cost: Financial liabilities, which include borrowings not classified as held at fair value through profit or loss, are classified as amortised cost instruments.
Preference shares which carry a mandatory coupon that represents a market rate of interest at the issue date, or which are redeemable on a specific date or at the option of the shareholders, are classified as financial liabilities and are presented in other borrowed funds.
The dividends on these preference shares are recognised in the income statement as interest expense on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method.
Initial recognition of financial instruments All financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value, which is normally the transaction price plus, for those financial assets and liabilities not carried at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent measurement Financial assets and liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss are carried at fair value, with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value taken directly to the net trading income line in the income statement except for changes in fair value on financial liabilities designated at fair value attributable to the Groups own credit presented directly within other comprehensive income.
Available-for-sale financial assets are carried at fair value, with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value taken to the available-for sale reserve within equity until the asset is sold, or is impaired, when the cumulative gain or loss is transferred to the income statement.
Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Held-to-maturity financial assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Financial liabilities are stated at amortised cost, with any difference between proceeds net of directly attributable transaction costs and the redemption value recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
In addition to these instruments, the carrying value of a financial instrument carried at amortised cost that is the hedged item in a qualifying fair value hedge relationship is adjusted by the fair value gain or loss attributable to the hedged risk.
