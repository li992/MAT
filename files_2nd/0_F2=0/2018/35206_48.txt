Finance Act 2016 which was substantively enacted in September 2016 included provisions to reduce the rate of corporation tax to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020.

Similarly, deferred tax arising in overseas jurisdiction has been based on the enacted rate.
US Tax Reform and EU CFC Challenge The United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed on 22 December 2017 and included a broad range of tax reform measures including a reduction in the Federal rate of corporate income tax from 35% to 21% effective 1 January 2018 as well as significant changes to business deductions and other international tax provisions including changes to the rules governing interest deductibility.
In the results to 30 June 2018 US tax reform gave rise to a transitional one-off non-underlying non-cash tax credit of 10.0 million primarily due to the revaluation of the Groups aggregate US deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities following the reduction in the US Federal rate from 35% to 21%.
Finance arrangements are in place to fund the acquisition of business operations in overseas territories.
This finance is provided primarily to US operations through intragroup loans which provide a benefit to the Group effective tax rate.
In addition, the Group claims a partial exemption under the UK Controlled Foreign Companies legislation for profits from qualifying loan relationships.
The Group is monitoring the developments in relation to EU state aid investigations into this exemption, noting that at this stage the final outcome of any investigation is not certain.
As such, no quantification of the potential tax liability has been calculated, as the basis for this calculation is currently unclear.
Future Tax Charge The Groups future tax charge, and its effective tax rate could be affected by several factors including the impact of the implementation of the OECDs Base Erosion and Profit Shifting BEPS actions, and changes in applicable tax rates and legislation in the territories in which it operates.
