As of the date of this report, BAT is not aware of any activity, transaction or dealing by the Group or any of its affiliates during the financial year ended 31 December 2018 that is disclosable under Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 and Section 13 r of the Exchange Act, except as set forth below.
This information is to the best of BATs knowledge.
BAT has a local operation in Iran, established on 18 October 2003, through its wholly-owned non-US subsidiary, B.
A. T. Pars Company Private Joint Stock BAT Pars.
BAT Pars produces its products, which include Kent, Pall Mall and Montana brands, in its own factory in Eshtehard, which is in the Alborz province of Iran.
BAT Pars distributes its product via 81 sub-agents with national and provincial distribution licenses, who sell products to wholesalers and retailers with the support of BAT Pars sales representatives.
BAT Pars has 315 direct employees and an additional 1,100 contract workers supplied by a private company.
Concerning the business of BAT Pars, various elements such as income tax, payroll, social security, other taxes, excise, monopoly fees, duties and other fees, including for utilities, licences and judicial fees to commence litigation, are payable to the Government of Iran and affiliated entities regarding BAT Pars operation.
BAT Pars maintains bank accounts in Iran with various banks to facilitate its operations in the country and to make any required payments, as described above, to the Government of Iran and affiliated entities regarding its operations.
During the year ended 31 December 2018, BAT did not have any gross revenues or net profits derived from transactions with the Government of Iran or affiliated entities.
BAT believes, and maintains policies and procedures designed to ensure, that its activities in Iran and elsewhere comply in all material aspects with the applicable and relevant trade sanctions laws and regulations, including US and other international trade sanctions and or embargoes.
BATs sanctions policies and procedures have been designed to be as robust as possible.
However, there can be no absolute assurance that these policies and procedures will be effective.
While we believe the imposition of penalties or sanctions against BAT for its activities in Iran by the relevant authorities would be an unlikely event, the impact of such penalties or sanctions, if imposed, could be material.
To the extent permitted under applicable law, BAT Pars activities in Iran are expected to continue.
