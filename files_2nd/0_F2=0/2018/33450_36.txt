I II III FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IV Notes 1 General Information Alliance Trust PLC was incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Acts 1862-1886.
The address of the registered office is given on page 99.
The nature of the Companys operations and its principal activity is a global investment trust.
The following notes refer to the year ended 31 December 2018 and the comparatives which are in brackets for the year ended 31 December 2017.
The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of the financial statements necessarily requires the exercise of judgement both in application of accounting policies, which are set out below, and in the selection of assumptions used in the calculation of estimates.
These estimates and judgements are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are continually evaluated based on historical experience and other factors.
However, actual results may differ from these estimates.
There are no critical judgements.
Following the announcement of the sale of its subsidiary company Alliance Trust Savings ATS there are no remaining key sources of estimation uncertainty in the Company's financial statements.
2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs, as adopted by the European Union Adopted IFRS's.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except that investments and financial instruments are stated at fair value and office premises are revalued on a periodic basis.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Where presentational guidance set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies issued by the Association of Investment Companies AIC in November 2014 and updated in February 2018, is consistent with the requirements of IFRS, then the Directors have sought to prepare the financial statements on a basis consistent with the recommendations of the SORP.
The same accounting policies, presentations and methods of computation are followed in these financial statements as were applied in the Companys last annual audited financial statements, other than those stated below.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers In the current financial year the Company has adopted IFRS 15.
The core principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity should recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
Given the nature of the income streams of the Company, there is no material impact to the current measurement and disclosure of revenue.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments In the current financial year the Company has applied IFRS 9 Financial Instruments as revised in July 2014 and the related consequential amendments to other IFRSs.
IFRS 9 introduces new requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, impairment for financial assets and general hedge accounting.
The Company measures all balance sheet items at fair value, there are no impaired assets and, does not enter into general hedge accounting.
There is no material impact on the Company in relation to the adoption of this standard.
Going concern The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
They therefore continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
The Companys business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development and performance, are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 36.
The financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2018 is shown on the balance sheet on page 69.
Basis of consolidation The Company qualifies as an investment entity under IFRS 10 meeting all the key characteristics: It obtains funds from investors and provides those investors with investment management services: It commits to its investors that its business purpose is to invest solely for returns from capital appreciation and investment income: and It measures and evaluates performance of substantially all its investments on a fair value basis.
As such the Company does not consolidate its subsidiaries.
The following subsidiaries held by the Company are valued at fair value through the income statement as they do not provide services that relate directly to the investment activities of the Company nor are they themselves regarded as an investment entity: Shares Country of Name held incorporation Principal Activity Alliance Trust Savings Limited ATS Ordinary Scotland Provision and administration of investment and pension products Alliance Trust Savings England Limited Ordinary England Inactive AT2006 Limited Ordinary Scotland Intermediate holding company Second Alliance Trust Limited Ordinary Scotland Inactive | Alliance Trust PLC Annual Report and Financial Accounts 2018 71 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Shares Country of Name held incorporation Principal Activity Alliance Trust Equity Partners Limited Ordinary Scotland Investment management ATEP 2008 GP Limited Ordinary Scotland Private equity general partner ATEP 2009 GP Limited Ordinary Scotland Private equity general partner Allsec Nominees Limited Ordinary Scotland Nominee Alliance Trust Savings Nominees Limited Ordinary Scotland Nominee Alliance Trust Services Limited Ordinary Scotland Service company Registered at 8 West Marketgait, Dundee, DD1 1QN.

Adopted IFRSs In the current year, the Company has applied a number of amendments to IFRSs issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB that are mandatorily effective for an accounting period that begins on or after 1 January 2018.
Their adoption has not had any material impact on the disclosures or on the amounts reported in these financial statements.
IFRS 2 Share based payments IFRSs not yet applied At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the Company has not applied the following new and revised IFRSs that have been issued but are not yet effective and had not yet been adopted by the EU as at 31 December 2018: IFRS 16 Leases The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the Standard listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Company in future periods.
Presentation of income statement In order to reflect the activities of an investment trust more accurately, and in accordance with guidance issued by the AIC, supplementary information which analyses the income statement between items of a revenue and capital nature have been presented alongside the income statement.
Net capital returns are not generally distributed by way of a dividend.
The net revenue profit for the year is the measure the Directors use in assessing the Companys compliance with certain requirements set out in Section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010.
Revenue recognition Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established, normally the exdividend date.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash, the amount of cash dividend foregone is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of shares received over the amount of cash dividend foregone is recognised as a capital gain in the income statement.
Rental income from property and income from mineral rights is recognised on a time-apportioned basis.
Interest income is accrued on a time-apportioned basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Special dividends receivable are treated as repayment of capital or as income depending on the facts of each particular case.
Expenses connected with rental income and mineral rights income are included as administrative expenses.
Foreign currencies Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange applicable to the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary items and non-monetary assets and liabilities that are fair valued and are denominated in foreign currencies are restated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Gains and losses arising on restatement are included as capital net profit or loss for the period where investments are classified as fair value through profit or loss.
Expenses All expenses and interest payable are accounted for on an accruals basis.
In respect of the analysis between revenue and capital items presented within the income statement, where there is a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments and where consistent with the AIC SORP the Company is attributing indirect expenditure including management fees and finance costs one quarter to revenue and three quarters to capital profits, specific exceptions are: Expenses which are incidental to the acquisition of an investment are included within the cost of that investment.
Expenses which are incidental to the disposal of an investment are deducted from the disposal proceeds of that investment.
Expenses which under the AIC SORP are chargeable to revenue profits are recorded directly to revenue.
The Directors have adopted a one quarter revenue and three quarters capital allocation for management fees, financing costs and other indirect expenses where consistent with the AIC SORP guidelines.
| 72 Alliance Trust PLC Annual Report and Financial Accounts 2018 I II III FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IV 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Operating leases Charges for operating leases are debited to the income statement on an accruals basis.
Note 25 Operating lease commitments discloses the commitments to pay charges for leases expiring within one year, between two to five years and over five years.
Share-based payment Historically the Company has operated three share-based payment schemes: the All Employee Share Ownership Plan AESOP, the Long Term Incentive Plans LTIP and the Deferred Bonus scheme.
No awards have been made in any of these schemes during the year.
Any cost relating to the AESOP was recognised as a revenue cost in the year.
The fair value of options granted to employees under the LTIP was recognised as staff costs, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the year in which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The amount recognised as an expense may be adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest.
For share-based compensation schemes settled by the Company that relate to employees of the subsidiary companies a recharge equal to the cost during the year is made to subsidiary companies.
Pension costs Employer contributions to pension arrangements for staff have been charged one quarter to revenue and three quarters to capital.
Contributions in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme are calculated by reference to actuarial valuations carried out for the Trustees at intervals of not more than three years, and represent a charge to cover the accrued liabilities on a continuing basis.
The Company completed a buy-out of the pension scheme liabilities in 2018, having carried out a buy-in of pension liabilities in 2016 and accordingly, no further contribution to fund pension liabilities will be required.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the statement of comprehensive income in the year in which they occur.
Taxation The Company carries on its business as an investment trust and conducts its affairs so as to qualify as such under the provisions of Section 1158 and 1159 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Companys liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates applicable as at balance sheet date.
In line with the recommendations of the SORP, the allocation method used to calculate tax relief on expenses presented against capital returns in the supplementary information in the income statement is the marginal basis.
Under this basis, if taxable income is capable of being offset entirely by expenses presented in the revenue return column of the income statement, then no tax relief is transferred to the capital return column.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates and interests in joint ventures, except where the Company is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not be reversed in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also recorded within equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and where they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Company intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
The Company does not recognise deferred tax assets or liabilities on capital profits or losses on the basis that the investment trust status of the Company means no tax is due on the capital profits, or losses, of the Company.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Companys balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument.
The Company will only offset financial assets and financial liabilities if it has a legally enforceable right of set off and intends to settle on a net basis.
Derivative financial instruments The Companys activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in market prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
Derivative transactions which the Company may enter include futures, forwards and swaps.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value on the date on which the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts of similar maturity dates.
Changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognised in the Income Statement.
| Alliance Trust PLC Annual Report and Financial Accounts 2018 73 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Investments Investments are recognised and derecognised on the trade date where a purchase or sale is made under a contract whose terms require delivery within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs.
Investments, which include collective investment schemes, are principally designated as fair value through profit and loss upon initial recognition not including transaction costs.
Listed investments are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value, which is either the bid price or the last traded price, depending on the convention of the exchange on which the investment is quoted.
Investments which are not listed or which are not frequently traded are valued at the Directors' best estimate of fair value.
In arriving at their estimate, the Directors make use of recognised valuation techniques and may take account of recent arm's length transactions in the same or similar instruments.
Investments in subsidiary companies are valued in the Companys accounts at the Directors estimate of their fair value, using the guidelines and methodologies on valuation published by the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Association issued in December 2018, or sale price, and where relevant the use of external valuers.
For investments in private equity, the Directors make use of unaudited valuations of the underlying investments as supplied by the managers of those private equity funds.
The Directors regularly review the principles applied by those managers to ensure they are in compliance with the Companys policies.
Valuation of mineral rights, included in unlisted investments, is based upon the net income received from the asset in the previous 12 months multiplied by appropriate factors for gas and oil or the agreed sale price for any assets sold.
Mineral rights are included in unlisted investments.
Foreign exchange gains and losses for fair value designated investments are included within the changes in their fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are defined as short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.
Other receivables Other receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Office premises During 2017 office premises were valued annually by chartered surveyors on the basis of market value in accordance with the RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards.
As at 31 December 2018 the office premises have been classified as held for sale.
They are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and where such a sale is considered highly probable.
These have been subsequently measured at the lower of their carrying amount and their fair value less the costs to sell.
No depreciation has been charged on these assets as, in the opinion of the Board, any provision for depreciation would be immaterial.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into by the Company.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities.
Bank borrowings and unsecured fixed rate loan notes Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for through the income statement on an accruals basis and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Unsecured fixed rate loan notes are initially recorded at the proceeds received.
After initial recognition they are now measured at fair value.
Finance charges are accounted for through the income statement on an accruals basis using the effective interest rate.
Other payables Other payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at their nominal value Buybacks and cancellation of shares The costs of acquiring own shares for cancellation, together with any associated trading costs, are written back to distributable reserves.
Share capital is reduced by the nominal value of the shares bought back with an equivalent entry made to the capital redemption reserve.
Realised and unrealised reserves A description of each of the reserves follows: Capital reserve The following are accounted through this reserve: Gains and losses on realisation of investments Changes in the value of assets held at fair value Realised exchange differences of a capital nature Purchases of shares by the Trustee of the Employee Benefit Trust Payment of capital dividends | 74 Alliance Trust PLC Annual Report and Financial Accounts 2018 I II III FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IV 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Amounts recognised in relation to share based payments which are capital in nature Amounts by which other assets and liabilities valued at fair value differ from their book value Buyback and cancellation of own shares Amounts recognised in relation to the defined benefit pensions scheme Where consistent with the AIC SORP, attributing three quarters of indirect expenditure including management fees, finance costs and relevant administrative expenses are charged to capital profits.
Revaluation reserve This reserve is used to record changes in the valuation of the office premises.
A downward revaluation in office premises is charged to the income statement to the extent that there is no earlier upward revaluation in this reserve for those premises.
Merger reserve This reserve was created as part of the arrangements for the acquisition of the assets of The Second Alliance Trust Limited in 2006.
Capital redemption reserve This reserve was created on the cancellation and repayment of the Companys preference share capital.
Further movements in this reserve reflect the nominal value of the buyback and cancellation of a portion of the share capital of the Company.
Revenue reserve Net revenue profits and losses of the Company and the fair value costs of share-based payments which are revenue in nature are recorded within this reserve, together with the dividend payments made by the Company.

| Alliance Trust PLC Annual Report and Financial Accounts 2018 85 22 Financial instruments and Risk 22.1 Risk management policies and procedures As an investment trust the Company invests in equities, private equity, financial instruments and its subsidiary businesses for the long term in order to achieve the investment objectives set out on page 6.
In pursuing these objectives the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for payment as dividends.
The principal financial instruments at risk comprise those in the Companys investment portfolio.
The risks and the Directors approach to managing them are set out below under the following headings: market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk, and other price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, and gearing risk.
The assumptions and sensitivities within each risk are considered appropriate and are based on the Directors' wider knowledge of the investment market.
The Company has a risk management framework in place which is described in detail on pages 32 to 34.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks, and the methods used to measure the risks, have not changed from the previous accounting period.
22.2 Market Risk Market risk embodies the potential for both losses and gains and includes currency risk see note 22.3, interest rate risk see note 22.4 and other price risk see note 22.5.
Market risk is managed on a regular basis by TWIMI in its role as AIFM.
TWIMI manages the capital of the Company within parameters set by the Directors on investment and asset allocation strategies and risk.
The Companys strategy on investment risk is outlined in our statement of investment objectives and policy on page 6.
Details of the equity investment portfolio at the balance sheet date are disclosed on pages 93 to 96.
22.3 Currency Risk Some of the Companys assets, liabilities and transactions are denominated in currencies other than its functional currency of pounds sterling.
Consequently the Company is exposed to the risk that movements in exchange rates may affect the pounds sterling value of those items.
The Companys currency holdings and gains losses thereon are reviewed regularly by the Directors, and the currency risk is managed on a regular basis by TWIMI within parameters set by the Directors on investment and asset allocation strategies and risk.
The Company may enter into forward exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency exposure.
The currency exposure for overseas investments is based on the quotation currency of each holding, while the currency exposure for net monetary assets is based on the currency in which each asset or liability is denominated.
At the reporting date the Company had the following exposures: Currency exposure Total Total Overseas Net monetary currency Overseas Net monetary currency investments assets exposure investments assets exposure 000 Dec 18 Dec 18 Dec 18 Dec 17 Dec 17 Dec 17 US dollar 1,406,409 - 1,406,409 1,527,085 - 1,527,085 Euro 428,694 - 428,694 450,442 - 450,442 Yen 80,336 - 80,336 72,116 - 72,116 Other non-sterling 360,791 - 360,791 395,933 - 395,933 2,445,576 - 2,445,576 2,276,230 - 2,276,230 Sensitivity analysis If pounds sterling had strengthened by 10% 10% relative to all currencies, with all other variables held constant, the income statement and the net assets attributable to equity holders of the parent would have decreased by the amounts shown below.
The analysis is performed on the same basis as for the year ended 31 December 2017.
The revenue return impact is an estimated figure for 12 months based on the cash balances at the reporting date.

| 86 Alliance Trust PLC Annual Report and Financial Accounts 2018 I II III FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IV 22 Financial instruments and Risk 22.4 Interest Rate Risk The Company is exposed to interest rate risk in a number of ways.
A movement in interest rates may affect income receivable on cash deposits and interest payable on variable rate borrowings.
The Company finances part of its activities through borrowings at levels which are approved and monitored by the Directors.
The possible effects on fair value and cash flows as a result of an interest rate change are taken into account when making investment or borrowing decisions.
Unsecured fixed rate loans being repayable at a fixed rate interest are excluded from the sensitivity analysis.
The following table details the Companys exposure to interest rate risks for bank and loan balances: 000 Dec 18 Dec 17 Exposure to floating interest rates Cash at bank 81,168 105,808 Bank loans repayable within 1 year 67,000 133,000 14,168 27,192 Sensitivity analysis If interest rates had decreased by 0.25% 0.25%, with all other variables held constant, the income statement result and the net assets attributable to equity holders would have increased by the amounts shown below.

000 Dec 18 Dec 17 Income statement Revenue return 124 155 Capital return 35 223 Net assets 89 68 22.5 Other Price Risk Other price risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices other than those arising from currency risk or interest rate risk, whether caused by factors specific to an individual investment or its issuer, or by factors affecting all instruments traded in that market.
As the majority of the Companys financial assets are carried at fair value with fair value changes recognised in the income statement, all changes in market conditions will directly affect gains and losses on investments and net assets.
The Directors manage price risk by having a suitable investment objective for the Company.
The Directors review this objective and investment performance regularly.
The risk is managed on a regular basis by TWIMI within parameters set by the Directors on investment and asset allocation strategies and risk.
The Directors monitor the managers compliance with their mandates and also whether each mandate and asset allocation is compatible with the Companys objective.
Concentration of exposure to other price risks A listing of the Companys equity investment portfolio is shown on pages 93 to 96.
The largest amount of equity investments by value is in North America, with significant amounts also in Europe, Asia and the UK.
It also shows the concentration of investments in various sectors.
The following table details the Companys exposure to market price risk on its quoted and unquoted equity investments: | Alliance Trust PLC Annual Report and Financial Accounts 2018 87 22 Financial instruments and Risk 22.5 Other Price Risk 000 Dec 18 Dec 17 Investments at fair value through Profit & Loss Investments listed on a recognised investment exchange 2,514,544 2,573,077 Forward currency exchange contracts held at fair value through profit and loss - 2 Unlisted investments 22,273 46,578 Other equity and funds 5,888 129,200 Investments in related and subsidiary companies 38,060 88,020 2,580,765 2,836,873 Sensitivity analysis 97.7% 95.3% of the Companys investment portfolio is listed on stock exchanges.
If share prices had decreased by 10% with all other variables remaining constant, the income statement result and the net assets attributable to equity holders of the parent would have decreased by the amounts shown below.
The analysis for last year assumed a share price decrease of 10%.

22.6 Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment that it has entered into with the Company.
This risk is managed as follows: Investment transactions are carried out with a number of well-established, approved brokers.
Investment transactions are carried out on a cash against receipt or cash against delivery basis.
The Company minimises credit risk through banking polices which restrict banking deposits to high-rated financial institutions.
The policies also set maximum exposure to individual banks.
The Company has adopted a policy of dealing only with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral where appropriate cash and gilts as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.
At the reporting date, the Companys cash and cash equivalents exposed to credit risk were as follows: 000 Dec 18 Dec 17 Credit rating Aa1 80,827 104,399 A3 341 1,409 81,168 105,808 Average maturity 1 day 1 day The Companys UK listed equities and its overseas listed equities are held by Bank of New York Mellon as custodian.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of the custodian may cause the Companys rights with respect to securities held by the custodian to be delayed or limited.
22.7 Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting its obligations associated with financial liabilities.
This is not a significant risk for the Company as the majority of its assets are investments in quoted equities that are readily realisable.
It also has the ability to borrow, which gives it access to additional funding when required.
At the balance sheet date it had the following facilities: | 88 Alliance Trust PLC Annual Report and Financial Accounts 2018 I II III FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IV 22 Financial instruments and Risk 22.7 Liquidity Risk 000 Dec 18 Expires 2017 Expires Committed multi-currency facility - RBS 100,000 31 12 2019 100,000 31 12 2018 Amount drawn 67,000 - 100,000 - Committed multi-currency facility - Scotiabank - 100,000 27 03 2018 Amount drawn - - 33,000 - Committed multi-currency facility - Scotiabank 100,000 22 12 2020 100,000 22 12 2020 Amount drawn - - - - 15 year 4.28% unsecured fixed rate loan notes 100,000 31 07 2029 100,000 31 07 2029 Amount drawn 100,000 - 100,000 - 15 year 2.657% unsecured fixed rate loan notes 20,000 27 11 2033 - Amount drawn 20,000 - - - 25 year 2.936% unsecured fixed rate loan notes 20,000 27 11 2043 - Amount drawn 20,000 - - - 35 year 2.897% unsecured fixed rate loan notes 20,000 27 11 2053 - Amount drawn 20,000 - - - Total facilities 360,000 400,000 Total drawn 227,000 - 233,000 - All the facilities are unsecured and have covenants on the maximum level of gearing and minimum net asset value of the Company.

22.9 Hierarchical Valuation of Financial Instruments Accounting Standards recognise a hierarchy of fair value measurements, for financial instruments measured at fair value in the Balance Sheet, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs Level 3.
The classification of financial instruments depends on the lowest significant applicable input.
The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method.
The different levels have been defined as follows: Level 1 Unadjusted, fully accessible and current quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Included within this category are investments listed on any recognised stock exchange.
| Alliance Trust PLC Annual Report and Financial Accounts 2018 89 22 Financial instruments and Risk 22.9 Hierarchical Valuation of Financial Instruments Level 2 Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities or other directly or indirectly observable inputs which exist for the duration of the period of investment.
Examples of such instruments would be forward exchange contracts and certain other derivative instruments.
Level 3 Valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.
The value is the Directors best estimate, based on advice from relevant knowledgeable experts, use of recognised valuation techniques and on assumptions as to what inputs other market participants would apply in pricing the same or similar instrument.
Included within this category are direct or pooled private equity investments and mineral rights.
The following table analyses the fair value measurements for the Company's assets and liabilities measured by the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurement is categorised at 31 December 2018.
All fair value measurements disclosed are recurring fair value measurements.
Fair Value Assets in Level 1 The quoted market price used for financial investments held by the Company is the current bid price.
These investments are included within Level 1 and comprise equities, bonds and exchange-traded derivatives.
This includes assets noted as part of the equity portfolio and the listed investment of Liontrust Asset Management PLC shares and, during the year ended 2017, Luxcellence Liontrust Sustainable Future Pan European Equity Fund which was sold in April 2018.
All as shown as part of the portfolio on pages 23.
Fair Value Assets in Level 2 The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market for example, over-the-counter derivatives is determined by using valuation techniques.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and with minimal reliance on entity specific estimates.
During the year ended 2017 this included the investments of Liontrust Sustainable Future Cautious Managed Fund and Liontrust Sustainable Future Defensive Managed Fund.
These investments were sold in April 2018 and there were no assets in this category as at 31 December 2018.
Fair Value Assets in Level 3 This includes subsidiary companies, private equity investments and North American mineral rights held by the Company noted on page 23.
From 1 April 2017 Level 3 assets, excluding the valuation of Alliance Trust Savings, are reviewed at least annually by the Valuation Committee of Towers Watson Investment Management TWIM who are assigned responsibility for valuation by the Board of the Company.
Prior to this date, valuation responsibility was assigned to the Valuation Committee of the Company.
The Directors' valuation of Alliance Trust Savings has been agreed as the consideration agreed to be paid for it by Interactive Investor Limited as announced in October 2018, adjusted for transaction costs.
The TWIM Valuation Committee considers the appropriateness of the valuation models, inputs, using the various valuation methods in accordance with the Company's valuation policy, and will determine the appropriateness of any valuation of the underlying assets.
The following table shows the reconciliation from the beginning balances to the ending balances for fair value measurement in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

The valuation of Alliance Trust Savings is 32.7m 38.0m and for 2018 is carried at the sale value to Interactive Investor Limited adjusted for transaction costs.
Mineral rights are carried at fair value and are valued in the Companys accounts at 12.9m 15.3m being the Directors' estimate of their fair value, using agreed sale values and the guidelines and methodologies on valuation published by the Oklahoma Tax Commission and for non-producing properties, the Lierle US Price Report.
Private equity investments, both fund-to-fund and direct included under Level 3, are valued in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines issued in December 2018.
Unlisted investments in private equity are stated at the valuation as determined by the TWIM Valuation Committee based on information provided by the General Partner.
The General Partners policy in valuing unlisted investments is to carry them at fair value.
The General Partner will generally rely on the fund's investment managers fair value at the last reported period, rolled forward for any cashflows.
However if the General Partner does not feel the manager is reflecting a fair value it will select a valuation methodology that is most appropriate for the particular investments in that fund and generate a fair value.
In those circumstances the General Partner believes the most appropriate methodologies to use to value the underlying investments in the portfolio are: Price of a recent investment Multiples Net assets Industry valuation benchmarks An entity is not required to create quantitative information to comply with this disclosure requirement if quantitative unobservable inputs are not developed by the entity when measuring fair value for example, when an entity uses prices from prior transactions or third-party pricing information without adjustment.
TWIM receives information from the General Partner on the underlying investments which is subsequently reviewed by the TWIM Valuation Committee.
Where the TWIM Valuation Committee does not feel that the valuation is appropriate, an adjustment will be made.
Unsecured fixed rate loan notes are recognised at fair value.
The Company refines and modifies its valuation techniques as markets develop.
While the Company believes its valuation techniques to be appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions could result in different estimates of fair value at the balance sheet date.
No interrelationships between unobservable inputs used in the above valuations of Level 3 investments have been identified.
