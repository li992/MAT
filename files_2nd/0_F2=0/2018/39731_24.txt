Net operating revenue Revenue The Groups primary source of revenue is fee income from investment management activities performed within both the Asset Management and Wealth Management segments.
Fee income includes management fees, performance fees, carried interest and other fees.
Revenue also includes interest income earned within the Wealth Management segment.
Management fees are generated through investment management agreements and are generally based on an agreed percentage of the valuation of AUM.
Management fees are recognised as the service is provided and it is probable that the fee will be collected.
Performance fees and carried interest are earned from some arrangements when contractually agreed performance levels are exceeded within specified performance measurement periods.
They are only recognised where there is deemed to be a low probability of a significant reversal in future periods.
Performance fees are typically earned over one year and are recognised at the end of the performance period.
Carried interest is earned over a longer time frame and is recognised when the performance obligations are expected to be met and it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur.
This may result in the recognition of revenue before the contractual crystallisation date.
Other fees principally comprises revenues for other services, which are typically driven by levels of AUM, along with revenues that vary according to the volume of transactions.
Other fees are recognised as the relevant service is provided and it is probable that the fee will be collected.
Within Wealth Management, earning a net interest margin is a core activity.
Interest income earned as a result of placing loans and deposits with other financial institutions, advancing loans and overdrafts to clients and holding debt and other fixed income securities is recognised within revenue.
Interest income is recognised as it is earned using the effective interest method, which allocates interest at a constant rate of return over the expected life of the financial instrument based on the estimated future cash flows.
The Group has applied IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 from 1 January 2018.
The changes resulting from the adoption of IFRS 15 is disclosed in the Presentation of financial statements on page 149.
Cost of sales Fee expenses incurred by the Group that relate directly to revenue are presented as cost of sales.
These expenses include commissions, external fund manager fees and distribution fees payable to financial institutions, investment platform providers and financial advisers that distribute the Groups products.
Fee expense is generally based on an agreed percentage of the valuation of AUM and is recognised in the income statement as the service is received.
Cost of sales also includes amounts payable to third parties in respect of financial obligations arising from carried interest.
Amounts payable in respect of carried interest are determined based on the current value of the amount that is expected to be paid when the carried interest crystallises at the end of the performance period.
As a result, the cost of sales recognised in respect of carried interest payable may increase or decrease over time, dependent on the fair value of the obligation until it crystallises.
Wealth Management pays interest to clients on deposits taken.
For Wealth Management, earning a net interest margin is a core activity.
Interest payable in respect of these activities is therefore recorded separately from finance costs elsewhere in the business and is reported as part of cost of sales.
Interest is recognised using the effective interest method see above.

Estimates and judgements revenue Carried interest is recognised when the relevant services have been provided and there is a low probability that a significant reversal will occur.
It represents the Groups contractual right to share in the profits of around 74 private asset investment vehicles if certain performance hurdles are met when the underlying investments are realised and the capital returned to clients.
The Group applies judgement to determine certain assumptions that are used to estimate the amount of carried interest that is expected to be received.
Those assumptions principally include the growth rates and realisation dates of the underlying investments that lead to capital payments being made to clients and crystallise any carried interest that may be received.
These factors are used to estimate the cash flows and determine the present value of the carried interest that may be received by the Group at future crystallisation dates.
The estimated cash flows are constrained, in accordance with accounting standards, to reduce the risk of significant reversal of revenue.
The Group estimates the cash flows that will be realised by the respective investment vehicles when the underlying securities are successfully disposed of.
These estimates are based on the current fair value of the underlying investments.
The resultant cash flows are assessed against the applicable performance hurdle, which is dependent on the capital invested and timing of distributions to clients in the individual vehicle.
In order to reduce the risk of a significant reversal of carried interest, as required by accounting standards, each investment vehicle is assessed to determine whether it is sufficiently developed to be assured of carried interest returns and the fair value of all investment vehicles is discounted to limit the potential revenue recognition.
Finally, it is assumed there is no further growth in the investment values to the realisation date.
The distributions to clients are based on the expectations of the individual investment managers as to the realisation of a large volume of underlying individual securities.
104 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial statements 2.
Net operating revenue continued Estimates and judgements cost of sales The cost of financial obligations in respect of carried interest carried interest payable is based on an assessment of the fair value of amounts that have been received or may be received in the future and the proportion that is payable to third parties.
The Group applies similar judgements as those used to determine the present value of carried interest receivable, as set out on page 104, in determining the carried interest payable.
However, accounting standards do not limit the liability that should be recognised before realisation to the amount that represents a low probability of a significant reversal occuring.
As a result no constraints are applied in determining the value of the liability.
In addition, a growth rate is assumed in order to determine the returns against which the investment hurdle should be applied.
The amount payable at maturity will depend on the realised value of the related financial asset and may differ to the projected value.
An increase in the growth rate of 3% would increase cost of sales by 12.5 million.
Notwithstanding the differing accounting requirements for the recognition of carried interest and carried interest payable, any cost of sale paid to third parties in respect of carried interest will always be less than the carried interest generated and will not be settled until the income is received.
An average acceleration delay in crystallisation dates of one year would increase reduce cost of sales by 6.9 million 7.2 million.
Net gain on financial instruments and other income The Group holds financial instruments to support its Group capital strategies, which comprise operating capital, seed and co-investment capital and other investible equity.
Operating capital is retained in the Groups operating entities to meet minimum local regulatory capital requirements and other capital required for day-to-day operational purposes.
Operating capital principally comprises cash and cash equivalents and other low-risk financial instruments, as well as financial instruments held to hedge fair value movements on certain deferred fund awards.
Seed and co-investment capital represents strategic investments in the Groups products to develop new investment strategies and co-invest selectively alongside clients.
Seed and co-investment capital is financed from investment capital and, where practical, the market risk on seed capital investments is hedged.
Other investible equity held in excess of operating requirements is transferred to investment capital, which is managed centrally in accordance with limits approved by the Board.
A portion of the Groups financial instruments measured at fair value are classified as financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL.
Net gains and losses on financial instruments at FVTPL principally comprise market returns on investments in debt securities, equities, pooled investment vehicles, gains and losses on derivatives which mainly arise from hedging activities and gains and losses on contingent consideration arising from business combinations including amounts related to carried interest.
Net gains and losses on financial instruments at FVTPL that are held to hedge deferred employee cash awards are presented separately and are included within operating expenses see note 4.
The cost of financial obligations in respect of carried interest other than that relating to contingent consideration is presented separately and is included within cost of sales see note 2.
In both instances, the presentation better reflects the substance of these transactions and provides more relevant information about the Groups net income and operating expenses.
The remainder of the Groups financial assets measured at fair value are classified as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI.
Unrealised gains and losses on debt securities classified as financial assets at FVOCI are recorded in other comprehensive income, and the cumulative gains and losses are transferred to the income statement if the investment is sold or otherwise realised.
This is the same accounting treatment as applied in the 2017 comparatives to the Groups financial assets classified as available-forsale AFS.
An explanation of how the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities are classified and measured is included in notes 9 and 16.
Under IFRS 9, expected credit losses are calculated on financial assets measured at amortised cost and debt instruments measured at FVOCI and are recognised in the income statement.
The changes resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9 are set out in the Presentation of the financial statements on page 149.
Net finance income is derived from interest on non-banking activities, principally generated from cash and deposits with banks, but also as a result of holding investments in debt securities.
Debt securities and cash held outside of Wealth Management entities are managed mainly by Group Treasury to earn competitive rates of return and provide liquidity throughout the Group.
Significant amounts of the Groups cash and interest-earning securities are held within Wealth Management and are managed by the Wealth Management treasury team.
Interest earned on the assets held within Wealth Management is included in revenue and interest incurred on the liabilities assumed is included in cost of sales.
Interest is recognised using the effective interest method see note 2.

Operating expenses Operating expenses represent the Groups administrative expenses and are recognised as the services are received.
Certain costs, including leases and capitalised costs, are charged evenly over the life of the relevant contract or useful life of the asset.
The biggest component of the Groups operating expenses is the cost of employee benefits, as shown below.
Other costs include accommodation, information technology, marketing and outsourcing costs.
The control of total costs, including compensation costs, is a key performance objective of the Group.
Compensation costs are managed toatarget total compensation ratio of between 45% to 49%.
Targeting a total compensation ratio range provides some flexibility to manage the overall cost base in response to market conditions.
Total costs are managed to a target long-term key performance indicator KPI ratio of total costs to net income of65%.
Employee benefits expense includes salaries and wages, together with the cost of other benefits provided to employees such as pension andbonuses.
Employee benefits expense is presented net of gains and losses on financial instruments held to hedge deferred employee cash awards see note 3.
The Group makes some performance awards to employees that are deferred over a specified vesting period.
Such awards are charged to the income statement over the performance period and the vesting period.
The Group holds investments that are linked to these performance awards in order to hedge the related expense.
Gains and losses on these investments are netted against the relevant costs in the income statement but are presented separately below.
Further detail on other types of employee benefit can be found elsewhere within these financial statements, see note 24 for pension costs and note 25 for more detail on compensation that is awarded in Schroders plc shares.

Tax expense continued Estimates and judgements The calculation of the Groups tax charge involves a degree of estimation and judgement.
Liabilities relating to open and judgemental matters, including those in relation to deferred taxes, are based on the Groups assessment of the most likely outcome based on the information available.
As a result, certain tax amounts are based on estimates using factors that are relevant to the specific judgement.
TheGroup engages constructively and transparently with tax authorities with a view to early resolution of any uncertain tax matters.
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts provided, such differences will impact the tax charge in a future period.
Such estimates are based on assumptions made on the probability of potential challenge within certain jurisdictions and the possible outcome based on relevant facts and circumstances, including local tax laws.
There was no individual judgemental component of the taxexpense that was material to the Group results when taking into account the likely range of potential outcomes.
Amounts recorded within the 2018 tax charge relating to these judgements were not material 2017: same.
Earnings per share This KPI shows the portion of the Groups profit after tax that is attributable to each share issued by the Company, excluding own shares held by the Group.
The calculation is based on the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
The diluted figure recalculates that number as if all share options that would be expected to be exercised, as they have value to the option holder, had been exercised in the year.
Shares that may be issued are not taken into account if the impact does not reduce earnings per share.
Reconciliation of the figures used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share: 2018 2017 Number Number Year ended 31 December Millions Millions Weighted average number of shares used in the calculation of basic earnings per share 275.9 275.4 Effect of dilutive potential shares share options 5.2 5.6 Effect of dilutive potential shares contingently issuable shares 0.1 Weighted average number of shares used in the calculation of diluted earnings per share 281.1 281.1 The pre-exceptional earnings per share calculations are based on profit after tax excluding non-controlling interest of 2.6 million 2017:3.7million.
After exceptional items, the loss after tax attributable to non-controlling interest was 0.3 million 2017: profit of 1.4million.
Dividends Dividends are distributions of profit to holders of the Groups share capital, usually announced with the Groups half-year and annual results.
Dividends are recognised only when they are paid or approved by shareholders.
The reduction in equity in the year therefore comprises the prior year final dividend and the current year interim dividend.

The dividend will be paid on 9 May 2019 to shareholders on the register at 29 March 2019 andwill be accounted for in 2019.
In addition, the Group paid 1.4 million of dividends to holders of non-controlling interests in subsidiaries of the Group during 2018 2017:3.5million, resulting in total dividends paid of 313.1 million 2017: 271.1 million.

Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables includes prepayments and deposits with banks in the form of bullion as well as amounts the Group is due to receive from third parties in the normal course of business.
Trade and other receivables, other than deposits with banks in the form of bullion, are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost see note 9, after the deduction of provisions for impairment.
Prepayments arise where the Group pays cash in advance for services.
As the service is provided, the prepayment is reduced and the operating expense is recognised in the income statement.
Accrued income, other than amounts relating to carried interest, represents unbilled revenue and is not dependent on future performance.
Amounts due from third parties also include settlement accounts for transactions undertaken on behalf of funds and investors.
Deposits with banks in the form of bullion are recorded at fair value.
Comparative information has not been restated following the adoption of IFRS 15 on 1 January 2018, see Presentation of financial statements on page 149.
The fair value of trade and other receivables held at amortised cost approximates their carrying value.
Deposits with banks in the form of bullion are categorised as level 1 in the fair value hierarchy see note 9.
Estimates and judgements Accrued income includes 74.7 million of receivables in respect of carried interest.
This income is due over a number of years and only when contractually agreed performance levels are exceeded.
The actual income received may vary as a result of future investment performance.
Further information regarding the estimates and judgements applied is set out in note 2.

Financial assets The Group holds financial assets including equities, debt securities, pooled investment vehicles and derivatives to support its Group capital strategies and its Wealth Management banking book, including loans to clients.
The Group also enters into derivatives on behalf of Wealth Management clients, referred to as client facilitation see note 18.
On 1 January 2018, the Group adopted IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9.
IFRS 9 replaces the classification and measurement models previously contained in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement IAS 39, see Presentation of financial statements on page 149.
The classification and measurement of financial assets at 31 December 2018 is in accordance with IFRS 9 and the classification and measurement of financial assets at 31 December 2017 is in accordance with IAS 39 as the Group has not restated comparative information.
Classification and measurement in accordance with IFRS 9 The Group initially records all financial assets at fair value.
The Group subsequently holds each financial asset at fair value fair value through profit or loss FVTPL or fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI or at amortised cost.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability between market participants.
Amortised cost is the amount determined based on moving the initial amount recognised for the financial instrument to the maturity value on a systematic basis using a fixed interest rate effective interest rate, taking account of repayment dates and initial premiums or discounts.
Financial assets at amortised cost Financial assets are measured at amortised cost when their contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest and they are held within a business model designed to collect cash flows.
This classification typically applies to the Groups loans and advances, trade receivables and some debt securities held by the Groups Wealth Management entities.
The carrying value of amortised cost financial assets is adjusted for impairment under the expected loss model see note 3 and 19.
Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income Financial assets are held at FVOCI when their contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest and they are held within a business model designed to collect cash flows and to sell assets.
This classification applies to certain debt securities within the Groups Wealth Management entities and to debt securities held as part of the Groups investment capital portfolio.
Impairment is recognised for debt securities classified as FVOCI under the expected loss model see note 3 and 19.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss All other financial assets are held at FVTPL.
The Groups financial assets at FVTPL principally comprise investments in debt securities, equities, pooled investment vehicles and derivatives.
Classification and measurement in accordance with IAS 39 in respect of prior periods The Group initially recorded all financial assets at fair value.
The Group subsequently held each financial asset at fair value fair value through profit or loss FVTPL or available-for-sale AFS or at amortised cost held to maturity or loans and receivables.
Fair value and amortised cost are explained above.
Financial assets at amortised cost held to maturity and loans and receivables Financial assets at amortised cost are the same as those within IFRS 9.
The main difference is that adjustments for impairment were made inaccordance with the incurred loss model.
This was normally determined based on an assessment of the estimated future cash flows on adiscounted basis using the original effective interest rate compared with contractual amounts see note 3 and 19.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss A portion of the Groups financial assets were held at FVTPL and comprised assets that were initially designated as such and those that were held for regular trading.
Available-for-sale financial assets The remainder of the Groups investments held at fair value were classified as AFS financial assets.
This classification was typically selected when the investment was expected to be held for the long term but not necessarily to maturity and where short-term volatility did not reflect long-term expected returns.
AFS financial assets were reviewed for impairment at the end of each reporting period.
The carrying value of these financial assets was not necessarily adjusted, but any impairment loss was transferred from other comprehensive income tothe income statement.
Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2018 111 Financial statements continued Notes to the accounts continued 9.
Financial assets continued Estimates and judgements fair value measurements The Group holds financial instruments that are measured at fair value.
The fair value of financial instruments may require some estimation or may be derived from readily available sources.
The degree of estimation involved depends on the individual financial instrument and is reflected in the fair value hierarchy below.
The hierarchy also reflects the extent of judgements used in the valuation but this does not necessarily indicate that the fair value is more or less likely to be realised.
Judgements may include determining which valuation approach toapply as well as determining appropriate assumptions.
For level 2 and 3 financial instruments, the judgement applied by the Group gives rise to an estimate of fair value.
The approach to determining the fair value estimate of level 2 and 3 financial instruments is set out below, with no individual input giving rise to a material component of the carrying value for the Group.
The fair value levels are based on the degree to which the fair value is observable and are defined as follows: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and principally comprise investments in pooled investment vehicles, quoted equities and government debt, daily-priced funds and exchangetraded derivatives: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from prices that are not traded in an active market but are determined using valuation techniques, which make maximum use of observable market data.
The Groups level 2 financial instruments principally comprise foreign exchange contracts, certain debt securities, asset and mortgage backed securities, and loans held at fair value.
Valuation techniques may include using a broker quote in an inactive market or an evaluated price based on a compilation of primarily observable market information utilising information readily available via external sources.
For funds not priced on a daily basis, the net asset value which isissued monthly or quarterly is used: and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
The Groups level 3 financial assets principally comprise investments in private equity funds that are measured by applying appropriate valuation techniques in accordance with International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines 2015.
Following the Groups acquisition of Algonquin Management Partners S. A. see note 28, level 3 financial assets now include investments in property investment vehicles that operate hotel businesses.
These are valued based on the expected future cashflows that could be generated from the hotel business.

Associates and joint ventures Associates are entities in which the Group has an investment and over which it has significant influence, but not control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions.
Joint ventures are entities in which the Group has an investment where it, along with one or more other shareholders, has contractually agreed to share control of the business and where the major decisions require the unanimous consent of the joint partners.
In both cases, the Group initially records the investment at the fair value of the purchase consideration, including purchase related costs.
The Groups income statement reflects its share of the entitys profit or loss after tax and amortisation of intangible assets.
The statement of other comprehensive income records the Groups share of gains and losses arising from the entitys financial assets at FVOCI 2017: AFS financial assets see note 9.
The statement of financial position subsequently records the Groups share of the net assets of the entity plus any goodwill and intangible assets that arose on purchase less subsequent amortisation.
The statement of changes in equity records the Groups share of other equity movements of the entity.
Goodwill and intangible assets are assessed regularly for impairment.
The associates and joint ventures reserve in the statement of changes in equity represents the Groups share of profits in its investments yet to be received for example, in the form of dividends or distributions, less any amortisation of intangible assets.
Certain associates are held at fair value where permitted by accounting standards and are recorded within financial assets see note 9.

Property, plant and equipment The Groups property, plant and equipment provides the infrastructure to enable the Group to operate and principally comprises leasehold improvements, freehold land and buildings, fixtures and fittings and computer equipment.
Assets are initially stated at cost, which includes expenditure associated with acquisition.
The cost of the asset is recognised in the income statement as a depreciation charge on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life, with the exception of land as it is assumed to have an indefinite useful life.
Goodwill and intangible assets Intangible assets other than software arise when the Group acquires a business and the fair value paid exceeds the fair value of the net tangible assets acquired.
This premium reflects additional value that the Group determines to be attached to the business.
Identifiable acquired intangible assets relating to business combinations include technology, contractual agreements to manage client funds and gain additional access to new or existing clients, geographies and brand names.
Where such assets can be identified, they are classified as acquired intangible assets and charged to the income statement over time.
Consideration paid to acquire the business in excess of the acquisition date fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets is known as goodwill.
Goodwill is not charged to the income statement unless its value has diminished.
Assessment of whether goodwill has become impaired is based on the expected future returns of the relevant cash-generating unit CGU as a whole.
Software purchased and developed for use in the business is also classified as an intangible asset.
The cost of purchasing and developing software is taken to the income statement over time as an amortisation charge within operating expenses.
The treatment is similar to property, plant and equipment and the asset is normally amortised on a straight line basis over three to five years, but can have estimated useful lives of up to 10 years.
Wealth Management goodwill is allocated 119.5million 2017: 119.3 million to Schroder Wealth and 65.0 million 2017: 65.0 million to Benchmark Capital.
The Group acquired 24.9 million 2017: 64.3 million of intangible assets as a result of business combinations completed in 2018, 20.1 million of which related to the acquisition of Algonquin Management Partners S. A. in the Asset Management segment and 4.8 million related to business combinations completed during the year by Benchmark Capital in the Wealth Management segment.
The Group also acquired 2.2million 2017: nil of customer contracts through Benchmark Capital that were not considered to be business combinations.
Estimates and judgements The Group estimates the fair value of intangible assets acquired at the acquisition date based on forecast profits, taking account of synergies, derived from existing contractual arrangements.
This assessment involves judgement in determining assumptions relating to potential future revenues, profit margins, appropriate discount rates and the expected duration of client relationships.
The Group also made estimates to determine the fair value of certain other identifiable assets and liabilities, which included judgement principally with respect to the determination of carried interest receivable and related liabilities and specifically the assumed growth rates, realisation dates and appropriate discount rates see note 2.
The difference between the fair value of the consideration and the value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, including intangible assets, is accounted for as goodwill.
At each reporting date, the Group applies judgement to determine whether there is any indication that goodwill or an acquired intangible asset may be impaired.
If any indication exists and a full assessment determines that the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amount at that time, the assets are written down to their recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of goodwill is determined using a discounted cash flow model.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and cannot be reversed.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
For all relevant acquisitions, it is the Groups judgement that the lowest level of CGU used to determine impairment is segment level for Asset Management.
The Benchmark Capital business within Wealth Management is assessed separately from the rest of Wealth Management.
Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2018 117 Financial statements continued Notes to the accounts continued 12.
Goodwill and intangible assets continued The recoverable amount of acquired intangible assets is the greater of fair value less costs to sell and the updated discounted valuation ofthe remaining net residual income stream.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement but may be reversed ifrelevant conditions improve.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations applying a discounted cash flow model.
The key assumptions on which the Groups cash flow projections are based include long-term market growth rates of 2% per annum 2017: 2%, apre-tax discount rate of 11% 2017: 11%, expected fund flows and expected changes to margins.
The results of the calculation indicate thatgoodwill is not impaired.
The sensitivity of the carrying amounts of goodwill to the methods and assumptions used in estimating the recoverable amounts oftheCGUs is small.
This is due to the amount of goodwill allocated to the relevant CGU relative to the size of the relevant future .
Movements in the growth rate and or the discount rate of 1% would not lead to any impairment.
A comparison of actual results to the projected results used to assess goodwill impairment in prior years reveals that the Group would have recognised no changes 2017: nil toits goodwill asset in the year as a result of inaccurate projections.
Deferred tax Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent amounts of tax that will become recoverable and payable in future accounting periods.
They arise as a result of temporary differences, where the time at which profits and losses are recognised for tax purposes differs from the time at which the relevant transaction is recorded.
A deferred tax asset represents a tax reduction that is expected to arise in a future period based on past transactions.
A deferred tax liability represents taxes that will become payable in a future period as a result of current or .
Deferred tax liabilities also arise on certain acquisitions where the amortisation of the acquired intangible asset does not result in a tax deduction.
The deferred tax liability is established on acquisition and is released to the income statement to match the intangible asset amortisation.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the year end date.

A deferred tax asset of 18.8 million 2017: 19.7 million relating to realised and unrealised capital losses has not been recognised as there isinsufficient evidence that there will be sufficient taxable gains in the future against which the deferred tax asset could be utilised.
Deferred tax assets of 8.0 million 2017: 7.2 million relating to other losses and other temporary differences have not been recognised as there is insufficient evidence that there will be sufficient taxable profits in the future against which these deferred tax assets could be utilised.
The aggregate amount of gross temporary differences regarding investments in subsidiaries is 2.7 million 2017: 3.4 million.
Deferred tax hasnot been provided as the relevant parent company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Unit-linked liabilities and assets backing unit-linked liabilities The Group operates a unit-linked life assurance business through the wholly-owned subsidiary Schroder Pension Management Limited LifeCompany.
The Life Company provides investment products through a life assurance wrapper.
The investment products do not provide cover for any insurance risk and are therefore recognised and accounted for as financial instruments and presented as financial liabilities due to Life Company investors policyholders within unit-linked liabilities.
The investment product is almost identical to a unit trust.
As it is a life assurance product, the contractual rights and obligations of the investments remain with the Group and the AUM is therefore included on the Groups statement of financial position, together with the liability to investors.
The Group earns fee income from managing the investment, which is included in revenue.
Financial assets and liabilities held by the Life Company are measured at FVTPL and this is unchanged following the adoption of IFRS 9.
Other balances include cash and receivables, which are measured at amortised cost see note 9.
The Life Companys assets are regarded ascurrent assets as they represent the amount available to Life Company investors or third party investors in other funds who are able to withdraw their funds on call, subject to certain restrictions in the case of illiquidity.
Gains and losses from assets and liabilities held to cover investor obligations are attributable to investors in the Life Company or third party investors in the funds.
As a result, any gain or loss is offset by a change in the obligation to investors.
2018 2017 m m Financial liabilities due to Life Company investors 8,811.3 10,518.2 1 Financial liabilities due to third parties 2,444.6 3,468.2 11,255.9 13,986.4 1.
In accordance with accounting standards, the Group is deemed to hold a controlling interest in certain funds as a result of the investments held by the Life Company.
This results in all of the assets and liabilities of those funds being consolidated within the Groups statement of financial position and the third party interest in the fund being recorded as a financial liability due to third party investors.
The Group has no primary exposure to market risk, credit risk or liquidity risk in relation to the investments due to Life Company investors.
The risks and rewards associated with its investments are normally borne by the investors in the Life Companys investment products or third party investors in the funds and not by the Life Company itself.
Fair value measurements of Life Company financial assets and liabilities Each of the Life Companys financial assets and liabilities have been categorised using a fair value hierarchy as shown below.
These levels are based on the degree to which the fair value is observable and are defined in note 9.

Unit-linked liabilities and assets backing unit-linked liabilities continued The types of investments found in each of the levels 1 and 3 for the Life Company are the same as those listed for the non-Life Company instruments in note 9.
Level 2 investments principally comprise commercial papers, certificates of deposit, forward foreign exchange contracts and certain debt securities.
No financial assets were transferred from level 1 to level 2 during the year.
Movements in financial assets categorised as level 3 during the year were: 2018 2017 m m At 1 January 54.6 44.5 Exchange translation adjustments 0.3 1.5 Gains recognised in the income statement 10.7 4.8 Additions 14.1 Disposals 28.3 10.3 At 31 December 37.3 54.6 15.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables includes amounts the Group is due to pay in the normal course of business, accruals and deferred income, being fees received in advance of services provided as well as deferred cash awards and bullion deposits by customers.
Trade and other payables, other than deferred cash awards and bullion deposits, are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost see note 9.
Amounts due to the Group in the normal course of business are made up of creditors and accruals.
Accruals represent costs, including remuneration, that are not yet billed or due for payment, but for which the goods or services have been received.
Deferred cash awards, being deferred employee remuneration payable in cash, and bullion deposits by customers are recorded at fair value.
The fair value of bullion deposits by customers is derived from level 1 inputs see note 9.
The fair value of deferred cash awards is derived from level 1 inputs, being equal to the fair value of the units in funds to which the employee award is linked.
Settlement accounts are generally settled within four working days and trade creditors have an average settlement period of 22 working days 2017:20workingdays.

Financial liabilities The Groups financial liabilities principally comprise deposits by Wealth Management clients and banking counterparties.
They also include derivatives held for client facilitation or interest rate matching in Wealth Management see note 18, and the hedging of risk exposures within investment capital.
Other financial liabilities at fair value mainly comprise liabilities that arise from financial obligations in respect ofcarried interest, third party interests in consolidated funds, and contingent consideration and other financial liabilities arising from prior acquisitions completed by the Group.
Consolidation occurs when the Group is deemed to control a fund, usually in respect of Life Company or seed capital investments.
When a fund is consolidated, the Group accounts for the fund in its statement of financial position as if it were wholly-owned by the Group, but records an additional liability representing the fair value of the proportion of the fund owned by third party investors.
Where the investment is held by the Life Company, the fair value of the proportion of the fund owned by third party investors is shown as part of unit-linked liabilities see note 14.
Each instrument has been categorised within one of three levels using a fair value hierarchy see note 9.

Financial liabilities continued Estimates and judgements The carrying value of financial liabilities may involve estimation or be derived from readily available sources.
Financial liabilities have been categorised using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the extent of estimates and judgements used in the valuation see note 9.
The Groups financial liabilities categorised as level 3 principally consist of obligations arising from contingent consideration related to carried interest arrangements and other financial liabilities arising from prior acquisitions completed by the Group.
Information about the estimates and judgements made in determining the fair value of carried interest payable is set out in note 2.
The carrying values of level 3 financial liabilities are typically derived from an estimate of the expected future cash flows required to settle the liability.
These estimates reflect the projected performance of the acquired businesses for a number of years into the future.
Movements in financial liabilities categorised as Level 3 during the year were: 2018 2017 m m At 1 January 72.4 44.2 Exchange translation adjustments 4.4 0.1 Net loss gain recognised in the income statement 38.1 4.1 1 47.4 32.2 Additions Disposals and settlements 7.9 At 31 December 154.4 72.4 1.
Provisions and contingent liabilities Provisions are liabilities where there is uncertainty over the timing or amount of settlement and therefore usually require the use of estimates.
They are recognised when three conditions are fulfilled: when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, when it is probable that the Group will incur a loss in order to settle the obligation, and when a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
They are recorded at the Groups best estimate of the cost of settling the obligation.
Any differences between those estimates and the amounts for which the Group actually becomes liable are taken to the income statement as additional charges where the Group has underestimated and credits where the Group has overestimated.
Where the estimated timing and settlement is longer-term, the amount is discounted using a rate reflecting specific risks associated with the provision.
Contingent liabilities are potential liabilities where there is even greater uncertainty, which could include a dependency on events not within the Groups control, but where there is a possible obligation.
Contingent liabilities are only disclosed where significant and are not included within the statement of financial position.

Legal and regulatory obligations associated with the Groups business arise from past events that are estimated to crystallise mainly within two years 2017: two years.
Estimates and judgements The timing and amount of settlement of each legal claim or potential claim, regulatory matter and constructive obligation is uncertain.
TheGroup applies judgement to determine whether a provision is required.
TheGroup performs an assessment of the timing and amount of each event and reviews this assessment periodically.
For some provisions, including the provision for onerous leases, there is greater certainty as the cash flows have largely been determined.
Potential legal claims, regulatory related costs and other obligations to third parties arise as a consequence of normal business activity.
They can arise from actual or alleged breaches of obligations and may be covered by the Groups insurance arrangements, but subject to insurance excess.
In certain circumstances, legal and regulatory claims can arise despite there being no error or breach.
The Groupsrisk management and compliance procedures are designed to mitigate, but are not ableto eliminate, the risk of losses occurring.
Wheresuch claims and costs arise there is often uncertainty over whether a payment will be required and estimation is required in determining the quantum and timing of that payment.
As a result, there is also uncertainty over the timing and amount of any insurance recovery, although this does not change the likelihood of insurance cover being available, where applicable.
The Group makes periodic assessments of all cash flows, including taking external advice where appropriate, to determine an appropriate provision.
Some matters may be settled through commercial negotiation aswell as being covered in whole or in part by the Groups insurance arrangements.
The Group has made provisions based on the reasonable expectation of likely outflows.
The inherent uncertainty in such matters and the results of negotiations and insurance cover may result in different outcomes.
At 31 December 2018, there are no key judgements or estimates that would result in any additional material provisions being recognised orany material contingent liabilities being disclosed in the financial statements 31 December 2017: none.
The provisions included in the financial statements at 31 December 2018 are based on estimates of reasonable ranges of likely outcomes, applying assumptions regarding the probability of payments being due and the settlement value.
The aggregate reasonable ranges have been assessed as not materially different to the carrying values.
Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2018 123 Financial statements continued Notes to the accounts continued 18.
Derivative contracts a The Groups use of derivatives The Group holds derivatives for risk management, client facilitation, and within its investment portfolios to provide exposure to market returns.
The Group most commonly uses forward foreign exchange contracts where it agrees to buy or sell specified amounts of a named currency at a future date, allowing the Group effectively to fix exchange rates so that it can avoid unpredictable gains and losses on financial instruments in foreign currencies.
The Group uses equity contracts to hedge market-related gains and losses on its seed capital investments where the purpose of investing is to help establish a new product rather than gain additional market exposure.
Interest rate contracts are used to hedge exposures to fixed or floating rates of interest.
Where derivatives are held for risk management purposes, the Group designates certain derivatives as hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation.
In these scenarios, and where relevant conditions are met, hedge accounting is applied and the Group formally documents the relationship between the derivative and any hedged item, its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking the various hedging transactions.
It also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of hedged items.
In respect of hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
The Groups net investment hedges are generally fully effective, but any ineffective portion that may arise is recognised in the income statement.
On disposal of the foreign operation, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised directly in other comprehensive income is transferred to the income statement.
Risk management: the Group actively seeks to limit and manage its exposures to risk where that exposure is not desired by the Group.
Thismaytake the form of unwanted exposures to a particular currency, type of interest rate or other price risk.
By entering into derivative contracts, the Group is able to mitigate or eliminate such exposures.
The principal risk that the Group faces through such use of derivative contracts is credit risk.
Client facilitation: the Groups Wealth Management entities are involved in providing portfolio management, banking and investment advisory services, primarily to private clients.
In carrying out this business, they transact as agent or as principal in financial assets and liabilities including derivatives in order to facilitate client portfolio requirements.
Wealth Managements policy is to hedge, as appropriate, exchange rate and interest rate risk on its client facilitation positions.
This does not eliminate credit risk.
For details of how the Group manages its exposure to credit risk, see below and note 19. b Derivatives used by the Group Currency forwards are contractual obligations to receive or pay amounts based on changes in currency rates or to buy or sell foreign currency ora financial instrument on a future date at a specified price.
For currency forward contracts, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the fair value of the contracts.
Currency and interest rate swaps are commitments to exchange one set of cash flows for another.
Swaps result in an economic exchange of currencies or interest rates for example, fixed rate for floating rate or a combination of all these i. e. cross-currency interest rate swaps.
No exchange of principal takes place, except in the case of certain currency swaps.
The Groups credit risk represents the potential cost of replacing the swap contracts if counterparties fail to perform their obligations.
This risk is monitored on an ongoing basis with reference to the current fair value, a proportion of the notional amount of the contracts, and the liquidity of the market.
To control the level of credit risk taken, the Group assesses counterparties in accordance with its internal policies and procedures.
Foreign exchange, equity and interest rate options are contractual agreements under which the seller grants the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, either to buy a call option or sell a put option at or by a set date or during a set period, a specific amount of a foreign currency or a financial instrument at a predetermined price.
The seller receives a premium from the purchaser and assumes foreign exchange, equity or interest rate risk.
Options may be either exchange-traded or negotiated between the Group and a customer or market counterparty.
The Group is exposed to credit risk on purchased options only, and only to the extent of their carrying amount, which is their fair value.
Futures contracts are standardised contracts to buy or sell specified assets for an agreed price at a specified future date.
Contracts are negotiated at a futures exchange, which acts as an intermediary between the two parties.
For futures contracts, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the fair value of the contracts.

Financial instrument risk management TheGroup Capital Committee GCC is responsible for the management of the Groups capital and sets objectives for how it is deployed.
This note explains how the Group manages its capital, setting out the nature of the risks the Group faces as a result ofits operations, and how these risks are quantified and managed.
The Group is exposed to different forms of financial instrument risk including: i the risk that money owed to the Group will not be received credit risk : ii the risk that the Group may not have sufficient cash available to pay its creditors as they fall due liquidity risk : and iii the risk that the value ofassets will fluctuate as a result of movements in factors such as market prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates market risk.
Themanagement of such risks is embedded in managerial responsibilities fundamental to the wellbeing of the Group.
The Groups primary exposure to financial instrument risk is derived from the financial instruments that it holds as principal.
In addition, duetothe nature of the business, the Groups exposure extends to the impact on investment management and other fees that are determined on the basis of a percentage of AUM and are therefore impacted by financial instrument risk exposure of our clients the secondary exposure.
This note deals only with the direct or primary exposure of the risks from the Groups holding of financial instruments see the Key Risks and Mitigations report on page 40.
The financial risks of these products are largely borne by thethird party investors, consistent with other investment products managed by the Group.
However, since the Life Company, which is a subsidiary, issues the investment instrument and holds the relevant financial assets, both the investments and the third party obligations are recorded in the statement of financial position.
Financial instrument risk management disclosures in respect of the Life Companys financial instruments are set out in note 14. a Capital The Groups approach to capital management is to maintain a strong capital position to enable us to invest in the future of the Group, in line with our strategy, and to support the risks inherent in conducting our business.
Capital management is an important part of our risk management framework and is underpinned by our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP.
The ICAAP considers the relevant current and future risks to the business and the capital we consider necessary to support these risks.
We actively monitor our capital base to ensure we maintain sufficient and appropriate capital resources to cover the relevant risks to the business and to meet consolidated and local regulatory and working capital requirements.
Our lead regulator is the Prudential Regulation Authority PRA as the Group includes an entity with a UK banking license.
We are required to maintain adequate capital resources to meet our Total Capital Requirement TCR of 827 million 2017: 799 million.
The TCR incorporates our Pillar 1 regulatory capital requirement of 605 million 2017: 583 million.
In addition to the Total Capital Requirement of our banking group, we are required to hold additional capital of 194 million 2017: 145 million in respect of our insurance companies and EU regulatory buffers.
The Groups overall regulatory capital requirement was 1,021 million at 31 December 2018 2017: 899 million.
This requirement increased to 1,126 million on 1 January 2019 1 January 2018: 944 million as a result of the final increase in the capital conversation buffer following the regulatory transition period together with the impact of IFRS 16 Leases see Presentation of financial statements on page 149.
Following these changes, the Groups regulatory surplus capital at 1 January 2019 was 1.2 billion 1 January 2018: 1.4 billion.
In managing our capital position, we consider the composition of our capital base, which consists of: Working capital deployed to support the Groups general operating activities and regulatory requirements: Investment capital held in excess of these operating requirements: and other items that are not investible or otherwise available to meet our operating or regulatory requirements.
The table below shows the components of our capital position.

Comprises regulatory deductions, principally goodwill, intangible assets and pension scheme surplus.
i Working capital The Groups policy is for subsidiaries to hold sufficient working capital to meet their regulatory and other operating requirements.
Local regulators oversee the activities of, and impose minimum capital and liquidity requirements on, the Groups operating entities.
At 31 December 2018, the Group, and all regulated entities within the Group, complied with minimum regulatory capital requirements.
Working capital is also deployed through certain subsidiaries to support new investment strategies and growth opportunities and to co-invest alongside the Groups clients.
126 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial statements 19.
Financial instrument risk management continued a Capital continued ii Investment capital Available capital held in excess of working capital requirements is transferred to investment capital.
Investment capital is managed with the aim of achieving a low-volatility return.
It is mainly held in investment grade corporate bonds and funds managed by the Group.
These liquid investments are available to support the organic development of existing and new business strategies and to respond to other investment and growth opportunities as they arise, such as acquisitions.
Investment capital also includes certain commercial private equity investments and illiquid legacy investments.

b Credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk The Group is exposed to credit, liquidity and market risk as a result of the financial instruments it holds.
Settlement of financial instruments onboth a principal and agency basis also gives rise to operational risk.
The Groups risk management framework is critical to effective management of these risks and considerable resources are dedicated to this area.
Risk management is the direct responsibility of the Board, with responsibility for oversight delegated to the Audit and Risk Committee.
The Group applies the three lines of defence model to risk management, which includes financial instrument risk.
More details on the risk management framework and approach are set out in the Key Risks and Mitigations report and the Audit and Risk Committee report on pages 40 and 62 respectively.
i Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument, loan or commitment will cause the Group financial loss by failing to discharge their obligations.
For this purpose, the impact on fair value of a credit loss arising from credit spread price changes in a portfolio of investments is excluded.
This risk is addressed within Pricing risk.

Financial instrument risk management continued b Credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk continued i Credit risk continued The Group has exposure to credit risk from its normal activities where it is exposed to the risk that a counterparty will be unable to pay, in full, amounts when due.
The Group carefully manages its exposure to credit risk by: approving lending policies that specify the type of acceptable collateral and minimum lending margins: setting limits for exposures to individual counterparties and sectors: and by taking security.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the gross carrying value of its financial assets.
Externally published credit ratings are indicators of the level of credit risk associated with a counterparty.
Not rated debt securities include redeemable preference shares issued by A10 Capital Parent Company LLC see note 10.
The Group adopted IFRS 9 Financial Instruments on 1 January 2018.
Prior to adoption of IFRS 9, impairment was only recognised when a default occurred.
Under IFRS 9, expected credit losses are calculated on all of the Groups financial assets that are measured at amortised cost and all debt instruments that are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.
Factors considered in determining whether a default has taken place include how many days past the due date a payment is, deterioration in the credit quality of a counterparty, and knowledge of specific events that could influence a counterpartys ability to pay.
In accordance with the transition provisions of IFRS 9, comparative information has not been restated.
A three stage model is used for calculating expected credit losses, which requires financial assets to be assessed as: Performing stage 1 Financial assets where there has been no significant increase in credit risk since original recognition: or Under-performing stage 2 Financial assets where there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, but no default: or, Non-performing stage 3 Financial assets that are in default.
For financial assets in stage 1, expected credit losses are calculated based on the credit losses that are expected to be incurred over the following twelve-month period.
For financial assets in stage 2 and 3, expected credit losses are calculated based on expected credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the instrument.
The Group applies the simplified approach to calculate expected credit losses for trade and other receivables.
Under this approach, instruments are not categorised into three stages and expected credit losses are calculated based on the life of the instrument.
Wealth Management activities All client credit requests are presented to the relevant Wealth Management approval authorities and counterparty exposures are monitored daily against limits.
Loans, overdrafts and advances to clients as well as certain derivative positions are secured on a range of assets including real estate both residential and commercial, cash, client portfolios and life insurance policies.
The Group does not usually provide loans, overdrafts or advances to clients on an unsecured basis.
Where disposal of non-cash collateral is required, in the event of default, the terms and conditions relevant to the specific contract and country will apply.
Portfolios held as collateral are marked to market daily and positions compared to clients exposures.
Credit limits are set following an assessment of the market value and lending value of each type of collateral, depending on the perceived risk associated with the collateral.
Clients are contacted if these limits are breached, or if collateral is not sufficient to cover the outstanding exposure.
The collateral accepted by the Group includes certain investment-grade securities that can be sold or repledged without default of the provider.
At 31 December 2018 the fair value of collateral that could be sold or repledged but had not been, relating solely to these arrangements, was 497.4 million 2017: 591.4 million.
Debt securities held within the Wealth Management treasury book are mainly unsecured.
Policies covering various counterparty and market risk limits are set and monitored by the relevant Wealth Management asset and liability management committees.
All instruments held within the Wealth Management treasury book have an investment grade credit rating.

Financial instrument risk management continued b Credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk continued i Credit risk continued Wealth Management takes a conservative approach to its treasury investments placing them with, or purchasing debt securities issued by, UKand overseas banks and corporates, central banks, supranational banks and sovereigns.
Expected credit losses on financial assets at amortised cost within the Wealth Management entities at 31 December 2018 were 0.4 million.
Loans and advances to clients includes 1.8 million of under-performing stage 2 loans and 0.2 million of non-performing stage 3 loans givingrise to 0.1 million and 0.2 million of expected credit losses respectively.
All other financial assets at amortised cost excluding trade andother receivables to which the three stage model is not applied were performing stage 1.
Expected credit losses on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income within the Wealth Management entities at 31December 2018 were 0.1 million.
All financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income were performing stage 1.
Other activities Fee debtors and other receivables arise as a result of the Groups asset management activities and amounts are monitored regularly.
Historically, default levels have been insignificant and unless a client has withdrawn its funds, there is an ongoing relationship between theGroup and the client.
Fee debtors past due but not in default as at 31 December 2018 were 20.0 million 31 December 2017: 21.9 million, the majority of which isless than 90 days past due 31 December 2017: less than 90 days.
The Group seeks to manage its exposure to credit risk arising from debt securities and derivatives within the investment portfolio by adopting aconservative approach and through ongoing credit analysis.
Corporate bond portfolios have an investment grade mandate, and exposure to sub-investment grade debt is low.
Derivative positions, other than forward foreign exchange contracts, are taken in exchange-traded securities where there is minimal credit risk.
Forward foreign exchange positions generally have a maturity of one month.
The Groups cash and cash equivalents in the non-Wealth Management entities are held primarily in current accounts, on deposit with well-rated banks, or invested in money market funds.
Expected credit losses on financial assets at amortised cost within non-Wealth Management entities at 31 December 2018 were 0.7 million.
All financial assets at amortised cost excluding trade and other receivables to which the three stage model is not applied were performing stage 1.
Expected credit losses on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income within non-Wealth Management entities at 31December 2018 were 0.6 million.
Debt securities includes 11.3 million of under-performing stage 2 securities giving rise to 0.2 million ofexpected credit losses respectively.
All other financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income were performing stage 1. ii Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group cannot meet its obligations as they fall due or can only do so at a cost.
The Group has a clearly defined liquidity risk management framework in place in the form of a Consolidated Group Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process ILAAP.
TheGroup policy is that its subsidiaries should trade solvently, comply with regulatory liquidity requirements, and have access to adequate liquidity for allactivities undertaken in the normal course of business.
As part of its ILAAP, the Group performs stress testing to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to cover severe but plausible stress events.
In particular, all companies should maintain sufficient liquid funds to meet peak working capital requirements.
Wealth Management activities The principal liquidity risk in the Groups Wealth Management business arises as a result of its banking activities, where the timing of cash flows from liabilities relating to client accounts can be impacted by client action.
The objective of the Groups liquidity policy is to maintain sufficient liquidity within the relevant entities to meet regulatory and prudential requirements, to cover cash flow imbalances and fluctuations in funding, and to ensure the timely repayment of funds to depositors.
Liquidity positions are actively monitored and cash flows are managed to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to cover potential liquidity risks inindividual currencies and in aggregate.

Excluding the Life Company and consolidated funds, the Asset Management and Group segment together hold cash and cash equivalents of 552.6 million 2017: 640.6 million.
Financial liabilities relating to other operating entities are 390.6million 2017: 200.8 million.
The Group has a committed loan facility of 510.0 million 2017: 510.0 million that expires on 4 October 2023, which was undrawn at 31 December 2018 31 December 2017: undrawn.
iii Market risk Market risk is the risk that the value of assets will fluctuate as a result of movements in factors such as market prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
Pricing risk Pricing risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk.
In respect of financial instrument risk, the Groups exposure to pricing risk is principally through investments held in investment capital, seed and co-investment capital, deferred employee compensation in the form of fund awards and some investments held for regulatory capital purposes.
Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2018 131 Financial statements continued Notes to the accounts continued 19.
Financial instrument risk management continued b Credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk continued iii Market risk continued Pricing risk continued The Group does not hedge exposures to pricing risk except in relation to seed capital, where it is practical to do so, and in respect of deferred employee compensation awards, where these can be matched by interests in funds managed by the Group.
Where financial instruments are held to hedge deferred compensation awards, movements in the fair value of the asset are normally offset by changes in the amounts payable to employees see note 4.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
Wealth Management activities In Wealth Management, interest rate risk is monitored against policies and limits set by the relevant risk committee on a daily basis.
Interest rate risk is managed within set limits by matching asset and liability positions and through the use of interest rate swaps.
Sensitivity-based and stress-based models are used for monitoring interest rate risk.
These models assess the impact of a prescribed basis point rise in interest rates, and potential impact of severe but plausible stress scenarios.
The impact is calculated regularly for individual currency exposures and in aggregate.
Other activities Cash held by the other operating companies is not normally expected to be placed on deposit for longer than three months and is not exposed to significant interest rate risk.
The Groups capital includes investments in corporate investment-grade bonds managed by the Groups fixed income fund managers.
The market risk including interest rate risk exposure of these investments is actively monitored against limits set by the Board.
Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
Wealth Management activities In Wealth Management, some loans and advances to clients, client deposits and a proportion of the treasury activities are undertaken in foreign currencies.
This is managed by the treasury departments within agreed limits that are set and monitored by the relevant risk committees.
Other activities The Groups policy in relation to foreign exchange risks arising from revenue, expenditure and capital currency exposure from its Asset Management activities is generally not to hedge.
The Groups revenue is earned and expenditure incurred in many currencies and the resulting exposure is considered to be a normal part of the Groups business activities.
The Group also has exposure to foreign currency through investments in currencies other than sterling.
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts with third parties to mitigate this exposure.
The gain or loss on the hedging instruments is included in the statement of other comprehensive income or the income statement, as appropriate.
The use of such instruments is subject to approval by the GCC.
The sensitivities to market risk are estimated as follows: 31 December 2018 31 December 2017 A reasonable Increase A reasonable Increase change in the decrease change in the decrease variable within Increase in other variable within Increase in other the next decrease in components the next decrease in components calendar year post-tax profit of equity calendar year post-tax profit of equity 1 Variable % m m % m m 2 Interest ratesincrease 1.0 4 0.5 3 -decrease 0.5 2 0.5 3 3 US dollar against sterlingstrengthen 15 2 10 3 -weaken 20 2 8 2 3 Euro against sterlingstrengthen 7 1 10 2 -weaken 10 1 6 1 3 US dollar against Euroincrease 7 2 10 4 -decrease 10 2 10 4 4 FTSE-All Share Indexstrengthen 20 42 20 14 1 -weaken 20 42 20 14 1 1.
The underlying assumption is that there is one variable increase decrease with all other variables held constant.
Assumes that the fair value of assets and liabilities will not be affected by a change in interest rates.
The 2017 sensitivities for changes in foreign exchange rates have been re-presented following a change in methodology.
Assumes that changes in the FTSE-All Share Index correlate to changes in the fair value of the Groups equity investments.
These sensitivities concern only the direct impact on financial instruments and exclude indirect impacts on fee income and certain costs that may be affected by changes in the variable.
The changes used in the sensitivity analysis were provided by the Groups Global Economics team who determine reasonable assumptions.

Share capital and share premium Share capital represents the number of issued ordinary and non-voting ordinary shares in Schroders plc multiplied by their nominal value of 1 each.
Share premium substantially represents the aggregate of all amounts that have ever been paid above nominal value to Schroders plc when it has issued ordinary and non-voting ordinary shares.
There are certain circumstances in which the share premium can be reduced but these have not arisen in 2017 or 2018.
The Company has no authority to issue, buy back, or cancel ordinary shares in issue including those held in trust and has authority limited by shareholder resolution to issue or purchase non-voting ordinary shares, which may either be cancelled or held in treasury.

Own shares Own shares are recorded by the Group when non-voting ordinary shares are acquired by the Company, or ordinary or non-voting ordinary shares are acquired through employee benefit trusts.
This enables the Group to hold some of its shares in treasury to settle option exercises or for other permitted purposes.
Own shares are held at cost and their purchase reduces the Groups net assets by the amount spent.
When shares vest unconditionally or are cancelled, they are transferred from own shares to the profit and loss reserve at their weighted average cost.

Commitments Commitments represent amounts the Group has contractually committed to pay to third parties but do not yet represent a liability.
Commitments at the year end do not impact on the Groups financial results for the year.
The Group leases office space and equipment.
Lease agreements can commit the Group to significant future expenditure and the table below discloses the Groups commitments to make such payments.
Such commitments are not recorded on the Groups statement of financial position in advance of the period to which they relate.
The Group sublets a small number of its owned and leased properties where such properties, or parts of such properties, are not required for use by the Group.
The table below discloses the commitments sub-lessees have made in respect of such arrangements.
These commitments are not recorded on the statement of financial position in advance of the period to which they relate.
However, they may be used to determine the onerous lease provision if the rental income does not equal or exceed the Groups own rental obligation see note 17.

Retirement benefit obligations The Group has two principle types of pension benefit for employees: defined benefit DB where the Group has an obligation to provide participating employees with pension payments that represent a specified percentage of their final salary for each year of service, and defined contribution DC, where the Groups contribution to an employees pension is measured as, and limited to, a specified percentage of salary.
Accounting for DB schemes requires an assessment of the likely quantum of future pension payments to be made.
If ring-fenced assets are held specifically to meet this cost, the scheme is funded, and if not, it is unfunded.
The Group periodically reviews its funded DB schemes using actuarial specialists to assess whether it is on course to meet the expected pension payments that current and former employees are or will be entitled to.
In the case of a projected shortfall, a plan must be formulated to reverse the deficit.
The income statement charge or credit represents the sum of pension entitlements earned by employees in the period, plus a notional net interest charge if the scheme is in deficit or income if it is in surplus based on the market yields on high quality corporate bonds.
Experience differences, principally the difference between actual investment returns and the notional interest amount, as well as actuarial changes in estimating the present value of future liabilities, are recorded in other comprehensive income.
Assets or liabilities recognised in the statement of financial position represent the differences between the fair value of plan assets if any and the  estimates of the present value of future liabilities.
The Group closed its largest DB scheme to future accrual on 30 April 2011, although it still operates some small unfunded schemes overseas.
This means that no future service will contribute to the closed scheme member benefits but those members continue to have the benefits determined by the Scheme rules as at 30 April 2011.
The Groups exposure to funding DC pension schemes is limited to the contributions it has agreed to make.
These contributions generally stop when employment ceases.
The income statement charge represents the contributions the Group has agreed to make into employees pension schemes in that period.
The disclosures within this note are provided mainly in respect of the principal DB scheme, which is the DB section of the funded Schroders Retirement Benefits Scheme the Scheme.
The income statement charge for retirement benefit costs is as follows: 2018 2017 m m Pension costs defined contribution plans 47.9 42.8 Pension credit defined benefit plans 2.5 1.5 Other post-employment benefits 0.2 0.2 45.6 41.5 i Profile of the Scheme The Scheme is administered by a Trustee company, Schroder Pension Trustee Limited.
The board of the Trustee company comprises an independent chairman, three directors appointed by the employer and two directors elected by the Scheme members.
The Trustee is required by law to act in the interest of all relevant beneficiaries and is responsible for setting the investment strategy and for the day-to-day administration of the benefits.
The Trustees investment committee comprises four of the Trustee directors and two representatives of the Group.
This committee, which reports to the Trustee board, is responsible for making investment strategy recommendations to the board oftheTrustee and for monitoring the performance of the investment manager.
Under the Scheme, employees are entitled to annual pensions on retirement based on a specified percentage of their final pensionable salary or, in the case of active members at 30 April 2011 the date the DB section of the Scheme closed for future accrual, actual pensionable salaries atthat date, for each year of service.
These benefits are adjusted for the effects of inflation, subject to a cap of 2.5% for pensions accrued after 12August 2007 and 5.0% for pensions accrued before that date.
As at 31 December 2018, there were no active members in the DB section 2017: nil and 1,973 active members in the DC section 2017: 1,828.
The weighted average duration of the Schemes DB obligation is 18 years 2017: 21 years.
Membership details of the DB section of the Scheme as at 31 December are as follows: 2018 2017 Number of deferred members 1,327 1,418 Total deferred pensions at date of leaving Scheme 10.0m per annum 10.9m per annum Average age deferred 52 52 Number of pensioners 849 829 Average age pensioners 70 69 Total pensions in payment 19.6m per annum 18.9m per annum ii Funding requirements The last completed triennial valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 31 December 2017.
The funding level at that date was 115% on the technical provisions basis and no contribution to the Scheme was required 2017: nil.
The next triennial valuation is due as at 31 December 2020 and will be performed in 2021.

Retirement benefit obligations continued iii Risks of the Scheme The Company and the Trustee have agreed a long-term strategy for reducing investment risk as and when appropriate.
This includes an asset-liability matching policy that aims to reduce the volatility of the funding level of the Scheme by investing in assets that perform in line with the liabilities of the Scheme.
The most significant risks that the Scheme exposes the Group to are: Asset volatility The liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if assets underperform this yield, this will reduce the surplus or may create a deficit.
The Group manages this risk by holding 51.6% 2017: 50.7% of Scheme assets in an LDI portfolio and the remainder in growth assets such as the Schroder Life Diversified Growth Fund and a Strategic Beta portfolio.
This asset mix is designed to provide returns that match or exceed the unwinding of the discount rate in the long term, but that can create volatility and risk in the short term.
The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the Schemes long-term objectives.
Credit risk The assets of the Scheme include LDI and other fixed income instruments that expose the Group to credit risk.
A significant amount of this exposure is to the UK Government as a result of holding gilts and bonds guaranteed by the UK Government.
Other instruments held include derivatives, which are collateralised daily to cover unrealised gains or losses.
The minimum rating for any derivatives counterparty is BBB.
Interest rate risk A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the Schemes liabilities for accounting purposes, although this should be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Schemes LDI portfolio, which comprises gilts and other LDI instruments.
The LDI portfolio has been designed to mitigate interest rate exposures measured on a funding rather than an accounting basis.
One of the principal differences between these bases is that the liability under the funding basis is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to gilt yields: the latter uses corporate bond yields.
As a result, the LDI portfolio hedges against interest rate risk by purchasing instruments that seek to replicate movements in gilt yields rather than corporate bond yields.
Movements in the different types of instrument are not exactly correlated, and it is therefore likely that a tracking error can arise when assessing whether the LDI portfolio has provided an effective hedge against interest rate risk on an accounting basis.
At 31 December 2018, the LDI portfolio was designed to mitigate 77% 2017: 73% of the Schemes exposure to changes in gilt yields.
Inflation risk A significant proportion of the Schemes benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
However, inmost cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place.
The majority of the growth assets are either unaffected by or not closely correlated with inflation, which means that an increase in inflation will also decrease any Scheme surplus.
The LDI portfolio includes instruments such as index-linked gilts to provide protection against inflation risk.
At 31 December 2018, the LDI portfolio was designed to mitigate 77% 2017: 73% of the Schemes exposure to inflation risk.
Life expectancy The majority of the Schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liability.
iv Reporting at 31 December The principal financial assumptions used for the Scheme are: 2018 2017 % % Discount rate 2.9 2.6 RPI inflation rate 3.3 3.3 CPI inflation rate 2.2 2.2 Future pension increases for benefits earned before 13 August 2007 3.2 3.1 Future pension increases for benefits earned after 13 August 2007 2.2 2.2 Average number of years a current pensioner is expected to live beyond age 60: Years Years Men 28 28 Women 29 30 Average number of years future pensioners currently aged 45 are expected to live beyond age 60: Years Years Men 29 29 Women 30 31 Net interest income is determined by applying the discount rate to the opening net surplus in the Scheme.
The Group determines the appropriate discount rate at the end of each year.
This is the interest rate that is used to determine the present value ofestimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the pension obligations.
In determining the appropriate discount rate, theGroup considers the interest rates of high quality, long dated corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will bepaid.

Retirement benefit obligations continued Estimates and judgements The Group estimates the carrying value of the Scheme by applying judgement to determine the assumptions as set out on page 138 to determine the valuation of the pension obligation using member data and applying the Scheme rules.
The Scheme assets are mainly quoted in an active market.
The sensitivity to those assumptions is set out below.
The most significant judgemental assumption relates to mortality rates which are inherently uncertain.
The Groups mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables with Continuous Mortality Investigation core projection factors and a long-term rate of mortality improvement of1.0% 2017: 1.0% perannum.
Mortality tables for male pensioners are scaled back by 5% and female pensioners are scaled back by 10% to reflect the history of longer life expectancy of the Groups employees.
The Group reviews its assumptions annually in conjunction with its independent actuaries and considers this adjustment appropriate given the geographic and demographic profile of Scheme members.
Other assumptions for pension obligations are based in part on current market conditions.
The financial impact of the Scheme on the Group has been determined by independent qualified actuaries, Aon Hewitt Limited, and is based on an assessment of the Scheme as at 31 December 2018.
The amounts recognised in the income statement are: 2018 2017 m m Interest income on Scheme assets 26.1 28.0 Interest cost on Scheme liabilities 21.9 24.8 Net interest income recognised in the income statement in respect of the Scheme 4.2 3.2 Income statement charge in respect of other defined benefit schemes 1.7 1.7 Total defined benefit schemes income statement credit 2.5 1.5 The amounts recognised in the statement of comprehensive income are: 2018 2017 m m Loss return on Scheme assets in excess of that recognised in interest income 56.8 20.6 Actuarial gains due to change in demographic assumptions 18.3 27.2 Actuarial gains losses due to change in financial assumptions 36.3 1.7 Actuarial losses due to experience 9.3 4.6 Total other comprehensive loss in respect of the Scheme 11.5 41.5 Other comprehensive loss in respect of other defined benefit schemes 0.1 0.8 Total other comprehensive loss in respect of defined benefit schemes 11.6 42.3 The sensitivity of the Scheme pension liabilities to changes in assumptions are: 2018 2017 Estimated Estimated Estimated Estimated increase increase increase increase reduction in reduction in reduction in reduction in pension pension pension pension liabilities liabilities liabilities liabilities Assumption Assumption change m % m % Discount rate Increase by 0.5% per annum 65.8 8.3 93.6 10.8 Discount rate Decrease by 0.5% per annum 72.1 9.1 102.1 11.8 Expected rate of pension increases Increase by 0.5% per annum 56.3 7.1 79.7 9.2 Expected rate of pension increases Decrease by 0.5% per annum 52.6 6.6 74.9 8.6 Life expectancy Increase by one year 32.3 4.1 33.6 3.9 Life expectancy Reduce by one year 33.5 4.2 33.4 3.9 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2018 139 Financial statements continued Notes to the accounts continued 24.

Share-based payments Share-based payments are remuneration payments to selected employees that take the form of an award of shares in Schroders plc.
Employees are generally not able to exercise such awards in full until three years after the award has been made, although conditions vary between different types of award.
The accounting for share-based awards settled by transferring shares to the employees equity-settled differs from the accounting for similar awards settled in cash cash-settled.
The charge for equity-settled share-based payments is determined based on the fair value of the award on the grant date or, in the case of grandfathered awards arising on business combinations, the fair value of the share awards at the acquisition date.
Such awards can include share options or share awards that may or may not have performance criteria.
The initial fair value of the award takes into account the current value of shares expected to be issued i. e. estimates of the likely levels of forfeiture and achievement of performance criteria, the contribution, if required, by the employee and the time value of money.
This initial fair value is charged to the income statement reflecting benefits received from employment, where relevant, in the performance period and over the vesting period.
The income statement charge is offset by a credit to the statement of changes in equity, where the award is expected to be settled through the issue of shares.
Such awards constituted 7.6% 2017: 7.7% of salaries, wages and other remuneration see note 4.
The Group may make share-based payments to employees through awards over or linked to the value of ordinary and non-voting ordinary shares and by the grant of market value share options over ordinary or non-voting ordinary shares.
These arrangements involve a maximum term of 10 years.
It is the Groups practice to hedge all awards to eliminate the impact of changes in the market value of shares between the grant date and the exercise date.
Awards that lapse or are forfeited during the vesting period result in a credit to the income statement reversing the previous charge in the year in which they lapse or are forfeited.
The Group recognised total expenses of 63.8 million 2017: 62.0 million arising from share-based payment transactions during the year, ofwhich 63.9 million 2017: 60.5 million were equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
In 2018 there were total exceptional costs of10.6 million included within equity-settled share-based payments 2017: nil.
The Group has the following share-based payment arrangements further details of the current schemes may be found in the Remunerationreport : a 2000 Equity Compensation Plan and 2011 Equity Compensation Plan Awards over ordinary and non-voting ordinary shares made under the Groups Equity Compensation Plans are charged at fair value as Operating expenses in the income statement.
There are no performance conditions attached to the awards.
For the 2000 Equity Compensation Plan the fair value of an award is calculated using the market value of the shares at the date of grant, discounted for the dividends forgone over the average holding period of the award.
For the 2011 Equity Compensation Plan the fair value of an award is calculated using the market value of the shares on the date of grant.
The fair value charges, adjusted to reflect actual levels of vesting, are spread over the performance period and the three-year vesting period of the awards.
The award is structured as a nil-cost option.

Interests in structured entities Structured entities are those entities that have been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who has control, such as when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only, or when the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements.
The Groups interests in consolidated and unconsolidated structured entities are described below.
The Group has interests in structured entities as a result of contractual arrangements arising from its principal activity, the management of assets on behalf of its clients.
AUM, excluding deposits by Wealth Management clients and some segregated client portfolios held within the Institutional channel of the Groups Asset Management business, are managed within structured entities.
These structured entities typically consist of investment vehicles such as Open Ended Investment Companies, Authorised Unit Trusts, Limited Partnerships and Socits dInvestissement Capital Variable, which entitle investors to a percentage of the vehicles net asset value.
The vehicles are financed by the purchase of units or shares by investors.
The Group also has interests in structured entities through proprietary investments.
These are mainly into vehicles that help facilitate the Groups stated aim of generating a return on investment capital and when it deploys seed and co-investment capital in developing new investment strategies.
The Group does not have any contractual relationships with, or interests in, structured entities related to AUA.
Additionally, the Group holds interests in structured entities for liquidity management purposes, for example via investments in money market funds.
The Group does not guarantee returns on the investments it manages or commit to financially support its structured entities.
A small proportion of the Groups AUM, principally real estate funds, are permitted to raise finance through loans from banks and other financial institutions.
Where external finance is raised, the Group does not provide a guarantee for the repayment of any borrowings.
The business activity of all structured entities in which the Group has an interest, is the management of assets in order to generate investment returns for investors from capital appreciation and or investment income.
The Group earns a management fee from its structured entities, normally based on a percentage of the entitys net asset value, committed capital value or gross asset value and, where contractually agreed, a performance fee or carried interest, based on outperformance against predetermined benchmarks.
In addition, where the Group owns a proportion of the structured entity it is entitled to receive investment returns.
a Interests arising from managing assets The Groups interests in structured entities arising as a result of contractual relationships from its principal activity, the management of assets on behalf of its clients, are reflected in the Groups AUM.

Within Asset Management, this occurs either because it is formed of segregated investment portfolios for Institutional clients comprising directly-held investments in individual financial instruments, or because the voting structures of the vehicles themselves allow the investment manager to be removed without cause.
Within Wealth Management, AUM is not considered to be within structured entities due to contractual relationships existing with clients rather than structured entities, for example discretionary and advisory asset management and banking services.
In addition, Wealth Management AUM in the form of loans and advances to customers is conducted outside of structured entities.
Certain structured entities are deemed to be controlled by the Group and are accounted for as subsidiaries and consolidated in accordance with IFRS 10.
AUM within consolidated structured entities represents the net assets of the beneficial interest in the consolidated structured entity owned by third parties.
AUM within unconsolidated structured entities constitutes the remaining balance, represented principally by the net asset value of pooled vehicles managed for Intermediary clients, as well as some assets invested in pooled vehicles on behalf of Institutional and Wealth Management clients.
The Groups beneficial interest in structured entities is not included within AUM and is described separately overleaf.
The Group has no direct exposure to losses in relation to the AUM reported above, as the investment risk is borne by clients.
The main risk the Group faces from its interest in AUM managed on behalf of clients is the loss of fee income as a result of the withdrawal of funds by clients.
Outflows from funds are dependent on market sentiment, asset performance and investor considerations.

Cash and cash equivalents comprise investments in money market funds, of which 3.0 million 2017: 26.5 million is managed by the Group.
Financial assets comprise investments in pooled vehicles and legacy private equity investments and include seed and co-investment capital and hedges of deferred cash awards.
Of the financial assets, 574.2 million 2017: 583.6 million is invested in funds managed by the Group.
The Group has no interest apart from its role as investor in those funds for which it does not act as manager.
The main risk the Group faces from its interests in unconsolidated structured entities arising from proprietary investments is that the investments will decrease in value.
Note 19 includes further information on the Groups exposure to market risk arising from proprietary investments.
Following the Groups acquisition of Adveq Holding AG in 2017, the Group has a contractual obligation to provide 1% 2017: 1% of committed capital to certain structured entities of the acquired business.

The Groups statement of financial position also includes the Life Company assets of 11,255.9 million 2017: 13,986.4 million, which are included in the AUM information presented on page 24.
The exposure to the risks and rewards associated with these assets is borne by unit-linked policyholders, or, where Life Company funds are consolidated, third-party investors in those funds.
Financial support for consolidated structured entities where there is no contractual obligation to do so The Group supports some of its funds through the injection of seed capital in order to enable the funds to establish a track record before they are more widely marketed.
During the year, the Group purchased units at a cost of 173.0 million 2017: 189.4 million to provide seed capital toinvestment funds managed by the Group, of which 112.6 million 2017: 162.2 million resulted in the consolidation of those funds, and 60.4million 2017: 27.2 million did not.
146 Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial statements 28. Business combinations The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations.
The consideration for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and any equity interests issued by the Group.
The consideration includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from contingent or deferred consideration arrangements.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
The Group recognises any non-controlling interest NCI in the acquiree on an  basis, either at fair value or at the NCI proportionate share of the recognised amounts of the acquirees identifiable net assets.
The Group completed six business combinations during the year.
The most significant of these transactions completed on 2 May 2018 when the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Algonquin Management Partners S. A. Algonquin, a specialist pan-European hotels investments and management business, for a total consideration of 118.5 million.
The acquisition contributed 1.6 billion of Asset Management AUM and strengthens the Groups real estate capabilities.
On 28 February 2018, the Group increased its interest in NEOS Finance Group B. V. NEOS from 25% to 49% of issued share capital for a cash consideration of 4.7 million which, combined with the fair value of the Groups holding, resulted in the fair value consideration of 9.5 million.
NEOS was previously held as an associate but the Group has determined that it is now a subsidiary.
The Group completed four other business combinations during the year for a combined consideration of 5.1 million.
Net assets acquired The fair values of the net assets acquired in the transactions together with the goodwill and intangible assets arising are as follows: Algonquin NEOS Other Total Net assets acquired: m m m m Cash 1.4 1.8 0.7 3.9 Financial assets 23.6 23.6 Trade and other receivables 19.9 19.9 Other assets 0.2 1.5 1.4 3.1 Trade and other payables 4.3 0.4 4.7 Other liabilities 2.6 6.8 9.4 Tangible net assets 40.8 0.3 4.7 36.4 Goodwill 61.4 9.4 70.8 Intangible assets arising on acquisition 20.1 4.8 24.9 Deferred tax arising on acquisition 3.8 3.8 Non-controlling interest 0.2 5.0 4.8 Total 118.5 9.5 5.1 133.1 Algonquin NEOS Other Total Satisfied by: m m m m Cash 94.7 4.7 3.6 103.0 1 Contingent consideration 23.8 23.8 Deferred consideration 1.5 1.5 Fair value of Groups pre-existing 25% interest 4.8 4.8 Total 118.5 9.5 5.1 133.1 1.
Contingent consideration of 23.8 million is payable under the terms of the share purchase agreement for Algonquin.
This amount is contingent upon the receipt of future revenues over a three year period post acquisition.
The estimated range of amounts that will ultimately be payable is between 14.4 million and 27.8 million.
Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2018 147 Financial statements continued Notes to the accounts continued 28. Business combinations continued Algonquin Goodwill arising on the acquisition of Algonquin represents the value of the acquired business arising from: A broader platform for business growth: Talented management and employees: and Opportunities for synergies from combining certain activities.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of Algonquin will not be deductible for tax purposes.
In the period between the acquisition date on 2 May 2018 and 31 December 2018, Algonquin contributed 8.3 million to the Groups net income.
Thecontribution to profit before tax and exceptional items was 4.4 million and exceptional costs of 2.1 million were incurred mainly in respect of amortisation of the acquired intangible assets.
Additionally, acquisition costs of 3.1 million were recorded within Operating expenses and classified as exceptional in the Consolidated income statement.
If the acquisition had been completed on 1 January 2018, the Groups pre-exceptional net income for the year would have been 2,128.1 million, and the profit before tax and exceptional items for the year on the same basis would have been 763.4 million.
NEOS The goodwill arising on the acquisition is attributable to the value of the additional investment capabilities acquired.
The 0.2 million of non-controlling interest recognised at the acquisition date was determined as a proportion of the identifiable net assets at the date of acquisition attributable to third parties.
At 28 February 2018, the fair value of the 25% equity interest in NEOS was 4.8 million.
As a result of remeasuring the equity interest to fair value at the acquisition date, a gain of 1.5 million was recognised through net gain on financial instruments and other income in the Groups income statement.
Estimates and judgements The fair value of certain items of consideration, assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires some estimation.
For contingent consideration payable on the acquisition of Algonquin, this estimation required assumptions regarding the level of management fees that will be earned over the relevant period and carried interest revenue that will be generated.
Certain assets acquired, including intangible assets arising on acquisition, as well as liabilities assumed also required some estimation.
Thekey assumptions included those in respect of management fees earned over the relevant period and carried interest revenue as set outabove.
The net impact of changes to these assumptions would be to change the carrying value of individual assets and liabilities with a corresponding change to goodwill.
The reasonable range of potential outcomes of contingent consideration undiscounted is between 14.4million and 27.8 million, compared with the Groups estimate of the amount payable of 23.8 million.

Financial instrument risk management The Companys policy is to have adequate capital for all activities undertaken in the normal course of business.
In particular, it should have adequate capital to maintain sufficient liquid funds to meet peak working capital requirements.
Generally, surplus capital is loaned back to theGroups investment capital management entities.
The risk management processes of the Company are aligned with those of the Group as a whole.
Details of the Groups risk management processes are outlined in the Key risks and mitigations section within the Strategic report and the Risk and internal controls section within theAudit and Risk Committee report as well as in note 19.
The Companys specific risk exposures are explained below.
Credit risk The Company has exposure to credit risk from its normal activities where the risk is that a counterparty will be unable to pay in full amounts when due.
The Companys counterparties are predominantly its subsidiaries and therefore there is minimal external credit risk exposure.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company cannot meet its obligations as they fall due or can only do so at a cost.
The Groups liquidity policy is tomaintain sufficient liquidity to cover any cash flow funding, meet all obligations as they fall due and maintain solvency.
The Company holds sufficient liquid funds to cover its needs in the normal course of business.
The Company can recall intercompany loans to subsidiaries or utilise the Group loan facility to maintain sufficient liquidity.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
At 31 December 2018, if interest rates had been 100 bps higher 2017: 50 bps higher or 50 bps lower 2017: 50 bps lower with all other variables held constant, the Company estimates that post-tax profit for the year would have increased by 11.0 million 2017: increased by 5.2million ordecreased by 5.5 million 2017: decreased by 5.2 million respectively.
These changes are mainly as a result of net interest income on the Companys interest-bearing intercompany receivables and payables and cash.
Other components of equity are not directly affected by interest rate movements.
The model used to calculate the effect on post-tax profits does not take into account the indirect effect of interest rates on the fair value of other assets and liabilities.
Foreign exchange and pricing risk Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
Pricing risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
The Company is not directly exposed to foreign exchange or pricing risk.
The Companys investments in its directly-held subsidiaries are in sterling and are held at historic cost.
It has indirect exposure to foreign exchange and pricing risk in the Group, which could result in the impairment of these subsidiaries.
There are currently sufficient resources in subsidiaries to absorb any normal market events.
Own shares Movements in own shares during the year were as follows: 2018 2017 m m At 1 January 150.0 148.9 Own shares purchased 66.7 53.7 Own shares cancelled 5.4 Awards vested 70.6 47.2 At 31 December 146.1 150.0 During the year 2.1 million own shares 2017: 1.7 million own shares were purchased and held for hedging share-based awards.
