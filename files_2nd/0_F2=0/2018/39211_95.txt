Details of the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values of the financial assets in the above table, along with how reasonably possible changes to the assumptions affect these fair values, are provided in note 32 to the consolidated financial statements.
The fair values of the companys financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from their carrying values, with the exception of equity investments in subsidiaries, which are carried at historical cost note 46.
55 Capital management The companys objectives when managing capital are to: safeguard the companys ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders: and maintain a strong capital base to support the development of its business.
For monitoring purposes, the company defines capital as distributable reserves see note 45.
The company monitors the level of distributable reserves on a monthly basis and compares this to forecast dividends.
Capital is distributed to the company from operating subsidiaries on a timely basis to ensure sufficient capital is maintained.
The board of directors considers the level of capital held in relation to forecast performance, dividend payments and wider plans for the business, although formal quantitative targets are not set.
There were no changes in the companys approach to capital management during the year.
