Accounting judgement The Groups tax affairs are governed by complex domestic tax legislations, international tax treaties between countries and the interpretation of these by taxauthorities and courts.
Given the many uncertainties that could arise from these factors, judgement is often required in determining the tax that is due.
Where management is aware of potential uncertainties that are judged more likely than not to result in a liability for additional tax, a provision is made for managements best estimate of the liability, determined with reference to similar transactions and, in some cases, reports from independent experts.
