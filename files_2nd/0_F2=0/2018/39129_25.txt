ii The 2017 comparative results have been re-presented from those previously published for the deduction of certain expenses against revenue following the adoption of IFRS 15.
iii This measure is the formal profit before tax measure under IFRS but it is not the result attributable to shareholders.
This is principally because the corporate taxes of the Group include those on the income of consolidated with-profits and unit-linked funds that, through adjustments to benefits, are borne by policyholders.
These amounts are required to be included in the tax charge of the Company under IAS 12.
Consequently, the profit before all taxes measure is not representative of pre-tax profits attributable to shareholders.
Profit before all taxes is determined after deducting the cost of policyholder benefits and movements in the liability for unallocated surplus of with-profits funds after adjusting for taxes borne by policyholders.
