Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1.
Accounting policies, estimates and judgements Accounting policies Morgan Advanced Materials plc the Company is a company incorporated in the UK under The Companies Act.
The address of the registered office is given in Shareholder information on page 158.
The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries and the nature of the Groups operations are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 4 to 41.
The Groups financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group, and include the Groups interest in associates.
The Parent Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
These consolidated financial statements have been drawn up to 31 December 2018.
The Group maintains a 12-month calendar fiscal year ending on 31 December.
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU adopted IFRSs.
The Company has elected to prepare its Parent Company financial statements in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework: these are presented on pages 137 to 153.
Where possible the Group has set out individual accounting policies in the note to the consolidated financial statements most relevant to that accounting policy, including for property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and specific adjusting items.
Except for the changes set out in the Adoption of new and revised Standards section, the accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Group financial statements.
a Measurement convention The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value: derivative financial instruments and financial instruments designated as fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI.
b Functional and presentation currency The Groups financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the Companys functional currency.
c Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases.
ii Acquisitions Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
The Group measures goodwill as the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred, including the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, less the net of the acquisition-date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent liabilities as required by IFRS 3.
Consideration transferred includes the fair values of assets transferred, liabilities incurred by the Group to the previous owners of the acquiree, equity interests issued by the Group, contingent consideration, and share-based payment awards of the acquiree that are replaced in the business combination.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration that is not classified as equity is recognised in the income statement.
Transaction costs that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination, such as finders fees, legal fees, due diligence fees and other professional and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.
iii Associates Associates are those entities in which the Company has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity.
Associates are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognised at cost.
iv Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Groups interest in the associate.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
d Foreign currency i Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to pounds sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Nonmonetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated to pounds sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
Annual Report 2018 Morgan Advanced Materials 89 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1.
Accounting policies, estimates and judgements continued ii Financial statements of foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to pounds sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues, expenses and cash flows of foreign operations are translated to pounds sterling at an average rate for the period where this approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation since the adoption of IFRS are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
e Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated see i below.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cashgenerating units group of units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other intangibles and other assets in the unit group of units on a pro-rata basis.
i Calculation of recoverable amount The recoverable amount of the Groups investments in receivables carried at amortised cost is calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate ie the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition of these financial assets.
Receivables with a short duration are not discounted.
The recoverable amount of other assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
ii Reversals of impairment An impairment loss in respect of a receivable carried at amortised cost and other assets not listed below is reversed if the subsequent increase in recoverable amount can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.
An impairment loss in respect of an investment in an equity instrument classified as FVOCI is not reversed through profit or loss.
If the fair value of a debt instrument classified as FVOCI increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in profit or loss, the impairment loss will be reversed, with the amount of the reversal recognised in profit or loss.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
f Revenue IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers requires revenue to be disaggregated into categories that depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.
The Group discloses revenue disaggregated by geography, end market and by global business unit, which are aligned by product type, in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.
Revenue is recognised when or as the Group satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to a customer.
The Groups principal performance obligation is the provision of products and components, is satisfied at a point in time and subject to standard payment terms.
Products and components are transferred when the customer obtains control of the goods.
For goods that are collected by the customer, revenue is recognised at the point the customer has taken physical possession of the goods.
For contracts that include delivery of goods, the delivery element of the contract constitutes a separate performance obligation because it is distinct.
For these contracts, control of the goods does not transfer to the customer until the goods have been delivered and therefore both performance obligations are satisfied simultaneously.
Revenue for these contracts is therefore recognised on delivery.
Substantially all of the Groups revenue is derived from short-term contracts for the provision of products and components.
A smaller portion of the Groups revenue relates to project-based business, principally within the Thermal Ceramics global business unit.
Revenue for these contracts is recognised in line with fulfilment of contractual performance obligations stated in the contract and is not significant: consequently except for trade receivables the Group does not have significant assets or liabilities relating to its contracts with customers.
At 31 December, balances relating to revenue from contracts with customers were: 2018 2017 m m Current Trade receivables note 16 177.8 174.9 Contract assets 3.2 1.0 Contract liabilities 6.6 5.7 90 Morgan Advanced Materials Annual Report 2018 Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 1.
Accounting policies, estimates and judgements continued Contract assets included within other trade receivables relate to the Groups right to consideration for project-based business which was completed but not billed at the end of the year.
Contract liabilities included within other trade payables relate to payments received from customers for project-based business in advance of the performance obligation being satisfied.
All of the 5.7 million was recognised as revenue in 2018.
As set out in note 27, the application of IFRS 15 has not had a material impact on the amount or timing of revenue recognised by the Group.
Revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur.
The transaction price is determined as the amount receivable for the provision of products and component excluding rebates, discounts and similar items.
Determining the transaction price does not require significant judgement.
The costs incurred in obtaining contracts are not material.
The Group acts as a principal in its transactions with customers.
In 2018, there were no material adjustments to revenue which related to performance obligations satisfied in the previous year.
g Dividends Dividends payable are recognised as a liability in the Companys financial statements in the period in which the dividends are declared and approved.
Dividends declared after the balance sheet date are not recognised as there is no present obligation at the balance sheet date.
h Research and development Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes, is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development, use and sale of products or processes.
The majority of the expenditure that the Group classifies as research and development relates to a gradual evolution of materials, products and processes over time through the activities of the Groups technology and application engineering teams, and can be characterised as incremental in nature, and is therefore not capitalised.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Use of judgements and estimates In preparing these consolidated financial statements, management has made judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the Groups accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Judgements Information about judgements made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effects on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements is included in the following notes: Note 6: Specific adjusting items The Group separately presents specific adjusting items in the consolidated income statement which, in the Directors judgement, need to be disclosed separately by virtue of their size and incidence in order for users of the consolidated financial statements to obtain a proper understanding of the financial information and the underlying performance of the business.
These items which occur infrequently and include but are not limited to : Individual restructuring projects which are material or relate to the closure of a part of the business and are not expected to recur.
Gains or losses on disposal of businesses.
Significant costs incurred as part of the integration of an acquired business.
Gains or losses arising on significant changes to or closures of defined benefit pension plans.
Determining whether an item is part of specific adjusting items requires judgement to determine the nature and the intention of the transaction.
Note 14: Recognition of deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets are recognised when management judges it probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Note 23: Provisions and contingent liabilities Due to the nature of its operations, the Group holds provisions for its environmental obligations.
Judgement is needed in determining whether a contingent liability has crystallised into a provision.
Management assesses whether there is sufficient information to determine that an environmental liability exists and whether it is possible to estimate with sufficient reliability what the cost of remediation is likely to be.
For environmental remediation matters, this tends to be at the point in time when a remediation feasibility study has been completed.
The Group will recognise a legal provision at the point when the outcome of a legal matter can be reliably estimated.
Estimates are based on past experience of similar issues, professional advice received and the Groups assessment of the most likely outcome.
The timing of utilisation of these provisions is frequently uncertain, reflecting the complexity of issues and the outcome of various court proceedings and associated negotiations.
Annual Report 2018 Morgan Advanced Materials 91 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1.
Accounting policies, estimates and judgements continued Assumptions and estimates Assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the year ending 31 December 2019 is included in the following notes: Note 22: Employee benefits: key actuarial assumptions The principal actuarial assumptions applied to pensions are shown in note 22, including a sensitivity analysis.
The actuarial evaluation of pension assets and liabilities is based on assumptions in respect of inflation, future salary increases, discount rates, returns on investments and mortality rates.
Relatively small changes in the assumptions underlying the actuarial valuations of pension schemes can have a significant impact on the net pension liability included in the balance sheet.
In addition, in the current year based on the results of a High Court hearing, the Group has recognised a liability in relation to Guaranteed Minimum Pensions GMPs, which is an initiative to remove inequalities in scheme benefits that arise from GMPs being unequal between men and women.
Legal uncertainty remains in this area.
Further details are included in note 6.
Note 23: Provisions and contingent liabilities Provisions for environmental costs and settlement of litigation are estimated based on current legal and constructive requirements.
Actual costs and cash outflows can differ from current estimates because of changes in laws and regulations, public expectations, prices, more detailed analysis of site conditions and innovations in clean-up technology.
Closure and restructuring costs can be estimated with greater certainty and the carrying value of existing provisions at the balance sheet date is less likely to change materially within the next financial year.
Amounts provided are the Groups best estimate of exposure based on currently available information.
Other assumptions and estimates which have a lower risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next 12 months include: Notes 7 and 13: Taxation The level of current tax and deferred tax recognised is dependent on the tax rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and on subjective judgments as to the outcome of decisions to be made by the tax authorities in the various tax jurisdictions around the world in which the Group operates.
The Group periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years open to audit based on the latest information available.
The Group records its best estimate of these tax liabilities, including related interest charges.
Whilst management believes it has adequately provided for the probable outcome of these matters, future results may include adjustments to these estimated tax liabilities and the final outcome of tax examinations may result in a materially different outcome than that assumed in the tax liabilities.
Provisions are made against individual exposures taking into account the specific circumstances of each case, including the strengths of technical arguments, past experience with tax authorities, recent case law or rulings on similar issues and external advice received.
Note 12: Impairment of intangible assets and goodwill The Group tests annually whether goodwill and other intangibles have suffered any impairment.
This process relies on the use of estimates of the future profitability and cash flows of its cash-generating units which may differ from the actual results delivered.
In addition, the Group reviews whether identified intangible assets have suffered any impairment.
Note 12 contains information about the assumptions relating to goodwill impairment tests, including a sensitivity analysis.
Note 21: Credit risk Note 21 contains information about the Groups exposure to credit risk, including a sensitivity analysis.
The Group establishes allowances for impairment losses against receivables.
The allowance represents its estimate of expected credit losses.
Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 4 to 41.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities, are described earlier in the Financial Review.
In addition, note 21 includes the Groups policies and processes for managing financial risk: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
92 Morgan Advanced Materials Annual Report 2018 Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 1.
Accounting policies, estimates and judgements continued The Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through local banking arrangements underpinned by the Groups 200 million unsecured multi-currency revolving credit facility maturing September 2023.
The Groups forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance and exchange rates, show the Group operating within its debt financial covenants for the next 18 months.
As described in the viability statement, the Group has continued to assess the potential impact of market volatility as a result of uncertainties caused by the ongoing Brexit negotiations.
It has considered its risk in relation to fluctuations such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and market prices and the impact this might have both on the Groups results and on the balance sheet value of financial instruments measured at fair value and discount rates used in measuring pension and other liabilities.
The risks and uncertainties around economic climate may have an impact on the Group, its customers and suppliers, as described in Risk management on page 19.
The Board fully recognises the challenges that lie ahead but, after making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.
Non-GAAP measures Where non-GAAP measures have been referenced these have been identified by an asterisk where they appear in text, and by a footnote where they appear in tables throughout this Report.
Further details can be found on pages 31 to 33, Alternative Performance Measures.
Adoption of new and revised Standards The Group adopted the following standards and with effect from 1 January 2018: IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
The standard introduced a new revenue recognition model which requires the transaction price receivable from customers to be allocated between the Groups performance obligations under contracts on a relative stand-alone selling price basis.
The Group has opted to apply the full retrospective method under which comparative information is restated.
The impact of the restatement is set out in note 27 to the financial statements: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: and IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Considerations.
There has been no material impact on the Group on adoption of these standards.
There were no other new accounting standards or amendments to standards that were required to be adopted in the period and the Group did not adopt any of the new accounting standards that could have been adopted early.
New standards and interpretations A number of new Standards, amendments to Standards and interpretations have been issued but are not yet effective, and have not been applied in preparing the Groups financial statements.
Those which may be relevant to the Group are set out below.
The Group has not adopted these Standards early.
IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments the standard is effective for annual reporting periods on or after 1 January 2019, and will clarify the accounting for uncertainties in income taxes.
The interpretation is to be applied to the determination of taxable profit tax loss, tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates, when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments under IAS 12.
We anticipate limited impact to the Group.
IFRS 16 Leases is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and introduces a single, on-balance sheet accounting model that is similar to current finance lease accounting.
Under the new standard, a lessee is required to recognise all lease assets and liabilities including those currently classified as operating leases on the balance sheet at the present value of the lease payments and a depreciation charge on the leased assets and an interest charge on the lease liabilities in the income statement.
For its material land and buildings leases, Morgan has adopted a modified retrospective approach which calculates the asset value using historical payment data as if IFRS 16 had always existed, but uses future lease payments only when calculating the lease liability, current discount rates and the benefit of hindsight for actual events.
This calculation leads to an equity adjustment.
For its remaining lease portfolio non-material land and buildings and plant and equipment, Morgan has used the alternative modified retrospective approach, calculating the lease liability based on future lease payments only and using current discount rates.
The asset is equal to the liability with the exception of any transition balance sheet adjustments such as rent free periods.
This calculation does not give rise to an equity adjustment.
Morgan has opted to grandfather assessments on whether a contract contains a lease and has applied the practical expedients which are available under these modified retrospective approaches, namely excluding leases with short remaining terms and excluding low value leases.
The Group has completed its evaluations of the impact of IFRS 16 on the financial statements and performance measures.
Upon adoption of IFRS 16, at 1 January 2019, the most significant impact will be the present value of the operating lease commitments currently disclosed in note 24 being shown as a liability of 67 million on the balance sheet together with an asset of 51 million representing the right of use.
At 1 January 2019, an equity adjustment before taxation of 16 million will be recognised as a result of the accounting method applied for material land and building leases.
It is anticipated that the depreciation and interest charge of the leases transitioned on 1 January 2019 will be around 9 million and 3 million respectively.

Disposals 2018 Composites and Defence Systems: On 23 April 2018 the Group announced that the Board had decided to exit the Composite and Defence Systems business.
The exit was intended to take the form of the divestment of certain product lines, should a suitable acquirer be found, together with the closure of the remainder of the business lines.
On 20 November 2018, the Group announced the sale of its Composites and Defence Systems business with its principle site in Coventry, UK.
The transaction was structured as a share sale on a debt-free and cash-free basis, for a total consideration of 2.5 million, of which 2.0 million was received on completion and 0.5 million was received on 21 January 2019, with a closing cash adjustment also received of 0.2 million.
The transaction has been structured to leave Morgan with the economic benefit of certain assets, most notably the principal freehold property associated with the business, as well as certain liabilities relating to the exit of parts of the business.
These liabilities were provided for in the interim results for the six months ended 30 June 2018.
In the year ended 31 December 2017, the Composite and Defence Systems business generated a 1.0 million headline operating loss on 21.0 million of revenue.
The disposal and closure of the Composites and Defence Systems business reduced the Groups assets and liabilities as follows: 31 December 2018 m Trading net assets of disposal group 4.2 Transaction costs associated with the business exit and disposal 7.6 Recycling of deferred foreign exchange losses 0.2 Total consideration 2.7 Loss on disposal 9.3 The disposal group formed the Composites and Defence Systems operating segment.
It has therefore been classified as a discontinued operation under IFRS 5.
Further detail is disclosed in note 9.

Disposals continued 2017 Electro-ceramics: On 31 March 2017, the Group completed the sale of its UK Electro-ceramics business, comprising the two sites at Ruabon and Southampton.
The transaction was structured as a sale of the business, assets and goodwill for a consideration of 47 million on a cash-free, debt-free basis, paid in cash on completion and subject to customary working capital adjustments.
In the year ended 31 December 2016, UK Electro-ceramics generated an operating profit of 6.2 million on revenues of 22.7 million.
Gross assets at 31 December 2016 were 6.7 million.
The Group also announced the closure of its US Electro-ceramics business, which formed the remainder of the Groups Electro-ceramics business, costs associated with the closure of the site have been provided for in the year, and are included in Transactions costs associated with disposal in the table below.
This latter site will be closed when delivery of the last time orders from customers have been completed, currently anticipated to be around the end of 2019.
The disposal and closure of the Electro-ceramics business reduced the Groups assets and liabilities as follows: 31 December 2017 m Trading net assets of disposal group 7.4 Goodwill of disposal group 5.8 Transaction costs associated with the disposal 6.9 Total consideration 46.9 Gain on disposal 26.8 The disposal group was included in the Technical Ceramics operating segment.
Global Rotary Transfer Systems Business: On 31 March 2017, the Group completed the sale of its global Rotary Transfer Systems.
The business is principally located at two manufacturing sites: Antweiler, Germany and Chalon, France.
The sale valued the business at 40.0 million on a cash-free, debt-free basis, with consideration paid in cash on completion, subject to customary closing working capital adjustments.
In the year to 31 December 2016, the Rotary Transfer Systems business generated 3.2 million of operating profit on 15.5 million of revenue.
Gross assets at 31 December 2016 were 5.9 million.
The disposal and closure of the Rotary Transfer Systems business reduced the Groups assets and liabilities as follows: 31 December 2017 m Trading net assets of disposal group 3.5 Goodwill of disposal group 7.1 Transaction costs associated with the disposal 3.1 Total consideration 32.6 Gain on disposal 18.9 The disposal group was included in the Electrical Carbon operating segment.

Segment reporting Accounting policies The Group reports as two Divisions and five 2017: five global business units, which have been identified as the Groups reportable operating segments, as detailed on page 2.
These have been identified on the basis of internal management reporting information that is regularly reviewed by the Groups Board of Directors the Chief Operating Decision Maker in order to allocate resources and assess performance.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Unallocated items comprise mainly investments and related income, loans and borrowings and related expenses, corporate assets and head office expenses, and income tax assets and liabilities.
The results for 2017 have been restated for discontinued operations note 9 and IFRS 15 note 27.
The information presented below represents the operating segments of the Group.
Definitions of these non-GAAP measures, and their reconciliation to the relevant GAAP measure, are provided on pages 31 to 33.
Details of specific adjusting items are given in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.
Segment assets, liabilities, capital expenditure and depreciation attributed to discontinued operations in 2017 were 9.8 million, 5.1 million, 0.7 million and 0.6 million respectively.

Specific adjusting items Accounting policies In the consolidated income statement the Group presents specific adjusting items separately.
In the judgement of the Directors, due to the nature and value of these items they should be disclosed separately from the underlying results of the Group to allow the reader to obtain a proper understanding of the financial information and the best indication of underlying performance of the Group.
2018 2017 Continuing operations m m Specific adjusting items: Net pension past service credit 5.7 Business closure and exit costs 15.2 Net profit on disposal of businesses 45.7 Total specific adjusting items before income tax 9.5 45.7 Income tax charge credit from specific adjusting items 1.7 0.9 Income tax credit resulting from US tax reform rate change and mandatory repatriation charge 4.1 Total specific adjusting items after income tax 11.2 50.7 Specific adjusting items in relation to discontinued operations are disclosed in note 9.
2018 Net pension past service credit, UK Early and late retirement adjustment During 2018, the Group reviewed with the Trustees of Morgan Pension Scheme the factors applied on early and late retirement, and clarified the practice regarding the calculation of pension payments with members who elected to retire other than at the normal date of retirement.
This was effected via a Deed of Amendment.
This change resulted in a net gain of 7.6 million in the income statement.
Adjustment for Guaranteed Minimum Pensions GMPs On 26 October 2018, the High Court ruled that the Trustee of the Lloyds Banking Group pension schemes needed to remove the inequalities in pension scheme benefits that arise from unequal GMPs.
We have included a charge of 1.9 million to reflect the potential cost of removing the GMP inequalities for the Groups UK defined benefit pension schemes.
The net impact of these pension adjustments is a credit to the income statement of 5.7 million.

Taxation income tax expense Accounting policies Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised in other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

Discontinued operations Accounting policies Where the Group has disposed of or intends to dispose of a business component which represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, it classifies such operations as discontinued.
The post-tax profit or loss of the discontinued operations is shown as a single line on the face of the consolidated income statement, separate from the results of the rest of the Group.
The Group disposed of its Composites and Defence Systems business on 20 November 2018.
The business represented a separate reporting segment and therefore, in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held For Sale and Discontinued Operations, the disposal group has been classified as discontinued and the prior period has been restated to reflect this.
The results from discontinued operations, which have been disclosed in the consolidated income statement, are set out below: Year ended 31 December 2018 Year ended 31 December 2017 Results Results before before specific Specific specific Specific adjusting adjusting adjusting adjusting items items Total items items Total Note m m m m m m Revenue 11.2 11.2 21.0 21.0 Operating costs before restructuring costs and other items 12.6 12.6 22.0 22.0 Loss from operations before restructuring costs and other items 1.4 1.4 1.0 1.0 Net loss on disposal of business 2 1.7 1.7 Business closure and exit costs 2 7.6 7.6 Loss before taxation 1.4 9.3 10.7 1.0 1.0 Income tax expense Loss from discontinued operations 1.4 9.3 10.7 1.0 1.0 Basic loss per share from discontinued operations 3.8 p 0.4 p Diluted loss per share from discontinued operations 3.7 p 0.3 p The discontinued specific adjusting items relate to the loss on disposal of assets and provisions for business exit costs.
There is no income tax expense in relation to the discontinued operations in either the current or preceding year.
Earnings per share The calculation of basic diluted earnings per share from continuing and discontinued operations at 31 December 2018 was based on the net profit attributable to equity shareholders of 46.3 million 2017: 107.6 million, 2016: 52.3 million, and a weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year of 285.2 million 2017: 285.0 million, 2016: 284.9 million.
The calculation of the weighted average number of shares excludes the shares held by The Morgan General Employee Benefit Trust, on which the dividends are waived.
Headline earnings per Ordinary share is defined as operating profit from continuing operations adjusted to exclude specific adjusting items and amortisation of intangible assets, plus share of profit of associate less net financing costs, income tax expense and non-controlling interests, divided by the weighted average number of Ordinary shares during the period.
This measure of earnings is shown because the Directors consider that it gives a better indication of headline performance.

Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
Gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of the asset.
Gains and losses on the disposal of property are recognised in Restructuring costs and other items in the income statement.
Gains and losses on the disposal of plant and equipment are recognised in Operating costs before restructuring costs, other items and amortisation of intangible assets in the income statement.
ii Leased assets Leases under the terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Leased assets acquired by way of a finance lease are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

Intangible assets Accounting policies i Goodwill All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is tested annually for impairment.
ii Research and development See note 1. iii Other intangible assets Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation see below and impairment losses.
iv Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite.
Goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date.
Other intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Capitalised development costs 3 years Computer software 3-10 years Customer relationships 15-20 years Technology and trademarks 15-20 years Intangible assets Technology Capitalised Customer and development Computer Goodwill relationships trademarks costs software Total m m m m m m Cost Balance at 1 January 2017 210.6 89.3 21.8 0.8 25.6 348.1 Additions externally purchased 5.3 5.3 Disposals 12.9 1.8 14.7 Effect of movement in foreign exchange 5.7 4.2 0.2 1.0 10.7 Balance at 31 December 2017 192.0 85.1 22.0 0.8 28.1 328.0 Balance at 1 January 2018 192.0 85.1 22.0 0.8 28.1 328.0 Additions externally purchased 1.3 1.3 Disposals 16.4 27.8 18.3 0.1 62.6 Effect of movement in foreign exchange 3.8 3.1 0.5 7.4 Balance at 31 December 2018 179.4 60.4 3.7 0.8 29.8 274.1 Amortisation and impairment losses Balance at 1 January 2017 16.4 57.6 18.4 0.8 14.5 107.7 Amortisation charge for the year 4.3 0.2 2.8 7.3 Disposals 1.6 1.6 Effects of movement in foreign exchange 2.0 0.4 2.4 Balance at 31 December 2017 16.4 59.9 18.6 0.8 15.3 111.0 Balance at 1 January 2018 16.4 59.9 18.6 0.8 15.3 111.0 Amortisation charge for the year 4.1 0.2 3.7 8.0 Disposals 16.4 27.8 18.3 0.1 62.6 Effects of movement in foreign exchange 1.9 0.2 2.1 Balance at 31 December 2018 38.1 0.5 0.8 19.1 58.5 Carrying amounts At 1 January 2017 194.2 31.7 3.4 11.1 240.4 At 31 December 2017 175.6 25.2 3.4 12.8 217.0 At 31 December 2018 179.4 22.3 3.2 10.7 215.6 Annual Report 2018 Morgan Advanced Materials 107 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 12.
Intangible assets continued Included in customer relationships is an asset with a net book value of 16.3 million at 31 December 2018 recognised in relation to the acquisition of the Technical Ceramics businesses of Carpenter Technology Corporation in 2008.
The remaining amortisation period on this asset is five years.
Impairment test for cash-generating units containing goodwill In accordance with the requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination that gave rise to the goodwill.
Goodwill is attributed to each cash-generating unit as follows: 2018 2017 m m Thermal Ceramics 87.2 85.4 Molten Metal Systems 9.3 9.1 Electrical Carbon 30.2 29.6 Seals and Bearings 15.3 15.0 Technical Ceramics 37.4 36.5 179.4 175.6 Each cash-generating unit is assessed for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication of impairment.
As part of the annual impairment test review the carrying value of goodwill has been assessed with reference to its value in use, reflecting the projected discounted cash flows of each cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated.
The key assumptions used in determining value in use relate to growth rates and discount rates.
The cash flow projections in year one are based on the most recent Board approved budget.
Cash flow projections for years two and three are based on the most recent Board approved strategic plan.
The key assumptions that underpin these cash flow projections relate to sales and operating margins, which are based on past experience, taking into account the effect of known or likely changes in market or operating conditions.
Growth rates for the period not covered by the budget and strategic plan 2022: 1.0%.
A 1.0% growth rate has been used to calculate a terminal value.
These growth rates reflect the products, industries and countries in which the operating segments operate.
These mediumto long-term growth rates have been reviewed by Management during 2018 and are considered to be appropriate.
In 2018, the Group has used the following pre-tax discount rates for calculating the terminal value of each of the cash-generating units: Thermal Ceramics: 11.9%, Molten Metal Systems: 11.8%, Electrical Carbon: 12.1%, Seals and Bearings: 11.9%, Technical Ceramics 12.2%.
The Directors have considered the following individual sensitivities and are confident that no impairment would arise for each of the Thermal Ceramics, Molten Metal Systems, Electrical Carbon, Seals and Bearings and Technical Ceramics cash-generating units in any one of the following three circumstances: If the pre-tax discount rate was increased to 15%.
If no growth was assumed for years two to five and in the calculation of terminal value.
If the cash flow projections of all businesses were reduced by 15.5%.

Investments Accounting policies Investments in debt and equity securities Investments in debt and equity securities held by the Group are classified as being as FVOCI and are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss being recognised directly in other comprehensive income in the fair value reserve, except for impairment losses and, in the case of monetary items such as debt securities, foreign exchange gains and losses.
When these investments are derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised directly in equity is recognised in profit or loss.
Where these investments are interest-bearing, interest calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in profit or loss.
2018 2017 m m Non-current investments FVOCI equity instrument 0.5 0.9 Investment in associates 5.4 5.4 5.9 6.3 FVOCI equity instrument The equity securities classified as FVOCI represent an investment in a mutual fund.
A 10% increase in the unit price would increase the fair value of the investments by nil 2017: nil.
Investment in associates The Group has no material associates in the current or preceding year.
Details of the Groups investment in its associate including name, country of incorporation and proportion of ownership are given in note 44 to the Companys separate financial statements.
The Groups share of profit from its associate for the year was 0.8 million 2017: 0.2 million.
The Group did not receive a dividend from its associate during the current or preceding year.

Capital and reserves Accounting policies i Ordinary share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
ii Preference share capital Preference share capital is classified as equity if it is non-redeemable and any dividends are discretionary, or is redeemable but only at the Companys option.
Dividends on Preference share capital classified as equity are recognised as distributions within equity.
iii Repurchase of share capital and own shares held by The Morgan General Employee Benefit Trust the Trust When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, which includes directly attributable costs, is net of any tax effects, and is recognised as a deduction from equity.
Repurchased shares and the purchase of own shares by the Trust are presented as a deduction from total equity.
Translation reserve The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations, as well as from the translation of liabilities that hedge the Companys net investment in a foreign subsidiary and forward contracts used for net investment hedging.
Hedging reserve The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred.
Fair value reserve The fair value reserve includes the cumulative net change in the fair value of FVOCI investments until the investment is derecognised.
Capital redemption reserve The capital redemption reserve arose when the Company redeemed Preference shares wholly out of distributable profits.
Retained earnings The Company has acquired own shares to satisfy the requirements of the various share option incentive schemes.
At 31 December 2018, 968,287 shares were held by The Morgan General Employee Benefit Trust and are treated as a deduction from equity 2017: 216,456.
No treasury shares were held by the Company 2017: none.
All rights conferred by those shares are suspended until they are reissued.

Voting rights of shareholders Ordinary shares The holders of Ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share at meetings of the Company.
Preference shares The 5.5% Cumulative First Preference shares of 1 each and the 5.0% Cumulative Second Preference shares of 1 each confer on the holders thereof the right to receive a cumulative preferential dividend at the rate of 5.5% and 5.0% respectively, calculated up to 30 June and 31 December respectively in every year.
The First and Second Cumulative Preference shares shall not entitle the holders thereof to attend or vote at any general meeting unless either: i the meeting is convened to consider any resolutions for reducing the capital, or authorising any issue of debentures or debenture stock, or increasing the borrowing powers of the Board under the Articles of Association of the Company, or winding up, or sanctioning a sale of the undertaking, or altering the Articles in any manner affecting their respective interests, or any other resolutions directly altering their respective rights and privileges: or ii at the date of the notice convening the general meeting the Preference dividend is upwards of one month in arrears from the payment date of any half-yearly instalment.
On a return of capital on a winding-up the assets of the Company available for distribution shall be applied: First, in payment to the holders of the First Preference shares of the amounts paid up on such shares, together with interest at the rate of 5.5% pa. Second, in payment to the holders of the Second Preference shares of the amounts paid up on such shares, together with interest at the rate of 5.0% pa. Third, in repaying the capital paid up or credited as paid up on the Ordinary shares.
Fourth, any surplus shall be distributed rateably amongst the holders of the Ordinary shares in proportion to the nominal amount paid up on their respective holdings of shares in the Company.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings This note provides information about the contractual terms of the Groups interest-bearing loans and borrowings which are measured at amortised cost.
For more information about the Groups exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk, see note 21.
Accounting policies Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interestbearing loans and borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Finance lease payments Leases where the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases as if the asset had been purchased outright.
Assets acquired under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group and the capital elements of the leasing commitments are shown as obligations in creditors.
Depreciation is charged on a basis consistent with similar owned assets or over the lease term if shorter.
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability.
The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Annual Report 2018 Morgan Advanced Materials 115 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 20.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings continued Borrowing facilities and liquidity All of the Groups borrowing facilities are arranged by Group Treasury with Morgan Advanced Materials plc as the principal obligor.
In a few cases operating subsidiaries have external borrowings but these are supervised and controlled centrally.
Group Treasury seeks to obtain certainty of access to funding in the amounts, diversity of maturities and diversity of counterparties as required to support the Groups medium-term financing requirements and to minimise the impact of poor credit market conditions.

On 27 December 2018, the Group completed a US private debt placement, raising 25 million for a 12 year tenor, to refinance existing financial indebtedness.
Financial risk management This note presents information about the Groups exposure to a variety of financial risks: credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, and the Groups management of capital.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
Accounting policies Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity ie forming part of shareholders funds only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions: i they include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group: and ii where the instrument will or may be settled in the Companys own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Companys own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
116 Morgan Advanced Materials Annual Report 2018 Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 21.
Financial risk management continued To the extent that this definition is not met the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability.
Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Companys own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called-up share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance expenses.
Finance payments associated with financial instruments that are classified in equity are dividends and are recorded directly in equity.
Financial risk management and Treasury Policy Group Treasury works within a framework of policies and procedures approved by the Audit Committee.
It acts as a service centre for Morgan Advanced Materials businesses, not as a profit centre, and manages and controls risk in the treasury environment through the establishment of such procedures.
Group Treasury seeks to align treasury goals, objectives and philosophy to those of the Group.
It is responsible for all of the Groups funding, liquidity, cash management, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and other treasury business.
As part of the policies and procedures, there is strict control over the use of financial instruments to hedge foreign currencies and interest rates.
Speculative trading in derivatives and other financial instruments is not permitted.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
The Group is exposed to credit risk on financial instruments such as liquid assets, derivative assets and trade receivables.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was: Carrying amount 1 Restated 1 2018 2017 m m FVOCI equity instruments 0.5 0.9 Trade and other receivables 177.8 174.9 Cash and cash equivalents 67.6 50.4 Derivatives 0.6 1.0 246.5 227.2 1.
FVOCI equity instruments The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by only investing in liquid securities and only with counterparties that have a sound credit rating.
Given these high credit ratings, management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
Trade and other receivables The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The demographics of the Groups customer base, including the default risk of the industries and countries in which customers operate, has less influence on credit risk.
Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
Credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit over a certain amount.
The Group does not require collateral in respect of financial assets.
The Group serves thousands of customers.
Many of these have purchased the same product for several years and in some cases decades.
Others have modified and enhanced designs or adopted the same components into new products, extending the lifecycle of the components that the Group supplies.
The Groups level of customer retention is very high, particularly with its major accounts, and, although the top 20 ranking will alter from year to year, many of the names remain consistent over time.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of expected credit losses in respect of trade and other receivables and investments.
Annual Report 2018 Morgan Advanced Materials 117 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 21.
The allowances in the accounts in respect of trade receivables are used to record impairment losses unless the Group is satisfied that no recovery of the amount owing is possible: at the point the amount is considered irrecoverable it is written off against the financial asset directly.
Cash, cash equivalents and derivatives Cash balances held by companies representing over 75% of the Groups revenue are managed centrally through a number of pooling arrangements.
Credit risk is managed by investing liquid assets and acquiring derivatives in a diversified way from high-credit-quality financial institutions.
Counterparties are reviewed through the use of rating agencies, systemic risk considerations and through regular review of the financial press.
Liquidity and funding risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by cash.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions.
The Group seeks a balance between certainty of funding and a flexible, cost-effective borrowing structure.
The policy is to ensure that the Group has sufficient borrowings and committed facilities to meet its medium-term financing requirements.

The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
The Group buys and sells derivatives in the ordinary course of business for hedging purposes, and also incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage market risks.
All such transactions are carried out in accordance with the Treasury Policy, which has been approved by the Audit Committee.
Generally the Group seeks to apply hedge accounting in order to manage volatility in profit or loss.
Interest rate risk The Group seeks to reduce the volatility in its interest charge caused by rate fluctuations.
This is achieved through a combination of fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps.
The proportions of fixed and floating rate debt are determined having regard to a number of factors, including prevailing market conditions, interest rate cycle, the Groups interest cover and leverage position and any perceived correlation between business performance and rates.
Annual Report 2018 Morgan Advanced Materials 119 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 21.
Financial risk management continued At the reporting date the interest rate profile of the Groups interest-bearing financial instruments was: Fixed rate instruments Variable rate instruments carrying amount carrying amount 2018 2017 2018 2017 m m m m Financial assets 67.6 50.4 Financial liabilities 223.9 193.2 23.7 38.5 223.9 193.2 43.9 11.9 The fixed rate financial liabilities predominantly comprise the currency equivalent of 223.7 million 2017: 192.3 million of Senior Notes.
The average cost of the Groups fixed rate instruments is 3.60% 2017: 3.67%.
An increase of 100 basis points in interest rates on the variable element of the Groups net debt at the reporting date would have increased profit by 0.5 million 2017: 0.3 million.
A decrease of 100 basis points would have decreased profit by 0.3 million 2017: decrease 0.2 million.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.
Foreign currency risk Due to the international reach of the Group, currency transaction exposures exist.
The Group has a policy in place to hedge all material firm commitments and a large proportion of highly probable forecast foreign currency exposures in respect of sales and purchases over the following 12 months, and achieves this through the use of the forward foreign exchange markets.
A significant proportion of the forward exchange contracts have maturities of less than one year after the balance sheet date.
The Group continues its practice of not hedging income statement translation exposure.
There are exchange control restrictions which affect the ability of a small number of the Groups subsidiaries to transfer funds to the Group.
The Group does not believe such restrictions have had or will have any material adverse impact on the Group as a whole or the ability of the Group to meet its cash flow requirements.
The table below shows the Groups currency exposures, being exposures on currency transactions that give rise to net currency gains and losses recognised in the income statement.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operating company involved, other than certain non-GBP borrowings treated as hedges of net investments in overseas entities.
2018 2017 GBP USD Euro GBP USD Euro Functional currency of Group operations m m m m m m Trade receivables 1.9 8.0 4.8 1.9 9.1 5.8 Cash and cash equivalents 0.9 7.5 1.6 0.8 2.0 3.6 Trade payables 2.3 8.3 12.2 2.0 10.0 5.6 Borrowings not designated as net investment hedges 2.4 0.1 3.1 0.9 Net balance sheet exposure 0.5 4.8 5.9 0.7 0.2 2.9 The amounts shown in the table take into account the effect of the forward contracts entered into to manage these currency exposures.
In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities held in currencies other than the currency of the reporting unit, the Group ensures that the net exposure is kept to an acceptable level, by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates where necessary to address short-term imbalances.
The Group classifies its forward exchange contracts hedging forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts used as hedges of forecasted transactions at 31 December 2018 was a liability of 0.1 million 2017: asset of 0.5 million.
The contractual cash flows associated with the forward exchange contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges are shown in the section on liquidity risk.
The impact on profit or loss is expected to occur at the same time as the associated cash flows.
Currency translation risks are controlled centrally.
To defend against the impact of a permanent reduction in the value of its overseas net assets through currency depreciation, the Group seeks to match the currency of financial liabilities with the currency in which the net assets are denominated.
This is achieved by raising funds in different currencies and through the use of hedging instruments such as swaps, and is implemented only to the extent that the Groups gearing covenant under the terms of its loan documents, as well as its facility headroom, are likely to remain comfortably within limits.
In this way, the currency of the Groups financial liabilities becomes more aligned to the currency of the trading cash flows that service them.
120 Morgan Advanced Materials Annual Report 2018 Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 21.
Financial risk management continued The Groups currency split of total borrowings was as follows: 2018 2017 m m GBP 23.6 10.3 USD 147.2 165.5 Euro 76.6 55.0 Other 0.2 0.9 247.6 231.7 The Groups sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates on financial assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2018 is as follows: Based upon the currency profile of the Groups net financial assets and liabilities, if GBP had strengthened by 10%, reported net financial liabilities would have decreased by 13.9 million 2017: 13.0 million.
Conversely, if GBP had weakened by 10%, reported net financial liabilities would have increased by 17.1 million 2017: 15.6 million.
Assuming the change occurred on the balance sheet date, there would be no impact on reported profit, as either the net financial liabilities are in the same currency as that of the respective Group entity, or the change would be offset by an equal and opposite change in the foreign currency monetary items in the Groups holding company.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are forward-looking estimates of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from those projected results due to developments.
The impact of a weakening in GBP on the Groups financial assets and liabilities would be more than offset in equity and income by its impact on the Groups overseas net assets and earnings respectively.
Exchange rates The principal exchange rates used in the translation of the results of overseas subsidiaries were as follows: 2018 2018 2017 2017 Closing rate Average rate Closing rate Average rate GBP to: USD 1.28 1.33 1.35 1.29 Euro 1.11 1.13 1.13 1.14 For illustrative purposes, the table below provides details of the impact on 2018 revenue, Group EBITA and profit before tax if the actual reported results, calculated using 2018 average exchange rates, were restated for GBP weakening by 10 cents against USD in isolation and 10 cents against the Euro in isolation: 2018 2018 2017 2017 2018 Group Profit 2017 Group Profit 1 1 Revenue EBITA before tax Revenue EBITA before tax m m m m m m 1 Increase in Revenue Group EBITA Profit before tax if: GBP weakens by 10c against USD in isolation 34.9 5.1 4.5 35.2 4.9 3.6 GBP weakens by 10c against the Euro in isolation 21.2 3.8 3.7 20.9 3.7 3.6 1.
Other market price risk Equity price risk arises from FVOCI equity instruments held for meeting partially the unfunded portion of the Groups defined benefit pension obligations.
The primary goal of the Groups investment strategy is to maximise returns in order to meet partially the Groups unfunded defined benefit obligations.

The Board encourages employees of the Group to hold the Companys Ordinary shares.
The Group operates a number of employee share and share option schemes.
From time to time the Company purchases its own shares on the market: the timing of these purchases depends on market prices.
Primarily the shares are intended to be used for issuing shares under the Groups various share option incentive schemes.
The Board seeks to maintain a balance between the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position, and the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings.
The Group monitors capital using the following indicators: Debt to adjusted capital 2018 2017 m m Total interest-bearing loans and borrowings 247.6 231.7 Less: cash and cash equivalents and overdrafts 67.6 50.4 1 Net debt 180.0 181.3 Total equity 277.2 234.3 Less: amounts accumulated in equity relating to cash flow hedges 0.2 0.5 Adjusted capital 277.4 233.8 Debt to adjusted capital ratio 0.6 0.8 1.

The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments reflected in the preceding table.
Equity securities Fair value is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are marked to market either using listed market prices or by discounting the contractual forward price and deducting the current spot rate.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.
The interest rates used to determine the fair value of loans and borrowings are 1.4-4.7% 2017: 1.6-4.2% and finance leases 4.3% 2017: 4.2%.
Finance lease liabilities The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at market interest rates for homogeneous lease agreements.
The estimated fair values reflect changes in interest rates.
Trade and other receivables payables For receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
All other receivables payables are discounted to determine the fair value.

Financial risk management continued Cash and cash equivalents, trade and other payables and trade and other receivables The Group has disclosed the fair value of cash and cash equivalents, current trade and other receivables and current payables at their carrying amount, given their notional amount is deemed to be their fair value.
Fair value hierarchy The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method.
The different levels have been defined as follows: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: i nputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly ie as prices or indirectly ie derived from prices Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.

Employee benefits Accounting policies i Defined contribution plans For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to either publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans, and the Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
ii Defined benefit plans A defined benefit plan is any retirement plan which is not a defined contribution plan.
Typically, defined benefit plans define an amount of retirement benefit that an employee will receive, usually depending on one or more factors such as age, years of service and earnings.
The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.
The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA-credit-rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
124 Morgan Advanced Materials Annual Report 2018 Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 22.
Employee benefits continued When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the total of the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
An economic benefit is available to the Group if it is realisable during the life of the plan, or on settlement of the plan liabilities.
Remeasurement gains and losses, differences between the interest income and actual returns on assets, and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised in full in other comprehensive income in the year in which they arise.
iii Long-term service benefits The Groups net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits, other than pension plans, is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
The obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method, or similar approximation, and is discounted to its present value and the fair value of any related assets is deducted.
iv Share-based payment transactions The grant date fair value of share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards for which the related service and non-market performance conditions are met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.
Employee benefits pensions The Group operates a number of defined benefit arrangements as well as defined contribution plans.
The defined benefit plans are primarily in the UK, US and Europe and predominantly provide pensions based on service and career-average pay.
In addition post-retirement medical plans are operated in the US.
UK Schemes In the UK, the Group operates two defined benefit pension schemes, the Morgan Pension Scheme and the Morgan Group Senior Staff Pension and Life Assurance Scheme the UK Schemes.
The two UK Schemes provide a benefit based upon an employees total service, and their career average earnings including allowance for consumer price inflation, although historically benefits were based upon an employees final salary.
Once in payment, pensions receive increases as set out in the rules, at either a fixed level, or in line with the Retail Price Index.
The overall duration of the UK Schemes is around 16 years.
The UK Schemes assets are held in trustee-administered funds which are governed by UK regulations, as is the nature of the relationship between the Group and the Trustees.
Responsibility for the governance of the UK Schemes including investment decisions and contribution schedules lies with the Board of Trustees which must consult with the Company on such matters.
The Board of Trustees must be composed of representatives of the Company, plan participants and an independent trustee, in accordance with the UK Schemes governing documents.
Funding legislation in the UK requires that schemes are fully funded on a scheme-specific basis as measured, and this must be assessed at least every three years.
To the extent that there is a deficit against this measure, a payment schedule must be agreed such that the deficit is removed over a reasonable period of time, typically around 10 years.
The most recent full actuarial valuations of the UK Schemes were undertaken as at March 2016 and resulted in combined assessed deficits of 132 million.
On the basis of these full valuations, the Trustees of the UK Schemes, having consulted with the Group, agreed past service deficit recovery payments totalling 12 million a year from April 2017, increasing by 2.75% pa until 2025, with further payments to Morgan Pension Scheme for 2026 and 2027 and contributions in respect of future service as accrued.
New full valuations are due with effective dates of March 2019 and the outcome of those consultations will determine the Groups future contribution requirements, with any new deficit arising needing to be met through the payment of additional contributions.
Annual Report 2018 Morgan Advanced Materials 125 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 22.
Employee benefits continued The UK Schemes were closed to new entrants on 1 August 2011, with any new employees receiving benefits through the Morgan Group Personal Pension Plan, a defined contribution arrangement.
The Morgan Group Senior Staff Pension and Life Assurance Scheme was closed to the future accrual of benefits on and with effect from 6 April 2016.
Following a consultation exercise with the remaining active members of the Morgan Pension Scheme, the Trustee of the Scheme agreed to a Company proposal to close the Scheme to future accrual of benefits with effect from 6 April 2018.
Current employees, including those who were active in the Schemes at closure were auto-enrolled into The Morgan Group Personal Pension Plan for their future pension benefits.
Some members of Morgan Pension Scheme in the UK were being granted unreduced pensions when they retired early, contrary to the Scheme Rules which state that a reduction should be applied to the pensions of members who take early retirement.
This adjustment has resulted in a gain of 9.7 million.
An increase has also been applied to the pensions of members who take late retirement, resulting in a 2.1 million charge to the income statement.
On 26 October 2018, the High Court ruled that the Trustee of the Lloyds Banking Group pension schemes needs to remove the inequalities in pension scheme benefits that arise from unequal Guaranteed Minimum Pensions GMPs.
The funding impact of these issues on the Morgan Pension Scheme will be taken into account in the valuation due in March 2019: the net impact is not expected to be material.
The Group has considered third-party powers and does not believe the Trustees have any powers that would prevent the Group obtaining a refund of any surplus on wind-up of the Scheme following gradual settlement of the plan obligations.
As such the Groups interpretation is that the current version of IFRIC 14 does not have an impact and, as a result, any IAS 19 surplus can be recognised as an asset and it is not necessary to recognise additional liabilities in respect of contribution agreements reached with the pension scheme Trustees, managers or any third party.
US schemes The Group operates a tax qualified defined benefit pension scheme in the US MUSE DB Scheme, and a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan SERP which is not tax approved.
The MUSE DB Scheme is frozen, and therefore employees accrue benefits within a 401k arrangement.
The US Schemes provide a benefit based upon an employees service and earnings.
The benefits are level both prior to, and whilst in, payment.
Overall, the US Schemes duration is around 10 years.
The qualified US Schemes assets are held in a trust separately from the Groups assets.
For the SERP the Group holds an asset to meet the obligations however, due to its nature this is accounted for as a Group asset, rather than an asset of the SERP.
Responsibility for the governance of the US Schemes, including investment decisions and contribution schedules, lies with a management committee, all of whose members are appointed by the Group.
The funding requirements in the US, ERISA, require schemes to be fully funded at all times, and if not to target full funding within a period of seven years.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the US MUSE DB Scheme was undertaken as at 1 January 2018 and the Scheme was fully funded on this basis.
On the more stringent Defined Benefit Obligation DBO basis used for IAS 19 purposes, the deficit as at 1 January 2019 totalled 1.4 million.
In the previous year, the Group made contributions totalling 36 million $46 million, including an additional accelerated payment in December 2017 of 28 million $36 million.
As a result of this contribution no further significant contributions to the Scheme are anticipated in the medium term.
European schemes In Europe, the Group operates a number of retirement schemes, with the bulk of the obligations relating to arrangements for employees in Germany.
In line with local practice these arrangements are not funded in advance, with benefits being met by the Group as they fall due.

The assumptions used are best estimate assumptions chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which may not be borne out in practice.
The principal assumptions are the discount rate and inflation assumptions which are long-term and measured on external factors, based upon each plans duration.
In addition to these, the mortality assumption in the UK and the US is material to the cost of the promised benefits.
In both the UK and Europe, the assumed increases in salaries and pensions in payment are derived from assumed future inflation.
The rates shown below are single equivalents for the obligations as a whole derived from discounting along the yield curve.
In line with IAS 19, in determining the value of the annuity contract held in the UK we have reflected the same methodology as used to value the corresponding obligations, reflecting the actual cashflow profile and duration of the insured obligations, rather than those of the Schemes as a whole.
Actuarial assumptions were: 2018 2018 2018 2018 Rest of UK US Europe the World % % % % Discount rate 2.74 4.34 1.70 2.60 Salary increase n a n a 2.20 5.00 Inflation UK: RPI CPI 3.17 2.07 n a 1.70 n a 1 Pensions increase 3.00 3.10 3.70 n a 1.70 n a Mortality post-retirement: Life expectancy of a male aged 60 in accounting year years 26.5 24.9 24.6 n a Life expectancy of a male aged 60 in accounting year 20 years 28.1 26.7 27.4 n a 1.
Pension increases in the UK reflect both fixed rate and RPI related increases to different elements of members pensions.
The actual liability in respect of global employee benefits will not be known until the last payments have been made.
In placing a current estimate on the Groups past service benefit obligations, a number of assumptions about the future are required.
For defined benefit schemes, the Directors make annual estimates and assumptions in respect of discount rates, future changes in salaries, employee turnover, inflation rates and life expectancy.
In making these estimates and assumptions, the Directors consider advice provided by external advisers, such as actuaries.
The accounting assumptions noted above are used to calculate the year-end net pension liability in accordance with the relevant accounting Standard, IAS 19 revised Employee Benefits.
Changes in these assumptions have no impact on the Groups cash payments to their arrangements.
The payments due are calculated based on local funding requirements, or in the case of the Groups unfunded arrangements on the incidence of benefit payments falling due.
Annual Report 2018 Morgan Advanced Materials 129 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 22.
Employee benefits continued The sensitivities of the Groups net balance sheet to the principal assumptions are: 2018 2017 Increase Increase effect on effect on deficit deficit Change in assumption m m Discount rate Decrease by 0.1% 9.3 10.5 Inflation Increase by 0.1% 4.0 4.5 Mortality post-retirement Pensioners live 1 year longer 19.5 17.6 Exchange rates GBP weakens against USD by 10% 1.0 1.2 GBP weakens against EUR by 10% 4.1 4.1 These sensitivities have been calculated to show the movement in the net balance sheet in isolation, and assuming no other changes in market conditions at the accounting date.
This is unlikely in practice for example, a change in discount rate is unlikely to occur without any movement in the value of the assets held by the Groups Schemes.

The calculation of the surplus or deficit depends, therefore, on factors which are beyond the control of the Group principally the value at the balance sheet date of equity shares in which the Scheme has invested and long-term interest rates which are used to discount future liabilities.
The funding of the Scheme is based on long-term trends and assumptions relating to market growth, as advised by qualified actuaries and investment advisers.
Investment returns: The Groups net balance sheet and contribution requirements are heavily dependent upon the return on the assets invested in by the schemes.
Longevity: The cost to the Group of the pensions promised to members is dependent upon the expected term of these payments.
To the extent that members live longer than expected this will increase the cost of these arrangements.
Inflation rate risk: In the UK, the pension promises are, in the main, linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
The above risks have been mitigated for a large proportion of the UK Schemes pensioner population through the purchase of an insurance policy, the payments from which exactly match the promises made to employees.
Remaining investment risks have also been mitigated to some extent by diversification of the return-seeking assets and backing uninsured pensioner liabilities by bonds and swaps.
In the UK, the bonds and LDI mandates target an interest rate hedge against movements in government bond yields for an amount equal to approximately 75% of the invested assets.
In the US, the bond mandates provide an interest rate hedge of approximately 100% of the liabilities for funded plans.
In addition, the IAS 19 defined benefit obligation is linked to yields on AA-rated corporate bonds: however the majority of the Groups arrangements invest in a number of other assets which will move in a different manner from these bonds.
Therefore, changes in market conditions may lead to volatility in the net pension liability on the Groups balance sheet and in other comprehensive income, and to a lesser extent in the IAS 19 pension expense in the Groups income statement.
Defined contribution plans The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension plans.
The total expense relating to these plans in the current year was 10.7 million 2017: 9.5 million.
The Group expects to contribute 11.0 million to these arrangements in 2019.
Share-based payments The Group operates various share schemes that allow Group employees to acquire shares in the Company.
During 2018, awards were made to Executives and senior employees under the Morgan Advanced Materials plc Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP, the Morgan Advanced Materials plc Deferred Bonus Plan DBP and for the first time Morgan Advanced Materials plc Restricted Stock Units RSU.
The Company also maintains a UK all-employee Sharesave scheme Sharesave.
Further details can be found in the Remuneration Report on pages 58 to 75.

Employee benefits continued The grant date fair value of options granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.

Measurement of fair values The DBP is an award of deferred shares which include the accumulated value of any dividends which fall during the period from the date of grant to the vesting date.
The RSU is an award of shares, which are released in tranches to the participant over a specified period of time with no performance conditions except continued employment by the Group.
As such, the grant-date fair value of the DBP and RSU are equal to the share price at the date of grant.

Provisions and contingent liabilities Accounting policies A provision is recognised in the consolidated balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and there is probable outflow of resources which can be reliably measured and will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are recognised at an amount equal to the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the Groups liability.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate reflective of the current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
A contingent liability is disclosed, where significant, if the existence of the obligation will only be confirmed by future events or where the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with reasonable reliability.
A contingent liability is not disclosed if the likelihood of a material outflow in excess of any amounts provided is considered remote.
Obligations arising from restructuring plans are recognised when detailed formal plans have been established and when there is a valid expectation that such a plan will be carried out.
The Groups contingent liabilities are reviewed on a regular basis.
A contingent asset is not recognised but is disclosed, where significant, if an inflow of economic benefit is probable.

The amounts provided are based on the costs of terminating relevant contracts, under the contract terms, and managements best estimate of other associated restructuring costs including professional fees.
Due to the nature of the provision for closure and restructuring provisions, the timing of any future potential future outflows in respect of these liabilities is uncertain until the restructuring programme is completed.
Legal and other provisions Legal and other provisions mainly comprise amounts provided against open legal and contractual disputes arising in the normal course of business and long-service costs.
The Company has on occasion been required to take legal or other actions to protect its intellectual property rights, to enforce commercial contracts or otherwise and similarly to defend itself against proceedings brought by other parties.
Provisions are made for the expected costs associated with such matters, based on past experience of similar items and other known factors, taking into account professional advice received, and represent managements best estimate of the most likely outcome.
Other provisions represent the best estimate of the cost of settling current obligations although there is a higher degree of judgement involved.
Where obligations are not capable of being reliably estimated, or if a material outflow of economic resources is considered remote, it is classified as a contingent liability.
The Group is of the opinion that any associated claims that might be brought can be defeated successfully and, therefore, the possibility of any material outflow in settlement is assessed as remote.
Subsidiary undertakings within the Group have given unsecured guarantees of 9.2 million 2017: 11.2 million in the ordinary course of business.

Provisions and contingent liabilities continued Environmental provisions Environmental provisions are made for quantifiable environmental liabilities arising from known environmental issues.
The amounts provided are based on the best estimate of the costs required to remedy these issues.
At one site, a remediation feasibility study is currently being conducted in relation to a known environmental issue, in conjunction with the local Environmental Regulator.
The costs of completing this study have been provided.
At this stage it is not possible to reliably quantify the liabilities arising from this environmental issue until the outcome of this feasibility study is known.
Environmental contingent liabilities The Group is subject to local health, safety and environmental laws and regulations concerning its manufacturing operations around the world.
These laws and regulations may require the Group to take future action to remediate the impact of historical manufacturing processes on the environment or lead to other economic outflows.
Such contingencies may exist for various sites which the Group currently operates or has operated in the past.
There is a contingent liability arising from the known environmental issue referred to above under the heading environmental provisions where the financial impact cannot be reliably estimated until the completion of the remediation feasibility study.
The Group is of the opinion that, whilst the amounts of future costs not provided for could be significant, it is not possible to estimate the amounts involved reliably.
However, the Group does not expect that costs associated with these environmental contingent liabilities will significantly impact the Groups operations or its liquidity.
Tax contingent liabilities The Group is subject to periodic tax audits by various fiscal authorities covering corporate, employee and sales taxes in the various jurisdictions in which it operates.
We have provided for estimates of the Groups likely exposures where these can be reliably estimated.
These are disclosed in notes 8 and 14.
Operating leases Accounting policies Operating lease payments Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Leases as lessee Non-cancellable operating lease rentals are payable as follows: 2018 2017 m m Less than one year 11.3 10.4 Between one and five years 26.2 26.9 More than five years 27.3 30.4 64.8 67.7 The Group leases a number of properties under operating leases of varying duration.
In some cases, during the life of the lease, the rental payable is reviewed after a fixed period to reflect market rentals.
The commitments above include no operating lease commitments relating to discontinued operations 2017: 1.4 million.
Leases as lessor In 2018 the total of future minimum sub-lease income under non-cancellable sub-leases is nil 2017: nil.
Capital commitments In 2018 commitments for property, plant and equipment and computer software expenditure for which no provision has been made in these accounts amount to 7.2 million 2017: 2.8 million for the Group.

Change in accounting policy The following tables summarise the impact of adopting IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers on the consolidated income statement and balance sheet.
The change in accounting policy had no impact on specific adjusting items, so figures presented show the impact on total results.
The IFRS 15 restatement has had no material impact on tax.

Results for the year ended 31 December 2017 have been restated to reflect this.
Revenue for certain contracts was previously recognised in the earlier stages of a contract in line with the profile of costs incurred.
Due to the application of IFRS 15, these contracts have now recognised revenue in line with their output, measured on a contract specific basis.
Under IFRS 15, revenue represents the amount of consideration the Group was entitled to receive for transferring its goods and services to its customers, net of rebates, discounts, penalties and similar items.
These costs have therefore been reclassified from the cost of sales to reflect this.
For certain contracts, the Group is reimbursed for the costs of shipping and packing.
Under IFRS 15, this forms part of revenue as it constitutes a separate performance obligation.
These reimbursements have been reclassified to reflect this.
There was no net change in cash generated as a result of the adoption of IFRS 15.
Accordingly no reconciliation of the consolidated statement of cash flows has been presented.
Practical expedients The Group has elected to apply the practical expedients available under IFRS 15.129.
Contracts with customer have no significant financing components at inception and the incremental costs of obtaining a contracts are not material.
Subsequent events In December 2018, the Group agreed the issuance of a new US private debt placement, raising $25 million with a duration of seven years, at a coupon of 4.87%.
This was used to refinance existing financial indebtedness.
Funding was completed on 28 January 2019.
