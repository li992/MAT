Participants may elect to save up to 500 per month under a three-year savings contract.
An option is granted by the Company to buy shares at a discount of 20% from market price at the time of the grant.
At the end of the savings period, the option becomes exercisable for a period of six months.
Employees who are not paid through the UK payroll may participate in the scheme under similar terms and conditions, albeit without the same tax benefits.
Share Incentive Plan The plan is open to all employees on the UK payroll.
Participants may invest up to 1,800 of their pre-tax salary each year to purchase partnership shares in easyJet.
For each partnership share acquired, easyJet purchases a matching share up to a maximum value of 1,500 per annum.
Employees must remain with easyJet for three years from the date of purchase of each partnership share in order to qualify for the matching share, and for five years for the shares to be transferred to them tax free.
The employee is entitled to dividends on shares purchased, and to vote at shareholder meetings.
Subject to Company performance, easyJet also issues free shares to UK employees under an approved share incentive plan of up to 3,000 per annum in value.
There is a similar unapproved free shares scheme for international employees.
The fair value of grants under the Save As You Earn scheme are calculated by applying the Binomial Lattice option pricing model.
The fair value of grants under the TSR-based Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP is estimated under the Stochastic model also known as the Monte Carlo model.
The fair value of grants under all other schemes is the share price on the date of grant.
Exercise price for the Save As You Earn scheme is set at a 20% discount from the share price at grant date.
Expected volatility is based on historical volatility over a period comparable to the expected life of each type of option.
Levels of early exercises and forfeitures are estimated using historical averages.
The weighted average fair value of matching shares granted under the Share Incentive Plan during the year was 15.44 2017: 11.23.
For grants under the Save As You Earn scheme, the dividend yield assumption is calculated based on the actual yield at the date of grant.
