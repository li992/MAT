The financial impact on these counterparties, and the contagion impact on the rest of the shareholder portfolio, is assessed under various scenarios and assumptions.
This analysis is regularly reviewed to reflect the latest economic outlook, economic data and changes to asset portfolios.
The results are used to inform the Groups views onwhether any management actions are required.
