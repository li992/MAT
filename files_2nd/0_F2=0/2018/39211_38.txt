Treatment and fair value of consideration transferred The purchase price payable in respect of the acquisition is split into a number of different components.
The payment of certain elements has been deferred: the timing and value of these are contingent on certain employment conditions and operational and financial targets being met.
The proportion of the deferred payments that are contingent on selling shareholders remaining employees of the group for a specific period are accounted for as remuneration for ongoing services in employment.
The groups estimate of the amounts ultimately payable will be expensed over the deferral period.
Those deferred payments accounted for as additional consideration were assessed against the operational targets to which they are subject.
Based on performance against the operational targets to date, the group has made an assessment of the amount and timing of these payments.
A provision for contingent consideration has been made for the amount expected to be paid.
