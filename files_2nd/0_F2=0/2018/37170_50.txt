Disclosures regarding financial instruments measured at fair value The Companys financial instruments within the scope of FRS 102 that are held at fair value comprise its investment portfolio.
The investments are categorised into a hierarchy consisting of the following three levels: 1 The unadjusted quoted price in an active market for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date The best evidence of fair value is a quoted price for an identical asset in an active market.
Quoted in an active market in this context means quoted prices are readily and regularly available and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arms length basis.
The quoted price is usually the current bid price.
2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable ie: developed using market data for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly When quoted prices are unavailable, the price of a recent transaction for an identical asset provides evidence of fair value as long as there has not been a significant change in economic circumstances or a significant lapse of time since the transaction took place.
If the entity can demonstrate that the last transaction price is not a good estimate of fair value e. g. because it reflects the amount that an entity would receive or pay in a forced transaction, involuntary liquidation or distress sale, that price is adjusted.
3 Inputs are unobservable ie: for which market data is unavailable for the asset or liability If the market for the asset is not active and recent transactions of an identical asset on their own are not a good estimate of fair value, an entity estimates the fair value by using a valuation technique.
The objective of using a valuation technique is to estimate what the transaction price would have been on the measurement date in an arms length exchange motivated by normal business considerations.
Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset.
Details of the valuation techniques used by the Company are given in note 1 b on page 54.
The following table sets out the fair value measurements using the FRS 102 hierarchy at 30th June.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies As an investment trust, the Company invests in equities for the long term so as to secure its investment objective stated on the Features page.
In pursuing this objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of financial risks that could result in a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for dividends.
These financial risks include market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Directors policy for managing these risks is set out below.
The Company Secretary, in close cooperation with the Board and the Manager, coordinates the Companys risk management policy.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks and the methods used to measure the risks that are set out below, have not changed from those applying in the comparative year.

a Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk.
Information to enable an evaluation of the nature and extent of these three elements of market risk is given in parts i to iii of this note, together with sensitivity analyses where appropriate.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and these policies have remained unchanged from those applying in the comparative year.
The Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
i Currency risk Certain of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling which is the Companys functional currency and presentation currency.
As a result, movements in exchange rates may affect the sterling value of those items.
Management of currency risk The Manager monitors the Companys exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the Board, which meets on at least four occasions each year.
The Manager measures the risk to the Company of this exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and income of a movement in rates of exchange to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
The Company may use short term forward currency contracts to manage working capital requirements.
It is currently not the Company's policy to hedge against foreign currency risk.
Foreign currency exposure The fair value of the Companys monetary items that have foreign currency exposure at 30th June are shown below.
Where the Companys equity investments which are not monetary items are priced in a foreign currency, they have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.

Cash held in the JPMorgan US Dollar Liquidity Fund has fluctuated between nil and 20,754,097 during the year 2017: nil and 40,795,000.
Foreign currency sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of return after taxation for the year and net assets with regard to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities and exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary currency financial instruments held at each balance sheet date and the income receivable in foreign currency and assumes a 10% 2017: 10% appreciation or depreciation in sterling against the currencies to which the Company is exposed to, which is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on the volatility of exchange rates during the year.

Management of interest rate risk The Company does not normally hold significant cash balances.
Short term borrowings are used when required.
Interest rate exposure The exposure of financial assets and liabilities to floating interest rates using the year end figures, giving cash flow interest rate risk when rates are reset, is shown below.
2018 2017 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates: Cash and short term deposits 873 3,871 JPMorgan US Dollar Liquidity Fund 150 6,709 Total net exposure 1,023 10,580 Interest receivable on cash balances is at a margin below LIBOR 2017: same.
The target interest earned on the JPMorgan US Dollar Liquidity Fund is the 7 day US Dollar London Interbank Bid Rate.
Interest rate sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and net assets to a 1% 2017: 1% increase or decrease in interest rates in regards to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities.
This level of change is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on observation of current market conditions.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary financial instruments held at the balance sheet date with all other variables held constant.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies continued a Market risk continued iii Other price risk Other price risk includes changes in market prices, other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk, which may affect the value of equity investments.
Management of other price risk The Board meets on at least four occasions each year to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors.
The investment management team has responsibility for monitoring the portfolio, which is selected in accordance with the Companys investment objectives and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Other price risk exposure The Companys total exposure to changes in market prices at 30th June comprises its holdings in equity investments as follows: 2018 2017 000 000 Investments held at fair value through profit or loss 1,189,079 1,109,292 The above data is broadly representative of the exposure to other price risk during the current and comparative year.
Concentration of exposure to other price risk An analysis of the Companys investments is given on pages 17 to 21.
This shows that the investments value is in a broad spread of countries with no concentration of exposure to any one country.
However, it should also be noted that an investment may not be entirely exposed to the economic conditions in its country of domicile or of listing.
Other price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and net assets to an increase or decrease of 10% 2017: 10% in the market value of equity investments.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys equities, adjusting for changes in the management fee but with all other variables held constant.

Liquidity risk exposure Contractual maturities of the financial liabilities, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required are as follows: 2018 2017 Within Within one year Total one year Total 000 000 000 000 Creditors: amounts falling due within one year Repurchase of the Companys own shares awaiting settlement 1,833 1,833 Securities purchased for future settlement 2,318 2,318 Other creditors and accruals 393 393 340 340 Derivative financial liabilities 4 4 2 2 2,715 2,715 2,175 2,175 The liabilities shown above represent future contractual payments and therefore may differ from the amounts shown in the Statement of Financial Position.
c Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that the counterparty to a transaction fails to discharge its obligations under that transaction which could result in loss to the Company.
Management of credit risk Portfolio dealing The Company invests in markets that operate Delivery Versus Payment DVP settlement.
The process of DVP mitigates the risk of losing the principal of a trade during the settlement process.
The Manager continuously monitors dealing activity to ensure best execution, a process that involves measuring various indicators including the quality of trade settlement and incidence of failed trades.
Counterparty lists are maintained and adjusted accordingly.
Cash and cash equivalents Counterparties are subject to regular credit analysis by the Manager and deposits can only be placed with counterparties that have been approved by JPMAMs Counterparty Risk Group.
The Board regularly reviews the counterparties used by the Manager.
Exposure to JPMorgan Chase JPMorgan Chase Bank, N. A. is the custodian of the Companys assets.
The Companys assets are segregated from JPMorgan Chases own trading assets.
Therefore these assets are designed to be protected from creditors in the event that JPMorgan Chase were to cease trading.
The Depositary, The Bank of New York Mellon International Limited, is responsible for the safekeeping of all custodial assets of the Company and for verifying and maintaining a record of all other assets of the Company.
However, no absolute guarantee can be given on the protection of all the assets of the Company.
Credit risk exposure The amounts shown in the Statement of Financial Position under debtors and cash and cash equivalents represent the maximum exposure to credit risk at the current and comparative year ends.
d Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities All financial assets and liabilities are either included in the Statement of Financial Position at fair value or the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
