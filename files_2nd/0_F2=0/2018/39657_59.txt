NET DEBT AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE CONTINUED 15 Equity continued 15.2 Share-based payments Accounting policy Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the shares that will eventually vest allowing for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes or the Monte Carlo pricing models, based on observable market prices.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
All outstanding Sage Performance Share Plans PSPs are subject to some non-market performance conditions.
These are organic revenue and EPS growth.
The element of the income statement charge relating to market performance conditions is fixed at the grant date.
At the end of the reporting period, the Group revises its estimates for the number of options expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The total charge for the year relating to employee share-based payment plans was 18m 2017: 11m, all of which related to equitysettled share-based payment transactions.

Under the Performance Share Plan 2,704,069 2017: 3,198,162 awards were made during the year.
Awards prior to 2016 These performance shares are subject to a service condition and three performance conditions.
Performance conditions are weighted one-third on the achievement of an EPS target, and one-third on the achievement of an organic revenue growth target.
The remaining one-third is based on a TSR target.
The EPS vesting percentage is based on compound EPS growth.
Where compound EPS growth is between 6% and 12%, the EPS vesting percentage will be calculated on a straight-line pro-rata basis between 6.7% and 26.7%, and where compound EPS growth is between 12% and 15%, the EPS vesting percentage will be calculated on a straight-line pro-rata basis between 26.7% and 33.3%.
The organic revenue growth target is based on the Companys compound annual organic revenue growth.
Where growth is between 4% and 8% the organic revenue growth vesting percentage will be calculated on a straight-line pro-rata basis between 6.7% and 26.7%, and where the Companys compound organic revenue growth is between 8% and 10%, the organic revenue growth vesting percentage will be calculated on a straight-line pro-rata basis between 26.7% and 33.3%.
In order for the organic revenue growth target proportion to vest, the underlying operating profit margin in the financial year of vesting must not be less than that of the underlying operating profit margin for the financial year in which the award is granted.
The final third of the award is the performance target relating to TSR which measures share price performance against a designated comparator group.
Where the Companys TSR is between median and upper quartile, the TSR vesting percentage will be calculated on a straight-line pro-rata basis between 6.7% and 26.7% and where the Companys TSR is between upper quartile and upper decile, the TSR vesting percentage will be calculated on a straight-line pro-rata basis between 26.7% and 33.3%.
The TSR vesting percentage may only exceed 26.7% stretch level if performance against either the EPS target or the organic revenue growth target is also at stretch level.
The comparator group for awards granted prior to 2016 is the companies comprised in the FTSE 100 Index at the start of the performance period, excluding financial services and extraction companies.
Awards were valued using the Monte Carlo option pricing model.
The market-based performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations, which were based on observable market prices at grant date.
All options granted under performance share awards have an exercise price of nil.
190 Annual Report and Accounts 2018 The Sage Group plc.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Awards from 2016 onwards These performance shares are subject to a service condition and two performance conditions.
Performance conditions are weighted one half on the achievement of a revenue growth target and one half on the achievement of a TSR target.
The revenue growth target is subject to two underpin performance conditions relating to EPS growth and organic revenue growth.
The revenue growth target is based on the Companys compound annual recurring revenue growth.
Where the Companys annual recurring revenue growth is between 8% and 10% or 10% and 12%, the extent to which the revenue performance condition is satisfied will be calculated on a straight-line pro rata basis between 10% and 40% or between 40% and 50% respectively.
Notwithstanding the extent to which the revenue performance condition has been satisfied, the revenue tranche will not be released and will lapse on the Boards determination that i the compound growth of the Companys underlying EPS over the performance period is less than 8% per annum: or ii the compound growth of the Companys organic revenue over the performance period is less than 6% per annum.
The performance target relating to TSR measures share price performance against a designated comparator group.
Where the Companys TSR is between median and upper quartile, the TSR vesting percentage will be calculated on a straight-line pro-rata basis between 10% and 40% and where the Companys TSR is between upper quartile and upper decile, the TSR vesting percentage will be calculated on a straight-line pro-rata basis between 40% and 50%.
The comparator group for awards granted from 2016 onwards is the companies comprised in the FTSE 100 Index at the start of the performance period, excluding financial services and extraction companies.
Performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations, which were based on observable market prices at grant date.
The fair value per award granted and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows: December May Grant date 2017 2018 Share price at grant date 7.59 6.73 Number of employees 84 14 Shares under award 2,561,092 142,977 Vesting period years 3 3 Expected volatility 20.9% 21.4% Award life years 3 3 Expected life years 3 3 Risk-free rate 0.95% 0.83% Fair value per award 6.10 4.64 December August September Grant date 2016 2017 2017 Share price at grant date 6.36 6.86 7.17 Number of employees 84 14 6 Shares under award 2,823,124 272,350 102,688 Vesting period years 3 2 2 Expected volatility 21.6% 21.0% 20.9% Award life years 3 2 2 Expected life years 3 2 2 Risk-free rate 0.27% 0.24% 0.41% Fair value per award 4.17 4.38 4.64 The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last three years.
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed award life.
