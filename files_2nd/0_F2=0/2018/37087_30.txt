AUTHORISATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Group and Company financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 6 March 2019 and the balance sheets were signed on the Boards behalf by Mark Dixon and Eric Hageman.
IWG plc is a public limited company incorporated in Jersey and registered and domiciled in Switzerland.
The Companys ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
IWG plc owns a network of business centres which are utilised by a variety of business customers.
Information on the Groups structure is provided in note 31, and information on other related party relationships of the Group is provided in note 30.
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with Companies Jersey Law 1991 and International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union Adopted IFRSs.
The Company prepares its parent company annual accounts in accordance with accounting policies based on the Swiss Code of Obligations: extracts from these are presented on page 131.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of preparation The Group financial statements consolidate those of the parent company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and equity account the Groups interest in joint ventures.
The extract from the parent company annual accounts presents information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Group financial statements.
Amendments to adopted IFRSs issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC with an effective date from 1 January 2018 did not have a material effect on the Group financial statements, unless otherwise indicated.
The following standards, interpretations and amendments to standards were adopted by the Group for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2018: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers Judgements made by the Directors in the application of these accounting policies that have significant effect on the consolidated financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed in note 32.
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis, with the exception of certain financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value as described in note 23.
The Directors, having made appropriate enquiries, have a reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements on pages 85 to 130.
In adopting the going concern basis for preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Directors have considered the further information included in the business activities commentary as set out on pages 22 to 27 as well as the Groups principal risks and uncertainties as set out on pages 35 to 41.
Further details on the going concern basis of preparation can be found in note 23 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
These Group consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is IWG plcs functional currency, and all values are in million pounds, rounded to one decimal place, except where indicated otherwise.
The attributable results of those companies acquired or disposed of during the year are included for the periods of ownership.
Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the total recognised gains and losses of joint ventures on an equity accounted basis, from the date that joint control commences until the date that joint control ceases or the joint venture qualifies as a disposal group, at which point the investment is carried at the lower of fair value less costs to sell and carrying value.
When the Groups share of losses exceeds its interest in a joint venture, the Groups carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of a joint venture.
9 0 IWG PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2018 90 IWG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Impact of the adoption of IFRS 9 The Group adopted IFRS 9 Financial Instruments from 1 January 2018.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments sets out requirements for recognising and measuring financial assets, financial liabilities and some contracts to buy and sell non-financial items.
This standard replaced IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Classification financial assets IFRS 9 contains a new classification and measurement approach for financial assets that reflects the business model in which assets are managed and their cash flow characteristics.
It contains three principal classification categories for financial assets: measured at amortised costs, fair value through other comprehensive income OCI and fair value through the profit or loss.
The standard eliminates the existing IAS 39 categories of held to maturity, loans and receivables and available for sale.
Under IFRS 9, derivatives embedded in contracts where the host is a financial asset in the scope of the standard are never bifurcated.
Instead, the hybrid financial instrument as a whole is assessed for classification.
The new classification requirements didnt have a material impact on any of its accounting balances.
Furthermore, at 31 December 2018, the Group did not have any balances classified as available-for-sale.
Consequently, there are no adjustments to be recognised in either the income statement or other comprehensive income.
Classification financial liabilities IFRS 9 largely retains the existing requirements in IAS 39 for the classification of financial liabilities.
However, under IAS 39 all fair value changes of liabilities designated as at fair value through the profit or loss are recognised in profit or loss, whereas under IFRS 9 these fair value changes are generally presented as follows: The amount of change in fair value that is attributable to changes in the credit risk of the liability is presented in other comprehensive income: and The remaining amount of change in the fair value is presented in profit or loss.
The Group has not designated any financial liabilities at fair value through the profit or loss and it has no current intention to do so.
The Groups adoption of IFRS 9 did not result in any change in the classification of financial liabilities at 1 January 2018.
Consequently, there were no adjustments to be recognised in either the income statement or other comprehensive income.
Impairment financial assets IFRS 9 requires the Group to record expected credit losses on all of its financial instruments, either on a 12-month or lifetime basis.
The Group applied the simplified approach to trade receivables and recorded the lifetime expected losses.
The Group determined that due to the nature of its receivables, taking into account the customer deposits obtained, the impact of applying IFRS 9 did not significantly impact the provision for bad debts.
Hedge accounting IFRS 9 requires the Group to ensure that hedge accounting relationships are aligned with the Groups risk management objectives and strategy and to apply a more qualitative and forward-looking approach to assessing hedge effectiveness.
IFRS 9 also introduces new requirements on rebalancing hedge relationships and prohibiting voluntary discontinuation of hedge accounting.
Under the new model, it is possible that more risk management strategies, particularly those involving hedging a risk component other than foreign currency risk of non-financial items, will be likely to qualify for hedge accounting.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate movements.
The majority of day-to-day transactions of overseas subsidiaries are carried out in local currency and the underlying foreign exchange exposure is small.
Transactional exposures do arise in some countries where it is local market practice for a proportion of the payables or receivables to be in other than the functional currency of the affiliate.
Intercompany charging, funding and cash management activity may also lead to foreign exchange exposures.
It is the policy of the Group to seek to minimise such transactional exposures through careful management of non-local currency assets and liabilities, thereby minimising the potential volatility in the income statement.
Net investments in IWG affiliates with a functional currency other than sterling are of a long-term nature and the Group does not normally hedge such foreign currency translation exposures.
From time to time the Group uses short-term derivative financial instruments to manage its transactional foreign exchange exposures where these exposures cannot be eliminated through balancing the underlying risks.
The Group designates these derivatives as fair value hedges.
The Group determined that all existing hedge relationships that are currently designated in effective hedging relationships will continue to qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS 9.
As IFRS 9 does not change the general principles of how an entity accounts for effective hedges, applying the hedging requirements of IFRS 9 does not impact the Groups financial statements.
9 1 91 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 2.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Impact of the adoption of IFRS 15 IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognised.
It replaced existing revenue recognition guidance, including IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes.
The Group is involved in the provision of flexible workspace, as well as performing related services.
Revenue from the provision of these services to customers is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable excluding sales taxes.
Where rent-free periods are granted to customers, rental income is spread on a straight-line basis over the length of the customer contract.
The services performed are based on the list price at which the Group provides the contracted services.
Based on the Groups assessment, the fair value of the service performed under IAS 18 and the timing of revenue recognised are consistent with IFRS 15.
Therefore, the application of IFRS 15 did not result in any differences in the timing of the performance and the recognition of the revenue, for these services.
IFRSs not yet effective The following new or amended standards and interpretations that are mandatory for 2019 annual periods and future years are not expected to have a material impact on the Group financial statements, unless otherwise stated.
IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019 IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments 1 January 2019 Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures Amendments to IAS 28 1 January 2019 Plan Amendments, Curtailment or Settlement Amendments to IAS 19 1 January 2019 Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2015 2017 Cycle 1 January 2019 Prepayment features with Negative Compensation Amendments to IFRS 9 1 January 2019 Amendments to References to Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards 1 January 2019 IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts 1 January 2019 There are no other IFRS standards or interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
The Group has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective.
The impact of these new or amended standards and interpretations has been considered as follows: IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 replaces existing leases guidance, including IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease, SIC-15 Operating Leases Incentives and SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease.
The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
Early adoption is permitted for entities that apply IFRS 15 at or before the date of initial application of IFRS 16.
IFRS 16 introduces a single, on-balance sheet lease accounting model for lessees.
A lessee recognises a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments.
There are recognition exemptions for short-term leases and leases of low-value items.
Lessor accounting remains similar to the current standard i. e. lessors continue to classify leases as finance or operating leases.
The Group has completed its initial assessment of the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements.
The actual impact of applying IFRS 16 on the financial statements in the period of initial application depends on future economic conditions, including the Groups borrowing rate and credit rating, external interest rates, country risk factors, the composition of the Groups lease portfolio, the Groups assessment of whether it will exercise any lease renewal options and the extent to which the Group chooses to use practical expedients and recognition exemptions.
Taking these considerations into account, on transition: The Group will adopt the modified approach, choosing to measure the right-of-use asset at the retrospective amount as if IFRS 16 had been applied from lease commencement date.
The difference between the right-of use asset and the related lease liability is recognised directly in retained earnings.
In determining the right-of-use asset and lease liability to be recognised, the Group will adopt an incremental borrowing rate for each lease.
This rate has been determined by taking currency specific interest rates based on 10-year external market rates where available, which reflect the average centre lease duration and then considering adjustments to reflect subsidiary country specific credit ratings and adjustments to reflect the level of collateral.
This incremental borrowing rate will be updated annually and applied to leases completed in the subsequent year.
The right-of-use asset recognised will be depreciated over the life of the lease, adjusted for any period between the lease commencement date and the date the related centre opens, reflecting the lease related costs directly incurred in preparing the business centre for trading.
The life of the lease reflects the contracted lease term and any renewal periods that are at IWGs option to extend.
The most significant impact identified is the right-of-use asset and related lease liability the Group recognises for its leases in respect of its global network, which will be recognised based on the modified retrospective approach.
Based on the lease portfolio at 31 December 2018, the Group expects to report a right-of-use asset of approximately 4,417m to 4,882m and a related lease liability of approximately 5,075m to 5,609m at 31 December 2019.
These balances exclude the impact of any lease terminations, lease renewals and expected 9 2 IWG PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2018 92 IWG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS growth in the lease portfolio in 2019.
The recognition of these balances will not impact the overall cash flows of the Group or cash generation per share.
The pro forma impact from the adoption of IFRS 16 as at 1 January 2019 is disclosed on pages 136 and 137.
In addition, the nature of expenses related to leases will change as IFRS 16 replaces the straight-line operating lease expense with a depreciation charge for right-of-use assets and an interest expense on the lease liabilities.
The Group has also considered the impact of lessor accounting, which is not considered to be material.
The Group will adopt the exemptions permitted in respect of short-term and low value leases, which are not material due to the relatively low number of these leases.
The Group does not expect the adoption of IFRS 16 to impact its ability to comply with the covenant requirements on its revolving credit facility described in note 23.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has the rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences.
The results are consolidated until the date control ceases or the subsidiary qualifies as a disposal group, at which point the assets and liabilities are carried at the lower of fair value less costs to sell and carrying value.
Impairment of non-financial assets For goodwill, assets that have an indefinite useful life and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount was estimated at 30 September 2018.
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amount of these assets to determine whether there is an indicator of impairment.
If any indicator is identified, then the assets recoverable amount is re-evaluated.
The carrying amount of the Groups other non-financial assets other than deferred tax assets are reviewed at the reporting date to determine whether there is an indicator of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
The Group has identified individual business centres as the CGU.
We evaluate the potential impairment of property, plant and equipment at the centre CGU level where there are indicators of impairment.
Centres CGUs are grouped by country of operation for the purposes of carrying out impairment reviews of goodwill as this is the lowest level at which it can be assessed.
Individual fittings and equipment in our centres or elsewhere in the business that become obsolete or are damaged are assessed and impaired where appropriate.
Calculation of recoverable amount The recoverable amount of relevant assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Goodwill All business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method.
Goodwill is initially measured at fair value, being the excess of the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling interests, and any previous interest held, over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the Group re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date.
If the re-assessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognised in profit or loss.
Positive goodwill is stated at cost less any provision for impairment in value.
An impairment test is carried out annually and, in addition, whenever indicators exist that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Negative goodwill is recognised directly in profit or loss.
Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately from the business are capitalised at cost.
Intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition of a business are capitalised separately from goodwill if their fair value can be identified and measured reliably on initial recognition.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets as follows: Brand Regus brand Indefinite life Brand Other acquired brands 20 years Computer software Up to 5 years Customer lists 2 years Management agreements Minimum duration of the contract Amortisation of intangible assets is expensed through administration expenses in the income statement.
9 3 93 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 2.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Acquisitions of non-controlling interests Acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and therefore no goodwill is recognised as a result.
Adjustments to non-controlling interests arising from transactions that do not involve the loss of control are based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary.
Assets held for sale Assets held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying value of the identified asset and its fair value less cost to sell.
Leases Plant and equipment leases for which the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
All other leases, including all of the Groups property leases, are categorised as operating leases.
Operating leases Minimum lease payments under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Lease incentives, including partner contributions and rent-free periods, are included in the calculation of minimum lease payments.
The commencement of the lease term is the date from which the Group is entitled to use the leased asset.
The lease term is the noncancellable period of the lease, together with any further periods for which the Group has the option to continue to lease the asset and when at the inception of the lease it is reasonably certain that the Group will exercise that option.
Contingent rentals include rent increases based on future inflation indices or non-guaranteed rental payments based on centre turnover or profitability and are excluded from the calculation of minimum lease payments.
Contingent rentals are recognised in the income statement as they are incurred.
Onerous lease provisions are an estimate of the net amounts payable under the terms of the lease to the first break point, at the Groups option, discounted at an appropriate pre-tax rate that reflects the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
Partner contributions Partner contributions are contributions from our business partners property owners and landlords towards the initial costs of opening a business centre, including the fit-out of the property and the losses that we incur early in the centre life.
The partner contribution is treated as a lease incentive and is amortised over the period of the lease.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets as follows: Buildings 50 years Leasehold improvements 10 years Furniture 10 years Office equipment and telephones 5 years Computer hardware 3 5 years Revenue The Groups primary activity and only business segment is the provision of global workplace solutions.
Revenue from the provision of services to customers is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable excluding sales taxes.
Workstations Workstation revenue is recognised when the provision of the service is rendered.
Amounts invoiced in advance are accounted for as deferred income contract liability and recognised as revenue upon provision of the service.
Customer service income Service income including the rental of meeting rooms is recognised as services are rendered.
In circumstances where IWG acts as an agent for the sale and purchase of goods to customers, only the commission fee earned is recognised as revenue.
Management and franchise fees Fees received for the provision of initial and subsequent services are recognised as revenue as the services are rendered.
Fees charged for the use of continuing rights granted by the agreement, or for other services provided during the period of the agreement, are recognised as revenue as the services are provided or the rights used.
Membership card income Revenue from the sale of membership cards is deferred and recognised over the period that the benefits of the membership card are expected to be provided.
The Group has generally concluded that it is the principal in its revenue arrangement, except where noted above.
9 4 IWG PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2018 94 IWG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Employee benefits The majority of the Groups pension plans are of the defined contribution type.
For these plans the Groups contribution and other paid and unpaid benefits earned by the employees are charged to the income statement as incurred.
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plan is determined using the projected unit credit method.
Re-measurements, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding net interest and the return on plan assets, excluding net interest, are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Re-measurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.
Service costs are recognised in profit or loss, and include current and past service costs as well as gains and losses on curtailments.
Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset.
The Group recognises the following changes in the net defined benefit obligation under cost of sales and selling, general and administration expenses in the consolidated income statement: service costs comprising current service costs: past service costs: and gains and losses on curtailments and non-routine settlements.
Settlements of defined benefit schemes are recognised in the period in which the settlement occurs.
Share-based payments The share awards programme entitles certain employees and Directors to acquire shares of the ultimate parent company: these awards are granted by the ultimate parent and are equity settled.
The fair value of options and awards granted under the Groups share-based payment plans outlined in note 24 is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The fair value of the options granted is measured using the Black-Scholes valuation model or the Monte Carlo method, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest in respect of non-market conditions except where forfeiture is due to the expiry of the option.
Taxation Tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets and liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised for all unused tax losses only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Restructuring provisions are made for direct expenditures of a business reorganisation where the plans are sufficiently detailed and well advanced and where the appropriate communication to those affected has been undertaken at the reporting date.
Provision is made for onerous contracts and closure costs to the extent that the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under a contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be delivered, discounted using an appropriate weighted average cost of capital.
9 5 95 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 2.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Equity Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the value of proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
When shares recognised as equity are repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, which includes directly attributable costs, net of any tax effects, is recognised as a deduction from equity.
Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented in the treasury share reserve.
When treasury shares are sold or re-issued subsequently, the amount received is recognised as an increase in equity and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is presented within retained earnings.
Net finance expenses Interest charges and income are accounted for in the income statement on an accruals basis.
Financing transaction costs that relate to financial liabilities are charged to interest expense using the effective interest rate method and are recognised within the carrying value of the related financial liability on the balance sheet.
Fees paid for the arrangement of credit facilities are recognised as a prepayment and recognised through the finance expense over the term of the facility.
Where assets or liabilities on the Group balance sheet are carried at net present value, the increase in the amount due to unwinding the discount is recognised as a finance expense or finance income as appropriate.
Costs arising on bank guarantees and letters of credit and foreign exchange gains or losses are included in other finance costs note 7.
Interest bearing borrowings and other financial liabilities Financial liabilities, including interest bearing borrowings, are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, financial liabilities are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest rate method.
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when the Groups obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired.
Financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss where the liability is either held for trading or is designated as held at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition.
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are stated at fair value with any resultant gain or loss recognised in the income statement.
Financial assets Financial assets are classified as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through the profit or loss or fair value through other comprehensive income OCI.
The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined on initial recognition.
Financial assets including trade and other receivables are measured at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met: The financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows: and Its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value and changes therein, including any interest or dividend income, are recognised in profit or loss.
Financial assets including trade and other receivables are measured at fair value through OCI if both of the following conditions are met: The financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting cash flows and selling financial assets: and Its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
Customer deposits Deposits received from customers against non-performance of the contract are held on the balance sheet as a current liability until they are returned to the customer at the end of their relationship with the Group.
Foreign currency transactions and foreign operations Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the closing rate of exchange at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on translation are taken to the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
The results and cash flows of foreign operations are translated using the average rate for the period.
Assets and liabilities, including goodwill and fair value adjustments, of foreign operations are translated using the closing rate, with all exchange differences arising on consolidation being recognised in other comprehensive income, and presented in the foreign currency translation reserve in equity.
Exchange differences are released to the income statement on disposal.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
9 6 IWG PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2018 96 IWG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Derivative financial instruments The Groups policy on the use of derivative financial instruments can be found in note 23.
Derivative financial instruments are measured initially at fair value and changes in the fair value are recognised through profit or loss unless the derivative financial instrument has been designated as a cash flow hedge whereby the effective portion of changes in the fair value are deferred in equity.
SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS STATUTORY BASIS An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenue and incur expenses.
An operating segments results are reviewed regularly by the chief operating decision maker the Board of Directors of the Group to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.
The business is run on a worldwide basis but managed through four principal geographical segments the Groups operating segments : the Americas: EMEA Europe, Middle East and Africa : Asia Pacific: and the United Kingdom.
These geographical segments exclude the Groups non-trading, holding and corporate management companies.
The results of business centres in each of these regions form the basis for reporting geographical results to the chief operating decision maker.
All reportable segments are involved in the provision of global workplace solutions.
The Groups reportable segments operate in different markets and are managed separately because of the different economic characteristics that exist in each of those markets.
Each reportable segment has its own discrete senior management team responsible for the performance of the segment.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the Annual Report and Accounts for the Group for the year ended 31 December 2017.
Revenue has been disaggregated to reflect the basis on which it is reported to the chief operating decision maker.
Further information can be found in the unaudited Segmental analysis Management basis on pages 132 and 133.
Excluding deferred taxation Operating profit in the Other category is generated from services related to the provision of workspace solutions, including fees from franchise agreements, offset by corporate overheads.
9 7 97 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 4.
SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS ENTITY-WIDE DISCLOSURES The Groups primary activity and only business segment is the provision of global workplace solutions, therefore all revenue is attributed to a single group of similar products and services.
It is not meaningful to separate this group into further categories of products.
Revenue is recognised where the service is provided.

Net of 8.5m derecognised on the finalisation of the accounting for prior year acquisitions previously reported on a provisional basis Cash-generating units CGUs, defined as individual business centres, are grouped by country of operation for the purposes of carrying out impairment reviews of goodwill as this is the lowest level at which it can be assessed.
Goodwill acquired through business combinations is held at a country level and is subject to impairment reviews based on the cash flows of the CGUs within that country.

GOODWILL CONTINUED The goodwill attributable to the reportable business segments is as follows: 2018 2017 Carrying amount of goodwill included within: m m Americas 299.7 285.8 EMEA 125.4 125.1 Asia 35.2 34.7 United Kingdom 218.9 221.1 679.2 666.7 The carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangibles allocated to two countries, the USA and the UK, is material relative to the total carrying value, comprising 73% of the total.
The remaining 27% of the carrying value is allocated to a further 43 countries.
The goodwill and indefinite life intangibles allocated to the USA and the UK are set out below: Intangible Goodwill assets 2018 2017 m m m m USA 277.1 277.1 262.4 United Kingdom 218.9 11.2 230.1 232.3 Other countries 183.2 183.2 183.2 679.2 11.2 690.4 677.9 The indefinite life intangible asset relates to the brand value arising from the acquisition of the remaining 58% of the UK business in the year ended 31 December 2006 see note 12.
The value in use for each country has been determined using a model which derives the individual value in use for each country from the value in use of the Group as a whole.
Although the model includes budgets and forecasts prepared by management it also reflects external factors, such as capital market risk pricing as reflected in the market capitalisation of the Group and prevailing tax rates, which have been used to determine the risk adjusted discount rate for the Group.
Management believes that the projected cash flows are a reasonable reflection of the likely outcomes over the medium to long term.
In the event that trading conditions deteriorate beyond the assumptions used in the projected cash flows, it is also possible that impairment charges could arise in future periods.
The following key assumptions have been used in calculating the value in use for each country: Future cash flows are based on forecasts prepared by management.
The model excludes cost savings and restructurings that are anticipated but had not been committed to at the date of the determination of the value in use.
Thereafter, forecasts have been prepared by management for a further four years from 2019 that reflect an average annual growth rate of the three-year average inflation rate of the country 2017: 3% : These forecasts exclude the impact of acquisitive growth expected to take place in future periods: Management considers these projections to be a reasonable projection of margins expected at the mid-cycle position.
Cash flows beyond 2022 have been extrapolated using the same three-year average inflation growth rate which management believes is a reasonable long-term growth rate for any of the markets in which the relevant countries operate.
A terminal value is included in the assessment, reflecting the Groups expectation that it will continue to operate in these markets and the long-term nature of the businesses: and The Group applies a country specific pre-tax discount rate to the pre-tax cash flows for each country.
The country specific discount rate is based on the underlying weighted average cost of capital WACC for the Group.
The Group WACC is then adjusted for each country to reflect the assessed market risk specific to that country.
The Group pre-tax WACC increased from 9.9% in 2017 to 10.4% in 2018 posttax WACC: 8.3%.
The country specific pre-tax WACC reflecting the respective market risk adjustment has been set between 9.7% and 14.1% 2017: 9.3% to 12.8%.
The amounts by which the values in use exceed the carrying amounts of goodwill are sufficiently large to enable the Directors to conclude that a reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would not result in an impairment charge in any of the countries.
Foreseeable events are unlikely to result in a change in the projections of such a significant nature as to result in the goodwill carrying amount exceeding their recoverable amount.
The forecast models used in assessing the impairment of goodwill are based on the related business centre structure at the end of the year.
The US model assumes an average centre contribution of 17% over the next five years.
Revenue and costs grow at 1.2% per annum from 2019.
A terminal value centre gross margin of 17% is adopted from 2023, with a 1.2% long-term growth rate assumed on revenue and costs into perpetuity.
The cash flows have been discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 14% 2017: 10%.
The UK model assumes an average centre contribution of 11% over the next five years.
Revenue and costs grow at 2.4% per annum from 2019.
A terminal value centre gross margin of 13% is adopted from 2023, with a 2.4% long-term growth rate assumed on revenue and costs into perpetuity.
The cash flows have been discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 10% 2017: 10%.
1 0 4 IWG PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2018 104 IWG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Management has considered the following sensitivities: Market growth and WIPOW Management has considered the impact of a variance in market growth and WIPOW.
The value in use calculation shows that if the long-term growth rate was reduced to nil, the recoverable amount of the US and UK would still be greater than their carrying value.
Discount rate Management has considered the impact of an increase in the discount rate applied to the calculation.
The value in use calculation shows that for the recoverable amount to be less than its carrying value, the pre-tax discount rate would have to be increased to 20% 2017: 12% for the US and 12% 2017: 16% for the UK.
Occupancy Management has considered the impact of a variance in occupancy.
The value in use calculation shows that for the recoverable amount to be less than its carrying value, occupancy would have to decrease by 4% 2017: 6% for the US and 2% 2017: 6% for the UK.
Includes 0.1m on the finalisation of the accounting for prior year acquisitions previously reported on a provisional basis Included within the brand value is 11.2m relating to the acquisition of the remaining 58% of the UK business in the year ended 31 December 2006.
The Regus brand acquired in this transaction is assumed to have an indefinite useful life due to the fact that the value of the brand is intrinsically linked to the continuing operation of the Group.
As a result of the Regus brand acquired with the UK business having an indefinite useful life no amortisation is charged but the carrying value is assessed for impairment on an annual basis.
The brand was tested at the balance sheet date against the recoverable amount of the UK business segment at the same time as the goodwill arising on the acquisition of the UK business see note 11.
The remaining amortisation life for definite life brands is six years.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The objectives, policies and strategies applied by the Group with respect to financial instruments and the management of capital are determined at Group level.
The Groups Board maintains responsibility for the risk management strategy of the Group and the Chief Financial Officer is responsible for policy on a day-to-day basis.
The Chief Financial Officer and Group Treasurer review the Groups risk management strategy and policies on an ongoing basis.
The Board has delegated to the Group Audit Committee the responsibility for applying an effective system of internal control and compliance with the Groups risk management policies.
Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risks arise in the normal course of business.
Going concern The Strategic Report on pages 1 to 44 of the Annual Report and Accounts sets out the Groups strategy and the factors that are likely to affect the future performance and position of the business.
The financial review on pages 30 to 33 within the Strategic Report reviews the trading performance, financial position and cash flows of the Group.
During the year ended 31 December 2018, the Group made a significant investment in growth and the Groups net debt position increased by 164.4m to a net debt position of 460.8m as at 31 December 2018.
The investment in growth is funded by a combination of cash flow generated from the Groups mature business centres and debt.
The Group had a 750.0m revolving credit facility provided by a group of relationship banks with a final maturity in 2023.
As at 31 December 2018, 125.4m was available and undrawn.
The revolving credit facility was increased from 750.0m to 950.0m in January 2019 and the final maturity extended to 2024 with an option to extend until 2026.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and, accordingly, continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.
Credit risk Credit risk could occur where a customer or counterparty defaults under the contractual terms of a financial instrument and arises principally in relation to customer contracts and the Groups cash deposits.
A diversified customer base, requirement for customer deposits, and payments in advance on workstation contracts minimise the Groups exposure to customer credit risk.
No single customer contributes a material percentage of the Groups revenue.
The Groups policy is to provide against trade receivables when specific debts are judged to be irrecoverable or where formal recovery procedures have commenced.
A provision taking into account the customer deposit held is created where debts are more than three months overdue, which reflects the Groups experience of the likelihood of recoverability of these trade receivables based on both historical and forward looking information.
These provisions are reviewed on an ongoing basis to assess changes in the likelihood of recoverability.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date, not taking into account customer deposits held, analysed by geographic region, is summarised below.
2018 2017 m m Americas 33.3 27.8 EMEA 94.8 75.0 Asia Pacific 51.7 41.6 United Kingdom 50.0 54.9 229.8 199.3 1 1 0 IWG PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2018 110 IWG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS All of the Groups trade receivables relate to customers purchasing workplace solutions and associated services and no individual customer has a material balance owing as a trade receivable.
The ageing of trade receivables at 31 December was: Gross Provision Gross Provision 2018 2018 2017 2017 m m m m Not overdue 175.6 132.4 Past due 0 30 days 38.2 43.3 Past due 31 60 days 11.6 13.8 More than 60 days 26.6 22.2 31.6 21.8 252.0 22.2 221.1 21.8 At 31 December 2018, the Group maintained a provision of 22.2m for expected credit losses 2017: 21.8m arising from trade receivables.
The Group had provided 17.7m 2017: 16.2m in the year and utilised 17.3m 2017: 13.5m.
Customer deposits of 483.2m 2017: 429.8m are held by the Group, mitigating the risk of default.
IFRS 9 requires the Group to record expected credit losses on all of its receivables, either on a 12-month or lifetime basis.
The Group has applied the simplified approach to all trade receivables, which requires the recognition of the expected credit loss based on the lifetime expected losses.
The expected credit loss is mitigated through the invoicing of contracted services in advance and customer deposits of 483.2m 2017: 429.8m held at the end of the year.
The Group believes no provision is generally required for trade receivables that are not overdue as they are not considered credit impaired.
Cash investments and derivative financial instruments are only transacted with counterparties of sound credit ratings, and management does not expect any of these counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.
Liquidity risk The Group manages liquidity risk by closely monitoring the global cash position, the available and undrawn credit facilities, and forecast capital expenditure and expects to have sufficient liquidity to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group has free cash and liquid investments excluding blocked cash of 64.8m 2017: 45.7m.
In addition to cash and liquid investments, the Group had 125.4m available and undrawn under its committed borrowings.
The Directors consider the Group has adequate liquidity to meet day-to-day requirements.
The Group maintains a revolving credit facility provided by a group of international banks.
In May, the amount of the facility was increased from 550.0m to 750.0m with the final maturity extended to May 2023.
As at 31 December, 125.4m was available and undrawn under this facility.
The debt provided under the credit facility is floating rate, however, as part of the Groups balance sheet management and to protect against a future increase in interest rates, 70.0m and $30.0m were swapped into a fixed rate liability for a three-year period, maturing in 2019 with an average fixed rate of respectively 0.7% and 1.8% excluding funding margin.
A further 30.0m maturing in 2021 was added in 2018 with a fixed rate of 1.2%.
Although the Group has net current liabilities of 610.3m 2017: 560.3m, the Group does not consider that this gives rise to a liquidity risk.
A large proportion of the net current liabilities comprise non-cash liabilities such as deferred income which will be recognised in future periods through the income statement.
The Group holds customer deposits of 483.2m 2017: 429.8m which are spread across a large number of customers and no deposit held for an individual customer is material.
Therefore, the Group does not believe the balance represents a liquidity risk.
The net current liabilities, excluding deferred income, were 290.3m at 31 December 2018 2017: 275.0m.
Market risk The Group is exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and the market value of our investments in financial assets.
These exposures are actively managed by the Group treasury department in accordance with a written policy approved by the Board of Directors.
The Group does not use financial derivatives for trading or speculative reasons.
Interest rate risk The Group manages its exposure to interest rate risk through the relative proportions of fixed rate debt and floating rate debt.
Any surplus cash balances are invested short-term, and at the end of 2018 no cash was invested for a period exceeding three months.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate movements.
No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.
The foreign currency exposure arising from open third-party transactions held in a currency other than the functional currency of the related entity is summarised as follows: 2018 m GBP EUR USD Trade and other receivables 1.1 20.8 2.3 Trade and other payables 0.8 3.9 8.6 Net statement of financial position exposure 0.3 16.9 6.3 2017 m GBP EUR USD Trade and other receivables 0.1 0.6 16.7 Trade and other payables 6.7 8.7 10.4 Net statement of financial position exposure 6.6 8.1 6.3 Other market risks The Group does not hold any available-for-sale equity securities and is therefore not subject to risks of changes in equity prices in the income statement.
Sensitivity analysis For the year ended 31 December 2018, it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would have decreased the Groups profit before tax by approximately 4.0m 2017: decrease of 2.6m with a corresponding decrease in total equity.
It is estimated that a five-percentage point weakening in the value of the US dollar against sterling would have decreased the Groups profit before tax by approximately 13.4m for the year ended 31 December 2018 2017: decrease of 8.6m.
It is estimated that a fivepercentage point weakening in the value of the euro against sterling would have decreased the Groups profit before tax by approximately 0.8m for the year ended 31 December 2018 2017: decrease of 1.7m.
It is estimated that a five-percentage point weakening in the value of the US dollar against sterling would have decreased the Groups total equity by approximately 11.6m for the year ended 31 December 2018 2017: 11.1m.
It is estimated that a five-percentage point weakening in the value of the euro against sterling would have decreased the Groups total equity by approximately 3.0m for the year ended 31 December 2018 2017: decrease of 1.1m.

Valuation techniques When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses market observable data as far as possible.
Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows: Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
The following tables show the valuation techniques used in measuring level 2 fair values and methods used for financial assets and liabilities not measured at fair value: Type Valuation technique Cash and cash equivalents, trade and other For cash and cash equivalents, receivables payables with a remaining life of less receivables payables and customer deposits than one year and customer deposits, the book value approximates the fair value because of their short-term nature.
Loans and overdrafts The fair value of bank loans, overdrafts and other loans approximates the carrying value because interest rates are at floating rates where payments are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.
Foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps The fair values are based on a combination of broker quotes, forward pricing and swap models.
There was no significant unobservable input used in our valuation techniques.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED 2014 CIP Investment and matching grants The total number of matching awards made in 2014 to each participant was divided into three separate equal amounts and is subject to future performance periods of three, four and five years respectively.
Thus, conditional on meeting the performance targets, the first amount will vest in March 2017, the second will vest in March 2018 and the third will vest in March 2019.
These vesting dates relate to the financial years ending 31 December 2016, 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2018 respectively.
The vesting of these awards is subject to the achievement of challenging corporate performance targets.
75% of each of the three amounts is subject to defined adjusted earnings per share EPS targets over the respective performance periods.

0.3m of the above goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
If the above acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2018, the revenue and net retained profit arising from these acquisitions would have been 4.6m and 0.1m respectively.
In the year, the equity acquisitions contributed revenue of 1.7m and net retained profit of 0.6m.
There was 0.3m contingent consideration arising on the 2018 acquisitions.
Contingent consideration of 1.8m 2017: 2.1m was also paid during the current year with respect to milestones achieved on prior year acquisitions.
The acquisition costs associated with these transactions were 0.2m, recorded within administration expenses within the consolidated income statement.
For a number of the acquisitions in 2018, the fair value of assets acquired has only been provisionally assessed, pending completion of a fair value assessment which has not yet been completed due to the limited time available between the date of acquisitions and the year-end date.
The main changes in the provisional fair values expected are for the fair value of the leases asset or liability, customer relationships and plant, property and equipment.
The final assessment of the fair value of these assets will be made within 12 months of the acquisition date and any adjustments reported in future reports.

KEY JUDGEMENTAL AND ESTIMATES AREAS ADOPTED IN PREPARING THESE ACCOUNTS The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make certain judgements and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures.
Fair value accounting for business combinations For each business combination, we assess the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired.
Where there is not an active market in the category of the non-current assets typically acquired with a business centre or where the books and records of the acquired company do not provide sufficient information to derive an accurate valuation, management calculates an estimated fair value based on available information and experience.
The main categories of acquired non-current assets where managements judgement has an impact on the amounts recorded include tangible fixed assets, customer list intangibles and the fair market value of leasehold assets and liabilities.
For significant business combinations management also obtains third-party valuations to provide additional guidance as to the appropriate valuation to be included in the financial statements.
Valuation of intangibles and goodwill We evaluate the fair value of goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets to assess potential impairments on an annual basis, or during the year if an event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset.
We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill based on our CGUs aggregated at a country level and make that determination based upon future cash flow projections which assume certain growth projections which may or may not occur.
We record an impairment loss for goodwill when the carrying value of the asset is less than its estimated recoverable amount.
Further details of the methodology and assumptions applied to the impairment review in the year ended 31 December 2018, including the sensitivity to changes in those assumptions, can be found in note 11.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment We evaluate the potential impairment of property, plant and equipment at a centre CGU level where there are indicators of impairment at the balance sheet date.
In the assessment of value-in-use, key judgemental areas in determining future cash flow projections include: an assessment of the location of the centre: the local economic situation: competition: local environmental factors: the management of the centre: and future changes in occupancy, revenue and costs of the centre.
Tax assets and liabilities We base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and, in certain cases, business plans and other expectations about future outcomes.
Changes in existing laws and rates, and their related interpretations, and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time.
Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents managements best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates.
It is current Group policy to recognise a deferred tax asset when it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets can be used.
The Group considers it probable if the entity has made a taxable profit in the previous year, current year and is forecast to continue to make a profit in the foreseeable future.
Where appropriate, the Group assesses the potential risk of future tax liabilities arising from the operation of its business in multiple tax jurisdictions and includes provisions within tax liabilities for those risks that can be estimated reliably.
Changes in existing tax laws can affect large international groups such as IWG and could result in significant additional tax liabilities over and above those already provided for.
Onerous lease provisions We evaluate the performance of centres to determine whether any leases are considered onerous, i. e. the Group does not expect to recover the unavoidable lease costs up to the first break point at the Groups option.
A provision for our estimate of the net amounts payable under the terms of the lease to the first break point, discounted at an appropriate discount rate, is recognised where appropriate.
Dilapidations Certain of our leases with landlords include a clause obliging the Group to hand the property back in the condition as at the date of signing the lease.
The costs to bring the property back to that condition are not known until the Group exits the property so the Group estimates the costs at each balance sheet date.
However, given that landlords often regard the nature of changes made to properties as improvements, the Group estimates that it is unlikely that any material dilapidation payments will be necessary.
A provision is recognised for those potential dilapidation payments when it is probable that an outflow will occur and can be reliably estimated.
