The fair value attributable to intangible assets acquired through a business combination is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows to be generated from that asset at the risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital for the Group.
The residual values of intangible assets are assumed to be nil.
The estimated useful economic lives of intangible assets are as follows: Customer lists and relationships 3 to 15 years Brands 2 to 15 years Product development up to 5 years Computer software 3 to 5 years The following are the main categories of intangible assets with finite useful lives: a Customer lists and relationships Customer lists and relationships are acquired as part of business combinations.
No value is attributed to internally generated customer lists or relationships.
b Brands Brands are acquired as part of business combinations.
No value is attributed to internally generated brands as expenditure incurred to develop, maintain and renew brands internally is recognised as an expense in the period incurred.
c Product development Costs incurred in the design and testing of new or improved products are recognised as intangible assets only if the cost can be measured reliably, and it is probable that the project will be a success considering its commercial and technological feasibility.
Capitalised product development expenditure is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Other development expenditure, and all research expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred.
Development costs recognised as an expense are never reclassified as an asset in a subsequent period.
Development costs that have been capitalised are amortised from the date the product is made available.
d Computer software Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products that are controlled by the Group including employee costs and external software development costs are recognised as intangible assets if they are expected to generate economic benefits beyond one year, in excess of their cost.
Purchased computer software is initially recognised based on the costs incurred to acquire and bring it into use.
Costs associated with maintaining computer software are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
Includes 654.8m 2017: 590.1m relating to the US Pest Control CGU.
Regional classifications have been revised in 2018 and comparative data has been restated.
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired business at the date of acquisition.
It is recognised as an intangible asset.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of an associate is included in investments in associates.
