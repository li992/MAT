The recognition of these balances will not impact the overall cash flows of the Group or the cash generation per share.
Right-of-use asset & related lease liability These adjustments reflect the right-of-use asset recognised on transition, together with the related lease liability.
The initial lease liability is equal to the present value of the lease payments during the lease term that have not yet been paid.
The cost of the right-ofuse asset comprises the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability, plus any additional direct costs associated with setting up the lease.
Rent prepayments at the date of transition have been offset against the value of the liability recognised.
Rent & finance costs Conventional rent charges recognised in the profit or loss under IAS 17 are fide-recognised on adoption of IFRS 16.
The payments associated with these charges instead form part of the lease payments used in calculating the right-of-use asset and related lease liability noted above.
The lease liability is measured in subsequent periods using the effective interest rate method, based on the applicable interest rate determined at the date of transition.
The related finance costs arising on subsequent measurement are recognised directly through profit or loss.
Depreciation & lease payments Depreciation on the right-of-use asset recognised is depreciated over the life of the lease on a straight-line basis, adjusted for any period between the lease commencement date and the date the related centre opens, reflecting the lease related costs directly incurred in preparing the business centre for trading.
Lease payments reduce the lease liability recognised in the balance sheet.
Other adjustments On transition, the remaining net book value of rent costs previously capitalised, as costs directly incurred in preparing the business centre for trading i. e. as part of property, plant and equipment, are fide-recognised and eliminated directly against retrained earnings.
Parking related costs previously expensed under IAS 17, but explicitly detailed within lease agreements, are fide-recognised from profit or loss and included as part of the right-of-use asset and related lease liability recognised on transition.
IWG acts as a lessor in a handful of instances.
On transition, the difference between the right-of-use asset costs arising on the headlease and the related finance lease receivable on the sub-lease is recognised directly in retained earnings.
The income statement is only impacted by the finance expenses from the head-lease offset by the finance income from the sub-lease.
Taxation The underlying tax charge is not impacted by IFRS 16 over the life of the leases but there is expected to be an upward impact on the expected tax rate ETR in the short term.
On transition however, the adoption of IFRS 16 impacts the profitability of various countries across the Group, resulting in a decrease in the deferred tax asset recognised in respect of those countries.
As this impact arises on the adoption of IFRS 16, the corresponding tax adjustment is recognised directly in retained earnings.
