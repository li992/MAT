Except where otherwise stated, the disclosures provided in this note exclude: Interests in subsidiaries and joint ventures accounted for in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standard 10 IFRS 10, Consolidated Financial Statements and International Financial Reporting Standard 11 IFRS 11, Joint Arrangements.
Retirement benefit assets and obligations.
Financial instruments, contracts and obligations under share based payment transactions.
Liabilities or assets that are not contractual such as income taxes that are created as a result of statutory requirements imposed by governments, prepayments, provisions and deferred income are not financial liabilities or financial assets.
Accordingly, prepayments, provisions, deferred income and amounts payable or receivable in respect of corporation tax, sales tax including UK Value Added Tax, payroll tax and other taxes are excluded from the disclosures provided in this note.
b Carrying values of financial assets and financial liabilities The carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and their respective fair values were: 2018 2017 2018 2017 Carrying value Carrying value Fair value Fair value Note m m m m Financial assets Available for sale investments 2.7 2.7 Loans and receivables Non-current assets Other receivables 17 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 Current assets Accrued income 17 45.4 54.0 45.4 54.0 Trade receivables, net of impairment 17 105.2 254.4 105.2 254.4 Other receivables 17 12.0 39.4 12.0 39.4 Cash and cash equivalents 18 238.2 313.3 238.2 313.3 Total financial assets 403.7 661.3 403.7 661.3 Financial liabilities Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost Non-current liabilities Borrowings 20 606.9 693.0 636.6 737.0 Current liabilities Trade payables 19 129.7 270.0 129.7 270.0 Accruals 19 340.8 436.7 340.3 436.7 Loan from joint venture 19 1.7 1.7 1.7 1.7 Loan from non-controlling interest 19 16.5 5.8 5.8 Borrowings 20 36.9 40.5 36.9 40.5 Total financial liabilities 1,132.5 1,447.7 1,145.2 1,491.7 Net financial liabilities 728.8 786.4 741.5 830.4 Derivatives that are designated as effective hedging instruments are not shown in the above table.
Information on the carrying value of such derivatives is provided in note 24 g. The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities shown above are determined as follows: The carrying value of 2.7m 29 April 2017: Nil of an available for sale investment is measured at cost, which based on recent transactions is considered to be a reasonable approximation of fair value.
The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accrued income, trade receivables and other receivables is considered to be a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Given the short average time to maturity, no specific assumptions on discount rates have been made.
The effect of credit losses not already reflected in the carrying value as impairment losses is assumed to be immaterial.
The carrying value of trade payables, accruals and loan from joint venture is considered to be a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Given the relatively short average time to maturity, no specific assumptions on discount rates have been made.
Contractual arrangements in place regarding the 16.5m loan from a non-controlling interest and related accrued interest of 0.5m mean that the Directors considered as at 28 April 2018 that it was very unlikely that the counterparty would be able to recover any portion of the loan or that the Group would be required to repay that loan.
Since 28 April 2018, any loan amounts owed by the Group to the non-controlling interest have been waived by the non-controlling interest.
The fair value of fixed-rate notes included in borrowings that are quoted on a recognised stock exchange is determined with reference to the bid price as at the balance sheet date.
The carrying value of fixed-rate notes that are not quoted on a recognised stock exchange and fixed-rate hire purchase and finance lease liabilities included in borrowings is considered to be a reasonable approximation of fair value taking account of the amounts involved in the context of total financial liabilities and the fixed interest rates relative to market interest rates at the balance sheet date.
We do not consider that the fair value of financial instruments would change materially from that shown above as a result of any reasonable change to the assumptions made in determining the fair values shown above.
The fair value of financial instruments, and in particular the fixed rate notes, would be affected by changes in market interest rates.
Excluding the element hedged in a fair value hedge, we estimate that a 100 basis points reduction in market interest rates would increase the fair value of the fixed-rate notes liability by around 21.6m 2017: 26.1m.

This note c presents qualitative information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, including the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk: there have been no significant changes to these matters during the year ended 28 April 2018.
This note c also provides summary quantitative data about the Groups exposure to each risk.
In addition, information on the Groups management of capital is provided in section 1.6.
8.3 of the Strategic report which forms part of these financial statements.
The Groups overall financial risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the likelihood and or magnitude of adverse effects on the financial performance and financial position of the Group.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments from time to time to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risk, commodity price risk and interest rate movements.
The Group does not generally hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
A Group Treasury Committee and central treasury department Group Treasury oversee financial risk management in the context of policies approved by the Board.
Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in co-operation with the Groups operating units.
Group Treasury is responsible for the execution of derivative financial instruments to manage financial risks.
Certain financial risk management activities for example, the management of credit risk arising from trade and other receivables are devolved to the management of individual business units.
The Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and investing excess liquidity.
i Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices and commodity prices will affect the Groups financial performance and or financial position.
The objective of the Groups management of market risk is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters.
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments in the ordinary course of business, and also incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage market risks.
All such transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by the Board.
Generally the Group seeks to apply hedge accounting in order to reduce volatility in the consolidated income statement.

The Group is exposed to foreign currency translation risk principally as a result of net investments in foreign operations and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies.
The Group has material foreign investments in Canada and the USA.
To reduce balance sheet translation exposure, the Group partially hedges the sterling carrying value of foreign operations through borrowings denominated in their functional currency or, where appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments.
Gains and losses arising from hedging instruments that provide a hedge against foreign net investments are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
A US$150.0m bond issued in October 2012 has been accounted for as a hedge of the Groups foreign net investments.
The Groups objective in managing and measuring foreign currency translation risk associated with net investments in foreign operations and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies is to maintain an appropriate cost of borrowing and retain some potential for benefiting from currency movements whilst partially hedging against adverse currency movements.
It is the Groups policy to examine each foreign investment individually and to adopt an appropriate hedging strategy.
The Group measures foreign currency translation risk by identifying the carrying value of assets and liabilities denominated in the relevant foreign currency and quantifying the impact on equity of changes in the relevant foreign currency rate.
The Groups consolidated income statement is principally exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates in the following ways: The translation of the revenues and costs of the Groups North American operations: and The translation of interest payable on US dollar denominated debt.
The Groups consolidated balance sheet exposures to foreign currency translation risk excluding immaterial exposure to Euros were as follows: 2018 2017 m m US dollars Net investments in foreign operations excluding intra-group balances, cash and borrowings 217.5 243.3 Cash 25.8 22.9 Borrowings 165.8 224.3 Canadian dollars Net investments in foreign operations excluding intra-group balances, cash and borrowings 18.6 23.0 Cash 2.4 2.1 Net exposure 98.5 67.0 The amounts shown above are the carrying values of all US and Canadian dollar items in the consolidated balance sheet that would have differed at the balance sheet date had a different foreign currency exchange rate been applied, except that derivatives that are cash flow hedges are excluded.
The sensitivity of the amounts shown above in the Groups consolidated balance sheet to US and Canadian dollar translation exposures is illustrated below: 2018 2017 US dollar US dollar balance sheet foreign exchange rate 1.3797 1.2937 Impact of 10% depreciation of UK sterling against US dollar US dollar foreign exchange rate 1.2417 1.1643 Increase in consolidated equity m 8.6 4.7 Impact of 10% appreciation of UK sterling against US dollar US dollar foreign exchange rate 1.5177 1.4231 Decrease in consolidated equity m 7.0 3.8 Canadian dollar Canadian dollar balance sheet foreign exchange rate 1.7745 1.7689 Impact of 10% depreciation of UK sterling against Canadian dollar Canadian dollar foreign exchange rate 1.5971 1.5920 Increase in consolidated equity m 2.3 2.8 Impact of 10% appreciation of UK sterling against Canadian dollar Canadian dollar foreign exchange rate 1.9520 1.9458 Decrease in consolidated equity m 1.9 2.3 The above sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions: Only those foreign currency assets and liabilities that are directly affected by changes in foreign exchange rates are included in the calculation.
The above calculations assume that the exchange rates between sterling and any currencies other than the one stated do not change as a result of the change in the exchange rate between the currencies stated.

That is based on the following assumptions: Only those income statement items directly affected by changes in foreign exchange rates are included in the calculation.
For example, changes in the sterling value of commodity prices that indirectly occur due to changes in foreign exchange rates are not included in the sensitivity calculation.
Exchange rates between sterling and any currencies other than the one stated do not change as a result of the change in the exchange rate between the currencies stated.
Foreign currency transactional risk Foreign currency transactional risk is the risk that future cash flows such as from sales and purchases of goods and services will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
The Group is exposed to limited foreign currency transactional risk due to the low value of transactions entered into by subsidiaries in currencies other than their functional currency.
Group Treasury carries out forward buying of currencies where appropriate.
The Group reviews and considers hedging of actual and forecast foreign exchange transactional exposures up to one year forward.
At 28 April 2018 there were Nil net transactional foreign currency exposures 2017: Nil.
The Groups exposure to commodity price risk includes a foreign currency element due to the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on the sterling cost of fuel for the Groups UK operations.
The effect of foreign exchange rate movements on sterling-denominated fuel prices is managed through the use of fuel derivative financial instruments denominated in the functional currency in which the fuel is purchased.
Further information on fuel hedging is given under the heading Price risk on page 122.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk principally through its borrowings and interest rate derivatives.
It has a mixture of fixed-rate borrowings where the fair value is exposed to changes in market interest rates, cash and floating-rate borrowings where the future cash flows are exposed to changes in market interest rates.
The Groups objective with regards to interest rate risk is to reduce the risk of changes in interest rates significantly affecting future cash flows and or profit.
To provide some certainty as to the level of interest cost, it is the Groups policy to manage interest rate exposure through the use of fixed and floating rate debt.
Derivative financial instruments are also used where appropriate to generate the desired interest rate profile.
The Group measures interest rate risk by quantifying the relative proportions of each of gross debt and net debt that are effectively subject to fixed interest rates and considers the duration for which the relevant interest rates are fixed.

The floating rate financial liabilities bear interest at rates fixed in advance for periods ranging from one to six months based on market rates.
The maturity profile of the Groups borrowings is shown in note 20 a.
The Groups financial assets on which floating interest is receivable include cash deposits and cash in hand of 238.2m 2017: 313.3m and the Groups financial asset on which fixed interest is receivable is a loan receivable of 1.0m 2017: Nil.
As at 28 April 2018, the Group had no other financial assets on which fixed interest is receivable 2017: Nil.
The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
The net impact of a change of 100 basis points on all relevant floating interest rates on annualised interest payable on cash and borrowings balances outstanding at the balance sheet date was not material.
Price risk The Group is exposed to commodity price risk.
The Groups operations as at 28 April 2018 consume approximately 385m litres of diesel fuel per annum.
As a result, the Groups future profit and cash flows are exposed to movements in the underlying price of fuel.
The Groups objective in managing commodity price risk is to reduce the risk that movements in fuel prices result in adverse movements in its profit and cash flow.
The Group has a policy of managing the volatility in its fuel costs by maintaining an ongoing fuel-hedging programme whereby derivatives are used to fix or cap the variable unit cost of a percentage of anticipated fuel consumption.
The Groups exposure to commodity price risk is measured by quantifying the element of projected future fuel costs, after taking account of derivatives in place, which varies due to movements in fuel prices.
Group Treasury is responsible for the processes for measuring and managing commodity price risk.
The Groups overall fuel costs include the impact of delivery margins, fuel taxes and fuel tax rebates.
These elements of fuel costs are not managed as part of Group Treasurys commodity price risk management and are managed directly by business unit management.
The Group uses a number of fuel derivatives to hedge against movements in the price of the different types of fuel used in each of its divisions.
The fuel derivatives hedge the underlying commodity price risk denominated in US$ and in the case of the UK Bus regional operations Division, the UK Bus London Division and the UK Rail Division, they also hedge the currency risk due to the commodity being priced in US$ and the functional currency of the divisions being pounds sterling.

After taking account of financial derivatives, the projected fuel costs for the next twelve months are not materially exposed to movements in fuel prices.
The revenue receivable under certain of the contracts that the Group has with customers is subject to adjustment for changes to certain fuel prices.
This further reduces the unhedged exposure to fuel prices shown above.
Demand for the Groups services can also be affected by movements in fuel prices due to the impact on the cost of competing transport services, including private cars.
The Group is also exposed to changes in electricity prices, principally in its UK Rail Division where electricity is consumed to power some of the trains operated.
The Group has some protection to price changes via rail industry arrangements to fix the price on a proportion of anticipated future electricity consumption.
The Groups joint venture, Virgin Rail Group, is also exposed to changes in fuel and electricity prices and applies commodity price risk management strategies similar to those applied by the Group and explained above.
ii Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
Credit risk is managed by a combination of Group Treasury and business unit management, and arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to amounts due from outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
The Groups objective is to minimise credit risk to an acceptable level whilst not overly restricting the Groups ability to generate revenue and profit.
It is the Groups policy to invest cash assets safely and profitably.
To control credit risk, counterparty credit limits are set by reference to published credit ratings and the counterpartys geographical location.
The Group considers the risk of material loss in the event of non-performance by a financial counterparty to be low.
In determining whether a financial asset is impaired, the Group takes account of: The fair value of the asset at the balance sheet date and where applicable, the historic fair value of the asset: In the case of receivables, the counterpartys typical payment patterns: In the case of receivables, the latest available information on the counterpartys creditworthiness such as available financial statements, credit ratings etc.
The movement in the provision for impairment of trade and other receivables is shown in note 17.
The table below shows the financial assets exposed to credit risk at the balance sheet date: Gross Impairment Net exposure Gross Impairment Net exposure 2018 2018 2018 2017 2017 2017 m m m m m m Trade receivables 108.3 3.1 105.2 256.9 2.5 254.4 Loans, other receivables and accrued income 57.6 57.6 93.6 93.6 Cash and cash equivalents pledged as collateral 18.5 18.5 18.6 18.6 Cash and cash equivalents other 219.7 219.7 294.7 294.7 Excluding derivative financial instruments 404.1 3.1 401.0 663.8 2.5 661.3 Derivatives used for hedging 41.4 41.4 14.3 14.3 Total exposure to credit risk 445.5 3.1 442.4 678.1 2.5 675.6 Stagecoach Group plc | page 123 159166 STC AR18 Back PRINT 159166 STC AR18 Back v19 05 07 2018 16:01 Page 124 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 24 Financial instruments continued c Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments continued ii Credit risk continued The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer or counterparty.
The Groups largest credit exposures are to the UKs Department for Transport, Transport for London, and other government bodies and financial institutions with short-term credit ratings of A2 or equivalent or better, all of which the Group considers unlikely to default on their respective liabilities to the Group.
The Groups total net exposure to credit risk by geographic region is analysed below: 2018 2017 m m United Kingdom &Europe 386.4 628.8 North America 56.0 46.8 442.4 675.6 The Groups financial assets by currency are analysed below: 2018 2017 m m Sterling &Euros 377.5 621.7 US dollars 61.6 51.2 Canadian dollars 3.3 2.7 442.4 675.6 The amount of financial assets denominated inEuros included in the figures above is immaterial.

iii Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups objective in managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The funding policy is to finance the Group through a mixture of bank, lease and hire purchase debt, capital markets issues and cash generated by the business.
As at 28 April 2018, the Groups credit facilities were 1,043.4m 2017: 1,130.5m, 362.4m 2017: 648.3m of which were utilised, including utilisation for the issuance of bank guarantees, performance season ticket bonds and letters of credit.
The Group had the following undrawn committed banking and uncommitted asset finance facilities: 2018 2017 m m Expiring within one year 196.5 160.3 Expiring beyond two years 484.5 321.9 681.0 482.2 Although there is an element of seasonality in the Groups bus and rail operations, the overall impact of seasonality on working capital and liquidity is not considered significant.
The Board expects the Group to be able to meet current and future funding requirements through free cash flow and available committed facilities.
In addition, the Group has investment grade credit ratings which should allow it access at short notice to additional bank and capital markets debt funding.
The Group has bank lines of credit arranged on a bi-lateral basis with a group of relationship banks which provide bank facilities for general corporate purposes.
These arranged lines of credit allow cash drawdowns to finance the Group and also include facilities which are dedicated to issuing performance season ticket bonds, guarantees and letters of credit.

Where the contractual cash flows are variable based on a price, foreign exchange rate, interest rate or index in the future, the contractual cash flows in the above table have been determined with reference to the value of the relevant price, foreign exchange rate, interest rate or index as at the balance sheet date.
In determining the interest element of contractual cash flows in cases where the Group has a choice as to the length of interest calculation periods and the interest rate that applies varies with the period selected, the contractual cash flows have been calculated assuming the Group selects the shortest available interest calculation periods.
Where the holder of an instrument has a choice of when to redeem, the amounts in the above tables are on the assumption the holder redeems at the earliest opportunity.
In the case of bank loans, which are drawn under revolving facilities, the contracted interest cash flows in respect of interest up to and including the next rollover date are shown and the principal is shown as repayable at the expiry date of the relevant facility Stagecoach Group plc | page 125 159166 STC AR18 Back PRINT 159166 STC AR18 Back v19 05 07 2018 16:01 Page 126 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 24 Financial instruments continued d Accounting policies The Groups significant accounting policies and measurement bases in respect of financial instruments are disclosed in note 1. e Collateral and restricted cash Included within the cash and cash equivalents balance of 238.2m as at 28 April 2018 2017: 313.3m are 18.5m 2017: 18.6m of cash balances that have been pledged as collateral for liabilities as follows: 18.1m 2017: 18.2m has been pledged by the Group as collateral for 18.1m 2017: 18.2m of loan notes that are classified within current liabilities: borrowings.
