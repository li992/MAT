Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 18 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 53 weeks ended 4 February 2018 3 Operating assets continued 3.1 Accounting policies continued Impairment of non-financial assets Intangible assets with indefinite lives, such as goodwill, and those in construction that are not yet being amortised, are tested for impairment annually.
Group policy is to test non-financial assets annually for impairment or if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Testing is performed at the level of a cash generating unit CGU in order to compare the CGUs recoverable amount against its carrying value.
An impaired CGU is written down to its recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use or its fair value less costs to dispose.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
The Group considers that each of its stores is a CGU, which together form a grocery group of CGUs supported by corporate assets such as head office and vertically integrated suppliers.
Impairment losses are reversed if there is evidence of an increase in the recoverable amount of a previously impaired asset, but only to the extent that the recoverable amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Impairment losses relating to goodwill are not reversed.
Any reversal of impairment losses is excluded from underlying earnings.

The Group has performed its annual assessment of its amortisation policies and asset lives and deemed them to be appropriate.
No changes have been made to asset lives during the year.
As in previous years, fully amortised assets are retained in the Groups fixed asset register.
In order to provide greater understanding of the Groups annual amortisation charge, assets which have become fully amortised in the year have been removed from both cost and accumulated amortisation.
Following the annual impairment review conducted by the Group, an impairment charge of 1m 2017: nil has been recognised in relation to intangible assets.
This has been included as an adjustment to underlying earnings see note 1.4.
Goodwill The goodwill arose on the acquisition of Flower World Limited 3m and Farmers Boy Deeside Limited 7m.
Impairment testing of goodwill Goodwill of 10m is allocated to the grocery group of CGUs.
This group of CGUs has been tested for impairment via the value in use calculation described in note 3.3.
The pre-tax discount rate used is 9.0% 2017: 9.0% and the growth rate applied to the period after five years is 2.0% 2017: 2.0%.
