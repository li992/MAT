NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNILEVER GROUP CONTINUED 20.
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES CONTINUED A summary of our contingent liabilities is shown in the table below: million million 2018 2017 a Corporate reorganisation IPI, PIS and COFINS taxes and penalties 2,032 2,092 Inputs for PIS and COFINS taxes 52 16 Goodwill amortisation 177 121 Other tax assessments approximately 600 cases 916 1,095 Total Brazil Tax 3,177 3,324 Brazil other 67 19 Contingent liabilities outside Brazil 414 324 Total contingent liabilities 3,658 3,667 a During 2004, and in common with many other businesses operating in Brazil, one of our Brazilian subsidiaries received a notice of infringement from the Federal Revenue Service in respect of indirect taxes.
The notice alleges that a 2001 reorganisation of our local corporate structure was undertaken without valid business purpose.
The 2001 reorganisation was comparable with restructurings done by many companies in Brazil.
The original dispute was resolved in the courts in the Groups favour.
However, in 2013 a new assessment was raised in respect of a similar matter.
Additionally, during the course of 2014 and again in 2017 and in 2018 other notices of infringement were issued based on the same grounds argued in the previous assessments.
The total amount of the tax assessments in respect of this matter is 2,032 million 2017: 2,092 million.
The judicial process in Brazil is likely to take a number of years to conclude.
The Group believes that the likelihood that the tax authorities will ultimately prevail is low, however there can be no guarantee of success in court.
In each case we believe our position is strong so they have not been provided for and are considered to be contingent liabilities.
Due to the fiscal environment in Brazil the possibility of further tax assessments related to the same matters cannot be ruled out.
The contingent liabilities reported for indirect taxes relating to disputes with the Brazilian authorities are separate from the provisions listed in note 19: Unilever does not have provision and contingent liabilities for the same matters.
ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSALS Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition accounting method as at the acquisition date, which is the date at which control is transferred to the Group.
Goodwill is measured at the acquisition date as the fair value of consideration transferred, plus non-controlling interests and the fair value of any previously-held equity interests less the net recognised amount which is generally fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities assumed.
Goodwill is subject to an annual review for impairment or more frequently if necessary in accordance with our accounting policies.
Any impairment is charged to the income statement as it arises.
Detailed information relating to goodwill is provided in note 9 on pages 97 to 99.
Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, within non-underlying items.
Changes in ownership that do not result in a change of control are accounted for as equity transactions and therefore do not have any impact on goodwill.
The difference between consideration and the non-controlling share of net assets acquired is recognised within equity.
2018 In 2018 the Group completed the following business acquisitions and disposals as listed below.
In each case 100% of the businesses were acquired unless stated otherwise.
Total payment for 2018 acquisitions is 1,294 million 2017: 4,912 million for acquisitions completed during that year.

EFFECT ON CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET ACQUISITIONS The following table sets out the effect of the acquisitions in 2018, 2017 and 2016 on the consolidated balance sheet.
The fair values currently used for opening balances of all acquisitions made in 2018 are provisional, with the exception of Quala, whose opening balance sheet was finalised within 2018.
Balances remain provisional due to missing relevant information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and where valuation work is still ongoing, notably for acquisitions which completed in the second half of 2018.
