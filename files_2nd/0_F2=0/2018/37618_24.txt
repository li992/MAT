Given the Employee Trusts functional currency was previously assessed as Sterling, and thus retranslation of the Balance Sheet into the Groups presentation currency USD was through the cumulative translation adjustment reserve, we have restated this retrospectively from 1 January 2017.
As a result there is a reclassification restatement within brought forward reserves at 1 January 2017, and also a $4 million currency translation difference reclassification between the Own shares held by Employee Trust and Cumulative translation adjustment reserves in 2017, compared to that previously reported.
This restatement has no impact on the Groups income statement, earnings per share, net assets, total capital and reserves attributable to owners of the Parent Company or distributable reserves.
The Group has not presented an additional restatement balance sheet for 1 January 2017 as there is no change to that previously reported.
2 Details of the Groups hedging arrangements are provided in Note 12.
