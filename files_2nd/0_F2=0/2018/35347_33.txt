Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information SECTION 8: REFERENCE INFORMATION This section details reference information relevant to the accounts.
Here we describe the general information about the Group e. g. operations and registered office.
We also set out the basis of preparation of the accounts and general accounting policies that are not specific to any one note.
8.1 GENERAL INFORMATION Drax Group plc the Company is incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act.
The Company and its subsidiaries together, the Group have three principal activities: electricity generation: electricity supply to business customers: and manufacturing of sustainable compressed wood pellets for use in electricity production.
The Groups activities are principally based within the UK, with the wood pellet manufacturing activities situated in the US.
The address of the Companys registered office and principal establishment is Drax Power Station, Selby, North Yorkshire, YO8 8PH, United Kingdom.
A full list of operating companies of the Group is disclosed in note 5 to the Companys separate financial statements, which follow these consolidated financial statements.
8.2 BASIS OF PREPARATION Adoption of new and revised accounting standards A number of new and amended standards became effective for the first time in 2018.
The Group adopted the following from 1 January 2018: IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
IFRS 15 including clarifications issued on 12 April 2016 Revenue from Contracts with Customers effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
Other than the adoption of IFRS 9, these updates and amendments have not had a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
The transition disclosures for IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 have been included in note 8.3.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following new or amended standards and relevant interpretations, which have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective and some of which were pending endorsement by the EU marked by : IAS 40 amended Investment Property effective for annual reportings beginning on or after 1 July 2018.
IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments effective for annual reports beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
IFRS 16 amended Leases effective for annual reports beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
IFRS 10 amended Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 amended Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures 2011 effective date deferred indefinitely.
IAS 28 amended Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures effective from 1 January 2019.
IAS 19 amended Employee Benefits effective from 1 January 2019.
IFRS 3 amended Business Combinations effective from 1 January 2020.
Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting amended effective from 1 January 2020.
IAS 1 amended Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS 8 amended Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors effective from 1 January 2020.
IFRS 17 Insurance contracts effective from 1 January 2021.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 173 SECTION 8: REFERENCE INFORMATION continued 8.2 BASIS OF PREPARATION continued Adoption of the other standards in future periods is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group, other than IFRS 16 as noted below.
IFRS 16 Leases The Group will adopt IFRS 16 from 1 January 2019 and has chosen to adopt the modified retrospective application.
Consequently, comparative information in the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2018 will not be restated.
The new requirements will impact the Groups accounting for lease contracts.
The Groups current operating lease portfolio predominantly relates to properties and the hire of plant and equipment at operating sites.
On transition to IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019, these leases will be brought onto the balance sheet as right-of-use assets, and the Group will recognise a corresponding liability for the amounts payable under the lease contracts.
On transition, the Group will make use of the practical expedient available not to reassess whether a contract is or contains a lease.
Accordingly, the definition of a lease in accordance with IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 will continue to apply to those leases entered into or modified before 1 January 2019.
However, the Group will apply the new definition of a lease to all contracts entered into or modified on or after 1 January 2019.
We do not anticipate this change to have a significant impact on the assessment of contracts that are in scope of the definition of a lease.
For short-term leases 12 months or less and leases of low value assets, the Group will elect to recognise a lease expense on a straightline basis as permitted by IFRS 16.
Short-term leases include those which end within 12 months of transition.
Under IFRS 16, right-of-use assets will be tested for impairment in accordance with our policy outlined in note 2.4.
This will replace the previous requirement to recognise a provision for onerous lease contracts.
Impact on lease accounting As at the reporting date, the Group has non-cancellable operating lease commitments of approximately 31 million.
A preliminary assessment has been concluded that indicates the Group will recognise a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability of approximately 20 million on transition to the new standard in 2019.
This value is lower than the value of non-cancellable minimum lease payments owing to the existence of short-term and low-value leases, and the effect of discounting.
The preliminary assessment indicates that 18 million of the existing lease obligations relate to short-term and leases of low value assets.
The effect of discounting has been estimated for the purpose of this analysis.
The anticipated effect on profit or loss compared to 2018 results for lease contracts in existence at the balance sheet date is a reduction in administrative and operating expenses of approximately 5 million, offset by increases in depreciation of approximately 4 million and finance costs of approximately 1 million.
Actual values may differ from those in this preliminary assessment.
Due to the timing of the transaction the Group has not yet completed any detailed analysis of lease contracts acquired as part of the ScottishPower generation portfolio for this purpose.
Initial investigations indicate the largest lease in the portfolio has a present value of approximately 5 million.
174 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information 8.3 ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND CHANGE IN PRESENTATION OF INCOME STATEMENT IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 supersedes IAS 11 Construction Contracts, IAS 18 Revenue and related interpretations.
It applies to all revenue arising from contracts with customers, unless those contracts are in the scope of other standards.
Adoption of IFRS 15 has not resulted in any changes to the amounts recognised in these financial statements compared to the previous requirements, nor any restatement of the prior period comparative information.
The adoption of IFRS 15 has not resulted in any changes to the amount or timing of revenue recognised in either period.
In accordance with the transition provisions in IFRS 15, the Group has adopted the new requirements retrospectively and has reclassified certain balance sheet receivables and payables for the 2017 financial year.
The Group has applied certain practical expedients on initial application including the exemption from the requirement to apply the standard to contracts that begin and end within the same annual reporting period and contracts completed before 1 January 2017.
These practical expedients did not have a material effect on the financial statements.
The accounting policies, as disclosed in the Annual Report and Accounts for 31 December 2017, have not materially changed.
Particular areas for consideration have been in respect of the growing B2B Energy Supply Segment which supplies to businesses ranging from micro-businesses to large Industrial & Commercial participants.
Larger customers actively rather than passively renew their supply contracts.
These contracts have been separated into two main categories: those with a fixed price for a contracted period of time, and those with a variable or flexible price where the contract price varies according to changes in the cost of supply.
For fixed price contracts, progress is measured with reference to the costs of supply incurred at the point the energy is delivered and revenue is accrued or deferred accordingly.
For variable rate and flexible contracts, revenue is recognised at a point in time when the energy is supplied and is measured at the contracted price per unit supplied.
The B2B Energy Supply business accrues revenue based on estimated usage each period and this is recognised in the balance sheet as accrued income.
Where the consideration received from the customer is in advance of supply, revenue is deferred on the balance sheet.
Generation revenue continues to be recognised at the point of delivery.
Activities within the scope of IFRS 9 see below are outside the scope of IFRS 15.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9 Financial Instruments replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, bringing together all three aspects of accounting for financial instruments: classification and measurement: impairment: and hedge accounting which has been fully adopted by the Group.
On transition to IFRS 9, the key change in the Groups accounting policy for financial instruments is to recognise the cost of hedging explained below initially in a reserve, rather than the income statement.
Amounts are subsequently reclassified from the cost of hedging reserve and recognised in cost of sales in the same period as the hedged item.
This change in policy has been applied retrospectively with comparative information for the period beginning 1 January 2017 being adjusted as though the cost of hedging approach had always been applied for those derivatives that existed at or since 1 January 2017.
Unrealised fair value gains and losses on cash flow hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Gains and losses relating to fuel purchases, which will be recycled to inventory in the balance sheet, are released directly from the hedge reserve.
Prior year comparatives have not been restated for other aspects of IFRS 9, as the effect is not material.
In respect of accounting for trade and other receivables, the Group has applied IFRS 9s simplified approach to provisioning and has calculated this using lifetime expected losses.
This calculation has had no material impact on the financial statements.
The transition to the new standard is complete: however, the Group will monitor emerging developments and interpretations of the new standard.
Changes in presentation of income statement All gains and losses on derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are included in revenue or cost of sales as and when they arise.
However, since the purpose of the derivative contracts concerned is to hedge certain risk exposures, principally commodity price and foreign currency risks, a columnar format has been adopted for the income statement in which adjusted results are presented, excluding certain gains and losses arising from remeasuring derivative contracts to fair value.
The purpose of adjusted results is to reflect sales of electricity and purchases of fuel at the contracted price.
This includes the effect of relevant financial derivatives such as forward foreign currency contracts used to secure the all-in sale or purchase price of the commodity concerned.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 175 SECTION 8: REFERENCE INFORMATION continued 8.3 ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND CHANGE IN PRESENTATION OF INCOME STATEMENT continued The adjusted results therefore in effect apply the accounting treatment that would have applied under IFRS 9 had the derivative contracts concerned qualified for hedge accounting.
This is consistent with the practice followed by other major UK power generation companies.
This change has been applied retrospectively but has not changed the prior year results, only their presentation.
The impact on the previously reported amounts in the income statement and statement of comprehensive income, due to changes in accounting policies, are set out in the tables below.
There have been no changes to the balance sheet other than the creation of a cost of hedging reserve.

Consistent with prior periods, the Group has continued to designate the change in fair value of the spot rate in the Groups cash flow hedge relationships.
As part of the transition, an election has been made to apply the cost of hedging approach resulting in the change in fair value associated with forward points, including currency basis, being initially recognised in equity and subsequently reclassified to profit or loss.
This change in policy has been applied retrospectively.
As a result, the Group reclassified 57.5 million of cumulative losses to the new cost of hedging reserve on initial application and restated the 2017 financial results to reflect 20.8 million of gains plus associated tax of 4.0 million in the cost of hedging reserve.
Fair value gains and losses on cash flow hedges of 85.7 million that relate to fuel purchases, which were recycled to inventory in the balance sheet, have been restated as though they were released directly from reserves and therefore are no longer recognised in Other comprehensive income.
The related deferred tax of 15.6 million has also been reallocated.
Impairment losses on trade receivables are now disclosed separately on the face of the income statement previously included within operational and administrative expenses.
Application of IFRS 9 has not had a material impact on the value of trade receivable impairment losses.
b Representation of the income statement Unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts have been included in the line item to which they relate.
c Other losses There were no material adjustments to the Groups classification and measurement of financial instruments.
The Group has changed its policy regarding the classification of listed equity investments from fair value through profit and loss to fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI.
d Tax charge Upon adoption of IFRS 9, deferred tax and income tax values were adjusted accordingly.

However, it does not reflect any fair value adjustments to the acquired assets and liabilities, as the fair value measurement of these items will only be performed at the date of Completion.
The fair value adjustments, when finalised, may be material.
For the purpose of the pro forma statement of net assets, the excess purchase consideration over the carrying amount of net assets of 456.8m has been attributed to property, plant & equipment.

For the purpose of the unaudited pro forma statement of net assets, the entire purchase price of 702m plus estimated acquisitionrelated costs of 23m have been funded by the acquisition bridge facility.
Drax may use available cash reserves to reduce the amount drawn on completion.
The acquisition-related costs are not included in the calculation of the preliminary uplift as they will be expensed as transaction costs or capitalised as borrowing costs, as required by IFRS.
18m of the acquisition-related costs are expected to be directly attributable to the purchase of the ScottishPower Generation Group.
These costs will be expensed in the income statement.
5m of the acquisition-related costs are expected to be directly attributable to the acquisition bridge facility.
These costs will be capitalised and offset against total borrowings and are expected to be amortised over the 19-month term of the bridge facility as required by IFRS.
This increases interest payable by 3.2m being 12 19 months amortisation of these costs and reducing borrowings by 1.8m in the unaudited pro forma statements.
