The MPRS has become the Auto Enrolment scheme for the Company and as such the Company was liable for backdated contributions for eligible employees to 1 October 2012.
As the MPRS is a defined contribution scheme, the Company is not subject to the same investment, interest rate, inflation or longevity risks as it is for the defined benefit schemes.
The benefits that employees receive are dependent on the contributions paid, investment returns and the form of benefit chosen at retirement.
During the 53 weeks ended 4 February 2018, the Company paid contributions of 3m to the MPRS, and expects to contribute 15m for the following period.

Merger reserve The merger reserve represents the reserve arising on the acquisition in 2004 of Safeway Limited.
This merger reserve was initially considered unrealised on the basis it was represented by investments held by the Company, which is not qualifying consideration in accordance with Tech 02 17 issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales ICAEW.
During the 53 weeks ended 4 February 2018, the majority of the Companys investments were transferred to another Group company, Wm Morrison Supermarkets Holdings Limited, in exchange for an intercompany loan.
To the extent that this intercompany loan is settled in qualifying consideration, the same proportion of the merger reserve becomes realised.
During the period, this intercompany loan balance has been partially settled through 974m of qualifying consideration.
As a result, 974m of the merger reserve balance has become realised.
Hedging reserve This represents the gains and losses arising on derivatives used for cash flow hedging.
