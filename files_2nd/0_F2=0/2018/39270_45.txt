Trade and other receivables The Groups trade receivables are recognised at the transaction price less provision for impairment.
However, management also considers factors that may influence the credit risk of its customer base, including the default risk associated with the industry and country in which customers operate.
The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement.
Movements on provisions for impaired trade receivables are recognised within operating expenses in the income statement.
Amounts charged to the provision for impairment of trade receivables are generally written off when there is no expectation of recovering additional cash.
There is limited concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables due to the Groups customer base being large and diverse.
The maximum amount of credit risk with respect to customers is represented by the carrying amount on the balance sheet.
The Group policy is that credit facilities for new customers are approved by designated managers at regional level.
Credit limits are set with reference to trading history and reports from credit rating agencies where they are available.
Where this is not feasible the Group may request payment in advance of work being carried out, or settlement by credit card on completion of the work.
Overdue accounts are regularly reviewed and impairment provisions are created where necessary with due regard to the historical risk profile of the customer.
There were no new customers in 2018 where the Group considered there was a risk of significant credit default.
There are no trade receivables that would otherwise be past due or impaired whose terms have been renegotiated.
