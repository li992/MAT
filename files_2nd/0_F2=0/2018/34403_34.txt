This represents a full and final settlement of these issues and resulted in a specific item charge of 225m 2016 17: nil, 2015 16: nil.
Restructuring charges During the year weve incurred restructuring charges of 241m 2016 17: nil, 2015 16: nil, primarily relating to leaver costs.
These costs reflect projects within the first phase of our group-wide cost transformation programme which was announced in May 2017 and is expected to total 300m.
Further associated charges relating to the first phase will be recognised in 2018 19 as part of our wider restructuring activity.
See note 30 for further details.
EE acquisition and integration costs We incurred 46m 2016 17: 215m, 2015 16: 113m of acquisition and integration related costs for EE.
Integration costs include EE related restructuring and leaver costs in the year.
In 2016 17, this included a 62m 2015 16: nil amortisation charge relating to the write-off of IT assets as we integrated the EE and BT IT infrastructure.
Property rationalisation costs We have recognised a charge of 28m 2016 17: nil, 2015 16: 29m relating to the rationalisation of the groups property portfolio.
British Telecommunications plc Annual Report & Form 20-F 2018 125 124 British Telecommunications plc Annual Report & Form 20-F 2018 THE STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Regulatory matters Weve recognised a net charge of 49m 2016 17: 479m, 2015 16: nil in relation to regulatory matters in the year.
Of this, 23m is recognised in revenue and 26m in operating costs, these are made up of the following: Deemed Consent In 2016 17 a charge of 342m was recognised 2015 16: nil in relation to Ofcoms March 2017 findings of its investigation into our historical practices on Deemed Consent by Openreach.
We have agreed the majority of compensation payments to other Communications Providers in the year and continue to estimate the total compensation payments will amount to 300m.
Ladder pricing agreements In 2016 17 we recognised revenue and costs of 8m 2015 16: 203m being the prior year impacts of ladder pricing agreements with the other UK mobile operators following a Supreme Court judgment in July 2014.
Other regulatory matters We re-assessed our regulatory risk provision in light of recent regulatory decisions by Ofcom.
As a result we have increased our net charge by 49m 2016 17: 137m for the year.
51m is recognised in provisions offset by a release of 2m in trade and other payables.
Italian business investigation In 2017 18, we have incurred professional costs relating to the investigation of our Italian business of 22m 2016 17: 15m.
As part of the investigation into our Italian business in 2016 17, we reviewed the carrying value of the assets and liabilities on the balance sheet of our Italian business including reassessing the recoverability of trade and other receivables and reconsidering other exposures, principally tax penalties.
We took into account any changes in facts or circumstances since 31 March 2016 in determining whether there was a need to change an estimate and whether additional exposures had arisen.
In the prior year we recognised a charge of 245m in relation to this as well as fees in relation to the investigation of 15m.
During 2017 18 we have reassessed the prior year judgements and estimates we made as a result of the investigation into our Italian business.
We concluded that the total adjustments recorded in 2016 17, either as part of the prior year revision or as a specific item, remain appropriate and thus no further adjustment is required.
We identified offsetting movements in individual balance sheet line items which were not material either individually or in aggregate.
These movements have been adjusted in the 2017 18 balance sheet.
Profit on disposal of businesses During the year we disposed of non-core businesses with a gain on disposal of 1m 2016 17: 16m, 2015 16: nil.
EE fair value adjustment In 2015 16 we recognised a fair value adjustment on the acquisition of EE which reduced the amount of deferred income in relation to its prepaid subscriber base by 70m with no cash impact.
The step down reflects the difference between the amount recorded by EE on acquisition and the fair value calculated based on the incremental cost that a market participant would incur to take on the liability plus a reasonable profit margin.
This amount was released as a reduction to revenue in the period between acquisition and 31 March 2016, reflecting the period over which EE provided the related service.
Out of period irrecoverable VAT In 2016 17, we recorded a charge of 30m for out of period irrecoverable VAT.
We also recorded a further 1m related interest charge.
Interest expense on retirement benefit obligation See note 19 for more details.
Tax credit on re-measurement of deferred tax See note 9 for more details.
