2 Includes share premium, capital reserve, capital redemption reserve, merger reserve and share-based payment reserve.
The merger reserve was derived from acquisitions made prior to 31 March 2004 and subsequently allocated to additional paid-in capital on adoption of IFRS.
3 The currency reserve is used to record cumulative translation differences on the assets and liabilities of foreign operations.
The cumulative translation differences are recycled to the income statement on disposal of the foreign operation.
4 The investment reserve is used to record the cumulative fair value gains and losses on available-for-sale financial assets.
The cumulative gains and losses are recycled to the income statement on disposal of the assets.
5 The revaluation surplus derives from acquisitions of subsidiaries made before the Groups adoption of IFRS 3 Revised on 1 April 2010 and comprises the amounts arising from recognising the Groups pre-existing equity interest in the acquired subsidiary at fair value.
6 Includes the impact of the Groups cash flow hedges with 1,811 million net loss deferred to other comprehensive income during the year 2017: 787 million net gain: 2016: 337 million net gain and 1,460 million net loss 2017: 654 million net gain: 2016: 294 million net gain recycled to the income statement.
These hedges primarily relate to foreign exchange exposure on fixed borrowings, with interest cash flows unwinding to the income statement over the life of the hedges and any foreign exchange on nominal balances impacting income statement at maturity up to 2056.
7 Includes 8 million tax charge 2017: 9 million credit: 2016: 5 million credit.

Financials 106 Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2018 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1.
Basis of preparation This section describes the critical accounting judgements and estimates that management has identified as havinga potentially material impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements and sets out our significant accounting policies that relate to the financial statements as a whole.
Where an accounting policy is generally applicable to a specific note to the financial statements, the policy is described within that note.
We have also detailed below the new accounting pronouncements that we will adopt in future years and our current view of the impact they will have on our financial reporting.
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and are also prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the European Union EU, the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulations.
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
A discussion on the Groups critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty is detailed below.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period: they are recognised in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
On 1 April 2016, the Groups presentation currency changed from sterling to the euro to better align with the geographic split of the Groups operations.
The results of Vodafone India are presented in results from discontinued operations in the current and prior periods and its assets and liabilities reported in assets and liabilities held for sale, respectively, at 31 March 2018.
Vodafone Group Plc is incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales registration number 1833679.
The registered address of the Company is Vodafone House, The Connection, Newbury, Berkshire, RG14 2FN, England.
IFRS requires the Directors to adopt accounting policies that are the most appropriate to the Groups circumstances.
These have been applied consistently to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
In determining and applying accounting policies, Directors and management are required to make judgements in respect of items where the choice of specific policy, accounting estimate or assumption to be followed could materially affect the Groups reported financial position, results or cash flows: it may later be determined that a different choice may have been more appropriate.
Management regularly reviews, and revises as necessary, the accounting judgements that significantly impact the amounts recognised in the financial statements and the estimates that are considered to be critical estimates due to their potential to give rise to material adjustments in the Groups financial statements in the year to 31 March 2019.
As at 31 March 2018, management has identified critical judgements in respect of revenue recognition gross versus net, classification of joint arrangements and whether to recognise a provision or disclose a contingent liability.
In addition, management has identified critical accounting estimates in relation to the recovery of deferred tax assets, post employment benefits, and impairments and estimates that are not considered to be critical in respect of the useful economic lives of finite lived intangibles and property, plant and equipment.
During the year to 31 March 2018, the Group had no significant acquisitions and no disposals of subsidiaries via contribution into joint arrangements, consequently there are no critical estimates disclosed in respect of such transactions.
The majority of the Groups provisions are either long term in nature such as asset retirement obligations or relate to shorter term liabilities such as those relating to restructuring and property where there is not considered to be a significant risk of material adjustment in the next financial year.
Provisions for uncertain tax positions are no longer considered a critical estimate as the provision predominantly relates to a large number of immaterial issues across the Groups markets and the risk of a material change in estimate in the next financial year is not considered to be significant.
Critical judgements are exercised in respect of tax disputes in India, including the cases relating to our acquisition of Vodafone India.
These critical accounting judgements, estimates and related disclosures have been discussed with the Companys Audit and Risk Committee.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty Revenue recognition Gross versus net presentation When the Group sells goods or services as a principal, income and payments to suppliers are reported on a gross basis in revenue and operating costs.
If the Group sells goods or services as an agent, revenue and payments to suppliers are recorded in revenue on a net basis, representing the margin earned.
Whether the Group is considered to be the principal or an agent in the transaction depends on analysis by management of both the legal form and substance of the agreement between the Group and its business partners: such judgements impact the amount of reported revenue and operating expenses but do not impact reported assets, liabilities or cash flows.
Taxation The Groups tax charge on ordinary activities is the sum of the total current and deferred tax charges.
The calculation of the Groups total tax charge involves estimation and judgement in respect of certain matters principally: Recognition of deferred tax assets Significant items on which the Group has exercised accounting estimation and judgement include the recognition of deferred tax assets in respect of losses in Luxembourg, Germany, Spain and India as well as capital allowances in the United Kingdom.
Overview Strategic Report Governance Financials Other information Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2018 107 The recognition of deferred tax assets, particularly in respect of tax losses, is based upon whether management judge that it is probable that there will be sufficient and suitable taxable profits in the relevant legal entity or tax group against which to utilise the assets in the future.
The Group assesses the availability of future taxable profits using the same undiscounted five year forecasts for the Groups operations as are used in the Groups value in use calculations see Impairment reviews on page 108.
Where tax losses are forecast to be recovered beyond the five year period, the availability of taxable profits is assessed using the cash flows and longterm growth rates used for the value in use calculations.
The estimated cash flows inherent in these forecasts include the unsystematic risks of operating in the telecommunications business including the potential impacts of changes in the market structure, trends in customer pricing, the costs associated with the acquisition and retention of customers, future technological evolutions and potential regulatory changes, such as our ability to acquire and or renew spectrum licences.
Changes in the estimates which underpin the Groups forecasts could have an impact on the amount of future taxable profits and could have a significant impact on the period over which the deferred tax asset would be recovered.
The Group only considers substantively enacted tax laws when assessing the amount and availability of tax losses to offset against the future taxable profits.
See note 6 Taxation to the consolidated financial statements.
Uncertain tax positions The tax impact of a transaction or item can be uncertain until a conclusion is reached with the relevant tax authority or through a legal process.
The Group uses in-house tax experts when assessing uncertain tax positions and seeks the advice of external professional advisors where appropriate.
The most significant judgement in this area relates to the Groups tax disputes in India, including the cases relating to the Groups acquisition of Vodafone India.
Further details of these are included in note 29 Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings to the consolidated financial statements.
Joint arrangements The Group participates in a number of joint arrangements where control of the arrangement is shared with one or more other parties.
Judgement is required to classify joint arrangements in a separate legal entity as either a joint operation or as a joint venture which depends on managements assessment of the legal form and substance of the arrangement taking into account relevant facts and circumstances such as whether the owners have rights to substantially all the economic outputs and, in substance, settle the liabilities of the entity.
The classification can have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
The Groups share of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows of joint operations are included in the consolidated financial statements on a line-by-line basis, whereas the Groups investment and share of results of joint ventures are shown within single line items in the consolidated statement of financial position and consolidated income statement respectively.
See note 12 Investments in associates and joint arrangements to the consolidated financial statements.
Finite lived intangible assets Other intangible assets include amounts spent by the Group acquiring licences and spectrum, customer bases and the costs of purchasing and developing computer software.
Where intangible assets are acquired through business combinations and no active market for the assets exists, the fair value of these assets is determined by discounting estimated future net cash flows generated by the asset.
Estimates relating to the future cash flows and discount rates used may have a material effect on the reported amounts of finite lived intangible assets.
Estimation of useful life The useful life over which intangible assets are amortised depends on managements estimate of the period over which economic benefit will be derived from the asset.
Useful lives are periodically reviewed to ensure that they remain appropriate.
Managements estimates of useful life have a material impact on the amount of amortisation recorded in the year, but there is not considered to be a significant risk of material adjustment to the carrying values of intangible assets in the year to 31 March 2019 if these estimates were revised.
The basis for determining the useful life for the most significant categories of intangible assets is discussed below.
Customer bases The estimated useful life principally reflects managements view of the average economic life of the customer base and is assessed by reference to customer churn rates.
An increase in churn rates may lead to a reduction in the estimated useful life and an increase in the amortisation charge.
Capitalised software For computer software, the estimated useful life is based on managements view, considering historical experience with similar products as well as anticipation of future events which may impact their life such as changes in technology.
The useful life will not exceed the duration of a licence.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment represents 19.5% 2017: 19.5% of the Groups total assets: estimates and assumptions made may have a material impact on their carrying value and related depreciation charge.
See note 11 Property, plant and equipment to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
Estimation of useful life The depreciation charge for an asset is derived using estimates of its expected useful life and expected residual value, which are reviewed annually.
Managements estimates of useful life have a material impact on the amount of depreciation recorded in the year, but there is not considered to be a significant risk of material adjustment to the carrying values of property, plant and equipment in the year to 31 March 2019 if these estimates were revised.
Management determines the useful lives and residual values for assets when they are acquired, based on experience with similar assets and taking into account other relevant factors such as any expected changes in technology.
Financials 108 Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2018 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1.
Basis of preparation continued Post employment benefits Management uses estimates when determining the Groups liabilities and expenses arising for defined benefit pension schemes.
Management is required to estimate the future rates of inflation, salary increases, discount rates and longevity of members, each of which may have a material impact on the defined benefit obligations that are recorded.
Further details, including a sensitivity analysis, are included in note 25 Postemployment benefits to the consolidated financial statements.
Contingent liabilities The Group exercises judgement to determine whether to recognise provisions and the exposures to contingent liabilities related to pending litigation or other outstanding claims subject to negotiated settlement, mediation, arbitration or government regulation, as well as other contingent liabilities see note 29 Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings to the consolidated financial statements.
Judgement is necessary to assess the likelihood that a pending claim will succeed, or a liability will arise.
Impairment reviews IFRS requires management to perform impairment tests annually for indefinite lived assets and, for finite lived assets, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
Impairment testing requires management to judge whether the carrying value of assets can be supported by the net present value of future cash flows that they generate.
Calculating the net present value of the future cash flows requires estimates to be made in respect of highly uncertain matters including managements expectations of: growth in adjusted EBITDA, calculated as adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortisation: timing and amount of future capital expenditure, licence and spectrum payments: long-term growth rates: and appropriate discount rates to reflect the risks involved.
Management prepares formal five year forecasts for the Groups operations, which are used to estimate their value in use: a long-term growth rate into perpetuity has been determined as the lower of: the nominal GDP growth rates for the country of operation: and the longterm compound annual growth rate in adjusted EBITDA in years six to ten estimated by management.
Changing the assumptions selected by management, in particular the discount rate and growth rate assumptions used in the cash flow projections, could significantly affect the Groups impairment evaluation and hence reported assets and profits or losses.
Further details, including a sensitivity analysis, are included in note 4 Impairment losses to the consolidated financial statements.
For discontinued operations, impairment testing requires management to determine whether the carrying value of the discontinued operation can be supported by the fair value less costs to sell.
Where not observable in a quoted market, management have determined fair value less costs to sell by reference to the outcomes from the application of a number of potential valuation techniques, determined from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Significant accounting policies applied in the current reporting period that relate to the financial statements as a whole Accounting convention The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis except for certain financial and equity instruments that have been measured at fair value.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company, subsidiaries controlled by the Company see note 32 Related undertakings to the consolidated financial statements and joint operations that are subject to joint control see note 12 Investments in associates and joint arrangements to the consolidated financial statements.
Foreign currencies The consolidated financial statements are presented in euro, which is also the Companys functional currency.
Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the functional currency rate prevailing at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into the respective functional currency of the entity at the rates prevailing on the reporting period date.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the initial transaction dates.
Non-monetary items measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Changes in the fair value of monetary securities denominated in foreign currency classified as available-for-sale are analysed between translation differences and other changes in the carrying amount of the security.
Translation differences are recognised in the income statement and other changes in carrying amount are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets, such as investments in equity securities classified as available-for-sale, are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss and are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Share capital, share premium and other capital reserves are initially recorded at the functional currency rate prevailing at the date of the transaction and are not retranslated.
Overview Strategic Report Governance Financials Other information Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2018 109 For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of entities with a functional currency other than euro are expressed in euro using exchange rates prevailing at the reporting period date.
Income and expense items and cash flows are translated at the average exchange rates for each month and exchange differences arising are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
On disposal of a foreign entity, the cumulative amount previously recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in profit or loss.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated accordingly.
The net foreign exchange gain recognised in the consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 March 2018 is 295 million 31 March 2017: 637 million loss: 2016: 1,141 million loss.
The net gains and net losses are recorded within operating profit 2018: 65 million credit: 2017: 133 million charge: 2016: 24 million credit, non-operating income and expense 2018: nil: 2017: nil: 2016: 282 million charge, investment and financing income 2018: 141 million credit: 2017: 505 million charge: 2016: 872 million charge and income tax expense 2018: 9 million credit: 2017: 1 million credit: 2016: 11 million charge.
The foreign exchange gains and losses included within other income and expense and non-operating income and expense arise on the disposal of interests in joint ventures, associates and investments from the recycling of foreign exchange gains previously recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Inventory Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

New accounting pronouncements adopted on 1 April 2017 On 1 April 2017 the Group adopted the following new accounting policies to comply with amendments to IFRS.
The accounting pronouncements, none of which is considered by the Group as significant on adoption, are: Amendments to IAS 12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses: Amendments to IAS 7 Disclosure Initiative: and Amendments to IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities part of Improvements to IFRS 2014-2016 cycle.
While the amendments to IAS 7 will have no impact on the Groups accounting, additional disclosures are included to reconcile the movements in assets and liabilities during the year resulting from financing activities.
New accounting pronouncements to be adopted on 1 April 2018 On 1 April 2018 the Group will adopt the following standards, which have been issued by the IASB and endorsed by the EU: these standards will have a significant impact on the Groups financial reporting: IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments.
Additional information on the impact of these significant standards is discussed below.
The following pronouncements, which have also been issued by the IASB and endorsed by the EU, will be adopted by the Group on 1 April 2018: these standards are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated results, financial position or cash flows of the Group: Amendments to IFRS 4 Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts: Amendments to IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures part of Improvements to IFRS 2014-2016 Cycle : Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions: and IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration.
Financials 110 Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2018 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1.
Basis of preparation continued New accounting pronouncements to be adopted on or after 1 April 2019 On 1 April 2019 the Group will adopt IFRS 16 Leases, which has been issued by the IASB and endorsed by the EU.
This is a significant new standard for the Group and the expected impacts are discussed below.
The following pronouncements, which are potentially relevant to the Group, have been issued by the IASB and are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019: except where otherwise noted, they have not yet been endorsed by the EU.
The Groups financial reporting will be presented in accordance with these new standards, which are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated results, financial position or cash flows of the Group, from 1 April 2019.
Amendments to IAS 28 Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures: IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments: Improvements to IFRS 2015-2017 Cycle: Amendment to IAS 19 Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement: and Amendments to IFRS 9 Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation, which has been endorsed by the EU.
In addition, the Group will adopt the following standard, which has been issued by the IASB and has not yet been endorsed by the EU: IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts, which is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021.
The Group is currently assessing the impact of the accounting changes that will arise under IFRS 17: however, the changes are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of financial position.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9 Financial Instruments was issued in July 2014 to replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and has been endorsed by the EU.
The standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and will be adopted by the Group on 1 April 2018.
IFRS 9 will impact the classification and measurement of the Groups financial instruments, revises the requirements for when hedge accounting can be applied and requires certain additional disclosures.
The primary changes resulting from IFRS 9 on the Groups accounting for financial instruments are as follows : The Group has elected, under IFRS 9, to recognise the full amount of credit losses that would be expected to be incurred over the full recovery period of trade receivables, contract assets recorded under IFRS 15 and finance lease receivables at the date of initial recognition of those assets: currently credit losses are not recognised on such assets until there is an indicator of impairment, such as a payment default.
Customer receivables that are received in instalments, which are currently recorded at amortised cost, will be recorded at fair value through other comprehensive income for receivable portfolios that the Group sells from time to time to third parties.
Whilst hedge accounting requirements are revised under IFRS 9, no material changes to the Groups hedge accounting have been identified.
The Group will adopt IFRS 9 with the cumulative retrospective impact on the classification and measurement of financial instruments reflected as an adjustment to equity on the date of adoption.
In order to comply with the transition requirements of IFRS 15 the Group will report financial information both under IFRS 15 and also under the pre-existing revenue standard IAS 18, Revenue for the year commencing 1 April 2018.
The Groups current estimate of the primary financial impact of adoption of IFRS 9 on an IAS 18 accounting basis on the consolidated statement of financial position on adoption is a reduction in cumulative retained earnings at 1 April 2018 of between 200 million and 300 million, inclusive of the impact of deferred tax movements but excluding the impact on equity accounted joint ventures and associates.
No material impact is expected from implementing IFRS 9 on an IAS 18 basis on the consolidated income statement or on the consolidated statement of cash flows.
Overview Strategic Report Governance Financials Other information Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2018 111 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, was issued in May 2014 and subsequent amendments, Clarifications to IFRS 15 were issued in April 2016: both have been endorsed by the EU.
IFRS 15, as amended, is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
IFRS 15 sets out the requirements for recognising revenue and costs from contracts with customers and includes extensive disclosure requirements: it will have a material impact on the Groups reporting of revenue and costs as follows: Deliverables in contracts with customers that qualify as separate performance obligations will be identified and the contractual transaction price receivable from customers must then be allocated to the performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis.
The performance obligations identified will depend on the nature of individual customer contracts, but might typically be identified for mobile handsets, other equipment provided to customers and for services provided to customers such as mobile and fixed line.
Stand-alone selling prices will be based on observable sales prices: however, where stand-alone selling prices are not directly observable, estimates will be made maximising the use of observable inputs.
Revenue will be recognised either at a point in time or over time when the respective performance obligations in a contract are delivered to the customer.
Currently revenue allocated to deliverables is restricted to the amount that is receivable without the delivery of additional goods or services: this restriction will no longer be applied under IFRS 15.
The primary impact on revenue reporting will be that when the Group sells subsidised devices together with airtime service agreements to customers, revenue allocated to equipment and recognised at contract inception, when control of the device typically passes to the customer, will increase and revenue subsequently recognised as services are delivered during the contract period will reduce.
Where additional up-front unbilled revenue is recorded for the sale of devices, this will be reflected in the consolidated statement of financial position as a contract asset.
Expected credit losses will be recorded in respect of amounts due from customers.
The recognition of contract assets under IFRS 15 will result in an increase in credit loss charges recorded in future periods.
Certain incremental costs incurred in acquiring a contract with a customer will be deferred on the consolidated statement of financial position and amortised as revenue is recognised under the related contract: this will generally lead to the later recognition of charges for some commissions payable to third party dealers and employees.
In addition, certain types of contract acquisition costs will be deducted from revenue as they are considered to relate to the funding of customer discounts.
In addition certain costs incurred in fulfilling customer contracts will be deferred on the consolidated statement of financial position and recognised as related revenue is recognised under the contract.
Such deferred costs are likely to relate to the provision of deliverables to customers that do not qualify as performance obligations and for which revenue is not recognised: currently such costs are generally expensed as incurred.
The impact of the changes above on the Groups reportable segments will depend largely on the extent to which customers receive discounted goods or services, such as mobile handsets, when they enter into airtime service agreements with the Group in the relevant markets.
The combined impact of the changes is expected to increase the gross profit, or reduce the gross loss, recorded at inception on many customer contracts: in such cases, this will typically reduce the gross profit reported during the remainder of the contract: however, these timing differences will not impact the total gross profit reported for a customer contract over the contract term.
In applying IFRS 15, and in determining the accounting impacts described above, the Group will be required to make material judgements.
The most significant judgements are expected to be: Determining standalone selling price for allocating revenue between performance obligations where contracts contain multiple performance obligations.
Judgement will be required to determine whether a standalone selling price exists and if no standalone price exists estimation will be required to determine the appropriate revenue allocation.
Judgements relating to the reporting of revenue and costs on a gross or net basis, which are consistent with those required under IAS 18 described in section Critical accounting judgements and key areas of estimation uncertainty on page 106.
The Group will adopt IFRS 15 with the cumulative retrospective impact reflected as an adjustment to equity on the date of adoption: and with disclosure of the impact of IFRS 15 on each line item in the financial statements in the reporting period.
The transactions impacted by IFRS 15 are high in volume, value and complexity which has necessitated a phased approach to the development of new software solutions and changes to processes and related controls across the Group.
The items discussed above are the main accounting changes for the Group under IFRS 15.
The Groups current estimate of the primary financial impact of these changes on the consolidated statement of financial position on adoption is a cumulative increase in: Retained earnings at 1 April 2018 of between 2.1 billion and 2.8 billion, inclusive of the impact of deferred tax movements and including the impact of adopting IFRS 9 but excluding the impact on equity accounted joint ventures and associates.
The primary movements contributing to the increase in retained earnings are the recognition of contract assets and the deferral of previously expensed contract acquisition costs.
On the assumption that there are no significant changes to business models or products offered, the Group expects the primary financial impacts of these changes on the consolidated income statement will be: A reduction in revenue which is currently estimated at between 2% and 3%: and A reduction in the share of total revenue recorded as service revenue by between 2.5 and 4.5 percentage points primarily as a result of an increased allocation of customer receipts to up-front equipment revenue and of the impact of the revenue reduction noted above.
Financials 112 Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2018 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1.
Basis of preparation continued The implementation of IFRS 15 is not expected to have any financial impact on the consolidated statement of cash flows.
These impacts are based on the assessments undertaken to date.
The exact financial impacts of the accounting changes of adopting IFRS 15 at 1 April 2018 may be revised as further analysis is completed prior to presentation of financial information for periods including the date of initial application.
The Group expects to be in a position to issue further guidance on the impact of adopting IFRS 15 in conjunction with the first quarter trading update for the financial year commencing 1 April 2018.
IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 Leases was issued in January 2016 to replace IAS 17 Leases and has been endorsed by the EU.
The standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and will be adopted by the Group on 1 April 2019.
IFRS 16 will primarily change lease accounting for lessees: lease agreements will give rise to the recognition of an asset representing the right to use the leased item and a loan obligation for future lease payables.
Lease costs will be recognised in the form of depreciation of the right to use asset and interest on the lease liability.
Lessee accounting under IFRS 16 will be similar in many respects to existing IAS 17 accounting for finance leases, but will be substantively different to existing accounting for operating leases where rental charges are currently recognised on a straight-line basis and no lease asset or related lease creditor is recognised.
Lessor accounting under IFRS 16 is similar to existing IAS 17 accounting and is not expected to have a material impact for the Group.
The Group is assessing the impact of the accounting changes that will arise under IFRS 16: however, the following changes to lessee accounting will have a material impact as follows: Right-of-use assets will be recorded for assets that are leased by the Group: currently no lease assets are included on the Groups consolidated statement of financial position for operating leases.
Liabilities will be recorded for future lease payments in the Groups consolidated statement of financial position for the reasonably certain period of the lease, which may include future lease periods for which the Group has extension options.
Currently liabilities are generally not recorded for future operating lease payments, which are disclosed as commitments.
The amount of lease liabilities will not equal the lease commitments reported on 31 March 2019, as they will be discounted to present value and the treatment of termination and extension options may differ, but may not be dissimilar.
Lease expenses will be for depreciation of right-of-use assets and interest on lease liabilities: interest will typically be higher in the early stages of a lease and reduce over the term.
Currently operating lease rentals are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term within operating expenses.
Operating lease cash flows are currently included within operating cash flows in the consolidated statement of cash flows: under IFRS 16 these will be recorded as cash flows from financing activities reflecting the repayment of lease liabilities borrowings and related interest.
A high volume of transactions will be impacted by IFRS 16 and material judgements are required in identifying and accounting for leases.
The most significant judgement is expected to be determination of the lease term: under IFRS 16 the lease term includes extension periods where it is reasonably certain that a lease extension option will be exercised or that a lease termination option will not be exercised.
Significant judgement will be required when determining the lease term of leases with extension or termination options.
The Group is continuing to assess the impact of the accounting changes that will arise under IFRS 16 and cannot yet reasonably quantify the impact: however, the changes highlighted above will have a material impact on the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of financial position and consolidated statement of cash flows after the Groups adoption on 1 April 2019.
The Group intends to adopt IFRS 16 with the cumulative retrospective impact as an adjustment to equity on the date of adoption.
The Group currently intends to apply the following practical expedients allowed under IFRS 16: The right-of-use assets will, generally, be measured at an amount equal to the lease liability at adoption and initial direct costs incurred when obtaining leases will be excluded from this measurement: The Group will rely on its onerous lease assessments under IAS 37 to impair right-of-use assets recognised on adoption instead of performing a new impairment assessment for those assets on adoption: and Hindsight will be used in determining the lease term..

Segmental analysis The Groups businesses are managed on a geographical basis.
Selected financial data is presented on this basisbelow.
The Groups operating segments are established on the basis of those components of the Group that are evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
The Group has a single group of related services and products, being the supply of communications services and products.
Revenue is attributed to a country or region based on the location of the Group company reporting the revenue.
Transactions between operating segments are charged at arms-length prices.
Segment information is provided on the basis of geographic areas, being the basis on which the Group manages its worldwide interests, with each country in which the Group operates treated as an operating segment.
The aggregation of operating segments into the Europe and AMAP regions reflects, in the opinion of management, the similar economic characteristics within each of those regions as well the similar products and services offered and supplied, classes of customers and the regulatory environment.
In the case of the Europe region this largely reflects membership of the European Union, while for the AMAP region this largely includes emerging and developing economies that are in the process of rapid growth and industrialisation.
Certain financial information is provided separately within the Europe region for Germany, Italy, the UK and Spain, and within the AMAP region for India and Vodacom, as these operating segments are individually material for the Group.
The segmental revenue and profit of India are included in discontinued operations for all years reported and segmental assets and cash flows are included in assets and liabilities held for sale at 31 March 2018 and 31 March 2017.
See note 7 Discontinued operations and assets and liabilities held for resale for details.
Accounting policies Revenue Revenue is recognised to the extent the Group has delivered goods or rendered services under an agreement, the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration receivable, exclusive of sales taxes and discounts.
The Group principally obtains revenue from providing mobile and fixed telecommunication services including: access charges, voice and video calls, messaging, interconnect fees, fixed and mobile broadband and related services such as providing televisual and music content, connection fees and equipment sales.
Products and services may be sold separately or in bundled packages.
Revenue for access charges, voice and video calls, messaging and fixed and mobile broadband provided to contract customers is recognised as services are performed, with unbilled revenue resulting from services already provided accrued at the end of each period and unearned revenue from services to be provided in future periods deferred.
Revenue from the sale of prepaid credit is deferred until such time as the customer uses the airtime, or the credit expires.
Revenue from interconnect fees is recognised at the time the services are performed.
Revenue for the provision of televisual and music content is recognised when or as the Group performs the related service and, depending on the nature of the service, is recognised either at the gross amount billed to the customer or the amount receivable by the Group as commission for facilitating the service.
Customer connection revenue is recognised together with the related equipment revenue to the extent that the aggregate equipment and connection revenue does not exceed the fair value of the equipment delivered to the customer.
Any customer connection revenue not recognised, together with any related excess equipment revenue, is deferred and recognised over the period in which services are expected to be provided to the customer.
Revenue for device sales is recognised when the device is delivered to the end customer and the significant risks and rewards of ownership have transferred.
For device sales made to intermediaries, revenue is recognised if the significant risks associated with the device are transferred to the intermediary and the intermediary has no general right to return the device to receive a refund.
If the significant risks are not transferred, revenue recognition is deferred until sale of the device to an end customer by the intermediary or the expiry of any right of return.
In revenue arrangements including more than one deliverable, the arrangements are divided into separate units of accounting.
Deliverables are considered separate units of accounting if the following two conditions are met: i the deliverable has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis and ii there is evidence of the fair value of the item.
The arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting based on its relative fair value.
The Group generally determines the fair value of individual elements based on prices at which the deliverable is regularly sold on a stand-alone basis after considering any appropriate volume discounts.
Revenue allocated to deliverables is restricted to the amount that is receivable without the delivery of additional goods or services.
This restriction typically applies to revenue recognised for devices provided to customers, including handsets.
Commissions Intermediaries are given cash incentives by the Group to connect new customers and upgrade existing customers.
For intermediaries who do not purchase products and services from the Group, such cash incentives are accounted for as an expense.
Such cash incentives to other intermediaries are also accounted for as an expense if: the Group receives an identifiable benefit in exchange for the cash incentive that is separable from sales transactions to that intermediary: and the Group can reliably estimate the fair value of that benefit.
Cash incentives that do not meet these criteria are recognised as a reduction of the related revenue.

Impairment losses Impairment occurs when the carrying value of assets is greater than the present value of the net cash flows they are expected to generate.
We review the carrying value of assets for each country in which we operate at least annually.
For further details of our impairment review process see Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty in note 1 Basis of preparation to the consolidated financial statements.
Accounting policies Goodwill Goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows, known as cashgenerating units.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
Impairment losses recognised for goodwill are not reversible in subsequent periods.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
The Group prepares and approves formal five year management plans for its operations, which are the basis for the value in use calculations.
Property, plant and equipment and finite lived intangible assets At each reporting period date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment and finite lived intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent, if any, of the impairment loss.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount and an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, not to exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years and an impairment loss reversal is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Impairment losses Following our annual impairment review, the impairment charges recognised in the consolidated income statement within operating profit in respect of goodwill are stated below.
The impairment losses were based on value in use calculations.
2018 2017 2016 Cash-generating unit Reportable segment m m m Romania Other Europe 569 569 For the year ended 31 March 2018, the Group recorded a non-cash charge of 3,170 million 2,245 million net of tax, included in discontinued operations, as a result of the re-measurement of Vodafone Indias fair value less costs of disposal.
See note 7 Discontinued operations and assets and liabilities held for sale for further details.
For the year ended 31 March 2017, the Group recorded a non-cash impairment charge of 4,515 million in respect of the Groups investment in India which, together with the recognition of an associated 840 million deferred tax asset, led to an overall 3,675 million reduction in the carrying value of Vodafone India, the results of which are included in discontinued operations see note 7 Discontinued operations and assets and liabilities held for sale for further details.
Goodwill The remaining carrying value of goodwill at 31 March was as follows: 2018 2017 m m Germany 12,479 12,479 Italy 3,654 3,654 Spain 3,814 3,814 19,947 19,947 Other 6,787 6,861 26,734 26,808 Financials 118 Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2018 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 4.
Impairment losses continued Key assumptions used in the value in use calculations The key assumptions used in determining the value in use are: Assumption How determined Projected adjusted Projected adjusted EBITDA has been based on past experience adjusted for the following: EBITDA voice and messaging revenue is expected to benefit from increased usage from new customers, especially in emerging markets, the introduction of new services and traffic moving from fixed networks to mobile networks, though these factors will be offset by increased competitor activity, which may result in price declines, and the trend of falling termination and other regulated rates: non-messaging data revenue is expected to continue to grow as the penetration of 3G plus 4G where available enabled devices and smartphones rise along with higher data bundle attachment rates, and newproducts and services are introduced: and margins are expected to be impacted by negative factors such as the cost of acquiring and retaining customers in increasingly competitive markets and the expectation of further termination rate cuts by regulators and by positive factors such as the efficiencies expected from the implementation of Groupinitiatives.
Projected capital The cash flow forecasts for capital expenditure are based on past experience and include the ongoing capital expenditure expenditure required to roll out networks in emerging markets, to provide voice and data products and services and to meet the population coverage requirements of certain of the Groups licences.
Capital expenditure includes cash outflows for the purchase of property, plant and equipment and computer software.
Projected licence and The cash flow forecasts for licence and spectrum payments for each operating company for the initial five years include spectrum payments amounts for expected renewals and newly available spectrum.
Beyond that period, a long-run cost of spectrum is assumed.
Long-term growth rate For businesses where the five year management plans are used for the Groups value in use calculations, along-term growth rate into perpetuity has been determined as the lower of: the nominal GDP rates for the country of operation: and the long-term compound annual growth rate in adjusted EBITDA in years six to ten estimated by management.
Pre-tax risk adjusted The discount rate applied to the cash flows of each of the Groups operations is generally based on the risk free rate for discount rate ten year bonds issued by the government in the respective market.
Where government bond rates contain a material component of credit risk, high-quality local corporate bond rates may be used.
These rates are adjusted for a risk premium to reflect both the increased risk of investing in equities and the systematic risk of the specific Group operating company.
In making this adjustment, inputs required are the equity market risk premium that is the required increased return required over and above a risk free rate by an investor who is investing in the market as a whole and the risk adjustment, beta, applied to reflect the risk of the specific Group operating company relative to the market as a whole.
In determining the risk adjusted discount rate, management has applied an adjustment for the systematic risk to each of the Groups operations determined using an average of the betas of comparable listed mobile telecommunications companies and, where available and appropriate, across a specific territory.
Management has used a forward-looking equity market risk premium that takes into consideration both studies by independent economists, the average equity market risk premium over the past ten years and the market risk premiums typically used by investment banks in evaluating acquisitionproposals.
Overview Strategic Report Governance Financials Other information Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2018 119 Year ended 31 March 2018 The table below shows key assumptions used in the value in use calculations.

2 Projected capital expenditure, which excludes licences and spectrum, is expressed as capital expenditure as a percentage of revenue in the initial five years for all cash-generating units of the plans used for impairment testing.
Sensitivity analysis Other than as disclosed below, management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of any cash-generating unit to materially exceed its recoverable amount.
The estimated recoverable amount of the Groups operations in Germany, Spain and Romania exceed their carrying values by 7.7 billion, 0.3 billion and nil respectively.
The changes in the following table to assumptions used in the impairment review would, in isolation, lead to an impairment loss being recognised for the year ended 31 March 2018.

The carrying values for Vodafone UK, Portugal, Ireland and Czech Republic include goodwill arising from their acquisition by the Group and or the purchase of operating licences or spectrum rights.
While the recoverable amounts for these operating companies are not materially greater than their carrying value, each has a lower risk of giving rise to impairment that would be material to the Group given their relative size or the composition of their carrying value.

Following the recent merger, the recoverable amount for VodafoneZiggo is not materially greater than its carrying value.
If adverse impacts of economic, competitive, regulatory or other factors were to cause significant deterioration in the operations of VodafoneZiggo and the entitys expected future cash flows, this may lead to an impairment loss being recognised.

Impairment losses continued Year ended 31 March 2017 During the year ended 31 March 2017, Vodafone India was classified as a discontinued operation and was consequently valued at fair value less costs of disposal.
Vodafone Indias fair value less costs of disposal was not observable in a quoted market and accordingly was determined with reference 1 to the outcomes from the application of a number of potential valuation techniques, which were considered to result in a level 2 valuation.
As such significant judgement was required and involved the use of estimates.
The two bases of valuation which were given the strongest weighting in the overall assessment of fair value are set out below.
Fair value less costs of disposal excluding net debt was assessed to be INR 971 billion, equivalent to 14.0 billion.
The contracted cash price for the sale of a portion of the entity to the Aditya Birla Group as part of the planned disposal of Vodafone India, adjusted for the agreed level of debt which is an observable price relating to Vodafone India: and The share price of Idea Cellular prior to the announcement of the plan to dispose of Vodafone India and participate with Idea Cellular in the planned jointly controlled entity, adjusted for transaction specific factors.
Idea Cellular equity shares are the primary component of the consideration for Vodafone India to be received by the Group, and the value of the Idea Cellular shares has been adjusted to reflect 50% of the estimated cost synergies that management expects to be realised by the jointly controlled entity.
A 10% increase or reduction in the expected cost synergies included in this determination of fair value would result in a 220 million increase or reduction, respectively, in the fair value less costs of disposal of Vodafone India calculated using this approach.
Note: 1 Level 2 classification comprises items where fair value is determined from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
The table below shows key assumptions used in the value in use calculations.

Sensitivity analysis Other than as disclosed below, management believed that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of any cash-generating unit to materially exceed its recoverable amount.
The estimated recoverable amount of the Groups operations in Germany, Spain and Romania exceed their carrying values by 3.5 billion, 1.0 billion and 0.2 billion respectively.

Taxation This note explains how our Group tax charge arises.
The deferred tax section of the note also provides information on our expected future tax charges and sets out the tax assets held across the Group together with our view on whether or not we expect to be able to make use of these in the future.
Accounting policies Income tax expense represents the sum of the current and deferred taxes.
Current tax payable or recoverable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement because some items of income or expense are taxable or deductible in different years or may never be taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability forcurrent tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting period date.
The Group recognises provisions for uncertain tax positions when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and management judge that it is probable that there will be a future outflow of economic benefits from the Group to settle the obligation.
Uncertain tax positions are assessed and measured on an issue by issue basis within the jurisdictions that we operate using managements estimate of the most likely outcome.
The Group recognises interest on late paid taxes as part of financing costs, and any penalties, if applicable, as part of the income tax expense.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable in the future arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.
It is accounted for using the statement of financial position liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that temporary differences or taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised to theextent they arise from the initial recognition of non-tax deductible goodwill.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint arrangements, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting period date and adjusted to reflect changes in the Groups assessment that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting period date.
Tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they either relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or on different taxable entities which intend to settle the current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to other comprehensive income or directly to equity, in which case the tax is recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity.

Taxation continued Factors affecting the tax charge in future years The Groups future tax charge, and effective tax rate, could be affected by several factors including: tax reform in countries around the world, including any arising from the OECDs or European Commissions work on the taxation of the digital economy and European Commission initiatives such as the anti tax avoidance directive, proposed tax and financial reporting directive or as a consequence of state aid investigations, future corporate acquisitions and disposals, any restructuring of our businesses and the resolution of open tax issues see below.
On 26 October 2017, the European Commission published a preliminary decision to open a formal investigation in relation to the group financing exemption GFE in the UKs controlled foreign company rules and whether the GFE constitutes unlawful State Aid.
The Group has made claims under the GFE for practical reasons, however given that the Groups Luxembourg financing activities are properly established and operate in accordance with EU and local law as well as the OECDs transfer pricing guidelines, we do not anticipate any significant impact should a finding of unlawful State Aid be ultimately upheld.
We do not anticipate any significant impact on our future tax charge, liabilities or assets, as a result of the triggering of Article 50 2 of the Treaty on European Union but cannot rule out the possibility that, for example, a failure to reach satisfactory arrangements for the UKs future relationship with the European Union, could have an impact on such matters.
We continue to monitor developments in this area.
The Group is routinely subject to audit by tax authorities in the territories in which it operates and, specifically, in India these are usually resolved through the Indian legal system.
The Group considers each issue on its merits and, where appropriate, holds provisions in respect of the potential tax liability that may arise.
As at 31 March 2018, the Group holds provisions for such potential liabilities of 521 million 2017: 711 million.
These provisions relate to multiple issues, across the jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
The reduction relates to the closure of tax audits across the Group during the year, including in Germany and Romania.
As the tax impact of a transaction can be uncertain until a conclusion is reached with the relevant tax authority or through a legal process, the amount ultimately paid may differ materially from the amount accrued and could therefore affect the Groups overall profitability and cash flows in future periods.
See note 29 Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings to the consolidated financial statements.
At 31 March 2018, the gross amount and expiry dates of losses available for carry forward are as follows: Expiring Expiring within beyond 5 years 6 years Unlimited Total m m m m Losses for which a deferred tax asset is recognised 266 103,452 103,718 Losses for which no deferred tax is recognised 621 3,074 21,994 25,689 887 3,074 125,446 129,407 At 31 March 2017, the gross amount and expiry dates of losses available for carry forward were as follows: Expiring Expiring within beyond 5 years 6 years Unlimited Total m m m m Losses for which a deferred tax asset is recognised 292 65 97,335 97,692 Losses for which no deferred tax is recognised 352 1,503 28,556 30,411 644 1,568 125,891 128,103 Deferred tax assets on losses in Luxembourg Included in the table above are losses of 81,740 million 2017: 82,634 million that have arisen in Luxembourg companies, principally as a result of revaluations of those companies investments for local GAAP purposes.
A deferred tax asset of 21,261 million 2017: 19,632 million has been recognised in respect of these losses, as we conclude it is probable that the Luxembourg entities will continue to generate taxable profits in the future against which we can utilise these losses.
The Luxembourg companies income is derived from the Groups internal financing and procurement and roaming activities.
The Group has reviewed the latest forecasts for the Luxembourg companies, including their ability to continue to generate income beyond the forecast period under the tax laws substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The assessment also considered whether the structure of the Group would continue to allow the generation of taxable income.
Based on this the Group conclude that it is probable that the Luxembourg companies will continue to generate taxable income in the future.
Any future changes in tax law or the structure of the Group could have a significant effect on the use of losses, including the period over which the losses can be utilised.
Based on the current forecasts the losses will be fully utilised over the next 55 to 60 years.
A 5%-10% change in the forecast income in Luxembourg would change the period over which the losses will be fully utilised by three to five years.
During the current year the Group recognised an additional 330 million 2017: 329 million of our deferred tax assets as a result of the revaluation of investments based upon the local GAAP financial statements, and tax returns at 31 March 2018.
The Group has recognised 1,603 million of deferred tax asset as a result of higher interest rates reducing the length of time over which these losses will be utilised.
Revaluation of investments for local GAAP purposes, which are based on the Groups value in use calculations, can give rise to impairments or the reversal of previous impairments.
These can result in a significant change to our deferred tax assets and the period over which these assets can be utilised.
In addition to the above, 2,587 million 2017: 993 million of the Groups Luxembourg losses expire and no deferred tax asset is recognised as they will expire before we can use these losses.
The remaining losses do not expire.
We also have 9,132 million 2017: 9,132 million of Luxembourg losses in a former Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group company, for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised as it is uncertain whether these losses will be utilised.
Overview Strategic Report Governance Financials Other information Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2018 127 Deferred tax assets on losses in Germany The Group has tax losses of 18,034 million 2017: 18,139 million in Germany arising on the write down of investments in Germany in 2000.
The losses are available to use against both German federal and trade tax liabilities and they do not expire.
A deferred tax asset of 2,796 million 2017: 2,799 million has been recognised in respect of these losses as we conclude it is probable that the German business will continue to generate taxable profits in the future against which we can utilise these losses.
The Group has reviewed the latest forecasts for the German business which incorporate the unsystematic risks of operating in the telecommunications business see pages 38 to 45.
In the period beyond the 5 year forecast we have reviewed the profits inherent in the terminal period and based on these and our expectations for the German business we believe it is probable the German losses will be fully utilised.
Based on the current forecasts the losses will be fully utilised over the next 10 to 12 years.
A 5%-10% change in the forecast profits of the German business would not significantly alter the utilisation period.
Deferred tax assets on losses in Spain The Group has tax losses of 3,521 million 2017: 3,646 million in Spain and which are available to offset against the future profits of the Grupo Corporativo ONO business.
A deferred tax asset of 880 million 2017: 914 million has been recognised in respect of these losses as we conclude it is probable that the Spanish business will continue to generate taxable profits in the future against which we can utilise these losses.
During the year, the Group also derecognised a deferred tax asset of 20 million related to losses in Spain which we do not expect to utilise in the future.
The Group has reviewed the latest forecasts for the Spanish business which incorporate the unsystematic risks of operating in the telecommunications business see pages 38 to 45.
In the period beyond the five year forecast we have reviewed the profits inherent in the value in use calculations and based on these and our expectations for the Spanish business we believe it is probable the losses will be fully utilised.
Based on the current forecasts the losses will be fully utilised over the next 22 to 25 years.
A 5%-10% change in the forecast profits of the Spanish business would change the period over which the losses are utilised by one to two years.
Other tax losses The Group has losses amounting to 7,544 million 2017: 7,880 million in respect of UK subsidiaries which are only available for offset against future capital gains and since it is uncertain whether these losses will be utilised, no deferred tax asset has been recognised, in line with the prior year.
The remaining losses relate to a number of other jurisdictions across the Group.
There are also 12 million 2017: 108 million of unrecognised other temporary differences.
The Group holds a deferred tax liability of 108 million 2017: 95 million in respect of deferred taxation that would arise if temporary differences on investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures were to be realised after the balance sheet date see table on page 126.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of a further 16,049 million 2017: 20,237 million of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
It is not practicable to estimate the amount of unrecognised deferred tax liabilities in respect of these unremitted earnings.

Discontinued operations and assets and liabilities held for sale Following the agreement to combine our Indian operations with Idea Cellular into a jointly controlled company, in accordance with IFRS accounting standards, the results of Vodafone India are included in discontinued operations.
The Group will continue to actively manage these operations until the transaction completes.
Discontinued operations On 20 March 2017, Vodafone announced the agreement to combine its subsidiary, Vodafone India excluding its 42% stake in Indus Towers, with Idea Cellular, which is listed on the Indian Stock Exchanges, with the combined company to be jointly controlled by Vodafone and the Aditya Birla Group.
Consequently, Vodafone India is now accounted for as a discontinued operation, the results of which are detailed below.

Vodafone Indias fair value less costs of disposal is not observable in a quoted market.
As the completion of the Vodafone India and Idea Cellular Limited merger is expected to complete in June 2018, the fair value of Vodafone India has been assessed to be primarily determined by reference to the Idea Cellular Limited quoted share price as at 31 March 2018 of INR 75.9 per share.
This technique is considered to result in a level 2 2 valuation under IFRS 13, as while the quoted price for Idea is observable, further adjustments, such as the assumption regarding the disposal of Vodafone India with a certain level of debt, are required to estimate fair value less costs of disposal.
For the year ended 31 March 2018, the Group has recorded a non-cash charge of 3,170 million 2,245 million net of tax, included in discontinued operations, as a result of the re-measurement of Vodafone Indias fair value less costs of disposal.
Fair value at the equity level has been assessed to be INR 223 billion 2017: INR 370 billion, equivalent to 2.8 billion 2017: 5.3 billion at the foreign exchange rates prevailing at those dates.
Should the competitive environment in India become more intense, there could be a further significant deterioration in the operations of Vodafone India Limited and Idea Cellular Limited impacting the entities expected future cash flows.
This may lead to a further impairment loss being recognised.
The initial investment in the joint venture expected to be formed by the merger of Vodafone India Limited and Idea Cellular Limited in the financial year ending 31 March 2019 will also be measured in part by reference to the share price of Idea Cellular Limited at the date of completion.
Accordingly the accounting gain or loss on the disposal of Vodafone India Limited to be recognised at that point, will in part be dependent on the share price of Idea Cellular Limited at that date.
A change in the share price of Idea Cellular Limited from INR 75.9 per share as at 31 March 2018, to INR 85.9 per share or to INR 65.9 per share would give rise to a potential gain or loss of approximately 0.5 billion respectively.
Based on Idea Cellular Limiteds share price of INR 51.75 per share as at 14 May 2018, the accounting loss on the disposal of Vodafone India would be approximately 1.2 billion based on the 31 March 2018 foreign exchange rate.
Notes: 1 Includes the profit on disposal of Vodafone Indias standalone towers business to ATC Telecom during the year.
See note 28 for further details.
2 Level 2 classification comprises items where fair value is determined from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Overview Strategic Report Governance Financials Other information Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2018 129 The Group will also realise as part of the disposal of Vodafone India Limited a loss comprising the cumulative foreign exchange losses arising from the retranslation of the consolidated net assets of Vodafone India Limited which has a functional currency of Indian Rupee to the Groups presentation currency in the period from acquisition of the Groups interest to the date of disposal.
This foreign exchange is required to be recycled to the income statement from the translation reserve.
Based on the 31 March 2018 exchange rate of :INR: 80.48, a loss of approximately 1.9 billion would arise.
The actual loss from the recycling of foreign exchange previously recognised in equity that would be recognised in the year ending 31 March 2019, will depend on the INR: exchange rate at the date of completion.
A change in the exchange rate from :INR 80.48 to :INR 85.5 or to :INR 75.5 would give rise to a foreign exchange loss of approximately 2.1 billion and 1.8 billion respectively.

The Group has reviewed the latest forecasts for the Indian business which incorporate the unsystematic risks of operating in the telecommunications business see pages 38 to 45.
In the period beyond the five year forecast, we have reviewed the profits inherent in the valuation of Indian business, and based on these and our expectations for the Indian business we believe it is probable the losses will be fully utilised.
Based on the current forecasts the losses will be fully utilised over the next 11 to 13 years.
We do not recognise a deferred tax asset of 399 million 2017: 352 million in relation to losses where we currently believe that is not probable these losses will be utilised in the future.

Intangible assets The statement of financial position contains significant intangible assets, mainly in relation to goodwill and licences and spectrum.
Goodwill, which arises when we acquire a business and pay a higher amount than the fair value of its net assets primarily due to the synergies we expect to create, is not amortised but is subject to annual impairment reviews.
Licences and spectrum are amortised over the life of the licence.
For further details see Critical accounting judgements in note 1 Basis of preparation to the consolidated financial statements.
Accounting policies Identifiable intangible assets are recognised when the Group controls the asset, it is probable that future economic benefits attributed to the asset will flow to the Group and the cost of the asset can be reliably measured.
Identifiable intangible assets are recognised at fair value when the Group completes a business combination.
The determination of the fair values of the separately identified intangibles, is based, to a considerable extent, on managements judgement.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on the acquisition of an entity represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the entity recognised at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is evidence that it may be required.
Goodwill is denominated in the currency of the acquired entity and revalued to the closing exchange rate at each reporting period date.
Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised directly in the income statement.
On disposal of a subsidiary or a jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss recognised in the income statement on disposal.
Finite lived intangible assets Intangible assets with finite lives are stated at acquisition or development cost, less accumulated amortisation.
The amortisation period and method is reviewed at least annually.
Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates.
Licence and spectrum fees Amortisation periods for licence and spectrum fees are determined primarily by reference to the unexpired licence period, the conditions for licence renewal and whether licences are dependent on specific technologies.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives from the commencement of related network services.
Computer software Computer software comprises software purchased from third parties as well as the cost of internally developed software.
Computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring into use the specific software.
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, and are probable of producing future economic benefits, are recognised as intangible assets.
Direct costs of software development include employee costs and directly attributable overheads.
Software integral to an item of hardware equipment is classified as property, plant and equipment.
Costs associated with maintaining software programs are recognised as an expense when they are incurred.
Internally developed software is recognised only if all of the following conditions are met: an asset is created that can be separately identified: it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits: and the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life from the date the software is available for use.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets, including brands and customer bases, are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement, over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets from the date they are available for use, on a straight-line basis, with the exception of customer relationships which are amortised on a sum of digits basis.
The amortisation basis adopted for each class of intangible asset reflects the Groups consumption of the economic benefit from that asset.
Estimated useful lives The estimated useful lives of finite lived intangible assets are as follows: Licence and spectrum fees 325 years Computer software 35 years Brands 110 years Customer bases 215 years Financials 132 Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2018 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 10.
For licences and spectrum and other intangible assets, amortisation is included within the cost of sales line within the consolidated income statement.

Property, plant and equipment The Group makes significant investments in network equipment and infrastructure the base stations and technology required to operate our networks that form the majority of our tangible assets.
All assets are depreciated over their useful economic lives.
For further details on the estimation of useful economic lives, see Critical accounting judgements in note 1 Basis of preparation to the consolidated financial statements.
Accounting policies Land and buildings held for use are stated in the statement of financial position at their cost, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Amounts for equipment, fixtures and fittings, which includes network infrastructure assets and which together comprise an all but insignificant amount of the Groups property, plant and equipment, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment losses.
Depreciation of these assets commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
The cost of property, plant and equipment includes directly attributable incremental costs incurred in their acquisition and installation.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land, using the straight-line method, over their estimated useful lives, as follows: Land and buildings Freehold buildings 2550 years Leasehold premises the term of the lease Equipment, fixtures and fittings Network infrastructure and other 135 years Depreciation is not provided on freehold land.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between any sale proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.

Where securities are held for trading purposes, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in net profit or loss for the period.
For available-for-sale investments, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, until the security is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income, determined using the weighted average cost method, is included in the net profit or loss for the period.

Provisions A provision is a liability recorded in the statement of financial position, where there is uncertainty over the timing or amount that will be paid, and is therefore often estimated.
The main provisions we hold are in relation to asset retirement obligations, which include the cost of returning network infrastructure sites to their original condition at the end of the lease, and claims for legal and regulatory matters.
Accounting policies Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the reporting date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Where the timing of settlement is uncertain amounts are classified as non-current where settlement is expected more than 12 months from the reporting date.
Asset retirement obligations In the course of the Groups activities, a number of sites and other assets are utilised which are expected to have costs associated with decommissioning.
The associated cash outflows are substantially expected to occur at the dates of exit of the assets to which they relate, whicharelong term in nature.
Legal and regulatory The Group is involved in a number of legal and other disputes, including notifications of possible claims.
The Directors of the Company, after taking legal advice, have established provisions after taking into account the facts of each case.
For a discussion of certain legal issues potentially affecting the Group see note 29 Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings to the consolidated financial statements.
Other provisions Other provisions comprises various provisions including those for restructuring costs and property.
The associated cash outflows for restructuring costs are primarily less than one year.
The timing of the cash flows associated with property is dependent upon the remaining term of the associated lease.

Borrowings The Groups sources of borrowing for funding and liquidity purposes come from a range of committed bank facilities and through short-term and long-term issuances in the capital markets including bond and commercial paper issues and bank loans.
We manage the basis on which we incur interest on debt between fixed interest rates and floating interest rates depending on market conditions using interest rate derivatives.
The Group enters into foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of exchange rate movements on certain monetary items.
Accounting policies Capital market and bank borrowings Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are initially measured at fair value which is equal to cost at inception, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Where they are identified as a hedged item in a designated fair value hedge relationship, fair value adjustments are recognised in accordance with policy see note 22.
Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the amount due on settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowing.
Where bonds issued with certain conversion rights are identified as compound instruments they are initially measured at fair value with the nominal amounts recognised as a component in equity and the fair value of future coupons included in borrowings.
These are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Carrying value and fair value information The carrying value and fair value of the Groups borrowings are as follows: Carrying value Fair value 2018 2017 2018 2017 m m m m Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost Bank loans 1,159 867 1,180 898 Commercial paper 2,712 3,648 2,715 3,650 1 Bonds 3,062 660 3,057 667 2,3 Other liabilities 3,003 4,632 3,003 4,632 Bonds in designated hedge relationships 415 2,244 409 2,241 Short-term borrowings 10,351 12,051 10,364 12,088 Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost: Bank loans 2,157 2,741 2,176 2,769 1 Bonds 18,804 19,345 18,714 19,286 Other liabilities 278 305 278 305 Bonds in designated hedge relationships 11,669 12,132 11,010 11,349 Long-term borrowings 32,908 34,523 32,178 33,709 Notes: 1 Bonds mature between 2018 and 2056 2017: 2017 and 2056 and have interest rates of 0.0% to 8.125% 2017: 0.0% to 8.125%.

3 Amount includes 1,070 million 2017: 2,654 million in relation to collateral support agreements.
Fair values of bonds and financial liabilities measured at amortised cost are based on Level 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy respectively, using quoted market prices or discounted cash flows with a discount rate based upon forward interest rates available to the Group at the reporting date.
The Groups gross and net debt includes certain bonds which have been designated in hedge relationships, which are carried at 1.7 billion higher than their euro equivalent redemption value.
In addition, where bonds are issued in currencies other than euros, the Group has entered into foreign currency swaps to fix the euro cash outflows on redemption.
The impact of these swaps are not reflected in gross debt and would increase the euro equivalent redemption value of the bonds by 0.6 billion.

On 25 February 2016 the Group issued 2.9 billion 3.5 billion of subordinated mandatory convertible bonds MCB issued in two tranches, with the first 1.4 billion 1.7 billion maturing during the year on 25 August 2017 and a further 1.4 billion 1.7 billion maturing on 25 February 2019 with coupons of 1.5% and 2.0% respectively.
These were recognised as compound instruments with nominal values of 2.8 billion 3.5 billion recognised as a component of shareholders funds in equity and the fair value of future coupons of 0.1 billion 0.1 billion recognised as a financial liability in borrowings.
Financials 148 Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2018 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 21.
Liquidity and capital resources continued The first tranche of the MCB converted to 729.1 million shares on 25 August 2017, reissued from treasury shares, at a conversion price of 1.9751.
This reflected the conversion price at issue 2.1730 adjusted for the pound sterling equivalent of aggregate dividends paid in August 2016, February 2017, and August 2017.
At March 2018 conversion price of 1.9387, additionally reflecting dividends paid in February 2018, the remaining tranche would convert to 743 million Vodafone Group Plc shares representing approximately 3% of Vodafones share capital.
The Group has hedged its exposure under the MCB to any future movements in its share price by an option strategy designed to hedge the economic impact of share price movements during the term of the bonds.
Should the Group decide to buy back ordinary shares to mitigate the dilution resulting from the conversion of the remaining tranche, the hedging strategy will provide a hedge for the repurchase price.
Own shares The Group held a maximum of 2,192,064,339 of its own shares during the year which represented 8.0% of issued share capital at that time.
Committed facilities In aggregate we have committed facilities of approximately 9,568 million, of which 7,168 million was undrawn and 2,400 million was drawn at 31 March 2018.
The following table summarises the committed bank facilities available to us at 31 March 2018.
1 Facility Amount m Drawn Maturity Syndicated revolving credit facilities 2 EUR facility 3,840 11 January 2023 2 USD facility 3,328 27 February 2022 Loan facilities, capped at 50% of operating company capital expenditure in: Canada 651 651 02 June 2018 UK and Ireland 568 568 12 December 2021 Germany VDSL spend 350 350 16 March 2023 Italy 400 400 05 June 2020 Turkey and Romania 300 300 18 September 2019 Turkey 100 100 04 December 2020 Other 31 31 19 September 2018 9,568 2,400 Notes: 1 Lenders have the right, but not the obligation, to cancel their commitments and have outstanding advances repaid no sooner than 30 days after notification of a change of control.
This is in addition to the rights of lenders to cancel their commitment if we commit an event of default: however, it should be noted that a material adverse change clause does not apply.
2 0.1 billion US$0.1 billion of the facility expires one year ahead of maturity.
Furthermore, certain of our subsidiaries are funded by external facilities which are non-recourse to any member of the Group other than the borrower.
These facilities may only be used to fund their operations.
At 31 March 2018 Vodafone Egypt had undrawn revolving credit facilities of EGP3 billion 138 million.
Vodacom had fully drawn facilities of US$75 million 61 million and facilities of ZAR0.48 billion 33 million of which ZAR0.46 billion 32 million was drawn.
Vodafone Ghana had fully drawn facilities of US$143 million 116 million and GHS60 million 11 million.
Dividends from associates and to non-controlling shareholders Dividends from our associates are generally paid at the discretion of the Board of Directors or shareholders of the individual operating and holding companies, and we have no rights to receive dividends except where specified within certain of the Groups shareholders agreements.
Similarly, other than ongoing dividend obligations to the KDG minority shareholders, should they continue to hold their minority stake, we do not have existing obligations under shareholders agreements to pay dividends to non-controlling interest partners of our subsidiaries or joint ventures.
The amount of dividends received and paid in the year are disclosed in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
Potential cash outflows from option agreements and similar arrangements Under the terms of the sale and purchase agreement governing the disposal of the US Group, including the 45% interest in Verizon Wireless, the Group retains the responsibility for any tax liabilities of the US Group, excluding those relating to the Verizon Wireless partnership, for periods up to the completion of the transaction on 21 February 2014.
Put options issued as part of the hedging strategy for the mandatory convertible bonds permit the holders to exercise against the Group if there is a decrease in our share price.
Under the terms of the options, settlement must be made in cash which will equate to the reduced value of shares from the initial conversion price, adjusted for dividends declared during the year, on 743 million shares.
Sale of trade receivables During the year the Group sold certain trade receivables to a financial institution.
Whilst there are no repurchase obligations in respect of these receivables, the Group provided a credit guarantee which would only become payable if default rates were significantly higher than historical rates.
The credit guarantee is not considered substantive and substantially all risks and rewards associated with the receivables passed to the purchaser at the date of sale, therefore the receivables were derecognised.
The maximum payable under the guarantees at 31 March 2018 was 506 million.
No provision has been made in respect of these guarantees as the likelihood of a cash outflow has been assessed as remote.
Supplier Financing arrangements The Group offers certain suppliers the opportunity to use a supply chain financing scheme SCF which allows them to be paid earlier than the invoice due date.
The Group evaluates supplier arrangements against a number of indicators to assess if the payable continues to hold the characteristics of a trade payable or should be classified as borrowings: these indicators include whether the payment terms exceed customary payment terms in the industry or 180 days.
At 31 March 2018 none of the payables subject to supplier financing arrangements met the criteria to be reclassified as borrowings.

Capital and financial risk management This note details the treasury management and financial risk management objectives and policies, as well as theexposure and sensitivity of the Group to credit, liquidity, interest and foreign exchange risk, and the policies inplace to monitor and manage these risks.
Accounting policies Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities, in respect of financial instruments, are recognised on the Groups statement of financial position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.
An equity instrument is any contract that provides a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities and includes no obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets.
The accounting policies adopted for specific financial liabilities and equity instruments are set out below.
Put option arrangements over non-controlling interest The potential cash payments related to put options issued by the Group over the equity of subsidiary companies are accounted for as financial liabilities when such options may only be settled by exchange of a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of shares in the subsidiary.
The amount that may become payable under the option on exercise is initially recognised at present value within borrowings with a corresponding charge directly to equity.
The charge to equity is recognised separately as written put options over non-controlling interests, adjacent to noncontrolling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries.
The Group recognises the cost of writing such put options, determined as the excess of the present value of the option over any consideration received, as a financing cost.
Such options are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method, in order to accrete the liability up to the amount payable under the option at the date at which it first becomes exercisable: the charge arising is recorded as a financing cost.
In the event thatthe option expires unexercised, the liability is derecognised with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Groups activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates which it manages using derivative financial instruments.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives consistent with the Groups risk management strategy.
Changes in values of all derivatives of a financing nature are included within investment income and financing costs in the income statement unless designated in an effective cash flow hedge relationship or a hedge of a net investment in foreign operations when changes in value are deferred to other comprehensive income or equity respectively.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date.
The Group designates certain derivatives as: hedges of the change of fair value of recognised assets and liabilities fair value hedges : or hedges of highly probable forecast transactions or hedges of foreign currency or interest rate risks of firm commitments cash flow hedges : or hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, or if the Company chooses to end the hedging relationship.
Fair value hedges The Groups policy is to use derivative instruments primarily interest rate swaps to convert a proportion of its fixed rate debt to floating rates in order to hedge the interest rate risk arising, principally, from capital market borrowings.
The Group designates these as fair value hedges of interest rate risk with changes in fair value of the hedging instrument recognised in the income statement for the period together with the changes in the fair value of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk, to the extent the hedge is effective.
Gains or losses relating to any ineffective portion are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Cash flow hedges Cash flow hedging is used by the Group to hedge certain exposures to variability in future cash flows.
The portion of gains or losses relating to changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as effective cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income: gains or losses relating to any ineffective portion are recognised immediately in the income statement.
When the hedged item is recognised in the income statement, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity for the hedging instrument are reclassified to the income statement.
However, when the hedged transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability.
When hedge accounting is discontinued, any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income at that time remains in equity and is recognised in the income statement when the hedged transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Financials 150 Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2018 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 22.
Capital and financial risk management continued Net investment hedges Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
Gains and losses on those hedging instruments which include bonds, commercial paper, cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange contracts designated as hedges of the net investments in foreign operations are recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedging relationship is effective: these amounts are included in exchange differences on translation of foreign operations as stated in the statement of comprehensive income.
Gains and losses relating to hedge ineffectiveness are recognised immediately in the income statement for the period.
Gains and losses accumulated in the translation reserve are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
Capital management The following table summarises the capital of the Group at 31 March: 2018 2017 m m Net debt 31,469 31,169 Equity 68,607 73,719 Capital 100,076 104,888 The Groups policy is to borrow centrally using a mixture of long-term and short-term capital market issues and borrowing facilities to meet anticipated funding requirements.
These borrowings, together with cash generated from operations, are loaned internally or contributed as equity to certain subsidiaries.
The Board has approved three internal debt protection ratios being: net interest to operating cash flow plus dividends from associates : retained cash flow operating cash flow plus dividends from associates less interest, tax, dividends to non-controlling shareholders and equity dividends to net debt: and operating cash flow plus dividends from associates to net debt.
These internal ratios establish levels of debt that the Group should not exceed other than for relatively short periods of time and are shared with the Groups debt rating agencies being Moodys, FitchRatings and Standard & Poors.
Financial risk management The Groups treasury function manages centrally the Groups funding requirement, net foreign exchange exposure, interest rate management exposures and counterpart risk arising from investments and derivatives.
Treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and guidelines authorised and reviewed by the Board, most recently on 22 July 2017.
A treasury risk committee comprising of the Groups Chief Financial Officer, Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, Group Deputy Chief Financial Officer, Group Treasury Director and Group Director of Financial Controlling and Operations meets three times a year to review treasury activities and its members receive management information relating to treasury activities on a quarterly basis.
The Groups accounting function, which does not report to the Group Treasury Director, provides regular update reports of treasury activity to the Board.
The Groups internal auditor reviews the internal control environment regularly.
The Group uses a number of derivative instruments for currency and interest rate risk management purposes only that are transacted by specialist treasury personnel.
The Group mitigates banking sector credit risk by the use of collateral support agreements.
Credit risk The Group considers its maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 March to be as follows: 2018 2017 m m Bank deposit 2,197 1,856 Cash held in restricted deposits 1,382 1,109 German government bonds 862 UK government bonds 1,112 1,638 Money market investments funds 2,477 6,979 Derivative financial instruments 2,629 4,282 Other investments debt and bonds 8,596 6,747 Trade receivables 5,402 5,335 Other receivables and accrued income 3,410 2,886 28,067 30,832 The Group invested in UK and German government bonds on the basis they generate a fixed rate return and, are amongst the most creditworthy of investments available.
The Group has three managed investment funds.
These funds hold fixed income euro and sterling securities and the average credit quality is high double A.
Money market investments are in accordance with established internal treasury policies which dictate that an investments long-term credit rating is no lower than mid BBB.
Additionally, the Group invests in AAA unsecured money market mutual funds where the investment is limited to 10% of each fund.
The Group also invests in a fund where the underlying assets are supply chain receivables, the creditworthiness of which are enhanced by an insurance wrapper as provided by established insurance companies with a long-term credit rating of at least A-.
Overview Strategic Report Governance Financials Other information Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2018 151 In respect of financial instruments used by the Groups treasury function, the aggregate credit risk the Group may have with one counterparty is limited by i reference to the long-term credit ratings assigned for that counterparty by Moodys, Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poors: ii that counterpartys five year credit default swap CDS spread: and iii the sovereign credit rating of that counterpartys principal operating jurisdiction.
Furthermore, collateral support agreements were introduced from the fourth quarter of 2008.
Under collateral support agreements the Groups exposure to a counterparty with whom a collateral support agreement is in place is reduced to the extent that the counterparty must post cash collateral when there is value due to the Group under outstanding derivative contracts that exceeds a contractually agreed threshold amount.
When value is due to the counterparty the Group is required to post collateral on identical terms.
Such cash collateral is adjusted daily as necessary.
In the event of any default, ownership of the cash collateral would revert to the respective holder at that point.
Detailed below is the value of the cash collateral, which is reported within short-term borrowings, held by the Group at 31 March: 2018 2017 m m Cash collateral 1,070 2,654 The majority of the Groups trade receivables are due for maturity within 90 days and largely comprise amounts receivable from consumers and business customers.
At 31 March 2018 3,389 million 2017: 3,322 million of trade receivables were not yet due for payment.
Overdue trade receivables consisted of 942 million 2017: 789 million relating to the Europe region, and 306 million 2017: 423 million relating to the AMAPregion.
Financial statements are monitored by management and provisions for bad and doubtful debts raised where it is deemed appropriate.
The following table presents ageing of receivables that are past due and provisions for doubtful receivables that have been established: 2018 2017 Gross Less Net Gross Less Net receivables provisions receivables receivables provisions receivables m m m m m m 30 days or less 810 32 778 730 27 703 Between 31 and 60 days 226 35 191 125 23 102 Between 61 and 180 days 530 206 324 648 258 390 Greater than 180 days 1,250 925 325 1,423 1,077 346 2,816 1,198 1,618 2,926 1,385 1,541 Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited given that the Groups customer base is large and unrelated.
Due to this, management believes there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the normal provision for bad and doubtful receivables.
Amounts charged to administrative expenses duringthe year ended 31 March 2018 were 528 million 2017: 589 million seenote 14 Trade andother receivables.
As discussed in note 29 Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings, the Group has covenanted to provide security in favour of the trustee of the Vodafone Group UK Pension Scheme in respect of the funding deficit in the scheme.
The security takes the form of an English law pledge over UK index-linked government bonds.
Liquidity risk At 31 March 2018 the Group had 3.8 billion and US$4.1 billion syndicated committed undrawn bank facilities which support the US$15 billion and 8 billion commercial paper programme available to the Group.
The Group uses commercial paper and bank facilities to manage short-term liquidity and manages long-term liquidity by raising funds in the capital markets.
The euro syndicated committed facility has a maturity date of 11 January 2023.
The US$ syndicated committed facility has a maturity date of 27 February 2022.
Both facilities have remained undrawn throughout thefinancial year and since year end and provide liquidity support.
The Group manages liquidity risk on long-term borrowings by maintaining a varied maturity profile with a cap on the level of debt maturity in any one calendar year, therefore minimising refinancing risk.
Long-term borrowings mature between one and 38 years.
Liquidity is reviewed daily on at least a 12 month rolling basis and stress tested on the assumption that all commercial paper outstanding matures and is not reissued.
The Group maintains substantial cash and cash equivalents which at 31 March 2018 amounted to 4,674 million 2017: 8,835 million.
Financials 152 Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2018 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 22.
Capital and financial risk management continued Market risk Interest rate management Under the Groups interest rate management policy, interest rates on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in euros, US dollars and sterling are maintained on a floating rate basis except for periods up to six years where interest rate fixing has to be undertaken in accordance with treasury policy.
The policy also allows euros, US dollars and sterling to be moved to a fixed rate basis if interest rates are statistically low.
Where assets and liabilities are denominated in other currencies interest rates may also be fixed.
In addition, fixing is undertaken for longer periods when interest rates are statistically low.
For each one hundred basis point rise in market interest rates for all currencies in which the Group had borrowings at 31 March 2018 there would be an increase in profit before tax by approximately 372 million 2017: approximately 470 million including mark-to-market revaluations of interest rate and other derivatives and the potential interest on outstanding tax issues.
There would be no material impact on equity.
At 31 March 2018 other than USD denominated liabilities, which are retained in order to hedge foreign exchange movements arising from our investment in VZ Communication loan notes, substantially all of our outstanding liabilities are held on a fixed interest rate basis in accordance with treasury policy.
Foreign exchange management As Vodafones primary listing is on the London Stock Exchange its share price is quoted in sterling.
Since the sterling share price represents the value of its future multi-currency cash flows, principally in euro, South African rand and sterling, the Group maintains the currency of debt and interest charges in proportion to its expected future principal cash flows and has a policy to hedge external foreign exchange risks on transactions denominated in other currencies above a certain fide minimis level.
At 31 March 2018 27% of net debt was denominated in currencies other than euro 9% sterling, 8% US dollar, 7% South African rand and 3% other.
This allows US dollar, South African rand and other debt to be serviced in proportion to expected future cash flows and therefore provides a partial hedge against income statement translation exposure, as interest costs will be denominated in foreign currencies.
Under the Groups foreign exchange management policy, foreign exchange transaction exposure in Group companies is generally maintained at the lower of 5 million per currency per month or 15 million per currency over a six month period.
The Group recognises foreign exchange movements in equity for the translation of net investment hedging instruments and balances treated as investments in foreign operations.
However, there is no net impact on equity for exchange rate movements on net investment hedging instruments as there would be an offset in the currency translation of the foreign operation.
At 31 March 2018 the Group held financial liabilities in a net investment hedge against the Groups South African rand.
Sensitivity to foreign exchange movements on the hedging liabilities, analysed against a strengthening of the South African rand by 15% 2017:18% would result in a decrease in equity of 348 million 2017: 493 million which would be fully offset by foreign exchange movements on the hedged net assets.
The following table details the Groups sensitivity of the Groups adjusted operating profit to a strengthening of the Groups major currency in which it transacts.
The percentage movement applied to the currency is based on the average movements in the previous three annual reporting periods.
Amounts are calculated by retranslating the operating profit of each entity whose functional currency is South African rand.
2018 2017 m m 1 ZAR 15% change 2017: 18% Operating profit 239 249 Notes: 1 Operating profit before impairment losses and other income and expense.
At 31 March 2018 the Groups sensitivity to foreign exchange movements, analysed against a strengthening of the US dollar by 9% 2017: 11% on its external US dollar exposure, would decrease the profit before tax by 65 million 2017: 100 million.
Foreign exchange on certain sterling balances analysed against a 7% 2017: 10% strengthening of sterling would increase the profit before tax by 208 million 2017: decrease by 262 million.
Equity risk There is no material equity risk relating to the Groups equity investments which are detailed in note 13 Other investments.
The Group has hedged its exposure under the subordinated mandatory convertible bonds to any future movements in its share price by an option strategy designed to hedge the economic impact of share price movements during the term of the bonds.
As at 31 March 2018 the Groups sensitivity to a movement of 10% 2017: 7% in its share price would result in an increase or decrease in profit before tax of approximately 164 million 2017: 236 million.

Employees This note shows the average number of people employed by the Group during the year, in which areas of our business our employees work and where they are based.
It also shows total employment costs.
Post employment benefits The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans for our employees.
The Groups largest defined benefit scheme is in the UK.
For further details see Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty in note 1 Basis of preparation to the consolidated financial statements.
Accounting policies For defined benefit retirement plans, the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the present value of the plan liabilities is recognised as an asset or liability on the statement of financial position.
Scheme liabilities are assessed using the projected unit funding method and applying the principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting period date.
Assets are valued at market value.
Actuarial gains and losses are taken to the statement of comprehensive income as incurred.
For this purpose, actuarial gains and losses comprise both the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments arising from differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred.
The return on plan assets, in excess of interest income, is also taken to other comprehensive income.
Other movements in the net surplus or deficit are recognised in the income statement, including the current service cost, any past service cost and the effect of any settlements.
The interest cost less the expected interest income on assets is also charged to the income statement.
The amount charged to the income statement in respect of these plans is included within operating costs or in the Groups share of the results of equity accounted operations, as appropriate.
The Groups contributions to defined contribution pension plans are charged to the income statement as they fall due.
Background At 31 March 2018 the Group operated a number of pension plans for the benefit of its employees throughout the world, with varying rights and obligations depending on the conditions and practices in the countries concerned.
The Groups pension plans are provided through both defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements.
Defined benefit schemes provide benefits based on the employees length of pensionable service and their final pensionable salary or other criteria.
Defined contribution schemes offer employees individual funds that are converted into benefits at the time of retirement.
The Group operates defined benefit schemes in Germany, Ghana, India, Ireland, Italy, the UK and the United States.
Defined contribution pension schemes are currently provided in Australia, Egypt, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, SouthAfrica, Spain and the UK.

The Groups preferred retirement provision is focused on Defined Contribution DC arrangements and or State provision for future service.
The Groups main defined benefit funding liability is the Vodafone UK Group Pension Scheme Vodafone UK plan.
Since June 2014 the plan has consisted of two segregated sections: the Vodafone Section and the Cable & Wireless Section CWW Section.
Both sections are closed to new entrants and to future accrual.
The Group also operates funded and unfunded plans in Germany and funded plans in Ireland.
Defined benefit pension provision exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as longer than expected longevity of participants, lower than expected return on investments and higher than expected inflation, which may increase the liabilities or reduce the value of assets of the schemes.
The defined benefit schemes are administered by Trustee Boards who are legally separate from the Group and consist of representatives who are employees, former employees or are independent from the Company.
The Boards of the pension schemes are required by legislation to act in the best interest of the participants, set the investment strategy and contribution rates and are subject to statutory funding objectives.
The Vodafone UK plan is registered as an occupational pension plan with HMRC and is subject to UK legislation and operates within the framework outlined by the Pensions Regulator.
UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently and that valuations are undertaken at least every three years.
Separate valuations are required for the Vodafone Section and CWW Section.
The trustees obtain regular actuarial valuations to check whether the statutory funding objective is met and whether a recovery plan is required to restore funding to the level of the agreed technical provisions.
On 19 October 2017, the 31 March 2016 triennial actuarial valuation for the Vodafone Section and CWW Section of the Vodafone UK plan, which is used to judge the funding the Group needs to put into the scheme, was concluded.
This valuation showed a net deficit of 279 million 317 million on the schemes funding basis, comprising of a 339 million 385 million deficit for the Vodafone Section offset by a 60 million 68 million surplus for the CWW Section.
These scheme specific actuarial valuations will always be different to the IAS 19 accounting deficit, which is an accounting rule concerning employee benefits and shown on the Groups consolidated statement of financial position.
Financials 156 Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2018 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 25.
Post employment benefits continued The Group and Trustees of the scheme agreed a funding plan to address the valuation deficit in the Vodafone Section over the period to 31 March 2025 and made a cash contribution on 19 October 2017 of 185 million 209 million into the Vodafone Section and a further cash payment in accordance with the arrangements set under the previous valuation of 58 million 66 million into the CWW Section.
These cash payments were invested into annuity policies issued by a third party insurance company which in turn entered into a reinsurance policy covering these risks with the Groups captive insurance company.
No further contributions are due in respect of the deficit revealed at the 2016 valuation.
Funding plans are individually agreed for each of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes with the respective trustees, taking into account local regulatory requirements.
It is expected that ordinary contributions relating to future service of 61 million will be paid into the Groups defined benefit pension schemes during the year ending 31 March 2019.
The Group has also provided certain guarantees in respect of the Vodafone UK plan: further details are provided in note 29 Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings to the consolidated financial statements.
The investment strategy for the UK schemes is controlled by the trustees in consultation with the Company and the schemes have no direct investments in the Groups equity securities or in property or other assets currently used by the Group.
The allocation of assets between different classes of investment is reviewed regularly and is a key factor in the trustees investment policy.
The trustees aim to achieve the schemes investment objectives through investing partly in a diversified mix of growth assets which, over the long term are expected to grow in value by more than the low risk assets.
The low risk assets include cash and gilts, inflation and interest rate hedging and in substantial insured pensioner annuity policies in both the Vodafone Section and CWW Sections of the Vodafone UK plan.
A number of investment managers are appointed to promote diversification by assets, organisation and investment style and current market conditions and trends are regularly assessed, which may lead to adjustments in the asset allocation.
Actuarial assumptions The Groups scheme liabilities are measured using the projected unit credit method using the principal actuarial assumptions set out below: 2018 2017 2016 % % % 1 Weighted average actuarial assumptions used at 31 March : 2 Rate of inflation 2.9 3.0 2.8 Rate of increase in salaries 2.7 2.6 2.6 Discount rate 2.5 2.6 3.2 Notes: 1 Figures shown represent a weighted average assumption of the individual schemes.
2 The rate of increases in pensions in payment and deferred revaluation are dependent on the rate of inflation.
Mortality assumptions used are based on recommendations from the individual scheme actuaries which include adjustments for the experience of the Group where appropriate.
The Groups largest scheme is the Vodafone UK plan.
Further life expectancies assumed for the UK schemes are 23.2 26.5 years 2017: 24.1 25.4 years: 2016: 24.0 25.3 years for a male female pensioner currently aged 65 years and 26.1 29.3 2017: 26.7 28.3years: 2016: 26.6 28.1years from age 65 for a male female non-pensioner member currently aged 40.

The International Accounting Standards Board IASB published an Exposure Draft in June 2015 that would amend IFRIC14 IAS19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and Their Interaction.
However, in 2017 the IASB stated that they are carrying out further work to assess whether it can establish a more principles-based approach in IFRIC14 for an entity to assess and measure its right to a refund of a surplus.
As such, it is not clear at this stage how and when IFRIC14 may be revised, and we will assess the impact of any changes when the revised version is published.
An analysis of net assets deficit is provided below for the Groups largest defined benefit pension scheme in the UK, which is a funded scheme.
As part of the merger of the Vodafone UK plan and the CWWRP plan on 6 June 2014 the assets and liabilities of the CWW Section are segregated from the Vodafone Section and hence are reported separately below.

The fair value of scheme assets, which have been measured at fair value in accordance with IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement, are analysed by asset category above and are subdivided by assets that have a quoted market price in an active market and those that do not, such as investment funds.
Where available, the fair values are quoted prices e. g. listed equity, sovereign debt and corporate bonds.
Unlisted investments without quoted prices in an active market e. g. private equity are included at values provided by the fund manager in accordance with relevant guidance.
Other significant assets are valued based on observable inputs such as yield curves.
The Vodafone UK Plan annuity policies include two new buy-in arrangements with Legal & General Assurance Society Limited entered into during the year ended 31 March 2018 following the cash contributions made by the Group.
These policies fully match the pension obligations of those pensioners insured and therefore are set equal to the present value of the related obligations.
Investment funds of 275 million at 31 March 2018 include 259 million of investments in diversified alternate beta funds held in the Vodafone Section of the Vodafone UK plan.
The actual return on plan assets over the year to 31 March 2018 was a gain of 130 million 2017: 1,008 million.
Sensitivity analysis Measurement of the Groups defined benefit retirement obligation is sensitive to changes in certain key assumptions.
The sensitivity analysis below shows how a reasonably possible increase or decrease in a particular assumption would, in isolation, result in an increase or decrease in the present value of the defined benefit obligation as at 31 March 2018.
Rate of inflation Rate of increase in salaries Discount rate Life expectancy Decrease by 0.5% Increase by 0.5% Decrease by 0.5% Increase by 0.5% Decrease by 0.5% Increase by 0.5% Increase by 1 year Decrease by 1 year m m m m m m m m Decrease increase in present value 1 of defined obligation 556 633 4 5 833 713 223 220 Note: 1 The sensitivity analysis may not be representative of an actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that changes in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another.
In presenting this sensitivity analysis, the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated on the same basis as prior years using the projected unit credit method at the end of the year, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the statement of financial position.
The rate of inflation assumption sensitivity factors in the impact of changes to all assumptions relating to inflation including the rate of increase in salaries, pension increases and deferred revaluations.

Share-based payments The Group has a number of share plans used to award shares to Directors and employees as part of their remuneration package.
A charge is recognised over the vesting period in the consolidated income statement to record the cost of these, based on the fair value of the award on the grant date.
Accounting policies The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
A corresponding increase in retained earnings is also recognised.
Some share awards have an attached market condition, based on total shareholder return TSR, which is taken into account when calculating thefair value of the share awards.
The valuation for the TSR is based on Vodafones ranking within the same group of companies, where possible, over the past five years.
The fair value of awards of non-vested shares is an average calculation of the closing price of the Groups shares on the days prior to the grant date, adjusted for the present value of the delay in receiving dividends where appropriate.
The maximum aggregate number of ordinary shares which may be issued in respect of share options or share plans will not without shareholder approval exceed: 10% of the ordinary share capital of the Company in issue immediately prior to the date of grant, when aggregated with the total number of ordinary shares which have been allocated in the preceding ten year period under all plans: and 5% of the ordinary share capital of the Company in issue immediately prior to the date of grant, when aggregated with the total number of ordinary shares which have been allocated in the preceding ten year period under all plans, other than any plans which are operated on an all-employee basis.
Share options Vodafone Group executive plans No share options have been granted to any Directors or employees under the Companys discretionary share option plans in the year ended 31 March 2018.
There were no options outstanding under the Vodafone Global Incentive Plan at the year-end.
Vodafone Group Sharesave Plan The Vodafone Group 2008 Sharesave Plan enables UK staff to acquire shares in the Company through monthly savings of up to 375 over a three and or five year period, at the end of which they may also receive a tax-free bonus.
The savings and bonus may then be used to purchase shares at the option price, which is set at the beginning of the invitation period and usually at a discount of 20% to the then prevailing market price of the Companys shares.
Share plans Vodafone Group executive plans Under the Vodafone Global Incentive Plan awards of shares are granted to Directors and certain employees.
The release of these shares is conditional upon continued employment and for some awards achievement of certain performance targets measured over a three year period.
Vodafone Share Incentive Plan Following a review of the UK all-employee plans it was decided that with effect from 1 April 2017 employees would no longer be able to contribute to the Share Incentive Plan and would therefore no longer receive matching shares.
Individuals who hold shares in the plan will continue to receive dividend shares.

Acquisitions and disposals We completed a number of acquisitions and disposals during the year.
The note below provides details of these transactions as well as those in the prior year including, most significantly, the combination of our operations in the Netherlands with those of Liberty Global plc to form VodafoneZiggo, a 50:50 joint venture.
Accounting policies Business combinations Acquisitions of subsidiaries are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the Group.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
The acquirees identifiable assets and liabilities are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the Groups previously held equity interest in the acquiree, if any, over the net amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.
The interest of the non-controlling shareholders in the acquiree may initially be measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling shareholders proportion of the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed.
The choice of measurement basis is made on an  basis.
Acquisition of interests from non-controlling shareholders In transactions with non-controlling parties that do not result in a change in control, the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid or received and the amount by which the non-controlling interest is adjusted is recognised in equity.
Disposals Vodafone And Qatar Foundation L. L. C Vodafone Qatar On 29 March 2018, the Group sold its 51% interest in Vodafone And Qatar Foundation L. L. C for consideration of QAR1,350 million 299 million.
The Group recognised a net gain on disposal of 113 million reported in other income and expense.
VodafoneZiggo Group Holding B. V. VodafoneZiggo On 31 December 2016, we combined our operations in the Netherlands with those of Liberty Global plc to create VodafoneZiggo Group Holding B. V. a 50:50 joint venture providing national unified communications.
As a result of the transaction, we no longer consolidate our previous interest in the Netherlands and account for our 50% interest in VodafoneZiggo as a Joint Venture using the equity method.
The Group recognised a net gain on the formation of VodafoneZiggo of 1,275 million.

2 The fair value of our initial investment in VodafoneZiggo is not observable in a quoted market.
Accordingly, the fair value has been primarily determined with reference to the outcome of a discounted cash flow analysis.
Certain significant inputs used in the valuation, such as forecasts of future cash flows, are based on our assumptions and are therefore unobservable.
The valuation therefore falls under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
The weighted average cost of capital and terminal growth rate used to value our initial investment in VodafoneZiggo were 7.0% and 1.0% respectively.

Commitments A commitment is a contractual obligation to make a payment in the future, mainly in relation to leases and agreements to buy assets such as network infrastructure and IT systems.
These amounts are not recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position since we have not yet received the goods or services from thesupplier.
The amounts below are the minimum amounts that we are committed to pay.
Accounting policies Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value at the inception of the lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments as determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the statement of financial position as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are recognised in the income statement.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Operating lease commitments The Group has entered into commercial leases on certain properties, network infrastructure, motor vehicles and items of equipment.
The leaseshave various terms, escalation clauses, purchase options and renewal rights, none of which are individually significant to the Group.
Future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases comprise: 2018 2017 m m Within one year 2,686 2,522 In more than one year but less than two years 1,633 1,487 In more than two years but less than three years 1,155 1,136 In more than three years but less than four years 903 882 In more than four years but less than five years 717 709 In more than five years 2,600 2,693 9,694 9,429 The total of future minimum sublease payments expected to be received under non-cancellable subleases is 859 million 2017: 584 million.

Overview Strategic Report Governance Financials Other information Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2018 163 Acquisition commitments Vodafone India On 20 March 2017, Vodafone announced the agreement to combine its subsidiary, Vodafone India excluding its 42% stake in Indus Towers, with Idea Cellular Limited Idea, which is listed on the Indian Stock Exchanges, with the combined company to be jointly controlled by Vodafone and the Aditya Birla Group ABG.
Vodafone will own 45.1% of the combined company after transferring a stake of 4.9% to the Aditya Birla Group for approximately INR39 billion approximately US$579 million in cash concurrent with completion of the merger.
ABG will then own 26.0% and has the right to acquire more shares from Vodafone under an agreed mechanism with a view to equalising the shareholdings over time.
If Vodafone and ABGs shareholdings in the combined company are not equal after four years, Vodafone will sell down shares in the combined company to equalise its shareholding to that of the ABG over the following five-year period.
Until equalisation is achieved, the voting rights of the additional shares held by Vodafone will be restricted and votes will be exercised jointly under the terms of the shareholders agreement.
The transaction has a break-fee of INR33 billion US$500 million that would become payable under certain circumstances.
On 4 January 2018 Idea announced its intention to raise up to INR67.5 billion 882 million of equity, which was achieved through a INR32.5 billion 425 million preferential allotment to the ABG entities and an additional INR35.0 billion 457 million of equity raised through a qualified institutions placement.
The proceeds from this capital raise, in addition to the INR78.5 billion 1.0 billion of proceeds from the announced disposals of Vodafone Indias and Ideas standalone tower businesses, would be used to strengthen the balance sheet of the merged entity Vodafone India and Idea.
As a consequence of the change in shareholding in Idea following the capital raise, ABG and Vodafone have agreed that ABG will buy a minimum of 2.5% of the merged entity from Vodafone, or such higher stake required in order for ABG to ultimately own at least 26% of the merged entity.
Consequently, Vodafone will receive minimum proceeds of INR19.6 billion 256 million from such sale and Vodafones ownership in the combined entity is expected to be not more than 47.5% at completion.
Vodafones stake in the combined entity in excess of 45.1% will not be subject to any lock-up after closing and Vodafone will be free to sell the relevant shares without restrictions.
Based on ABGs shareholding in Idea as at 31 March 2018, ABG will need to acquire approximately 4.8% of the merged entity from Vodafone at completion in order to own at least 26% of the merged entity.
This would result in Vodafone having an approximate 45.2% shareholding.
The aforementioned changes to the capital structure were already contemplated in the scheme of arrangement for the merger, which has been approved by the Competition Commission of India, the shareholders and creditors of both Idea and Vodafone India, and the relevant National Company Law Tribunals.
Foreign investment and Department of Telecommunications approvals are currently pending.
As such, Vodafone now expects the merger to be completed in June 2018.
As per the agreement entered into on 20 March 2017, Vodafone Indias contribution of net debt to the merged entity and Vodafone Groups funding requirement will be dependent on Ideas net debt at completion of the merger, as well as customary closing adjustments, but is not affected by proceeds received in relation to the announced disposals of Vodafone Indias and Ideas standalone towers and a potential monetisation of Ideas 11.15% stake in Indus Towers.
Vodafone will contribute INR24.8 billion 323 million more net debt than Idea at completion.
On 31 March 2018, Vodafone India completed the sale of its standalone tower business in India to ATC Telecom Infrastructure Private Limited ATC for an enterprise value of INR38.5 billion 478 million.
The receipt of these proceeds prior to completion of the proposed merger of Vodafone India and Idea was anticipated and provided for in the merger agreement and hence does not affect the agreed terms of the merger, including the amount of debt which Vodafone will contribute to the combined company at completion.
Completion of Ideas sale of its standalone tower business to ATC for INR40.0 billion is expected in the first half of this calendar year.
Following the completion of Ideas equity raise in February 2018, under the terms of the merger agreement with Idea the Group intends to inject up to 1 billion of incremental equity into India, net of the proceeds of the sale of a stake in the JV to the Aditya Birla Group, prior to completion.
Vodafone Greece On 23 January 2018, Vodafone announced that Vodafone Greece had agreed to acquire CYTA Telecommunications Hellas S. A. a provider of fixed and mobile telecommunication services in Greece, for a total enterprise value of 118 million.
The acquisition is subject to a number of conditions, including antitrust clearance by the relevant competent authorities.
Vodafone to acquire Liberty Globals operations in Germany, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania On 9 May 2018, Vodafone announced that it had agreed to acquire Liberty Globals operations in Germany, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania for an enterprise value of 18.4 billion.

2 Other guarantees principally comprise Vodafone Group Plcs guarantee of the Groups 50% share of an AUD1.7 billion loan facility and a US$3.5 billion loan facility of its joint venture, Vodafone Hutchison Australia Pty Limited.
The Groups share of these loan balances is included in the net investment in joint venture see note 12 Investments in joint ventures.
UK pension schemes The Groups main defined benefit scheme is the Vodafone UK Group Pension Scheme the Scheme which has two segregated sections, the Vodafone Section and the CWW Section, as detailed in note 25.
The Group has covenanted to provide security in favour of both the Vodafone Sections and CWW Section of the Scheme whilst a deficit remains.
The deficit is measured on a prescribed basis agreed between the Group and Trustee.
The Group provides a combination of surety bonds and a charge over UK indexed gilts as the security.
The level of the security has varied since inception in line with the movement in the Scheme deficit.
At 31 March 2018 the Scheme retains security over 536 million notional value for the Vodafone Section and 57 million notional value for the CWW Section.
The security may be substituted either on a voluntary or mandatory basis.
The Company has also provided two guarantees to the Vodafone Section of the Scheme for a combined value up to 1.7 billion to provide security over the deficit under certain defined circumstances, including insolvency of the employers.
The Company has also agreed a similar guarantee of up to 1.7 billion for the CWW Section.
An additional smaller UK defined benefit scheme, the THUS Plc Group Scheme, has a guarantee from the Company for up to 114 million.
Legal proceedings The Company and its subsidiaries are currently, and may from time to time become, involved in a number of legal proceedings, including inquiries from, or discussions with, governmental authorities that are incidental to their operations.
However, save as disclosed below, the Company does not believe that it or its subsidiaries are currently involved in i any legal or arbitration proceedings including any governmental proceedings which are pending or known to be contemplated which may have, or have had in the 12 months preceding the date of this report, a material adverse effect on the financial position or profitability of the Group: or ii any material proceedings in which any of the Companys Directors, members of senior management or affiliates are either a party adverse to the Company or its subsidiaries or have a material interest adverse to the Company or its subsidiaries.
Due to inherent uncertainties, the Company cannot make any accurate quantification of any cost, or timing of such cost, which may arise from any of the legal proceedings referred to in this Annual Report, however costs in complex litigation can be substantial.
Indian tax cases In August 2007 and September 2007, Vodafone India Limited VIL and Vodafone International Holdings BV VIHBV respectively received notices from the Indian tax authority alleging potential liability in connection with an alleged failure by VIHBV to deduct withholding tax from consideration paid to the Hutchison Telecommunications International Limited group HTIL in respect of HTILs gain on its disposal to VIHBV of its interests in a wholly-owned Cayman Island incorporated subsidiary that indirectly holds interests in VIL.
Following approximately five years of litigation in the Indian courts in which VIHBV sought to set aside the tax demand issued by the Indian tax authority, in January 2012 the Supreme Court of India handed down its judgement, holding that VIHBVs interpretation of the Income Tax Act 1961 was correct, that the HTIL transaction in 2007 was not taxable in India, and that consequently, VIHBV had no obligation to withhold tax from consideration paid to HTIL in respect of the transaction.
The Supreme Court of India quashed the relevant notices and demands issued to VIHBV in respect of withholding tax and interest.
On 28 May 2012 the Finance Act 2012 became law.
The Finance Act 2012, which amended various provisions of the Income Tax Act 1961 with retrospective effect, contained provisions intended to tax any gain on transfer of shares in a non-Indian company, which derives substantial value from underlying Indian assets, such as VIHBVs transaction with HTIL in 2007.
Further, it seeks to subject a purchaser, such as VIHBV, to a retrospective obligation to withhold tax.
VIHBV received a letter on 3 January 2013 from the Indian tax authority reminding it of the tax demand raised prior to the Supreme Court of Indias judgement and purporting to update the interest element of that demand to a total amount of INR142 billion, which includes principal and interest as calculated by the Indian tax authority but does not include penalties.
On 10 January 2014, VIHBV served an amended trigger notice on the Indian Government under the Netherlands-India Bilateral Investment Treaty Dutch BIT, supplementing a trigger notice filed on 17 April 2012, immediately prior to the Finance Act 2012 becoming effective, to add claims relating to an attempt by the Indian Government to tax aspects of the transaction with HTIL under transfer pricing rules.
A trigger notice announces a partys intention to submit a claim to arbitration and triggers a cooling off period during which both parties may seek to resolve the dispute amicably.
Notwithstanding their attempts, the parties were unable to amicably resolve the dispute within the cooling off period stipulated in the Dutch BIT.
On 17 April 2014, VIHBV served its notice of arbitration under the Dutch BIT, formally commencing the Dutch BIT arbitration proceedings.
In June 2016, the tribunal was fully constituted with Sir Franklin Berman KCMG QC appointed as presiding arbitrator.
The Indian Government has raised objections to the application of the treaty to VIHBVs claims and to the jurisdiction of the tribunal under the Dutch BIT.
On 19 June 2017, the tribunal decided to try both these jurisdictional objections along with the merits of VIHBVs claim in a hearing now scheduled for February 2019.
More recent attempts by the Indian Government to have the jurisdiction arguments heard separately have also failed.
VIHBV will file its response to Indias defence in July 2018 and India will respond in December 2018.
Overview Strategic Report Governance Financials Other information Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2018 165 Separately, on 15 June 2015, Vodafone Group Plc and Vodafone Consolidated Holdings Limited served a trigger notice on the Indian Government under the United Kingdom-India Bilateral Investment Treaty UK BIT in respect of retrospective tax claims under the Income Tax Act 1961 as amended by the Finance Act 2012.
Although relating to the same underlying facts as the claim under the Dutch BIT, the claim brought by Vodafone Group Plc and Vodafone Consolidated Holdings Limited is a separate and distinct claim under a different treaty.
On 24 January 2017, Vodafone Group Plc and Vodafone Consolidated Holdings Limited served a Notice of Arbitration on the Indian Government formally commencing the arbitration.
The Indian Government has appointed a second arbitrator as required under the UK BIT under protest.
The Indian Government has indicated that it considers the arbitration under the UK BIT to be an abuse of process but this is strongly denied by Vodafone.
On 22 August 2017, the Indian Government obtained an injunction from the Delhi High Court preventing Vodafone from progressing the UK BIT arbitration.
Vodafone was not present when India obtained this injunction and applied to dismiss it.
On 26 October 2017, the Delhi High Court varied its order to permit Vodafone to participate in the formation of the UK BIT tribunal.
It now consists of Marcelo Kohen, an Argentinian national and professor of international law in Geneva appointed by India, Neil Kaplan, a British national appointed by Vodafone Group Plc and Professor Campbell Mclachlan QC, a New Zealand national appointed by the parties as presiding arbitrator.
No further steps in the arbitration were permitted pending a decision on Indias injunction.
On 7 May 2018, the Delhi High Court dismissed the injunction.
The Indian Government has the right to appeal the decision.
On 12 February 2016, VIHBV received a notice dated 4 February 2016 of an outstanding tax demand of INR221 billion which included interest accruing since the date of the original demand along with a statement that enforcement action, including against VIHBVs indirectly held assets in India, would be taken if the demand was not satisfied.
On 29 September 2017, VIHBV received an electronically generated demand in respect of alleged principal, interest and penalties in the amount of INR190.7 billion.
This demand does not appear to have included any element for alleged accrued interest liability.
Separate proceedings in the Bombay High Court taken against VIHBV to seek to treat it as an agent of HTIL in respect of its alleged tax on the same transaction, as well as penalties of up to 100% of the assessed withholding tax for the alleged failure to have withheld such taxes, were listed for hearing at the request of the Indian Government on 21 April 2016 despite the issue having been ruled upon by the Supreme Court of India.
The hearing has since been periodically listed and then adjourned or not reached hearing.
VIHBV and Vodafone Group Plc will continue to defend vigorously any allegation that VIHBV or VIL is liable to pay tax in connection with the transaction with HTIL and will continue to exercise all rights to seek redress including pursuant to the Dutch BIT and the UK BIT.
We have not recorded a provision in respect of the retrospective provisions of the Income Tax Act 1961 as amended by the Finance Act 2012 and any tax demands based upon such provisions.
Other Indian tax cases VIL and Vodafone India Services Private Limited VISPL formerly 3GSPL are involved in a number of tax cases with total claims exceeding 2.4 billion plus interest, and penalties of up to 300% of the principal.
VISPL tax claims VISPL has been assessed as owing tax of approximately 264 million plus interest of 422 million in respect of i a transfer pricing margin charged for the international call centre of HTIL prior to the 2007 transaction with Vodafone for HTIL assets in India: ii the sale of the international call centre by VISPL to HTIL: and iii the acquisition of and or the alleged transfer of options held by VISPL for VIL.
The first two of the three heads of tax are subject to an indemnity by HTIL.
The larger part of the potential claim is not subject to any indemnity.
VISPL unsuccessfully challenged the merits of the tax demand in the statutory tax tribunal and the jurisdiction of the tax office to make the demand in the High Court.
The Tax Appeal Tribunal heard the appeal and ruled in the Tax Offices favour.
VISPL lodged an appeal and stay application in the Bombay High Court which was concluded in early May 2015.
On 13 July 2015 the tax authorities issued a revised tax assessment reducing the tax VISPL had previously been assessed as owing in respect of i and ii above.
In the meantime, i a stay of the tax demand on a deposit of 20 million and ii a corporate guarantee by VIHBV for the balance of tax assessed remain in place.
On 8 October 2015, the Bombay High Court ruled in favour of Vodafone in relation to the options and the call centre sale.
The Tax Office has appealed to the Supreme Court of India.
A hearing has been adjourned with no specified date.
Indian regulatory cases Litigation remains pending in the Telecommunications Dispute Settlement Appellate Tribunal TDSAT, High Courts and the Supreme Court of India in relation to a number of significant regulatory issues including mobile termination rates MTRs, spectrum and licence fees, licence extension and 3G intra-circle roaming ICR.
3G inter-circle roaming: Vodafone India and others v Union of India In April 2013, the Indian Department of Telecommunications DoT issued a stoppage notice to VILs operating subsidiaries and other mobile operators requiring the immediate stoppage of the provision of 3G services on other operators mobile networks in an alleged breach of licence claim.
The DoT also imposed a fine of approximately 5.5 million.
VIL applied to the Delhi High Court for an order quashing the DoTs notice.
Interim relief from the notice has been granted but limited to existing customers at the time with the effect that VIL was not able to provide 3G services to new customers on other operators 3G networks pending a decision on the issue.
The dispute was referred to the TDSAT for decision, which ruled on 28 April 2014 that VIL and the other operators were permitted to provide 3G services to their customers current and future on other operators networks.
The DoT has appealed the judgement and sought a stay of the tribunals judgement.
The DoTs stay application was rejected by the Supreme Court of India.
The matter is pending before the Supreme Court of India.
One time spectrum charges: VIL v Union of India The Indian Government has sought to impose one time spectrum charges of approximately 525 million on certain operating subsidiaries of VIL.
VIL filed a petition before the TDSAT challenging the one time spectrum charges on the basis that they are illegal, violate VILs licence terms and are arbitrary, unreasonable and discriminatory.
The tribunal stayed enforcement of the Governments spectrum demand pending resolution of the dispute.
The matter is due to go for final hearing before the Supreme Court of India, and will be listed in due course.
Other public interest litigation Three public interest litigations have been initiated in the Supreme Court of India against the Indian Government and private operators on the grounds that the grant of additional spectrum beyond 4.4 6.2 MHz has been illegal.
The cases seek appropriate investigation and compensation for the loss to the exchequer.
Financials 166 Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2018 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 29.
Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings continued Adjusted Gross Revenue AGR dispute before the Supreme Court of India: VIL and others v Union of India VIL has challenged the tribunals judgement dated 23 April 2015 to the extent that it dealt with the calculation of AGR, upon which licence fees and spectrum usage charges are based.
The cumulative impact of the inclusion of these components is approximately 1.67 billion.
The Department of Telecommunications DoT also moved cross appeals challenging the tribunals judgement.
In the hearing before the Supreme Court of India, the Court orally directed the DoT not to take any coercive steps in the matter, which was adjourned.
On 29 February 2016, the Supreme Court of India ordered that the DoT may continue to raise demands for fees and charges, but may not enforce them until a final decision on the matter.
Other cases in the Group Patent litigation Germany The telecoms industry is currently involved in significant levels of patent litigation brought by non-practising entities NPEs which have acquired patent portfolios from current and former industry companies.
Vodafone is currently a party to patent litigation cases in Germany brought against Vodafone Germany by Marthon, IPCom and Intellectual Ventures.
Vodafone has contractual indemnities from suppliers which have been invoked in relation to the alleged patent infringement liability.
Spain Vodafone Group Plc has been sued in Spain by TOT Power Control TOT, an affiliate of Top Optimized Technologies.
The claim makes a number of allegations including patent infringement, with TOT seeking over 500 million from Vodafone Group Plc as well as an injunction against using the technology in question.
Vodafones initial challenge of the appropriateness of Spain as a venue for this dispute was denied.
Vodafone Group Plc appealed the denial and was partially successful.
In a decision dated 30 October 2017, the court ruled that while it did have jurisdiction to hear the infringement case relating to the Spanish patent, it was not competent to hear TOTs contractual and competition law claims.
This decision is subject to appeal.
TOTs application for an injunction was unsuccessful and TOT is appealing.
A trial has now been set to commence on 10 September 2018.
Germany: Mannesmann and Kabel Deutschland takeover class actions Since 2001, the German courts have been determining the adequacy of the mandatory cash offer made to minority shareholders in Vodafones takeover of Mannesmann.
The German courts were also asked to consider whether squeeze out compensation was payable to affected Mannesmann shareholders in a similar proceeding.
In September 2014, the German courts awarded compensation to minority shareholders of Mannesmann in the amount of 229.58 per share, which would have resulted in a pay-out of 19 million.
The German courts also ruled that the squeeze out compensation should amount to 251.31 per share, which would have resulted in a pay-out of 43.8 million.
Vodafone appealed these decisions and in March 2018 the Court ruled in Vodafones favour that the original compensation had been adequate.
There is no right of appeal.
Similar proceedings were initiated by 80 Kabel Deutschland shareholders.
These proceedings are in their early stages, and, accordingly, Vodafone believes that it is too early to assess the likely quantum of any claim.
In a hearing on 6 October 2016, the Court examined the Kabel Deutschland business plan which formed the main basis for the calculation of the offer per share.
The next hearings are scheduled for June 2018.
Italy: British Telecom Italy v Vodafone Italy The Italian Competition Authority concluded an investigation in 2007 when Vodafone Italy gave certain undertakings in relation to allegations that it had abused its dominant position in the wholesale market for mobile termination.
In 2010, British Telecom Italy brought a civil damages claim against Vodafone Italy on the basis of the Competition Authoritys investigation and Vodafone Italys undertakings.
British Telecom Italy sought damages in the amount of 280 million for abuse of dominant position by Vodafone Italy in the wholesale fixed to mobile termination market for the period from 1999 to 2007.

Judgement was handed down by the court in August 2015, awarding 12 million including interest to British Telecom Italy.
British Telecom Italy appealed the amount of the damages to the Court of Appeal of Milan.
In addition, British Telecom Italy has asked again for a reference to the European Court of Justice for an interpretation of the European community law on antitrust damages.
Vodafone Italy also filed an appeal which was successful.
British Telecom Italy were ordered to repay to Vodafone Italy the 12 million with interest and legal costs.
An appeal to the Supreme Court is still possible.
Italy: FASTWEB v Vodafone Italy The Italian Competition Authority concluded an investigation in 2007 when Vodafone Italy gave certain undertakings in relation to allegations it had abused its dominant position in the wholesale market for mobile termination.

FASTWEB sought damages in the amount of 360 million for abuse of dominant position by Vodafone Italy in the wholesale fixed to mobile termination market.
A court appointed expert delivered an opinion to the Court that the range of damages in the case should be in the region of 0.5 million to 2.3 million.
On 15 October 2014, the Court decided to reject FASTWEBs damages claim in its entirety.
FASTWEB appealed the decision and the first appeal hearing took place in September 2015.
The final hearing took place in September 2016, and on 1 March 2017 the Court rejected FASTWEBs appeal and confirmed the first instance ruling.
FASTWEB appealed this decision to the Supreme Court and a decision is not expected for two to three years.

South Africa: GH Investments GHI v Vodacom Congo Vodacom Congo contracted with GHI to install ultra-low cost base stations on a revenue share basis.
After rolling out three sites, GHI stopped and sought to renegotiate the terms.
GHI accused it of bad faith and infringement of intellectual property rights.

The dispute was submitted to mediation under the International Chamber of Commerce.
A mediator was appointed in September 2015 who convened a first meeting which took place in early November 2015.
A follow-up mediation meeting was scheduled for December 2015 but was postponed without a new date having been fixed.
