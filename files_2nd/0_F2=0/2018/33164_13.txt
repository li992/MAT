2 Realised profits, unrealised profits, and portfolio income shown in the IFRS accounts onlyrelate to portfolio companies that are held directly by 3i Group plc and not those portfolio companies held through Investment entity subsidiaries.
Realised profits, unrealised profits, and portfolio income in relation to portfolio companies held through Investment entity subsidiaries are aggregated into the single Fair value movement on investment entity subsidiaries line.
This is the most significant reduction of information in our IFRS accounts.

Notes: 1 Applying IFRS 10 to the Consolidated statement of financial position aggregates the line items into the single line item Investments in investment entity subsidiaries.
In the Investment basis we have disaggregated these items to analyse our net assets as if the Investment entity subsidiaries were consolidated.
The adjustment reclassifies items in the Consolidated statement of financial position.
There is no change to the net assets, although for reasons explained below, gross assets and gross liabilities are different.
The disclosure relating to portfolio companies is significantly reduced by the aggregation, as the fair value of all investments held by Investment entity subsidiaries is aggregated into the Investments in investment entity subsidiaries line.
We have disaggregated this fair value and disclosed the underlying portfolio holding in the relevant line item, ie, quoted equity investments or unquoted equity investments.
Other items which may be aggregated include carried interest and other payables, and the Investment basis presentation again disaggregates these items.
2 Intercompany balances between Investment entity subsidiaries and trading subsidiaries also impact the transparency of our results under the IFRS basis.
If an Investment entity subsidiary has an intercompany balance with a consolidated trading subsidiary of the Group, then the asset or liability of the Investment entity subsidiary will be aggregated into its fair value, while the asset or liability of the consolidated trading subsidiary will bedisclosed as an asset or liability in the Consolidated statement of financial position forthe Group.
3 Investment basis financial statements are prepared for performance measurement and therefore reserves are not analysed separately under this basis.
