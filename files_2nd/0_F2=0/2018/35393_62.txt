Financial risk and capital management easyJet is exposed to financial risks including fluctuations in exchange rates, jet fuel prices and interest rates.
Financial risk management aims to limit these market risks with selected derivative hedging instruments being used for this purpose.
easyJets policy is not to speculatively trade derivatives but to use the instruments to hedge anticipated exposure.
As such, easyJet is not exposed to market risk by using derivatives as any gains and losses arising are offset by the outcome of the underlying exposure being hedged.
In addition to market risks, easyJet is exposed to credit and liquidity risk.
The Board is responsible for setting financial risk and capital management policies and objectives which are implemented by the Treasury function on a day-to-day basis.
The policy outlines the approach to risk management and also states the instruments and time periods which the Treasury function is authorised to use in managing financial risks.
The policy is regularly reviewed to ensure best practice, however there have been no significant changes during the current year.
Capital employed Capital employed comprises shareholders equity, borrowings, cash and money market deposits excluding restricted cash and an adjustment for the capital implicit in aircraft operating lease arrangements.
The adjustment is calculated by multiplying the annual charge for aircraft dry leasing by a factor of seven, in line with accepted practice for the airline industry.
Normalised operating profit is adjusted for the implied interest incorporated in the charge for aircraft dry leasing.
Consequently, the capital employed at the end of the current and prior year and the return earned during those years were as follows: 2018 2017 NonNonHeadline headline Total Headline headline Total million million million million million million Shareholders' equity 3,259 3,259 2,802 2,802 Borrowings 977 977 971 971 Cash and money market deposits excluding restricted cash 1,373 1,373 1,328 1,328 Reported capital employed 2,863 2,863 2,445 2,445 Operating lease adjustment 1,134 1,134 770 770 Capital employed including operating lease adjustment 3,997 3,997 3,215 3,215 Reported operating profit 592 132 460 428 24 404 Implied interest in operating lease costs 51 3 54 37 37 Adjusted operating profit 643 129 514 465 24 441 Tax rate 19% 19% Adjusted operating profit after tax 521 105 416 376 19 357 Return on capital employed 14.4% 11.5% 11.9% 11.3% Return on capital employed is calculated by dividing the adjusted operating profit after tax by the average of the opening and closing capital employed, including the operating lease adjustment.

Capital management The objective of capital management is to ensure that easyJet is able to continue as a going concern whilst delivering shareholder expectations of a strong capital base and returning benefits for other stakeholders.
easyJet manages its capital structure in response to changes in both economic conditions and strategic objectives.
The cash and net debt position, together with the maturity profile of existing debt, is monitored to ensure the continuity of funding.

Financial risk and capital management continued easyJet continues to hold significant cash and liquid funds to mitigate the impact of potential business disruption events as well as having access to two separate revolving credit facilities of $500 million and 250 million respectively.
The $500 million revolving credit facility was agreed on 10 February 2015, with an additional 250 million facility being signed with effect from 1 August 2018.
Both facilities were undrawn at 30 September 2018.
On 1 December 2017 easyJet also entered into a bespoke business interruption insurance product that pays out up to 150 million in the event of specific liquidity stress scenarios with standard insurance exclusions.
easyJet has a target minimum liquidity requirement to cover peak unearned revenue with a minimum of 2.6 million per 100 seats in the fleet.
In assessing this liquidity metric, both revolving credit facilities and the business interruption insurance are taken into consideration.
Total cash excluding restricted cash and money market deposits at 30 September 2018 was 1,373 million 2017: 1,328 million.
Surplus funds are invested in high quality short-term liquid instruments, mainly money market funds, bank deposits and tri-party repos.
The maturity profile of financial liabilities based on undiscounted cash flows and contractual maturities is as follows: Within 1 year 1-2 years 2-5 years Over 5 years At 30 September 2018 million million million million Borrowings 26 32 558 450 Trade and other payables 894 Foreign exchange and jet derivative contracts receipts 3,184 1,282 68 Foreign exchange and jet derivative contracts payments 3,161 1,228 65 Cross-currency swap contracts receipts 13 13 484 450 Cross-currency swap contracts payments 22 22 439 450 Within 1 year 1-2 years 2-5 years Over 5 years At 30 September 2017 million million million million Borrowings 25 25 127 899 Trade and other payables 613 Foreign exchange and jet derivative contracts receipts 2,969 1,096 66 Foreign exchange and jet derivative contracts payments 2,973 1,105 62 Cross-currency swap contracts receipts 13 13 38 899 Cross-currency swap contracts payments 20 20 60 845 The maturity profile has been calculated based on spot rates for the US dollar, Euro, Swiss franc, South African rand and jet fuel at close of business on 30 September each year.
Credit risk management easyJet is exposed to credit risk arising from cash and money market deposits, derivative financial instruments and trade and other receivables.
Credit risk management aims to reduce the risk of default by setting limits on credit exposure to counterparties based on their respective credit ratings.
Credit ratings also determine the maximum period of investment when placing funds on deposit.
Credit risk is limited to the carrying amount in the statement of financial position at each year end.
Counterparties for cash investments, currency forward contracts, cross-currency interest rate swap contracts, foreign currency swap contracts and jet fuel forward contracts are required to have a long-term credit rating of Aor better at contract inception except where there is a specific regulatory, contractual requirement or a bank guarantee from an Aor above rated entity.
Exposures to these counterparties are regularly reviewed and if the long-term credit rating falls below Amanagement will take remedial action.
Disclosure relating to the credit quality of trade and other receivables is given in note 12.
Foreign currency risk management The majority of easyJets exposure to currency arises from fluctuations in the US dollar, Euro and Swiss franc exchange rates which can significantly impact easyJets financial results and cash flows.
The aim of the foreign currency risk management is to reduce the impact of these exchange rate fluctuations.
Significant currency exposures in the income statement are managed through the use of currency forward contracts, in line with the Board-approved policy.
The policy states that easyJet hedges between 65% and 85% of the next 12 months forecast surplus cash flows on a rolling basis, and between 45% and 65% of the following 12 months forecast surplus cash flows on a rolling basis.
Significant currency exposures relating to the acquisition cost or sale proceeds of aircraft is also managed through the use of currency forward contracts where up to 90% of contractually committed forecast requirement is hedged.
In addition, easyJet has substantial borrowings and other monetary liabilities denominated in US dollars and Euros, which are largely offset by holding US dollar and Euro cash and money market deposits.
Significant currency exposures relating to foreign currency denominated debt issuances are managed through the use of cross-currency interest rate swap contracts, where deemed appropriate.
These hedges are designated as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges where permitted.
Management may take action to hedge other currency exposures as deemed appropriate.

Fuel price risk management easyJet is exposed to fuel price risk.
The objective of the fuel price risk management policy is to provide protection against sudden and significant increases in jet fuel prices, thus mitigating volatility in the income statement in the short term.
In order to manage the risk exposure, forward contracts are used in line with Board-approved policy to hedge between 65% and 85% of estimated exposures up to 12 months in advance, and to hedge between 45% and 65% of estimated exposures from 13 up to 24 months in advance, which is hedged on a rolling basis.
Specific decisions may require consideration of a longer term approach.
Treasury strategies and actions will be driven by the need to meet treasury, financial and corporate objectives.
