BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2018 275 See Glossary Non-operating items Non-operating items are charges and credits included in the financial statements that BP discloses separately because it considers such disclosures to be meaningful and relevant to investors.
They are items that management considers not to be part of underlying business operations and are disclosed in order to enable investors to understand better and evaluate the groups reported financial performance.
An analysis of non-operating items is shown in the table below.
$million 2018 2017 2016 Upstream a b Impairment and gain loss on sale of businesses and fixed assets 90 563 2,391 Environmental and other provisions 35 1 8 c Restructuring, integration and rationalization costs 131 24 373 Fair value gain loss on embedded derivatives 17 33 32 bd Other 56 118 289 183 671 1,753 Downstream a e Impairment and gain loss on sale of businesses and fixed assets 54 579 405 Environmental and other provisions 83 19 73 c Restructuring, integration and rationalization costs 405 171 300 Fair value gain loss on embedded derivatives Other 174 56 716 389 24 Rosneft Impairment and gain loss on sale of businesses and fixed assets 95 62 Environmental and other provisions Restructuring, integration and rationalization costs Fair value gain loss on embedded derivatives Other 39 95 23 Other businesses and corporate a Impairment and gain loss on sale of businesses and fixed assets 260 22 f Environmental and other provisions 640 156 134 c Restructuring, integration and rationalization costs 190 72 90 Fair value gain loss on embedded derivatives g Gulf of Mexico oil spill response 714 2,687 6,640 Other 159 90 55 1,963 2,847 6,919 Total before interest and taxation 2,957 3,129 5,167 g Finance costs 479 493 494 Total before taxation 3,436 3,622 5,661 h Taxation credit charge on non-operating items 510 1,172 2,833 i Taxation - impact of US tax reform 121 859 Total after taxation 2,805 3,309 2,828 a See Financial statements Note 4 for further information.
b 2018 includes an impairment reversal for assets in the North Sea and Angola.
2017 includes an impairment charge relating to BPX Energy previously known as the US Lower 48 business, partially offset by gains associated with asset divestments.
In addition, 2017 includes an impairment charge arising following the announcement of the agreement to sell the Forties Pipeline System business to INEOS.
2016 includes a $319-million exploration write-back relating to Block KG D6 in India.
In addition, an impairment reversal of $234 million was also recorded in relation to this block.
c Restructuring charges are classified as non-operating items where they relate to an announced major group restructuring.
A major group restructuring is a restructuring programme affecting more than one of the groups operating segments that is expected to result in charges of more than $1 billion over a defined period.
Following the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010 and since the fall in oil prices in late 2014, major group restructuring programmes were initiated.
The group's restructuring programme, originally announced in 2014, has now been completed.
d 2018 and 2017 include exploration write-offs of $124 million and $145 million respectively in relation to the value ascribed to certain licences in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico as part of the accounting for the acquisition of upstream assets from Devon Energy in 2011.
2017 also includes BPs share of an impairment reversal recognized by the Angola LNG equity-accounted entity, partially offset by other items.
2016 includes the write-off of $334 million in relation to the value ascribed to the licence in Brazil as part of the accounting for the acquisition of upstream assets from Devon Energy in 2011. e 2017 primarily reflects the disposal of our shareholding in the SECCO joint venture.
f 2018 primarily reflects charges due to the annual update of environmental provisions, including asbestos-related provisions for past operations, together with updates of non-Gulf of Mexico oil spill related legal provisions.
g See Financial statements Note 2 for further details regarding costs relating to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
h 2017 includes the tax effect of the increase in the provision in the fourth quarter for business economic loss and other claims associated with the Deepwater Horizon Court Supervised Settlement Program DHCSSP at the new US tax rate.
i In 2017 the US tax reform reduced the US federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective from 1 January 2018.
The impact disclosed has been calculated as the change in deferred tax balances at 31 December 2017, excluding the increase in the provision in the fourth quarter for business economic loss and other claims associated with the DHCSSP, which arises following the reduction in the tax rate.
2018 reflects a further impact following a clarification of the tax reform.
The impact of the US tax reform has been treated as a non-operating item because it is not considered to be part of underlying business operations, has a material impact upon the reported result and is substantially impacted by Gulf of Mexico oil spill charges, which are also treated as non-operating items.
Separate disclosure is considered meaningful and relevant to investors.
