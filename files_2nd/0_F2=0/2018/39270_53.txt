Share-based payments Share-based compensation The Group operates one equity-settled share-based long-term incentive plan.
The economic cost of awarding shares and share options to employees is recognised as an expense in the income statement, equivalent to the fair value of the benefit awarded.
The fair value is determined by reference to option pricing models, principally Monte Carlo and adjusted Black-Scholes models.
The charge is recognised in the income statement over the vesting period of the award.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of shares that vest or options that are expected to become exercisable.
Any revision to the original estimates is reflected in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to equity immediately to the extent it relates to past service, and the remainder over the rest of the vesting period.
Performance Share Plan The Company introduced a share-based performance plan in 2006 for senior executives worldwide.
The main features of the scheme are as follows: For awards made in 2012 and 2013, the performance conditions are total shareholder return TSR performance and an individual performance modifier.
No shares will vest or options become exercisable if the share price does not reach median TSR performance at the end of the threeyear performance period relative to the constituents of a comparator group, made up of FTSE 350 companies excluding financial services, primary resource and property sector companies.
If TSR performance is above the upper quartile and all participants attain their maximum bonus target over the performance period, the full award will vest or become exercisable.
For awards made between 2014 and 2018, one-third of the award is based on earnings per share EPS growth targets as outlined in the relevant years Remuneration Report, and two-thirds of the award is based on TSR over the three-year performance period as explained above.
The value of dividends paid during the vesting period are paid on the number of shares that ultimately vest in the form of additional shares for awards that are nil-cost options, this is the value of dividends between grant and exercise.
The total net charge for the year relating to equity-settled share-based payment plans was 5.7m 2017: 4.4m.
