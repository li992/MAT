Prudential has agreed with the Financial Conduct Authority FCA to review annuities sold without advice after 1 July 2008 to its contract-based defined contribution pension customers.
The review is examining whether customers were given sufficient information about their potential eligibility to purchase an enhanced annuity, either from Prudential or another pension provider.
A gross provision of 400 million, before costs incurred, was established at 31 December 2017 to cover the costs of undertaking the review and any related redress and following a reassessment, no change has been made in 2018.
The majority of the provision will be utilised in 2019.
The ultimate amount that will be expended by the Group on the review will remain uncertain until the project is completed.
If the population subject to redress increased or decreased by 10 per cent, then the provision would be expected to increase or decrease by circa 7 per cent accordingly.
Additionally, in 2018, the Group agreed with its professional indemnity insurers that they will meet 166 million of the Groups claims costs, which will be paid as the Group incurs costs redress.
This has been recognised on the Groups balance sheet within Other debtors at 31 December 2018.
C12 Capital C12.1 Group objectives, policies and processes for managing capital i Capital measure The Group manages its Group Solvency II own funds as its measure of capital.
At 31 December 2018 estimated Group Solvency II own funds are 30.2 billion 31 December 2017: 26.4 billion.
ii External capital requirements Solvency II is the Groups consolidated capital regime.
Solvency II is a risk-based solvency framework required under the European Solvency II Directive as implemented by the Prudential Regulatory Authority in the UK.
The Solvency II surplus represents the aggregated capital held by the Group less Solvency Capital Requirements.
iii Meeting of capital management objectives The Group Solvency Capital Requirement has been met during 2018.
As well as holding sufficient capital to meet Solvency II requirements at Group level, the Group also closely manages the cash it holds within its central holding companies so that it can: Maintain flexibility, fund new opportunities and absorb shock events: Fund dividends: and Cover central costs and debt payments.
More details on holding company cash flows and balances are given in section II a of the Additional unaudited financial information.
While the Group at a consolidated level is subject to the Solvency II requirements, at a business unit level capital is defined by local capital regulations and local business needs.
Each of the Groups long-term business operations is capitalised to a sufficiently strong level for its individual circumstances.
The Group manages its assets, liabilities and capital locally, in accordance with local regulatory requirements and reflecting the different types of liabilities in each business unit.
As a result of the diversity of products offered by Prudential and the different regulatory regimes under which it operates, the Group employs differing methods of asset liability and capital management, depending on the business concerned.
Stochastic modelling of assets and liabilities is undertaken in the UK, US and Asia to assess the economic capital requirements.
A stochastic approach models the inter-relationship between asset and liability movements, taking into account asset correlation, management actions and policyholder behaviour under a large number of alternative economic scenarios.

The sensitivity of liabilities and other components of total capital vary depending upon the type of business concerned and this conditions the approach to asset liability management.
iv Post demerger In August 2018, the Group announced that the Hong Kong Insurance Authority would become its lead regulator upon successful completion of the demerger.
The European Solvency II regime will no longer be applicable to Prudential plc group and it is proactively engaging with the Hong Kong Insurance Authority on the supervisory framework that will apply to the Group after the demerger.
C12.2 Local capital regulations i Asia insurance operations The estimated available capital position for Asia life insurance operations excluding with-profits funds with reconciliation to shareholders equity is shown below: 31 Dec 31 Dec 2018 m 2017 m IFRS shareholders equity 5,868 5,525 Adjustments to local regulatory basis Remove deferred acquisition costs, goodwill and other intangibles 1,850 1,515 Other adjustments 631 306 Total adjustments 1,219 1,209 Total available capital resources of life assurance businesses on a local regulatory basis note excluding with-profits funds 4,649 4,316 Note The available capital resources on a local regulatory basis as at 31 December 2018 excludes the with-profits business of Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia of 11,524 million 31 December 2017: 10,253 million.
The capital requirements of significant operations are: China A risk-based capital, risk management and governance framework, known as the China Risk Oriented Solvency System C-ROSS, applies in China.
Under C-ROSS, insurers are required to maintain a core solvency ratio core capital over minimum capital and a comprehensive solvency ratio actual capital over minimum capital of not lower than 50 per cent and 100 per cent, respectively.
The actual capital is the difference between the admitted assets and admitted liabilities.
Hong Kong The capital requirement varies by underlying risk and duration of liabilities, but is generally determined as a percentage of mathematical reserves and capital at risk.
Mathematical reserves are based on a best estimate basis with prudent margins for adverse deviations, discounted at a valuation interest rate based on a blend between the risk-adjusted portfolio yield and the reinvestment rate.
Indonesia Solvency capital is determined using a risk-based capital approach.
Insurance companies in Indonesia are expected to maintain the level of net assets above 100 per cent of solvency capital.
Malaysia A risk-based capital framework applies in Malaysia.
The local regulator, Bank Negara Malaysia BNM, has set a Supervisory Target Capital Level of 130 per cent below which supervisory actions of increasing intensity will be taken.
Each insurer is also required to set its own Individual Target Capital Level to reflect its own risk profile and this is expected to be higher than the Supervisory Target Capital Level.
Market liberalisation measures were introduced by BNM in April 2009, which increases the limit from 49 per cent to 70 per cent on foreign equity ownership for insurance companies and Takaful operators in Malaysia.
A higher foreign equity limit beyond 70 per cent for insurance companies will be considered by BNM on a case by case basis for companies who support expansion of insurance provision to the most vulnerable in Malaysian society.
Singapore A risk-based capital framework applies in Singapore.
A registered insurer incorporated in Singapore is required at all times to maintain a minimum level of paid-up ordinary share capital and to ensure that its financial resources are not less than the greater of i the total risk requirement arising from the assets and liabilities of the insurer, calculated in accordance with the Singapore Insurance Act: or ii a minimum amount of S$5 million Singapore dollars.
The regulator also has the authority to direct that the insurer satisfy additional capital adequacy requirements in addition to those set forth under the Singapore Insurance Act if it considers such additional requirements appropriate.

The regulatory framework for Jackson is governed by the requirements of the US NAIC approved Risk-Based Capital standards.
Under these requirements life insurance companies report using a formula-based capital standard which includes components calculated by applying after-tax factors to various asset, premium and reserve items and a separate model-based component for market risk associated primarily with variable annuity products.
The after-tax factors were adjusted to reflect the impact of US Tax Reform during 2018.
Jackson had a permitted practice in effect as granted by the local regulator allowing Jackson to carry certain interest rate swaps at book value, as if statutory hedge accounting were in place, instead of at fair value as would have been otherwise required.
Jackson is required to demonstrate the effectiveness of its interest rate swap programme pursuant to the Michigan Insurance Code.
The total effect of this permitted practice, net of tax, was to decrease statutory surplus by 129 million 31 December 2017: 355 million.
Under the equivalence provisions of Solvency II, Jackson is incorporated into the Groups Solvency II position at a level equal to available capital in excess of 100 per cent of the US local minimum risk-based capital requirement level at which corrective action commences.
