STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES Alternative Performance Measures Alternative Performance Measures APMs are measures of financial performance, financial position or cash flows that are not defined or specified under IFRS.
APMs are used by the Directors internally to assess the performance of the Group and assist in providing relevant and useful information to users of the Annual Report and Accounts.
APMs are not uniformly defined by all companies, including those in the Groups industry.
APMs used by the Group may not be comparable with similarly titled measures and disclosures made by other companies.
APMs should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for measures of financial performance, financial position or cash flows reported in accordance with IFRS.
The Group uses APMs to improve the comparability of information between reporting periods and segments, either by adjusting for special items which impact upon IFRS measures or by aggregating or disaggregating IFRS measures, to aid understanding of the Groups performance.
The definition and relevance of the APMs used by the Group is set out below.
a EBITDA 1 EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, depletion, amortisation, MET and royalties and special items.
EBITDA is a key non-IFRS measure that the Directors use internally to assess the performance of the Groups segments and is viewed as relevant to capital intensive industries with long life assets.
The Directors believe that the exclusion of MET and royalties provides an informed measure of the operational profitability given the nature of the taxes, as further explained in the Taxation section on page 40.
Special items are excluded to enhance the comparability of EBITDA and certain other APMs from period to period.
This performance measure is one of the Groups KPIs, the relevance of which is shown on page 28.
A reconciliation to operating profit is provided in note 4 a i of the consolidated financial statements.
b Underlying Profit 1 Underlying Profit is defined as profit loss excluding special items and their resulting tax and non-controlling interest effects.

Underlying Profit is reconciled from net profit attributable to equity holders of the Company on page 40 as set out in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.
c EPS based on Underlying Profit 1 EPS based on Underlying Profit is profit loss excluding special items and their resulting tax and non-controlling interest effects, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period see note 13 of the consolidated financial statements.
