Overview Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information Notes to the Company Financial Statements 1.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of Preparation The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union, and the UK Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations issued and effective at the time of preparing these financial statements.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements reasonable knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results may differ from those estimates.
Going Concern After making enquiries, the Directors are of the opinion that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least 12 months from the date of approval of its financial statements.
The Company therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its financial statements.
Functional and Presentation Currency These financial statements are presented in Euro, which is the Companys functional currency.
All financial information presented in Euro has been rounded to the nearest 100,000 except where stated otherwise.
Changes in Accounting Policy and Disclosures A number of new standards, amendments to standards, and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, or are not yet effective and have not been applied in preparing the Companys financial statements.
These are discussed further in the consolidated financial statements.
Foreign Currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are converted to the functional currency at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are converted to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date.
Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are converted using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
All transactional foreign currency differences are included in the Income Statement.
The average and year-end exchange rates for the Companys principal currencies are disclosed in the consolidated financial statements.
Investments in Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are all entities including structured entities over which the Company has control.
The Company controls an entity when the Company is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
Investments in subsidiaries are recorded in the Companys balance sheet at cost.
The investments are subject to a periodic impairment review, with any resulting diminution of the carrying value recognised in the Income Statement.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
Financial Instruments The below policy is relevant to amounts reported in the comparative year under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
On 1 January 2018, IFRS 9 Financial Instruments replaced IAS 39.
Amounts reported in the current year have therefore been accounted for in accordance with an updated 2018 policy.
The key changes are outlined above in Note 1.1.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value.
Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition.
Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at FVTPL are expensed as incurred.
Financial Assets Financial assets are classified into financial assets at FVTPL and loans and receivables.
The classification is determined at the time of initial recognition and depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets.
Financial assets at FVTPL Financial assets are classified at FVTPL when they are so designated or held for trading, including derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period.
The Companys loans and receivables comprise loans due from related parties and cash and cash equivalents.
Impairment of financial assets The Company assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that any financial asset is impaired as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset which has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the asset that can be reliably estimated.
Evidence of impairment may include indications that any debtor is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in payments, the probability that any debtor will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation, and where observable data indicate that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults.
A financial asset is impaired and an impairment loss incurred if there is objective evidence that loss events since initial recognition of the asset have adversely affected the amount or timing of future cash flows from the asset.
Financial Liabilities Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at FVTPL or liabilities at amortised cost.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL Financial liabilities are classified at FVTPL when they are so designated or held for trading, including derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments.
Liabilities at amortised cost Liabilities at amortised cost are recognised initially on the date at which the Company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Liabilities at amortised cost, including loans due to related parties and trade and other payables, are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, which calculates the amortised cost of a financial liability and allocates interest expense over its term.
The effective interest rate discounts estimated cash payments including all fees, transaction costs and premiums through the expected life of the financial liability, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Trade and Other Payables Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers.
Accrued expenses are recognised when ownership of goods or services has been transferred but not invoiced.
Trade and other payables are recognised at amortised cost.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with original maturities of three months or less.
Share Capital Ordinary shares of the Company are classified as equity.
Costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares and share options are recognised in equity as a deduction, net of any tax effects from the proceeds.
Taxation The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the Income Statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income and equity.
Current tax Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable profit or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Deferred tax Deferred income tax is measured using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except for deferred income tax liabilities where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Company and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.

Exceptional Items Exceptional items are defined as those items that, by virtue of their nature, size and expected frequency, warrant separate additional disclosure in the financial statements in order to fully understand the underlying performance of the Company.
These may include the costs of closure of locations or significant headcount reduction, costs arising from the acquisition or disposal of businesses including related contractual management incentive charges, transaction costs of a significant and non-recurring nature, debt refinancing costs, impairment charges and the recognition of previously derecognised deferred tax assets.
Dividends Receivable Dividends from investments of the Company and dividends receivable by the Company are recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Payable Dividends payable to the Companys shareholders are recognised in the Statement of Changes in Equity in the period in which they are approved.
