Donating shares to Save the Children In 2013, GSK embarked on an ambitious global partnership with Save the Children to share our expertise and resources with the aim of helping to save the lives of one million children.
Shareholders with a small number of shares, the value of which makes it uneconomical to sell, may wish to consider donating them to Save the Children.
Donated shares will be aggregated and sold by Save the Children who will use the funds raised to help them reach the above goal.
To obtain a share donation form, please contact our registrar, Equiniti, which is managing the donation and sale of UK shares to Save the Children free of charge.
