John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2018 NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2018 1 GENERAL INFORMATION John Laing Group plc the Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The Companys ordinary shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The principal activity of the Company is that of a holding company.
The remuneration of the Directors of the Company is shown in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 70 to 87.
2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES a Basis of accounting These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, except for investments at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL which are stated at fair value.
For the reasons set out on page 108, the Companys financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis.
A summary of the principal accounting policies adopted by the Directors, which have been applied consistently throughout the current and preceding years, is set out below.
New and amended IFRS that are effective for the current year In 2018, the Company adopted two new IFRS together with a number of amendments to IFRS and Interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB that are effective for an annual period that begins on or after 1 January 2018 and have been endorsed for use within the EU.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRIC Interpretation 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Considerations Amendments to IAS 40 Transfers of Investment Property Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions Amendments to IFRS 4 Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts Amendments to IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures Clarification that measuring investees at fair value through profit or loss is an  choice Amendments arising from Annual Improvements to IFRS 2014 2016 Cycle Other than IFRS 9 the above amendments do not have an impact on the financial statements of the Company.
The Companys revenue is dividends from its underlying investments and interest income which are not within the scope of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
The key changes in IFRS9 compared to the previous standard around financial instruments IAS39 are disclosed in the Group financial statements on page 105.
The adoption of IFRS9 has not had a material impact on the Company financial statements.
The Companys main financial assets other than cash and cash equivalents are its investment in John Laing Holdco Limited which is held at fair value through profit and loss FVTPL and receivables from subsidiary undertakings.
The Companys business model for its receivables is to hold them to collect the contractual cash flows and the contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
These receivables therefore continue to be held at amortised cost.
The Company has assessed that expected credit risk on these receivables is immaterial.
The Company has no derivative financial instruments.
New and amended IFRS standards in issue but not yet effective At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the Group has not applied the following new and revised standards that have been issued but are not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU: IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts Amendments to IFRS 9 Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation Amendments to IAS 28 Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures Annual Improvements to IFRS 2015 2017 Cycle: Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 23 Borrowing Costs Amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits: Plan Amendment, Curtailment and Settlement IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 amendments : Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments 141 Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Overview John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2018 NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED for the year ended 31 December 2018 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED a Basis of accounting continued The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the Standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group in future periods.
The Company has not entered into lease agreements, therefore IFRS 16 Leases does not apply.
b Investments The Company meets the definition of an Investment Entity under IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and as such has adopted Investment Entities Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27.
See note 2a to the Group financial statements for details on how the Company has concluded that it meets the definition of an investment entity.
In accordance with IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements and the Investment Entities standard, the Company has accounted for its investments as follows: Investments at fair value through profit or loss The Company has accounted for its investment in John Laing Holdco Limited at FVTPL, consistent with the Group financial statements.
Investments at cost Under IAS 27, the Company has elected to account for its interest in directly-owned subsidiaries that provide investment related services or engage in permitted investment-related activities Service Companies at cost less provision for impairment.
In the Group financial statements, these interests are consolidated.
c Taxation Current tax The tax charge or credit represents the sum of tax currently payable or receivable.
Current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit because it excludes both items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Companys liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax Deferred tax liabilities are recognised in full for taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will arise to allow all or part of the assets to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Company intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
d Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Company Balance Sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the instrument expire or the asset is transferred and the transfer qualifies for derecognition in accordance with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
142 John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2018 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED d Financial instruments continued i Financial assets The Company classifies its financial assets in the following categories: investments at FVTPL, loans and receivables, cash and cash equivalents and investments at cost.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired.
The Company determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
All financial assets are initially measured at fair value.
They are subsequently measured at either amortised cost or fair value, depending on the classification of the financial assets.
Financial assets that meet the following conditions are measured subsequently at amortised cost: the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows: and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
Financial assets that meet the following conditions are measured subsequently at fair value through other comprehensive income FVTOCI : the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets: and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
By default, all other financial assets are measured subsequently at FVTPL.
The financial assets that the Company holds are classified as follows: a Investments at FVTPL The Companys accounting policy in respect of investments at FVTPL is set out in section 2 b above.
b Loans and receivables The Companys loans and receivables comprise cash and cash equivalents and amounts owed by subsidiary undertakings and are recorded at amortised cost.
Amounts owed by subsidiary undertakings are held at amortised cost as the Companys business model is to hold these receivables to collect contractual cash flows which comprise payments of principal and interest.
c Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the Company Balance Sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with original maturities of three months or less.
d Investments at cost The Companys investments at cost comprise its investments in Service Companies see note 2 b for further details which are held at cost less provision for impairments.
ii Financial liabilities and equity Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.
All financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value.
Subsequent measurement of financial liabilities depends on whether they are equity instruments or financial liabilities.
a Equity instruments share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or associated with the establishment of the Company that would otherwise have been avoided are written off against the balance of the share premium account.
b Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are classified as other financial liabilities, comprising loans and borrowings which are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
e Dividend payments Dividends on the Companys ordinary shares are recognised when they have been appropriately authorised and are no longer at the Companys discretion.
Accordingly, interim dividends are recognised when they are paid and final dividends are recognised when they are declared following approval by shareholders at the Companys AGM.
Dividends are recognised as an appropriation of shareholders funds.

The methodology for determining the fair value of investments and the critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty therein are consistent with those for the Group as set out in note 4 to the Group financial statements.

As set out in note 3a of the Group financial statements, the Company holds its investments in non-recourse project companies through intermediate holding company subsidiaries with its investment in its directly-held intermediate holding company subsidiary John Laing Holdco Limited recorded at FVTPL in the Group and Company financial statements.
The Company also has investments in directly-owned subsidiaries that provide investment-related services or engage in permitted investment-related activities with investees.
These subsidiaries, referred to as Service Companies, are consolidated in the Group financial statements rather than recorded at FVTPL.
In the Company accounts, these investments are held at cost less provision for impairment.
Inter-company transactions occur between subsidiaries in which investments are recorded at FVTPL and subsidiaries that are consolidated in the Group financial statements.
The differences in the amounts of i investments at FVTPL and ii fair value movements in the year between the Company financial statements as stated above and the Group financial statements occur because in the latter inter-company balances arising from the transactions referred to above are eliminated under the normal basis of consolidation, whereas in the Company financial statements these inter-company balances are not eliminated.
The differences do not relate to any items that might have an effect on the tax recognised in the Group accounts.
