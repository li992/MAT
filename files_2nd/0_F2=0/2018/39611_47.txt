Notes on the consolidated accounts 12 Financial instruments - valuation Where the Group manages a group of financial assets and financial Critical accounting policy: Fair value - financial instruments liabilities on the basis of its net exposure to either market risks or credit In accordance with Accounting policies 13 and 21, financial risk, it measures the fair value of a group of financial assets and instruments classified as mandatory fair value through profit or loss, financial liabilities on the basis of the price that it would receive to sell held-for-trading or designated as at fair value through profit or loss and a net long position i. e. an asset for a particular risk exposure or to financial assets classified as fair value through other comprehensive transfer a net short position i. e. a liability for a particular risk income are recognised in the financial statements at fair value.
All exposure in an orderly transaction at the measurement date under derivatives are measured at fair value.
Credit valuation adjustments are made when valuing derivative financial assets to incorporate counterparty Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to credit risk.
Adjustments are also made when valuing financial liabilities transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants measured at fair value to reflect the Groups own credit standing.
A fair value measurement takes into Where the market for a financial instrument is not active, fair value is account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants established using a valuation technique.
These valuation techniques would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or involve a degree of estimation, the extent of which depends on the liability at the measurement date.
It also uses the assumptions that instruments complexity and the availability of market-based data.
market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.
In Further details about the valuation methodologies and the sensitivity to determining fair value the Group maximises the use of relevant reasonably possible alternative assumptions of the fair value of observable inputs and minimises the use of unobservable inputs.
financial instruments valued using techniques where at least one significant input is unobservable are given below.
Modelled approaches may be used to measure instruments classed as Level 2 or 3.
Estimation expertise is required in the selection, implementation and calibration of appropriate models.
The resulting modelled valuations are considered for accuracy and reliability.
Portfolio level adjustments consistent with IFRS 13 are raised to incorporate counterparty credit risk, funding and margining risks.
Expert judgement is used in the initial measurement of modelled products by control teams.

For example, a single name corporate credit default swap could be in level 2 or level 3 depending on whether the reference counterpartys obligations are liquid or illiquid.

The range represents the highest and lowest values of the input parameters and therefore is not a measure of parameter uncertainty.
Movements in the underlying input may have a favourable or unfavourable impact on the valuation depending on the particular terms of the contract and the exposure.
For example, an increase in the credit spread of a bond would be favourable for the issuer but unfavourable for the note holder.
Whilst RBS indicates where it considers that there are significant relationships between the inputs, their inter-relationships will be affected by macro economic factors including interest rates, foreign exchange rates or equity index levels.
2 Credit spreads and discount margins: credit spreads and margins express the return required over a benchmark rate or index to compensate for the credit risk associated with a cash instrument.
A higher credit spread would indicate that the underlying instrument has more credit risk associated with it.
Consequently, investors require a higher yield to compensate for the higher risk.
3 Price and yield: There may be a range of prices used to value an instrument that may be a direct comparison of one instrument or portfolio with another or, movements in a more liquid instrument may be used to indicate the movement in the value of a less liquid instrument.
The comparison may also be indirect in that adjustments are made to the price to reflect differences between the pricing source and the instrument being valued.
4 Recovery rate: reflects market expectations about the return of principal for a debt instrument or other obligations after a credit event or on liquidation.
Recovery rates tend to move conversely to credit spreads.
5 Valuation: for private equity investments, values may be estimated by looking at past prices of similar stocks and from valuation statements where valuations are usually derived from earnings measures such as EBITDA or net asset value NAV.
Similarly for equity or bond fund investments, prices may be estimated from valuation or credit statements using NAV or similar measures.
6 Correlation: measures the degree by which two prices or other variables are observed to move together.
If they move in the same direction there is positive correlation: if they move in opposite directions there is negative correlation.
Correlations typically include relationships between: default probabilities of assets in a basket a group of separate assets, exchange rates, interest rates and other financial variables.
7 Volatility: a measure of the tendency of a price to change with time.
8 Interest rate delta: these ranges represent the low high marks on the relevant discounting curve.
9 Upfront points: where CDS contracts are standardised, the inherent spread of the trade may exceed the standard premium paid or received under the contract.
Upfront points will compensate for the difference between the standard premium and the actual premium at the start of the contract.
10 RBS does not have any material liabilities measured at fair value that are issued with an inseparable third party credit enhancement.

A key related matter is where a market moves from liquid to illiquid or vice versa.
Where this change is considered to be temporary, the The availability and quality of independent pricing information are classification is not changed.
For example, if there is little market considered during the classification process.

For example, date and during the intervening period the market has been where consensus prices are used for non-modelled products, a key considered to be liquid, the instrument will continue to be classified in assessment of the quality of a price is the depth of the number of the same level in the hierarchy.

Where suitable independent pricing information is not readily available, the quality assessment will result in the For some instruments with a wide number of available price sources, instrument being assessed as Level 3. there may be differing quality of available information and there may be a wide range of prices from different sources.
In these situations Modelled products the highest quality source is used to determine the classification of the For modelled products the market convention is to quote these trades asset.
For example, a tradable quote would be considered a better through the model inputs or parameters as opposed to a cash price source than a consensus price.
