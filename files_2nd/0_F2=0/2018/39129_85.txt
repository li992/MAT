By contrast, EEV is a way of reporting the value of the life insurance business.
The EEV basis results have been prepared in accordance with the EEV Principles dated April 2016, issued by the European Insurance CFO Forum.
The EEV Principles provide consistent definitions, a framework for setting actuarial assumptions, and an approach to the underlying methodology and disclosures.
Results prepared under the EEV Principles capture the discounted value of future profits expected to arise from the current book of long-term business.
The results are prepared by projecting cash flows, by product, using best estimate assumptions for all relevant factors.
Furthermore, in determining these expected profits, full allowance is made for the risks attached to their emergence and the associated cost of capital, taking into account recent experience in assessing likely future persistency, mortality, morbidity and expenses.
Further details are explained in notes 13 and 14.
