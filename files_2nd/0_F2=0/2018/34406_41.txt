ADDITIONAL INFORMATION NON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS Adjusting items The group includes adjusting items which are charges and credits included in the financial statements that are disclosed separately because it considers such disclosures allow shareholders to understand better the elements of financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to assess trends in financial performance more readily.
The adjusting items include those items of income and expense which, because of the size, nature or infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation.
Adjusting items include fair value movements on financial instruments where hedge accounting cannot be applied on future transactions and also where hedge ineffectiveness is recognised.
These items have been included within adjusting items because they are non-cash and do not form part of how management assess performance.
In the current period acquisition related amortisation has been included within adjusting items in order to simplify the groups financial reporting.
This has resulted in adjusted EBIT replacing adjusted EBITA as one of the groups KPIs.
This however in practice has no impact on the amounts reported due to the reclassication of acquisition related amortisation.
Adjusted profit before tax is dened as profit before tax before adjusting items, with the exception of acquisition related amortisation.
Pre-tax adjusting items before acquisition related amortisation is 29.4m 2017: 25.9m.
