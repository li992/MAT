Reckitt Benckiser Group plc RB 150 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 2 Operating Segments On 1 January 2018, the Groups operating segments changed from ENA, DvM and IFCN to Health and Hygiene Home.
This change, which aligns the operating segments with the new business unit structure, was prompted by the RB 2.0 reorganisation effective 1 January 2018 and associated updates to the way in which information is presented to, and reviewed by, the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM for the purposes of making strategic decisions and assessing Group-wide performance.
The CODM is the Group Executive Committee.
This Committee is responsible for the implementation of strategy approved by the Board, the management of risk delegated by the Board and the review of Group operational performance and ongoing business integration.
The Executive Committee assesses the performance of these operating segments based on Net Revenue from external customers and Adjusted Operating Profit.
Intercompany transactions between operating segments are eliminated.
Finance income and expense are not allocated to segments, as each is managed on a centralised basis.
The segment information provided to the Executive Committee for the operating segments for the year ended 31 December is asfollows: Hygiene Health Home Total Year ended 31 December 2018 m m m Net Revenue 7,762 4,835 12,597 Adjusted Operating Profit 2,207 1,151 3,358 Adjusting items 311 Operating Profit 3,047 Net finance expense 325 Profit before income tax 2,722 Hygiene Health Home Total 1 Year ended 31 December 2017 restated m m m 2 Net Revenue 6,562 4,887 11,449 Adjusted Operating Profit 1,949 1,173 3,122 Reallocation of central costs 385 Operating Profit 2,737 Net finance expense 238 Profit before income tax 2,499 1.

Reckitt Benckiser Group plc RB 152 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 3 Analysis of Net Operating Expenses continued Adjusting Items The Group uses certain adjusted earnings measures, including Adjusted Operating Profit and Adjusted Net Income, to provide additional clarity about the underlying performance of the business.
The Group makes reference to adjusting items in presenting the Groups principal adjusted earnings measures.
These comprise exceptional items, other adjusting items, and the reclassification of finance expenses on tax balances: Exceptional items are material, non-recurring items of expense or income, which are relevant to an understanding of the underlying performance and trends of the business.
Other adjusting items comprise the amortisation of certain fair value adjustments recorded in respect of finite-life intangible assets recognised in the purchase price allocation for the acquisition of MJN.
The Group adjusts for these charges because their pattern of recognition is largely uncorrelated with the underlying performance of the business.
Adjusting items include a reclassification of finance expenses on tax balances into income tax expense, to align with the Groups tax guidance.
As a result, these expenses are presented as part of income tax in the adjusted profit before income tax measure.
The table below provides a reconciliation of the Groups reported statutory earnings measures to its adjusted measures for the year ended 31 December 2018: Adjusting: Adjusting: Adjusting: Finance Exceptional Other expense Reported items items reclassification Adjusted Year ended 31 December 2018 m m m m m 2 3 Operating Profit 3,047 233 78 3,358 4 Net finance expense 325 29 296 Profit before income tax 2,722 233 78 29 3,062 2 3 4 Income tax expense 536 50 17 29 632 Net income for the year from continuing operations 2,186 183 61 2,430 Less: Attributable to non-controlling interests 20 20 Net income for the year attributable to owners of the parent continuing 2,166 183 61 2,410 1 Net loss for the year from discontinued operations 5 5 Total net income for the year attributable to owners of the parent 2,161 188 61 2,410 1.

This is comprised of UK corporation tax of 32million 2017: 25million and overseas tax suffered of 23million 2017: 28million.
UK current tax is calculated at 19% 2017: 19.25% of the estimated assessable profit for the year, net of relief for overseas taxes where available.
Taxation in other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the relevant jurisdictions.
Cash tax paid in the year was 567million 2017: 543million.
The variance between the current year tax charge of 545million and cash tax paid is attributable to movements on non-current tax liabilities shown in Note 21 and timing differences arising between accrual and payment of income tax liabilities.
The 2017 deferred tax impact of changes in tax rates of 1,564million primarily relates to the enactment of a reduction in the US federal corporation rate from 35% to 21%, applicable from 1 January 2018.
This resulted in a reduction in the value of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities.
Origination and reversal of temporary differences includes adjustments in respect of prior periods of 22million expense 2017: 23million income.

The effect of overseas tax rates represents the impact of profits arising outside the UK that are taxed at different rates to the UK rate.
Unrecognised tax losses and other unrecognised tax assets primarily relates to losses arising from an internal restructuring carried out during 2018.
Reckitt Benckiser Group plc RB 156 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 7 Income Tax Expense Benefit continued Withholding and local taxes includes a provision for deferred tax on unremitted earnings.
This charge is expected to arise on planned repatriations of retained earnings from overseas subsidiaries in future periods.
Reassessment of prior year estimates arose as a result of revised tax filings and differences between final tax return submissions and liabilities accrued in these Financial Statements.
We conduct business operations in a number of countries, and are therefore subject to tax and intercompany pricing laws in multiple jurisdictions.
We have in the past faced, and may in the future face, audits and challenges brought by tax authorities, and we are involved in ongoing tax investigations in a number of countries.
If material challenges were to be successful, our effective tax rate may increase, we may be required to modify structures at significant costs to us, we may also be subject to interest and penalty charges and we may incur costs in defending litigation or reaching a settlement.
Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
On 19 December 2018, the European Commission EC issued a press release in connection with its investigation into certain aspects of the Gibraltar tax system and on 25 January 2019 published its resultant decision which concluded that Gibraltar had granted State Aid to a number of companies and that this State Aid now needed to be recovered by the Gibraltar authorities.
This judgement impacted a former MJN subsidiary which no longer exists and the Group is currently assessing the implications of the Commissions investigation.
The ECs investigation into whether the United Kingdoms controlled foreign company Group finance exemption constitutes State Aid remains ongoing and the Group continues to monitor developments.

Diluted Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares outstanding to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
The Company has the following categories of potentially dilutive ordinary shares: Executive Share Awards including Executive Share Options and Executive Restricted Share Scheme Awards and Employee Sharesave Scheme Options.

The majority of brands, all of goodwill and certain other intangibles are considered to have indefinite lives for the reasons noted in the Accounting Policies and therefore are subject to an annual impairment review.
The MJN global brand, acquired MJN WIC contracts and a number of small non-core brands are deemed to have a finite life and are amortised accordingly.
Amortisation is recognised in net operating expenses.

The goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment at the level at which identifiable cash inflows are largely independent.
Generally this is at a GCGU level, but for certain intangible assets this is at a CGU level.
After considering all the evidence available, including how brand and production assets generate cash inflows and how management monitors the business, the Directors have concluded that for the purpose of impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets, the Groups GCGUs are as follows: Health, Hygiene Home and IFCN.
Hygiene and Home are no longer considered separate GCGUs on the basis of changes made as part of RB 2.0.

As part of RB 2.0, certain key brands have moved from the former Hygiene GCGU into Health.
The 2017 comparative balances have been restated to reflect these movements.
As Hygiene Home is now considered to represent one GCGU, the 2017 comparative balances restated have been disclosed on an aggregated basis.
Within the Health GCGU, the cash flows of certain brands are separately identifiable.
As a result, the carrying values of the associated indefinite life assets and goodwill have been tested for impairment as CGUs.
This is in addition to the impairment testing over the Health GCGU.
The CGUs tested separately in 2018 are shown below.
BMS and VMS were not tested in 2018 as changes to their factory brand mix meant that the associated cash flows were no longer separately identifiable.

Both valuation models are calculated from cash flow projections, based on historical operating results, short-term budgets and medium-term financial plans, which have each been approved by management and cover either a three or five-year period.
These projections exclude any estimated future cash inflows or outflows expected to arise from restructuring not yet implemented.
Given their nature, the cash flow projections are influenced by: Net Revenue growth based upon forecast future sales volumes and prices, which take account of the expected impact from committed new product initiatives, geographical expansion and the maturity of the markets in which each GCGU or CGU operates: Gross Margin based on historical experience adjusted for the impact of forecast production costs, cost optimisation initiatives and changes in product mix: Marketing and other expenditure, reflecting historical experience, expected levels of cost inflation, committed cost saving initiatives and future levels of marketing support required to sustain, grow and further innovate brands: and The discount rates used to calculate the present value of cash flows.
Cash flows beyond the initial three or five-year period are forecast using progressively decreasing growth rates followed by terminal growth rates.
These rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the products and markets in which the GCGU or CGU operates.
Management has determined an appropriate discount rate for each GCGU and CGU.
In 2018, this was performed via a bottomup analysis of the relevant Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC, combined with benchmarking of comparable companies.
Due to the wide geographic and product diversification of their respective markets, and the diverse risks associated with a number of GCGUs and CGUs, a pre-tax discount rate of 10% was determined for both the Health and Hygiene Home GCGUs as well as the Sexual Wellbeing CGU 2017: 10%.
The IFCN recoverable amount was calculated on a value in use basis using a pre-tax discount rate of 10%.
In 2017, the IFCN recoverable amount was calculated on a fair value less costs of disposal basis using a post-tax discount rate of 8%.
The Oriental Pharma CGU is concentrated in China while the Brazilian Sexual Wellbeing CGU is concentrated in Brazil.
Pre-tax discount rates of 13% were applied to both CGUs, reflecting the risks specific to each of these businesses.

Reckitt Benckiser Group plc RB Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 161 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 9 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets continued Following the Groups annual impairment review, no impairments have been identified.
For the Health and Hygiene Home GCGUs, along with the Sexual Wellbeing and Brazilian Sexual Wellbeing CGUs, any reasonably possible change in the key valuation assumptions would not imply possible impairment.
The results of the IFCN and Oriental Pharma impairment reviews are summarised below.
IFCN On 15 June 2017, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of MJN for cash consideration of 13,044million $16,642million.
The acquisition was treated as a business combination and hence both the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were brought onto the Group Balance Sheet at their fair value.
As part of the 2018 IFCN impairment assessment, future cash flows were estimated using a ten-year IFCN forecast covering the period 2019 to 2028, which was derived from a detailed five-year financial plan and progressively decreasing growth rates thereafter.
Over this period, the Net Revenue growth rates ranged between 3% and 6% per annum.
A terminal growth rate of 3% was applied from 2029 onwards.
The IFCN impairment assessment indicated that the recoverable amount exceeded the net book value by less than 10 percent.
This valuation incorporated the impact of the 2018 disruption at our European manufacturing plant.
Looking ahead, management remains committed to delivering the expected sustained growth in both IFCN revenue and margins.
This growth is expected to be achieved through an increase in volumes generated via the utilisation of IFCNs already strong presence in developing and often fragmented markets, ongoing product innovation and premiumisation, and the achievement of scale and synergies with the wider RB Group.
The table below shows the impairment charge that would be required if key assumptions were negatively impacted.
The table assumes no response by management e. g. to drive further cost savings and hence is theoretical in nature.
Impairment charge m Expected Net Revenue growth rates 2019 to 2028 adjusted downwards by 100 bps 1,300 Expected EBIT growth rates 2019 to 2028 adjusted downwards by 100 bps 1,000 Terminal growth rate adjusted downwards by 100 bps 1,000 Pre-tax discount rate adjusted upwards by 100 bps 1,500 The table below shows the percentage movement in key assumptions that individually would be required to reach the point at which the IFCN value in use approximates its carrying value.
Movement Expected Net Revenue growth rates 2019-2028 30 bps decrease Expected EBIT growth rates 2019-2028 30 bps decrease Terminal growth rate 30 bps decrease Pre-tax discount rate 20 bps increase Oriental Pharma The value in use of the Oriental Pharma CGU approximates its carrying value, and as such is highly sensitive to changes in key assumptions.
If all other assumptions were held constant, a 30 percent reduction in assumed Net Revenue growth rates between 2019 and 2023 would lead to an impairment of 23million.
In addition, a 100 bps increase in the discount rate would result in an impairment of 15million while a 100 bps reduction in the terminal growth rate would result in an impairment of 8million.
Applying these sensitivities together would result in an impairment of circa 37million.

The Group has in place a risk management programme that uses foreign currency financial instruments, including debt, and other instruments, to limit the impact of these risks on the financial performance of the Group.
The Groups financing and financial risk management activities are centralised into Group Treasury GT to achieve benefits of scale and control.
GT manages financial exposures of the Group centrally in a manner consistent with underlying business risks.
GT manages only those risks and flows generated by the underlying commercial operations and speculative transactions are not undertaken.
The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies, guidelines and authority levels for all areas of Treasury activity and individually approves significant activities.
GT operates under the close control of the CFO and is subject to periodic independent reviews and audits, both internal and external.
Market risk a Currency risk The Group operates internationally and enters into transactions in many currencies and as such is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
Reckitt Benckiser Group plc RB Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 169 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 14 Financial Instruments and Financial Risk Management continued The Groups policy is to align interest costs and operating profit of its major currencies in order to provide some protection against the translation exposure on foreign currency profits after tax.
The Group may undertake borrowings and other hedging methods in the currencies of the countries where most of its assets are located.
It is the Groups policy to monitor and only where appropriate hedge its foreign currency transaction exposure.
These transaction exposures arise mainly from foreign currency receipts and payments for goods and services and from the remittances of foreign currency dividends and loans.
Where the Group enters into hedges and applies hedge accounting, hedges are documented and tested for effectiveness on an ongoing basis with any ineffectiveness recorded in the Income Statement.
The local business units enter into forward foreign exchange contracts with GT to manage these exposures where practical and allowed by local regulations.
GT matches the Group exposures, and hedges the position where possible, using spot and forward foreign currency exchange contracts.
The Groups strategy is to minimise Income Statement volatility by monitoring foreign currency balances, external financing, and external hedging arrangements.
The Groups hedging profile is regularly reviewed to ensure it is appropriate and to mitigate these risks as far as possible.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts at 31 December 2018 was 4,486million payable 2017: 2,760million payable.
As at 31 December 2018, the Group had designated bonds totalling $500million 2017: $1,000million as the hedging instrument in a net investment hedge relationship.
The hedged risk is the foreign exchange currency risk on the value of the Groups net investments in US dollars.
Possible sources of ineffectiveness include any impairments to the Groups net investments in US dollars.
The hedges are documented and are assessed for effectiveness on an ongoing basis.
As at 31 December 2018, the Group had designated commercial paper totalling 1,000million 2017: 1,000million, for which the carrying value was equal to the fair value, as the hedging instrument in a net investment hedge relationship.
This is to hedge the risk of loss in value of the Groups Euro net investments due to exchange rate fluctuations.
The net gain or loss under these arrangements is recognised in other comprehensive income.
The net effect on other comprehensive income for the year ended 31 December 2018 was a 44million loss 2017: 44million gain.
If Sterling strengthens weakens by 5% against the US dollar and Euro, the maximum impact on Shareholders equity due to net investment hedging by US dollar bond and Euro commercial paper would be 20million and 47million respectively.
The Group held forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges.
These were primarily denominated in US dollar, Euro, Sterling, Chinese renminbi, Mexican peso, Canadian dollar and Australian dollar.
The notional value of the payable leg resulting from these financial instruments was as follows: 2018 2017 Cash Flow Hedge Profile m m Euro 403 221 US dollar 395 115 Sterling 241 383 Chinese renminbi 214 Mexican peso 88 41 Canadian dollar 82 105 Australian dollar 61 63 Saudi riyal 40 98 Other 351 286 1,875 1,312 These forward foreign exchange contracts are expected to mature over the period January 2019 to December 2020 2017: January 2018 to December 2020.
Reckitt Benckiser Group plc RB 170 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 14 Financial Instruments and Financial Risk Management continued Hedge accounting is applied to the cash flow hedges and the economic relationship and expected effectiveness is assessed at inception, with any ineffectiveness recognised in the Income Statement.
The ineffective portion recognised in the Income Statement arising from cash flow hedges is immaterial 2017: immaterial.
Gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve in other comprehensive income on forward exchange contracts in 2018 of 6million gain 2017: 12million gain are recognised in the Income Statement in the year or years during which the hedged forecast transaction affects the Income Statement, which is generally within 36 months from the Balance Sheet date.
At 31 December 2018, the Group had forward contracts used for cash flow hedging with total fair value of 7million asset 2017: 1million liability.
These contracts are denominated in a diverse range of currency pairings, where a fluctuation of 5% in any one of the contract pairings, with all others remaining constant, would have a maximum effect of 25million 2017: 13million on Shareholder equity, until the point at which the contracts mature and the forecast transaction occurs.
The four largest contract pairings in order of nominal value were US dollar Chinese renminbi, Euro Polish zloty, US dollar Euro and Sterling Euro.
The remaining major monetary financial instruments liquid assets, receivables, interest and non-interest bearing liabilities are directly denominated in the functional currency of the Group or are transferred to the functional currency of the local entity through the use of derivatives.
The gains and losses from fair value movements on derivatives held at fair value through the Income Statement, recognised in the Income Statement in 2018, was a 65million gain 2017: 61million loss.
b Price risk Due to the nature of its business the Group is exposed to commodity price risk related to the production or packaging of finished goods, such as oil-related, and a diverse range of other, raw materials.
This risk is, however, managed primarily through mediumterm contracts with certain key suppliers and is not therefore viewed as being a material risk.
c Interest rate risk The Group has both interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing assets and liabilities.
The Group monitors its interest income and expense rate exposure on a regular basis.
The Group manages its interest income rate exposure on its gross financial assets by using a combination of fixed-rate term deposits.
Under the Groups interest rate management strategy a percentage of fixed interest rate borrowings have been swapped to floating interest rate.
The Groups debt is obtained on a fixed or floating basis to align with fixed to floating debt requirements.
Interest rate swaps are held to hedge the interest rate risk associated with the $700million 2019 Senior Note and $750million 2020 Senior Note.
The interest rate swaps convert the fixed rate of 4.9% on the 2019 Senior Note and 3% on the 2020 Senior Note to floating and have been designated as a fair value hedge.
As at 31 December 2018, interest rate swaps held at fair value totalled 16million payable 2017: 12million payable.
The fair value adjustment applied to the bonds due to the hedge designation totalled 16million receivable 2017: 12million receivable.
The hedges are documented and assessed for ineffectiveness on an ongoing basis, with any ineffectiveness recognised in the Income Statement.
Possible sources of ineffectiveness include any changes to credit ratings of the Group or counterparties to the interest rate swaps, differences in day counts between the interest rate swaps and the coupons of the hedged senior notes, and modifications to the senior notes such as any repayments.
Various scenarios are simulated taking into consideration refinancing, renewal of existing positions, alternative financing and hedging.
Based on these scenarios, the Group calculates the impact on the Income Statement of a defined interest rate shift.
For each simulation, the same interest rate shift is used for all currencies, calculated on a full year and pre-tax basis.
Reckitt Benckiser Group plc RB Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 171 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 14 Financial Instruments and Financial Risk Management continued The scenarios are only run for liabilities that represent the major interest-bearing positions.
Based on the simulations performed, the impact on the Income Statement of a 50 basis-point shift in interest rates would be a maximum increase of 16million 2017: 18million or decrease of 16million 2017: 18million, respectively, for the liabilities covered.
The simulation is done on a periodic basis to verify that the maximum loss simulated is within the limit given by management.
2. Credit risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments, deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers.
The assessment of lifetime expected credit losses relating to trade and other receivables is detailed in Note 13.
Financial institution counterparties are subject to approval under the Groups counterparty risk policy and such approval is limited to financial institutions with a BBB rating or above.
The Group uses BBB and higher rated counterparties to manage risk and only uses sub-BBB rated counterparties by exception.
The amount of exposure to any individual counterparty is subject to a limit defined within the counterparty risk policy, which is reassessed annually by the Board of Directors.
Derivative financial instruments are only traded with counterparties approved in accordance with the approved policy.
Derivative risk is measured using a risk weighting method.
The Group has counterparty risk from asset positions held with financial institutions.
This is comprised of short-term investments, cash and cash equivalents and derivatives positions as stated on the face of the Balance Sheet.
For risk management purposes, the Group assesses the exposure to major financial institutions by looking at the deposits, cash and cash equivalents and 5% of derivative notional position.
The following table summarises the Groups assessment of its exposure: 2018 Credit Limit Exposure Counterparty rating m m Financial institution A AA- 200 201 Financial institution B AAA 300 168 Financial institution C A 150 133 Financial institution D A 121 112 Financial institution E A 125 107 Financial institution F A 100 99 Financial institution G A 125 95 Financial institution H A 125 89 Financial institution I A 115 85 Financial institution J A 125 84 2017 Credit Limit Exposure Counterparty rating m m Financial institution A AAA 300 266 Financial institution B AAA 250 193 Financial institution C AAA 300 189 Financial institution D AAA 200 182 Financial institution E A 150 179 Financial institution F AA- 200 163 Financial institution G AAA 300 115 Financial institution H A 125 97 Financial institution I A 125 93 Financial institution J AA- 100 90 Reckitt Benckiser Group plc RB 172 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 14 Financial Instruments and Financial Risk Management continued 3.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group cannot repay financial liabilities as and when they fall due.
The Groups liquidity risk is concentrated towards bond, term loan and senior note principal repayments due between 2019 and 2044.
The Group has various borrowing facilities available to it.
The Group has bilateral credit facilities with high-quality international banks and has a financial covenant, which is not expected to restrict the Groups future operations.
At the end of 2018, the Group had long-term debt of 9,670million 2017: 11,515million, of which 9,091million 2017: 10,979million is repayable in more than two years.
In addition, the Group has undrawn committed borrowing facilities totalling 4,500million 2017: 4,500million, which expire after more than two years.
The committed borrowing facilities both drawn and undrawn, together with central cash and investments, are considered sufficient to meet the Groups projected cash requirements.
The undrawn committed facilities available, in respect of which all conditions precedent have been met at the Balance Sheet date, were as follows: 2018 2017 m m Undrawn committed borrowing facilities: Expiring within one year Expiring between one and two years Expiring after more than two years 4,500 4,500 4,500 4,500 All borrowing facilities are at floating rates of interest.
The facilities have been arranged to cover general corporate purposes, including support for commercial paper issuance.
All facilities incur commitment fees at market rates.
The Groups borrowing limit at 31 December 2018, calculated in accordance with the Articles of Association, was 44,228million 2017: 40,599million.
The table below shows the Groups financial liabilities and the derivatives that will be settled on a net basis.

GT monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities.
Funds over and above those required for short-term working capital purposes by the local businesses are generally remitted to GT.
The Group uses the remittances to settle obligations, repay borrowings, or, in the event of a surplus, invest in short-term instruments issued by institutions with a BBB rating or better.
Capital management The Group considers capital to be net debt plus total equity.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents, short-term other investments and financing derivative financial instruments Note 16.
Total equity includes share capital, reserves and retained earnings as shown in the Group Balance Sheet.

In 2018, the Group provided returns to Shareholders in the form of dividends.
Refer to Note 27 for further details.
The Group monitors net debt and at the year end the Group had net debt of 10,406million 2017: 10,746million.
The Group seeks to pay down net debt using cash generated by the business to maintain an appropriate level of financial flexibility.
Certain suppliers to the Group are able to access a supply chain financing arrangement that enables them to fund their working capital.
As part of this facility, the Group has confirmed to certain financial institutions that it will make payments of 322million 2017: 277million to these suppliers as they fall due.
These amounts are recorded within trade payables on the Balance Sheet and all cash flows associated with the programme are included within operating cash flows as they continue to be part of the normal operating cycle of the Group.

The HS issue was a tragic event.
The Group continues to make both public and personal apologies to victims.
During the year, a number of payments were made to claimants in respect of Rounds 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the HS issue, partially utilising the provision held for this matter.
The restructuring provision relates principally to business integration costs associated with the acquisition of MJN and subsequent RB 2.0 reorganisation, the majority of which is expected to be utilised within one year.
Other provisions include environmental and other obligations throughout the Group, the majority of which are expected to be utilised within five years.

19 Contingent Liabilities and Assets The Group remains involved in ongoing investigations by the DoJ and the US Federal Trade Commission and related litigation proceedings in the US arising from certain matters relating to the RB Pharmaceuticals RBP business prior to its demerger in December 2014 to form Indivior PLC, and may incur liabilities in relation to such matters.
These investigations and related proceedings are continuing and the Group has been in discussions with the DoJ.
At 31 December 2018, the Company was recognising a provision denominated in US dollars of $400million 2017: $400million or 313million 2017: 296million.
TheGroup remains committed to ensuring these issues are concluded or resolved satisfactorily but we cannot predict with any certainty whether we will be able to reach any agreement with the DoJ or other parties who are involved in any other investigation or related proceedings.
The final cost for the Group may be substantially higher than this provision.
From time to time, the Group is involved in discussions in relation to ongoing tax matters in a number of jurisdictions around the world.
Where appropriate, the Directors make provisions based on their assessment of each case.
HS South Korea The HS issue in South Korea was a tragic event.
There are a number of further expected costs and income relating to the issue that either cannot be reliably estimated or are not considered probable at the current time.
Round 4 lung injury: The South Korean government opened Round 4 to new applicants on 25 April 2016 for an indefinite period.
It has received 4,990 applications to participate in Round 4 as at 11 January 2019 and continues to receive applications.
Oxy RB has commenced payments under a compensation plan during 2018 and made provision for the Round 4 Oxy RB Category I & II users categorised to date.
The number of additional victims in Round 4 cannot be reliably estimated at the current time as it is open for an indefinite period.
Asthma-related injury and other potential lung or non-lung injuries: A damage relief committee set up by the Ministry of Environment MOE announced a recognition standard for asthma caused by HS, based on the increased incidence of asthma in HS users.
From 23 July 2018, HS users can apply for asthma-only categorisation as part of Round 4.
No provision has been made because: a no detailed underlying data has yet been made available in respect of general causation of asthma injuries by HS, although 316 victims have been announced by the MOE as at 26 December 2018: and b it is not possible to estimate the total number of applicants across all rounds including future asthma-only claims in Round 4 and therefore the total number of potential victims with potential asthma injuries, or for any other injuries that the MOE may decide to recognise.

The Group continues to assess and, where appropriate, pursue rights which Oxy RB may have to recover sums from other involved parties.
On 9 August 2017, the Humidifier Sanitiser Injury Special Relief Act became effective and further amendments have since been introduced.
Given the high profile and complex nature of this issue, the amendments to this Act, the rules and regulations issued pursuant to this Act and other legal or governmental proposals or developments in South Korea may give rise to further financial liability for RB.

Within other non-current liabilities of 448million 2017: 408million is a financial liability of 148million 2017: 105million.
This liability is in respect of the present value of the expected redemption amount of a written put option granted to the non-controlling interest as described in Note 26.
The amortised cost of the liability is subject to estimation of the future performance of certain Group products.
Future changes in estimation would result in the remeasurement of the liability through the Income Statement.
In addition, other non-current liabilities includes US employee related payables of 32million 2017: 34million, and interest accrued on tax balances of 191million 2017: 189million.

Certain tax positions taken by the Group are based on industry practice, tax advice and drawing similarities from our facts and circumstances to those in case law.
In particular, international transfer pricing is an area of taxation that depends heavily on the underlying facts and circumstances and generally involves a significant degree of judgement.
Tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to do so.
Reckitt Benckiser Group plc RB Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 179 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 22 Pension and Post-Retirement Commitments Plan Details The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans around the world covering many of its employees, which are principally funded.
The Groups most significant defined benefit pension plan UK is a final salary plan, which closed to new entrants in 2005 and following consultation was closed to further accrual from 31 December 2017.
Trustees of the plan are appointed by the Group, active members and pensioner membership, and are responsible for the governance of the plan, including paying all administrative costs and compliance with regulations.
The plan is funded by the payment of contributions to the plans trust, which is a separate entity from the rest of the Group.
The Group also operates a number of other post-retirement plans in certain countries.
The two major plans are the US Retiree Health Care Plan and the Mead Johnson & Company, LLC Medical Plan together, the US Medical plans.
In the US Retiree Health Care Plan, salaried participants become eligible for retiree health-care benefits after they reach a combined age and years of service rendered figure of 70, although the age must be a minimum of 55.
This plan closed to new members in 2009.
In the Mead Johnson & Company, LLC Medical Plan, acquired as part of the acquisition of MJN on 15 June 2017, participants become eligible for retiree health-care benefits if they leave employment after the age of 65, leave after the age of 55 and have completed ten years of service, or have their employment involuntarily terminated after the age of 55.
A Benefits Committee is appointed by the Group for both of these plans, responsible for the governance of the plans, including paying all administrative costs and compliance with regulations.
Both of these plans are unfunded.
For the principal UK plan, a full independent actuarial valuation is carried out on a triennial basis.
The most recent valuation was carried out at 5 April 2016.
The Group has agreed that it will aim to eliminate the pension plan technical provisions deficit in the UK and Ireland by the end of 2020.
Funding levels are monitored on an annual basis and the current agreed annual deficit reduction contributions are 25million p. a.
It is expected that contributions to the UK defined benefit plan in 2019 will be 25million 2018: 30million.
During 2018, a UK High Court ruling the Lloyds Case clarified the benefits due to members of certain UK defined benefit pension schemes under the provisions of Guaranteed Minimum Pension GMP, which led to enhanced benefits in some circumstances.
As no allowance had previously been made, accordingly a past service cost has been charged in the current year of 4million 2017: N A reflecting the best estimate of the likely additional benefits that will be due to members.
The final amount will be subject to agreement of the relevant pension trustees.
For the US Retiree Health Care Plan, a full independent actuarial valuation is carried out on an annual basis.
The most recent valuation was carried out on 1 January 2018.
For the Mead Johnson & Company, LLC Medical Plan, the most recent valuation was carried out at 31 December 2018.
For both of these plans, funding levels are monitored on an annual basis with contributions made equal to the claims made each year.
It is expected that the combined contributions to these plans in 2019 will be 8million 2018: 10million.
For the purpose of IAS 19, the projected unit valuation method was used for the UK and US plans, as per the principal UK plan triennial valuation results at 5 April 2016 and the US Medical plan valuations to 31 December 2018.
The UK plans have a weighted average duration of the deferred benefit obligation of 17.6 years 2018: 18.5 years.

Allowance for future improvements is made by adopting the 2015 edition of the CMI series with a long-term improvement trend of 1.5% per annum from 2007 onwards.
For the US plan, the mortality assumptions were determined using the RP-2014 Total Employee and Healthy Annuitant Mortality Tables regressed to 2006 and projected with Mortality Improvement Scale MP-2018.

During 2018, the Group sought further legal advice to clarify the circumstances in which the Group would be unable to recover any surplus in the principal UK pension fund.
After consideration, the Group would be able to recover any surplus in the fund once all benefits had been paid and accordingly a pension surplus has been recognised in the Balance Sheet.

Sensitivity of Significant Actuarial Assumptions The sensitivity of the UK defined benefit obligation to changes in the principal assumptions is shown below: 2018 Change in assumption Change in defined benefit obligation Discount rate Increase 0.1% Decrease by 1.8% RPI increase Increase 0.1% Increase by 0.6% Life expectancy Members live 1 year longer Increase by 4.0% 2017 Change in assumption Change in defined benefit obligation Discount rate Increase 0.1% Decrease by 1.9% RPI increase Increase 0.1% Increase by 0.5% Life expectancy Members live 1 year longer Increase by 4.5% The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
Impact of Medical Cost Trend Rates A one percent change in the assumed health-care cost trend rates would have an immaterial impact on the service cost, interest cost and post-retirement benefit obligation.
Risk and Risk Management Through its defined benefit pension plans and post-employment medical plans, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed as follows: Asset Volatility: The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields.
If plan assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit.
Both the UK and US plans hold a significant proportion of equities, which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term while providing volatility and risk in the short-term.
As the plans mature, the Group intends to reduce the level of investment risk by investing more in assets that better match the liabilities.
All the UK plans have agreed with the Group a plan to fide-risk the investment strategy of the plans at a pace that is commensurate with a planned return to full funding over a reasonable timescale.
Reckitt Benckiser Group plc RB 184 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 22 Pension and Post-Retirement Commitments continued The fide-risking plan provides for a proportion of the investment portfolio to move from equity holdings to government and corporate bonds over time.
The corporate bonds are global securities with an emphasis on the UK and US.
However, the Group believes that due to the long-term nature of the plan liabilities and the strength of the supporting group, a level of continuing equity investment is an appropriate element of the Groups long-term strategy to manage the plans efficiently.
Changes in Bond Yields: A decrease in government and corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans bond holdings.
Inflation Risk: Some of the Groups pension obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect the plan against extreme inflation.
The majority of the plans assets are either unaffected by fixed interest bonds or loosely correlated with equities inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
In the US plans, the pensions in payment are not linked to inflation, so this is a less material risk.
Life Expectancy: The majority of the plans obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member.
Whilst the plans allow for an increase in life expectancy, increases above this assumption will result in an increase in the plans liabilities.
This is particularly significant in the UK plan, where inflationary increases result in higher sensitivity to changes in life expectancy.
Change in Regulations: The Group is aware that future changes to the regulatory framework may impact the funding basis of the various plans in the future.
The Groups pensions department monitors the changes in legislation and analyses the risks as and when they occur.
Investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.
A large portion of assets consists of quoted equities and quoted bonds, although the Group also invests in property and cash.
The Group believes that quoted equities offer the best returns over the long-term with an acceptable level of risk.
The trustees of all the UK funds have moved the overwhelming majority of their assets to low-cost investment funds in consultation with the Group whilst maintaining a prudent diversification.

Proceeds received from the reissuance of Treasury shares to exercise share options were 105million 2017: 94million.
24 Share-Based Payments The Group operates a number of incentive schemes, including a share option scheme, a restricted share scheme, and other share award schemes.
During 2017, as part of a transitional scheme for MJN employees, a cash-settled scheme replaced an MJN equity-settled scheme.
All other schemes within the Group are equity-settled.
The total charge for share-based payments for the year was 16million 2017: 78million.
Executive Share Awards Executive share awards, comprising both Executive Share Options and Restricted Share Awards, are awarded to the senior management team.
Executive Share Options are awarded at an exercise price determined on grant date and become payable on exercise following satisfaction of performance criteria.
Restricted Share Awards entitle the recipient to receive shares at no cost following satisfaction of the following performance criteria.
For awards granted before December 2012: Adjusted earnings per share growth over three years % 6% 6% 7% 8% 9% Proportion of awards vesting % Nil 40% 60% 80% 100% For awards granted in December 2013 and thereafter: Adjusted earnings per share growth over Between 6% and 10% 10% three years % 6% 6% Proportion of awards vesting % Nil 20% Straight-line vesting between 20% and 100% 100% The cost is spread over the three years of the performance period.
For Executive Committee and members of the Group Leadership Team, vesting conditions must be met over the three-year period and are not retested.
For the remaining members of the senior management team the targets can be retested after four or five years.
If any target has not been met, any remaining shares or options which have not vested will lapse.
Other Share Awards Other share awards represent SAYE schemes offered to all staff within the relevant geographic area and a number of Senior Executive Share Ownership Policy Plan SOPP awards.
Other share awards have contractual lives of between three and eight years and are generally not subject to any vesting criteria other than the employees continued employment.
Individual tranches of these other share awards are not material for detailed disclosure and therefore have been aggregated in the tables following.
Reckitt Benckiser Group plc RB 186 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 24 Share-Based Payments continued Modifications to Share Awards The Remuneration Committee approved modifications to all unexercised share schemes in December 2014 following the demerger of RB Pharmaceuticals to compensate for the loss of scheme value.
For SAYE schemes this was in the form of a one-off payment.
For executive share awards this included an adjustment to shares under the amount of each grant, and the lowering of exercise price, where applicable.
There is no change to the IFRS fair value charge as a result of these modifications.
Summary of Shares Outstanding All outstanding Executive and other share awards as at 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017 are included in the following tables, which analyse the charge for 2018 and 2017.
The Group has used the Black-Scholes model to calculate the fair value of one award on the date of the grant of the award.
Table 1: Fair value The most significant awards are share options and restricted shares, details of which have been provided below.
The 2019 Executive Share Awards are expected to be granted in May 2019 following approval of the new Remuneration Policy.
Grant date and exercise price for each of the awards are shown in Table 1.
For options outstanding at the year end, the weighted average remaining contractual life is 5.84 years 2017: 6.92 years.
Options outstanding at 31 December 2018 that could have been exercised at that date were 4,606,460 2017: 3,897,913 with a weighted average exercise price of 43.87 2017: 38.82.
The assumptions made within the valuation calculation with respect to the achievement of performance criteria are based on the Directors expectations in light of the Groups business model and relevant published targets.
Under the terms of the schemes, early exercise may only be granted in exceptional circumstances and therefore the effect of early exercise is not incorporated into the calculation.
The calculation also assumes that there will be no leavers in the following year.
No material modifications have been made to these calculations in 2018 or 2017 for the purposes of the valuation.
An estimate of future volatility is made with reference to historical volatility over a similar time period to the performance period or the contractual life as appropriate.
Historical volatility is calculated based on the annualised standard deviation of the Groups daily share price movement, being an approximation to the continuously compounded rate of return on the share.
National Insurance contributions are payable in respect of certain share-based payment transactions and are treated as cash-settled transactions.
The weighted average share price for the year was 63.32 2017: 71.70.
