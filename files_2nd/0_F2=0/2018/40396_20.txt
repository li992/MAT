temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised based on the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Company income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity or other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also recognised in equity, or other comprehensive income, respectively.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the assets to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current taxation assets against current taxation liabilities and it is the intention to settle these on a net basis.
Judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty The preparation of the Company financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions in applying the Companys accounting policies to determine the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, with revisions to accounting estimates applied prospectively.
The preparation of the Company financial statements for the financial year did not require the exercise of any critical accounting judgements or significant estimates.
The risk of material adjustment in the next financial year relating to impairment of investments, previously disclosed as a key source of estimation uncertainty, is no longer viewed as significant.
