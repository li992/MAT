STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CORPORATE INFORMATION Spirent Communications plc the Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales registration number 00470893.
The registered address of the Company is Northwood Park, Gatwick Road, Crawley, West Sussex, RH10 9XN, United Kingdom.
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101.
In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU EU Adopted IFRS, but makes amendments where necessary in order tocomply with the Companies Act 2006 and has set out below the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions that have been taken in respect of the following disclosures: A Cash Flow Statement and related notes: Comparative period reconciliations for share capital, tangible fixed assets and intangible assets: Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries: Disclosures in respect of capital management: The effects of new but not yet effective IFRS: and Disclosures in respect of the compensation of key management personnel.
As the consolidated financial statements include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken the exemptions under FRS 101 available in respect of the following disclosures: IFRS 2 Share-based payment in respect of Group-settled share-based payments.
Certain disclosures required by IAS 36 Impairment of Assets in respect of the impairment of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets.
The disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instruments Disclosures and IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement regarding financial instrument disclosures have not been provided apart from those which are relevant for the financial instruments which are held at fair value.
The following exemptions have been taken in these financial statements, as granted by IFRS 1 First-time adoption of IFRS: Business combinations business combinations that took place prior to 1 January 2014 have not been restated.
Use of previous GAAP carrying amounts as at date of transition as a deemed cost for investment in subsidiaries.
As the Company is included in the consolidated financial statements, made up to 31 December each year, it is not required to present aseparate profit and loss account as provided by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
Information on fees for non-audit services in respect of the parent Company accounts have not been disclosed as the Company prepares Group accounts which disclose information on fees for non-audit services on a consolidated basis.
ACCOUNTING CONVENTION The financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis apart from certain financial instruments that have been measured at fair value.
GOING CONCERN BASIS OF ACCOUNTING The directors have reviewed the detailed financial projections for a period of 12 months from the date of this report and the business plans for the 2020 and 2021 financial years.
They have also considered the principal risks and uncertainties that the Company faces and its current financial position and are satisfied that the Company has adequate financial resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, a period of not less than 12 months from the date of this report.
Accordingly, the going concern basis of accounting continues to be used in the preparation of the financial statements.
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS There have been no applicable new standards, amendments to standards or interpretations effective from 1 January 2018 that have been applied by the Company which have resulted in a significant impact on its results or financial position.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers were effective from 1 January 2018 and have had an immaterial impact on the Companys results and financial position.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2018 161 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED IFRS 15 REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS The Company adopted IFRS 15 on 1 January 2018 using the fully retrospective transition method, requiring restated comparatives.
The cumulative effect of the adoption of IFRS 15 has resulted in an increase to net assets of 0.1 million as at 1 January 2018.
This reflects the capitalisation of incremental costs incurred to obtain a contract, being sales commissions previously expensed as incurred, net of the associated deferred tax impact.
These assets are presented within debtors as assets recognised from costs to obtain a contract.
There is no impact to the profit and loss account.
The impact on the 2017 financial statements is immaterial, therefore, the adjustment will be reflected in the balance sheet and the profit and loss account in 2018.
The impact of IFRS 15 on the Group financial statements is presented in note 37 of Notes to the consolidated financial statements on page 156. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND GOODWILL Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a business, representing the excess of cost over the net fair value of the net assets acquired, iscapitalised as an intangible asset.
Goodwill is carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related cash-generating units monitored by management.
Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the profit and loss account.
The UK Companies Act requires goodwill to be reduced by provisions for depreciation on a systematic basis over a period chosen by the directors, its useful economic life.
However, under IFRS 3 Business Combinations goodwill is not amortised.
Consequently the Company does not amortise goodwill, but reviews it for impairment on an annual basis or whenever there are indicators of impairment.
The Company is therefore invoking a true and fair view override to overcome the prohibition on the non-amortisation of goodwill in the Companies Act.
Had the Company amortised goodwill a period of 20 years would have been chosen as the useful life for goodwill.
The profit for the year would have been 0.6 million lower had goodwill been amortised in the year.
TANGIBLE ASSETS Tangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment.
Depreciation is not provided on freehold land.
Depreciation is provided to write-off the cost of all other assets, less residual value, on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives at rates which take into account commercial conditions at their location.
Usual asset lives are as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Plant and machinery 3 to 8 years Fixtures, fittings and equipment Building installations 20 years or lease period if lower Fittings and equipment 3 to 8 years Motor vehicles 3 to 5 years Business systems software 4 years The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS Tangible assets with finite useful lives are tested for impairment at each reporting date where there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
Goodwill with an indefinite useful life is assessed at least annually.
When an impairment test is performed, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the higher of the net present value of the expected cash flows value in use of the relevant cashgenerating unit or asset and the fair value less cost of disposal.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money andthe risks specific to the asset.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the profit and loss account in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
Where an impairment loss has been recognised against an asset, it may be reversed in future periods where there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised, but only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation oramortisation, had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years.
Such a reversal is recognised in the profit and loss account.
This does not apply for goodwill, for which an impairment loss must not be reversed in any circumstances.
162 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2018 STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION 1.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED INVESTMENTS Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost and reviewed for impairment if there are indications that the carrying value may not berecoverable.
LEASES A lease is an agreement whereby the lessor conveys to the lessee in return for a payment or series of payments the right to use an asset for an agreed period of time.
Operating leases are leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset and are not finance leases.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
STOCKS Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value, after provisions for obsolescence.
Cost includes all costs in bringing each product to its present location and condition, being the full manufacturing cost on a first-in, first-out basis, including all attributable overheads based on a normal level of activity.
PROVISIONS Provisions are recorded when the Company has a present, legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, for which it is probable that it will be required to settle by an outflow of resources and for which a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of the provision shall be the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation.
CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only on the occurrence or non-occurrence of uncertainfuture events outside the Companys control, or present obligations that are not recognised because it is not probable thatasettlement will be required or the value of such a payment cannot be reliably measured.
The Company does not recognise contingent liabilities but discloses them.
FOREIGN CURRENCIES The financial statements are presented in pound sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentation currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the rates ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
All exchange gains and losses are taken to the profit and loss account.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Companys balance sheet when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade debtors Trade debtors are non-interest bearing and are stated at original invoiced amount less an appropriate allowance for expected credit losses.
At each reporting date, the Company measures the loss allowance at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses.
The Company applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade debtors.
To measure the expected credit losses, trade debtors have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due.
The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of trade debtors over a period of 12 months before 31 December 2017 and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period.
Trade debtors are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.
A default on a trade debtor occurs when the debtor fails to make contractual payments when they fall due.
Cash at bank and in hand Cash at bank and in hand in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits which usually have an original maturity of three months or less.
Trade creditors Trade creditors are non-interest bearing and are stated at the original invoiced amount.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2018 163 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Loans and borrowings Loans and borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, and in respect of financial assets, less any impairment losses.
Impairment losses are based on lifetime expected credit losses.
Equity instruments Equity instruments are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Spirent Communications plc Ordinary Shares heldby the Company are classified in equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost and included as a deduction from retained earnings.
Consideration received for the sale of such treasury shares is also recognised in equity.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Company uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage exposures arising on receipts and payments in foreign currencies relating to firm commitments.
Forward foreign currency exchange contracts are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the contract is entered into, and are subsequently re-measured to fair value at each reported balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The Company has not adopted the hedge accounting rules.
Consequently all gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are taken to the profit and loss account.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts.
PENSIONS The Company operates two funded defined benefit pension plans.
All other pension plans are defined contribution in nature where theamount charged to the profit and loss account is the employers contributions paid or payable during the year.
For defined benefit pension plans, full actuarial valuations are carried out every three-years using the projected unit credit method, and updates are performed at each balance sheet date.
Re-measurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of changes to the asset ceiling if relevant and the return on plan assets excluding interest, is reflected immediately in the balance sheet liability orasset with a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Re-measurement recognised in other comprehensive income will not be reclassified to profit or loss.
Past service cost is recognised in profit or loss inthe period of plan amendment.
Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit pension liability or asset, taking account of any changes in the net defined benefit pension liability during the period asa result of contribution and benefit payments.
Defined benefit pension costs are categorised as: service cost including current service cost, past service cost and gains and losses on curtailments or settlements : net interest expense or income: and re-measurement.
The Company presents the first two components of defined benefit pension costs in profit or loss.
REVENUE Revenue represents the transfer of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those products or services.
Revenue from product sales of hardware and perpetual software licenses is recognised at the point in time when the customer has obtained control of the products sold.
This is usually when the products have been delivered in accordance with the contractual terms.
In most instances it is not until acceptance has occurred that control of the asset is transferred to the customer.
Terms of acceptance are dependent upon the specific contractual arrangement agreed with the customer.
If it can be objectively determined that control has been transferred to the customer in accordance with the agreed contract specifications, customer acceptance is a formality that would not affect the determination of when the customer has obtained control of the products.
However, if it cannot be objectively determined that the products delivered are in accordance with the agreed-upon contract specifications, revenue would not be recognised until customer acceptance has been granted.
For the sale of services, revenue is recognised over time with reference to when or as the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring the service to the customer.
Revenue from support and maintenance service contracts and software subscription sales is recognised over the period of performance on a straight-line basis.
Revenue from professional services is generally recognised as work progresses in accordance with agreed upon contractual terms, either based on a measure of progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation or at periodic intervals.
Progress is measured with reference to the actual cost of services provided as a proportion of the total cost of services expected to be provided under the contract.
Where the professional service has a predetermined or fixed output deliverable, revenue is recognised at a point in time once the performance obligation has been satisfied and the customer has received the agreed deliverable.
164 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2018 STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION 1.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Revenue from multi-component and bundled orders that includes both products and services is accounted for as two or more separate performance obligations only where the commercial substance is that the individual components operate independently of each other, because they are capable of being distinct and are separately identifiable from other promises in the context of the contract with the customer.
COST OF SALES The Companys cost of sales related to the sale of its products includes materials, payments to third party contract manufacturers, royalties and salaries and other expenses related to its manufacturing and supply operations personnel.
Cost of sales related to the provision of services includes salaries and other expenses associated with technical support services and the cost of extended maintenance services.
COSTS TO OBTAIN A CONTRACT The incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer are capitalised as an asset if the Company expects to recover them.
The Company incurs costs such as sales commissions when it enters into a new contract.
Such costs are presented within debtors in the balance sheet as assets recognised from costs to obtain a contract where the related revenue is recognised over time, usually in relation to support and subscription agreements.
These assets are amortised on a systematic basis consistent with how the related revenue is recognised.
The Company applies the practical expedient in paragraph 94 of IFRS 15 and recognises incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortisation period of the asset that the Company would otherwise have recognised is one year or less.
Management is required to determine the recoverability of assets recognised from costs to obtain a contract.
At each reporting date, the Company determines whether or not the assets are impaired by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the remaining amount of consideration that the Company expects to receive less the costs that relate to providing services under the relevant contract.
No assets were impaired as at 31 December 2018.
DEFERRED INCOME Deferred income is only recognised on non-cancellable contracts that provide unconditional rights to payment from the customer for products and services that the Company has not yet completed providing or that it will provide in the near future.
Revenue from product sales of hardware and perpetual software licences is recognised at the point in time when the customer has obtained control of the products sold.
In the instances where the customer has been invoiced and revenue from hardware or perpetual software licences is unable to be recognised, revenue would not be recognised until control has passed, resulting in deferred income.
Support services and software subscription agreements are generally billed at commencement of the support or subscription contract, while revenue is recognised over the period of the support or subscription agreement, resulting in deferred income.
The Company occasionally receives advance payments from customers on account, before products or services are delivered and revenue is recognised, resulting in liabilities.
These liabilities are reported on the balance sheet within trade and other payables on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.
GOVERNMENT GRANTS A government grant is recognised in the balance sheet initially within creditors when there is reasonable assurance that it will be received and that the Company will comply with the conditions attached to it.
Grants that compensate the Company for expenses incurred are recognised as other operating income on a systematic basis in the same periods in which expenses are incurred.
Grants that compensate the Company for the acquisition of an asset are presented by deducting them from the acquisition cost of the related asset in accordance with IAS 20 Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance.
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT Research expenditure is recorded as a product development cost in the year in which it is incurred.
Intangible assets arising on the Companys various product development projects are recognised only if the recognition criteria of IAS 38 Intangible Assets are met.
Product development costs are expensed as incurred until the technological feasibility of the product under development has beenestablished.
Technological feasibility in Spirents circumstances occurs when a working model is completed.
For software development, technological feasibility is not established until the process of developing the software is complete.
After technological feasibility is established, additional costs are capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life.
At 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017, no amounts have met the recognition criteria.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2018 165 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED EMPLOYEE BENEFITS When an employee has rendered service to the Company during an accounting period, short-term benefits expected to be paid in exchange for that service are recognised in the same accounting period.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENT The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value is determined using the Hull-White trinomial model.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised as a cost to the Company or as an addition to the cost of investment in the subsidiary in which the relevant employees work, over the vesting period of the equity-settled transactions with a corresponding adjustment to reserves.
Any payments received from the Companys subsidiaries in respect of these share-based payments result in areduction in the cost of investment.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other vesting conditions are satisfied.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
The Company has an employee share trust for the granting of certain share incentives to employees.
Shares are held by the employee share trust, treated as treasury shares and presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from equity.
TAX Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the profit and loss account except to the extent that it relates to items in other comprehensive income or equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable for previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions: where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill taxable temporary differences only or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss: and in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
DIVIDENDS PAID The interim dividend is included in the financial statements in the period in which it is paid, and the final dividend in the period in which it is approved by the shareholders at an annual general meeting.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGEMENTS The preparation of financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect items reported.
Such estimates and assumptions are based on managements best knowledge of current facts, circumstances and future events.
Actual results may differ, possibly significantly, from those estimates.
The areas requiring high degree of judgement or where assumptions and estimates are significant to the parent Company financial statements are revenue recognition, defined benefit pension plans note 3 and recognition of deferred tax assets note 12.

PENSIONS DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS i Characteristics and risks associated with the Plans The Company sponsors two funded defined benefit pension plans in the United Kingdom: the Spirent Communications plc Staff Pension & Life Assurance Plan Staff Plan and the Spirent Communications plc Retirement Cash & Life Assurance Plan Cash Plan.
These plans are funded and have full UK HM Revenue & Customs HMRC tax-exempt approval.
Both schemes are administered by atrustee board which is comprised of representatives from the employer, member nominated trustees and an independent trustee.
The trustee board operates in accordance with the Trust Deed and Rules of each Plan and acts in the interests of all of its members.
The Staff Plan is the Companys most significant plan.
It provides its members with retirement benefits based on their final salary and length of service.
The Staff Plan is closed to new entrants.
The Cash Plan is primarily a defined contribution arrangement, although there are some legacy defined benefits Old Section that have been valued for the purpose of these accounts in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
Members who left service before 1992 are entitled to a cash lumpsum on retirement that is based on their salary and length of service.
Members of the OldSection are entitled to defined contribution benefits, but with an underpin based on salary and length of service.
The cash planis closed to new entrants.
There is also a UK unfunded plan, which consists of a contractual obligation for the Company to top up certain former employees benefits whose salaries exceeded the statutory earnings cap.
As with the vast majority of similar arrangements in the United Kingdom, the Company ultimately underwrites the risks relating to thedefined benefit plans.
These risks include investment risks and demographic risks, such as the chance of members living longer thanexpected.
The plans hold a significant proportion of their assets in equity.
Strong future equity returns would be expected to reduce the Companys future cash contributions and vice versa.
Expected contributions to the defined benefit plans in 2019 are 5.1 million.
This includes the contributions agreed with the funded plans trustees in accordance with UK legislation.
The triennial valuation as at 1 April 2015 was in deficit, whereas the IAS 19 accounting valuation is in surplus, therefore, the Company has agreed to pay 5.0million per annum into the Staff Plan from 1 July 2016, over a seven-year period, in order to clear the funding deficit as assessed.
If the contributions currently agreed are insufficient to pay the benefits due, the Company will need to make further contributions.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2018 167 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 3.
PENSIONS CONTINUED GMP EQUALISATION On 26 October 2018, the High Court ruled on the Lloyds Bank GMP Inequalities case.
In response to this, an allowance of 3.1 million has been included on the Companys balance sheet at 31 December 2018 to make provision for the estimated costs arising from the judgement.
This past service cost has been charged to the income statement in the year and relates to the Staff Plan.
There is no impact on the Cash Plan.
The Staff Plan was contracted-out between 17 May 1990 and 5 April 1997, and therefore has accrued GMP benefits for all members who were active during that period.
From the data available as at 31 March 2018, which was provided for the formal valuation of the Staff Plan as at that date, we have estimated the amount of the GMP liability in the Plan applicable for each member for this period of service.
In estimating the impact of equalising these benefits, we have considered the possible range of results that could arise from the various different possible methods given the circumstances of the Plan.
In particular, we note that: no decision has been made on the methodology to be adopted to equalise GMPs, but we would expect the cost to be broadly in line with method D2 or method C2, which is similar considered by the Lloyds Bank judgement: legal opinion is not yet available on how historical claims will be dealt with: at this stage we have included allowance for full backpayments on pensions in payment, but no allowance for payments in respect of past transfers and deaths: and financial assumptions, demographic assumptions, and benefits are consistent with those disclosed below.
Based on these considerations, we have included an allowance of 15 per cent of the estimated GMP liability affected by the equalisation process.
We have therefore adopted the process below to calculate the allowance: 1.
Calculate proportion of Plans obligations relating to Post-1988 GMP The proportion of the Plans liabilities on an accounting basis that relate to Post-1988 GMP is estimated as 14 per cent, based on the valuation data as at 31 March 2018.
Overall, this implies that approximately 14 per cent of the Plans total IAS 19 obligations relate to Post-1988 GMPs.
Estimate the proportion of GMPs relating to benefits that need to be equalised post-1990 GMPs The requirement to equalise relates only to benefits accrued after 17 May 1990.
We estimate the obligation for GMPs accrued after this date on a pro rata basis as seven-ninths of the Post-1988 GMP obligation.
W e have estimated the cost of removing GMP inequalities in the Plan is 15 per cent of post-1990 GMP obligation, giving a figure of 3.1 million.
This estimate of 15 per cent is informed by the actuarys experience of working with schemes that have already undertaken a process to remove GMP inequalities.
We have not considered the specific circumstances of the scheme in detail, on the grounds that this would be disproportionate.

The objective of this allocation is to hedge against the plans liabilities, provide protection against inflation risk and to provide a level of investment returns in all market scenarios.
These funds have a wide investment remit and as such the investments of the funds may or may not be listed on recognised exchanges and markets and will be without restriction as to geographical, industrial or sectoral exposure.
These funds may take both long and short positions and may utilise a broad range of derivatives.
The funds investments may include sub-investment grade securities, corporate debt securities, gilts, sale and repurchase agreements, loans, and emerging markets debt and currencies.
The plans are prohibited from investing in Spirents own financial instruments.

PENSIONS CONTINUED The fair values of the quoted equity and debt instruments are determined based on quoted market prices in active markets whereas the fair values of the other assets are not.
Unquoted investments are included at values provided by the fund managers and are generally valued using recent market data and external sources, with a hierarchy that follows the principles of IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.

PENSIONS CONTINUED f The key financial assumptions The assumptions used for both plans using a weighted average were as follows: 2018 2017 % % Inflation RPI 3.2 3.1 Inflation CPI 2.1 2.0 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 2.1 2.0 Rate of increase for pensions in payment pre 2001 service 3.7 3.6 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 2001 to 5 April 2005 service 3.1 3.0 Rate of increase for pensions post 5 April 2005 service 2.1 2.1 Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.1 2.0 Rate used to discount plan liabilities 2.8 2.5 The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements.
The assumptions are such that a member currently aged 65 will live on average for a further 22.5 years 2017 22.7 years if they are a male and for a further 24.5 years 2017 24.6 years if they are female.
For a member who retires in 2038 2017 in 2037 at age 65 the assumptions are that they will live on average for a further 23.9 years 2017 24.1 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 26.0 years 2017 26.1 years after retirement if they are female.
iii Amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows The approximate impact to the past service liabilities of changing these main assumptions is as follows: Reducing the discount rate by 0.1 per cent per annum would increase past service liabilities by 2.7 million 2017 3.1 million Increasing RPI inflation by 0.1 per cent would increase the plans liabilities by 1.0 million 2017 1.1 million Increasing the life expectancy of a member by one year by modifying the standard mortality tables using an appropriate scaling factor would increase past service liabilities by 9.0 million 2017 10.3 million There will also be an impact on the future service cost but given the small active population in these plans this is likely to be insignificant.
The sensitivity analysis may not be representative of the actual change as the changes in assumptions may not occur in isolation.
