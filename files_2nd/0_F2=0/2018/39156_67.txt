Retirement benefits The Group operates retirement benefit schemes for most of its UK and overseas subsidiaries.
The defined benefit scheme associated obligations have all been measured in accordance with IAS 19 revised.
Summary of Group retirement schemes UK retirement benefits The UK operates a defined contribution scheme for current employees.
The UKs defined benefit schemes were closed to future accrual on 31 May 2008.
The following four defined benefit schemes are the UKs main schemes: Main staff plan for all historically eligible UK-based staff, excluding PZ Cussons Plc Executive Directors Directors plan for PZ Cussons Plc Executive Directors Expatriate plan for all eligible expatriate staff based outside the UK Unfunded plan unfunded unapproved retirement scheme Current and past employees within these schemes are provided with defined benefits based on service and final salary.
The assets of the schemes are administered by trustees and are held in trust funds independent of the Group.
In relation to the unfunded plan, the Group made payments during the year to former Directors of 172,208 2017: 168,300.
Overseas retirement benefits Outside of the UK the Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution schemes.
Included within Overseas retirement benefits and similar obligations below are the unfunded retirement benefit obligations relating to certain of the Groups overseas subsidiaries and other employee-related provisions for long service and sick leave.
Basis of recognition of pension scheme surplus The trust deeds for the Directors and Main staff plan provides the Group with an unconditional right to a refund of surplus assets assuming the full settlement of plan liabilities in the event of a plan wind-up.
Furthermore, in the ordinary course of business the trustee has no rights to unilaterally wind up, or otherwise augment the benefits due to members of the scheme.
Based on these rights, any net surplus in these two UK schemes are recognised in full.
The trust deed for the Expatriate plan provides the trustees with an unconditional right to wind up the scheme and distribute the surplus to members.
The surplus on the expatriate scheme has been fide-recognised in the current financial year, due to a change in accounting policy under IAS 8, as documented on page 54.

UK schemes risk review The UKs main schemes expose the Group to actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk and longevity risk.
Investment risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to high quality corporate bond yields: if the return on plan assets is below this rate, it will create a plan deficit.
Interest risk A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability but this will be partially offset by an increase in the return on the plans debt investments.
Longevity risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after employment.
An increase in life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plans liability.
The movements in the schemes each year are as follows: Overseas UK retirement retirement benefits benefits and similar and similar obligations obligations Total m m m At 1 June 2016 8.5 3.9 12.4 Currency retranslation 1.3 1.3 Interest expense and administrative expenses 1.0 0.7 1.7 Contributions paid 6.2 6.2 Utilised in the year 0.3 0.3 Remeasurement gains 0.4 5.3 4.9 At 31 May 2017 10.1 3.7 13.8 Currency retranslation 1.0 1.0 Interest income expense and administrative expenses 0.2 0.4 0.2 Contributions paid 6.5 6.5 Utilised in the year 1.0 1.0 Gain on settlement 0.2 0.2 Remeasurement gains 0.1 26.5 26.6 At 31 May 2018 7.8 29.1 21.3 2017 comparatives have been restated due to the fide-recognition of the expatriate scheme surplus.

Retirement benefits continued Funding and contributions by the Group A recovery plan for the Main staff plan was agreed between the trustee and the employer on 29 June 2016.
Under the recovery plan, itwas agreed that the employer would pay shortfall correction contributions of 6.0 m per annum until 31 May 2019, the date that the plan's funding deficit was expected to be eliminated.
These arrangements were formalised in a schedule of contributions, which the scheme actuary certified on 29 June 2016.
Overseas retirement benefits and similar obligations measurement and assumptions used The most significant overseas scheme as at 31 May 2018 is the Indonesian post-retirement benefit scheme.
The obligations havebeen measured in accordance with IAS 19 revised and a discount rate of 7.5% 2017: 7.5% and salary inflation rate of 8.0% 2017: 8.0% have been used.
The scheme is unfunded and provision for future obligations included in the above table is 7.5m 2017: 9.2m.
UK retirement benefits and similar obligations measurement and assumptions used The last triennial actuarial valuations of the schemes administered in the UK were performed by independent professional actuaries at 1 June 2016 using the projected unit method of valuation.
For the purposes of IAS 19 revised the actuarial valuation as at 1 June 2016, which was carried out by a qualified independent actuary, has been updated on an approximate basis to 31 May 2018.
There have been no changes in the valuation methodology adopted for this years disclosures compared to the prior years disclosures.
The key financial assumptions used by the actuary were as follows: 2018 2017 Rate of increase in retirement benefits in payment 2.85% 3.05% Discount rate 2.80% 2.45% Inflation assumption 3.00% 3.10% The mortality assumptions used were as follows: 2018 2017 Years Years Weighted average life expectancy on post-retirement mortality table used to determine benefit obligations Member age 65 current life expectancy 24.4 23.6 Member age 40 life expectancy at age 65 26.5 25.8 Movements in the fair value of plan assets were as follows: Assets Assets 2018 2017 m m 1 June 408.4 344.6 Interest income 9.9 11.3 Return of plan assets excluding interest income 9.6 60.1 Employer contribution 6.5 6.2 Administrative expenses 0.4 0.7 Benefits paid 17.8 13.1 31 May 397.0 408.4 88 PZ Cussons Plc Governance and Financial Statements 2018 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 24.

The UK schemes investment strategy is set by the trustee after taking appropriate advice from its investment consultant.
The trustee's primary objective is to invest the plan's assets in the best interest of the members and beneficiaries.
Within this framework the trustee has agreed a number of objectives to help guide them in their strategic management of the assets and control of the various investment risks to which the plan is exposed.

Retirement benefits continued The net retirement benefit income before taxation recognised in the Income Statement in respect of the defined benefit schemes is summarised as follows: 2018 2017 m m Net interest on net defined benefit schemes Gain on settlements 0.2 Administration expenses paid by the scheme 0.4 0.7 Net retirement benefit income before taxation 0.2 0.7 2017 comparatives have been restated due to the fide-recognition of the expatriate scheme surplus.
The above amounts are recognised in the Groups Income Statement in arriving at operating profit.
The reconciliation of the opening and closing Balance Sheet position is as follows: 2018 2017 m m Retirement benefit deficit at beginning of year 3.7 3.9 Net pension interest income Administration expenses paid by the scheme 0.4 0.7 Contributions paid 6.5 6.2 Gain on settlements 0.2 Remeasurement gain due to changes in demographic assumptions 10.4 Remeasurement gain loss due to changes in financial assumptions 21.5 49.4 Loss return on scheme assets excluding interest income 5.4 44.1 Net surplus deficit at end of year 29.1 3.7 Analysed between: Retirement benefit surplus 33.3 4.1 Retirement benefit obligation 4.2 7.8 29.1 3.7 2017 comparatives have been restated due to the fide-recognition of the expatriate scheme surplus.
Remeasurement gains and losses are recognised directly in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The sensitivities on the key actuarial assumptions as at the end of the period were: Change in assumption Change in defined benefit obligation Discount rate Decrease of 0.25% Increase of 4.6% Rate of inflation Increase of 0.25% Increase of 4.3% Rate of mortality Increase in life expectancy of 1 year Increase of 3.5% The sensitivities shown above are approximate.
Each sensitivity considers each change in isolation and is calculated using the same methodology as used for the calculation of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the period.
The inflation sensitivity includes the impact of changes to the assumptions for the revaluation and pension increases.
In practice it is unlikely that the changes would occur in isolation.
During the year ending 31 May 2019 the Group expects to make cash contributions of 6.0m 2018: 6.0m to funded defined benefit plans.
The amount recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Income Statement in relation to defined contribution schemes is 3.9m 2017: 1.4m.
