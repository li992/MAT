The work surrounding a significant change report and a profit estimate requires the accountant to have detailed knowledge of the Group.
If a firm other than the audit firm were to undertake this work, they would require a significant amount of additional time becoming familiar with the Group.
PwC were therefore chosen to undertake this work as it was considered to be sensible and more efficient both in terms of time and costs.
As for all non-audit work, consideration was given as to whether PwCs independence could be affected by undertaking this work.
It was concluded by the Audit Committee that this would not be the case.

Factors that may affect future current and total tax charges The Group continued to operate as a UK REIT throughout the year, under which any profits and gains from the UK property investment business are exempt from corporation tax, provided certain conditions continue to be met.
The Group fulfilled these UK REIT conditions throughout the year.
In view of the announced short-term reduction of dividends it is expected that there will be an underpayment of the minimum PID, and so for the Group to incur UK corporation tax payable at 19 per cent.
Certain of the Groups Spanish joint ventures have elected into the SOCIMI regime, and these continued to operate as and fulfil the relevant conditions of the SOCIMI regime throughout the year.

Underlying earnings per share excludes property and derivative movements, exceptional items and related tax.
The key differences to EPRA earnings per share relate to the following adjustments: with the exception of termination costs on allocated interest rate swaps and costs related to acquisitions, which are both excluded from EPRA earnings and underlying earnings, exceptional finance costs as detailed in note 9 and exceptional administration expenses as detailed in note 5 are included in EPRA earnings but are excluded from the Groups measure of underlying earnings.
In accordance with the Groups definition for exceptional items as detailed in the glossary, the Group considers these costs to be exceptional based on their nature and incidence, which create volatility in earnings fair value movements on interest rate swaps not currently used for economic hedges of debt referred to as unallocated swaps are included in EPRA earnings but are excluded from the Groups measure of underlying earnings.

Investment and development property is measured at fair value in the Groups balance sheet and categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy see note 28 for definition as one or more significant inputs to the valuation are partly based on unobservable market data.
Transfers into and transfers out of the fair value hierarchy levels are recognised on the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.
There were no transfers in or out of Level 3 for investment and development property during the year.
The Group has only one class of investment and development property asset.
All the Groups significant investment and development property relates to prime shopping centres which are of a similar nature and share characteristics and risks.
Valuation process It is the Groups policy to engage independent external valuers to determine the market value of its investment and development property at both 30 June and 31 December.
The Group provides information to the valuers, including current lease and tenant data along with asset-specific business plans.
The valuers use this and other inputs including market transactions for similar properties to produce valuations see valuation methodology below.
These valuations and the assumptions they have made are then discussed and reviewed with the Groups asset management team and Directors.
124 intu properties plc Annual report 2018 124 intu properties plc Annual report 2018 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Financial statements 14 Investment and development property continued The Group engages independent valuation experts to undertake the Groups property valuations.
A summary of the valuers and the value of property assets they have been engaged to value is presented below: 2018 2017 m m Cushman & Wakefield 4,029.2 4,609.6 CBRE 2,160.6 2,420.8 Knight Frank 1,635.1 1,964.0 Jones Lang LaSalle 210.0 197.7 Assets not valued externally held at cost 23.2 16.3 8,058.1 9,208.4 In addition to the above, investment properties in the Groups joint ventures were valued by CBRE, Cushman & Wakefield, Knight Frank and Jones Lang LaSalle.
Assets not valued externally held at cost relate to certain development land.
These amounts have been reviewed internally and it has been concluded that the cost is the appropriate carrying value and so no valuation adjustment is needed.
As the developments advance these will be valued by independent external valuers.
In respect of the intu Costa del Sol development site near Mlaga, Spain, as the General Plan of Torremolinos was approved in December 2017, with the remaining consents expected in the coming months, the Group obtained an independent external valuation at 31 December 2017 as cost was no longer an appropriate approximation of fair value.
At 31 December 2018 the remaining consents are yet to be finalised: however, we continue to expect these to be received.
Therefore, consistent with the 31 December 2017 valuation, the 31 December 2018 valuation is based on the assumption that planning approval is in place at the valuation date.
Valuation fees are a fixed amount agreed between the Group and the valuers in advance of the valuation and are not linked to the valuation output.
Valuation methodology The fair value of the Groups investment and development property at 31 December 2018 was determined by independent external valuers at that date other than certain development land as detailed above.
The valuations are in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS Valuation Global Standards 2017 and were arrived at by reference to market transactions for similar properties and rent profiles.
Fair values for investment properties are calculated using the present value income approach.
The main assumptions underlying the valuations are in relation to rent profile and yields as discussed below.
The key driver of the property valuations is the terms of the leases in place at the valuation date.
These determine the majority of the cash flow profile of the property for a number of years and therefore form the base of the valuation.
The valuation assumes adjustments from these rental values in place at the valuation date to current market rent at the time of the next rent review where a typical lease allows only for upward adjustment and as leases expire and are replaced by new leases.
The current market level of rent is assessed based on evidence provided by the most recent relevant leasing transactions and negotiations.
This is based on evidence available at the date of valuation and does not assume future increases in market rent.
The nominal equivalent yield is applied as a discount rate to the rental cash flows which, after taking into account other input assumptions such as vacancies and costs, generates the market value of the property.
The nominal equivalent yield applied is assessed by reference to market transactions for similar properties and takes into account, amongst other things, any risks associated with the rent uplift assumptions.
In respect of development valuations, deductions are made for anticipated costs, including an allowance for developers profit and any other assumptions before arriving at a valuation.
Annual property income as disclosed in the following table reflects current annualised gross income.
The net initial yield is calculated as the current net income over the gross market value of the asset and is used as a sense check and to compare against market transactions for similar properties.
Full definitions of nominal equivalent yield, annual property income and net initial yield are provided in the glossary.
The valuation output, inputs and assumptions are reviewed to ensure that they are in line with those of market participants.
intu properties plc Annual report 2018 125 intu properties plc Annual report 2018 125 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 14 Investment and development property continued A significant change in the nominal equivalent yield of investment property in isolation would result in a significant change in the value of investment and development property.
A decrease in nominal equivalent yield of 50 basis points would result in an increase in the total market value of 818.9 million 31 December 2017: 1,055.5 million, while a 50 basis point increase would result in a decrease in the total market value of 669.1 million 31 December 2017: 806.5 million.
Additionally, development property is sensitive to income, cost and developers profit assumptions included in the valuations.
The valuation of investment and development property is a significant estimate as referenced in note 1.
Impairment is assessed by comparing the carrying value against the underlying assets and liabilities of the respective subsidiaries.
Details of related undertakings are provided in note 38.

The Group holds 50 per cent beneficial interests in the relevant freehold or leasehold of these properties.
Each joint arrangement is governed by a Trust Deed giving each party rights to income and obligations for expenses in respect of their beneficial interest in the property.
The management of the property is established under the Trust Deed as being undertaken by an entity jointly controlled by the beneficial owners of the property.
This entity does not have the right to a share of the income or expenditure from the property, other than the receipt of a management fee.
Therefore these interests are accounted for as joint operations.
The principal place of business of both joint operations is England.

Both companies are incorporated in India.
The equity method of accounting is applied to the Groups investments in Prozone and Empire in line with the requirements of IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures.
The results for the year to 30 September have been used as 31 December information is not available in time for these financial statements.
Those results are adjusted to be in line with the Groups accounting policies and include the most recent property valuations, determined at 30 September 2018, by independent professionally qualified external valuers in line with the valuation methodology described in note 14.
The market price per share of Prozone at 31 December 2018 was INR29 31 December 2017: INR72, valuing the Groups interest at 16.4 million 31 December 2017: 41.1 million compared to the carrying value of 45.1 million 31 December 2017: 45.1 million.
As the share price of Prozone is lower than its carrying value, a review of the carrying value has been undertaken.
The net assets of Prozone principally comprise investment property which is held at fair value within the investment in associates line.
As with other Group investment property, it is subject to independent valuation to fair value and that valuation reflects the future cash flows expected to be generated from those assets.
As such the net asset carrying value recorded in the financial statements is deemed to be a reasonable approximation of the value in use of the business and so no adjustment to that carrying value is considered necessary.

The Group substantially eliminates its interest rate exposure to floating rate debt through interest rate swaps as described in note 28.
The market value of investment property secured, either directly or indirectly, as collateral against borrowings at 31 December 2018 is 8,774.6 million including 1,096.8 million of investment property held within joint ventures 2017: 9,802.2 million including 1,001.0 million held within joint ventures.
In most circumstances the Group can realise up to 50 per cent without restriction providing the Group continues to manage the asset.
Realising an amount in excess of this would trigger a change of control and mandatory repayment of the facility.
The fair values of fixed rate borrowings and CMBS are assessed based on quoted market prices, and as such are categorised as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy see note 28 for definition.
The fair values of unlisted floating rate borrowings are equal to their carrying values.
During the year there were no breaches of these conditions see financial covenants in the other information section.

In the UK the standard shopping centre lease is for a term of 10 to 15 years.

Standard turnover based leases have a turnover percentage agreed with each lessee which is applied to a retail units annual sales and any excess between the resulting turnover rent and the minimum rent is receivable by the Group.
The future minimum lease amounts receivable by the Group under non-cancellable operating leases for continuing operations are as follows: 1 Restated 2018 2017 m m Not later than one year 374.6 391.3 Later than one year and not later than five years 987.2 1,079.2 Later than five years 973.5 1,026.3 2,335.3 2,496.8 1 The 2017 figures have been restated primarily to include the Groups interests in joint operations at their beneficial interests which were previously included at 100 per cent.

The majority of the Groups financial risk management is carried out by the Groups treasury department.
The policies for managing each of these risks and their impact on the results for the year are summarised below.
Market risk a Interest rate risk Interest rate risk comprises both cash flow and fair value risks.
Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.
Fair value interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of financial instruments will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates.
The Groups interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at floating rates that expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, whereas borrowings issued at fixed interest rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
Bank debt is typically issued at floating rates linked to LIBOR.
Bond debt and other capital market debt is generally issued at fixed rates.
It is Group policy, and often a requirement of the Groups lenders, to eliminate substantially all exposure to interest rate fluctuations by using floating to fixed interest rate swaps referred to as allocated swaps in order to establish certainty over cash flows.
Such allocated swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating to fixed rates.
The Group also holds interest rate swaps that are not actively used as a hedge against borrowings referred to as unallocated swaps.
As a consequence, the Group is exposed to market price risk in respect of the fair value of its fixed rate interest rate swaps, as discussed in the financial review on pages 50 to 51.
The table below shows the effects of allocated swaps on the borrowings profile of the Group: Fixed Floating Fixed Floating 2018 2018 2017 2017 m m m m 1 Borrowings 2,998.3 1,884.1 2,998.2 1,607.0 Derivative impact nominal value of allocated swaps 1,112.6 1,112.6 1,371.6 1,371.6 Net borrowings profile 4,110.9 771.5 4,369.8 235.4 Interest rate protection 84.2% 94.9% 1 Borrowings are stated at nominal value and exclude the Metrocentre compound financial instrument and finance leases.
At 31 December 2018 they include the 393.9 million 2017: 233.8 million drawn under the revolving credit facility RCF which incurs interest at a floating rate.
Excluding the revolving credit facility, interest rate protection is 92 per cent 2017: 100 per cent.
Group policy is to target interest rate protection within the range of 75 per cent to 100 per cent.
The weighted average rate for allocated swaps currently effective is 1.89 per cent 2017: 1.71 per cent.
The nominal value of unallocated swaps, which are excluded from the above table, is 566.7 million 2017: 566.7 million.
Their fair value of 184.4 million 2017: 235.4 million is included as a liability in the balance sheet.
The approximate impact on the total fair value of derivatives liability allocated and unallocated swaps of a 50 basis point increase in the level of interest rates would be a reduction to the liability of 78.8 million 2017: 87.6 million.
The approximate impact of a 50 basis point reduction in the level of interest rates would be an increase to the liability of 78.8 million 2017: 87.6 million.
In practice, a parallel shift in the yield curve is highly unlikely.
However, the above sensitivity analysis is a reasonable illustration of the possible effect from the changes in slope and shifts in the yield curve that may occur.
Where the fixed rate derivative financial instruments are matched by floating rate debt, the overall effect on Group cash flow of such a movement would be very small.
b Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a functional currency other than pounds sterling.
At 31 December 2018 the exposure is 15.0 per cent of net assets attributable to shareholders of the Group 31 December 2017: 10.6 per cent, the increase from 31 December 2017 being primarily due to the declines in UK property valuations during the year.
Once the Eurofund expected future interest in the intu Costa del Sol development concludes, we expect this to reduce to 13.9 per cent, after which the appropriate level of exposure will be assessed.

The approximate impact of a 10 per cent depreciation in foreign exchange rates would be a negative movement of 51.9 million 2017: 48.8 million to equity attributable to owners of the Group.
As part of the strategy to comply with the Groups policy, the Group is able to borrow part of its RCF in euros, up to 100 million.
The RCF borrowings denominated in euros have been designated as a hedging instrument net investment hedge against the Groups net investment in Spain with the hedged risk being the changes in the euro pounds sterling spot rate that will result in changes in the value of the Groups net investments in Spain.
At 31 December 2018, 100 million 2017: 100 million was drawn in euros.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is managed to ensure that the Group is able to meet future payment obligations when financial liabilities fall due.
Liquidity analysis is conducted to ensure that sufficient headroom is available to meet the Groups operational requirements and committed investments.
The Group treasury policy aims to meet this objective by maintaining adequate cash, marketable securities and committed facilities.
Undrawn borrowing facilities are detailed in note 24.
The Groups policy is to seek to optimise its exposure to liquidity risk by balancing its exposure to interest rate risk and to refinancing risk.
In effect the Group seeks to borrow for as long as possible at the lowest acceptable cost.
Group policy is to maintain a weighted average debt maturity of over five years.
At 31 December 2018, the maturity profile of Group debt showed an average maturity of six years 2017: seven years.
The Group regularly reviews the maturity profile of its borrowings and seeks to avoid bunching of maturities through the regular replacement of facilities and by arranging a selection of maturity dates.
Refinancing risk may be reduced by doing so prior to the contracted maturity date, effectively switching liquidity risk for market risk.
The Group does not use supplier financing arrangements to manage liquidity risk.
The tables below set out the maturity analysis of the Groups financial liabilities based on the undiscounted contractual obligations to make payments of interest and to repay principal.
Where interest payment obligations are based on a floating rate, the rates used are those implied by the par yield curve for the relevant currency.
Where payment obligations are in foreign currencies, the spot exchange rate at the balance sheet date is used.

Credit risk arises primarily from trade receivables but also from other financial assets with counterparties including loans to joint ventures, cash deposits and derivative financial instruments.
trade receivables Credit risk associated with trade receivables is actively managed: tenants are managed individually by asset managers, who continuously monitor and work with tenants, aiming wherever possible to identify and address risks prior to default.
Prospective tenants are assessed via a review process, including obtaining credit ratings and reviewing financial information, which is conducted internally.
As a result deposits or guarantees may be obtained.
The amount of deposits held as collateral at 31 December 2018 is 3.5 million 2017: 4.1 million.
When applying a loss allowance for expected credit losses, judgement is exercised as to the collectability of trade receivables and whether it is appropriate to impair these assets.
Factors such as days past due, credit status of the counterparty and historical evidence of collection are considered.
The ageing analysis of trade receivables is as follows: Group Group 2018 2017 m m Up to three months 32.1 23.1 Three to six months 3.7 3.3 Trade receivables 35.8 26.4 At 31 December 2018 trade receivables are shown net of a loss allowance totalling 4.0 million 2017: 4.5 million.
The Group does not use factoring to generate cash flow from trade receivables.
intu properties plc Annual report 2018 141 intu properties plc Annual report 2018 141 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 28 Financial risk management continued other financial assets including loans to joint ventures The Group applies the expected credit loss model in respect of other financial assets.
Financial assets are individually assessed as to whether the credit risk has increased significantly in the period and therefore whether there is a need to apply the lifetime expected credit loss model as opposed to the 12-month expected credit loss model.
At 31 December 2018 there is no loss allowance recognised for other financial assets as it has been concluded as an immaterial risk of credit loss other financial assets in the next 12 months.
cash deposits and derivative financial instruments The credit risk relating to cash deposits and derivative financial instruments is actively managed by the Groups treasury department.
Relationships are maintained with a number of tier one institutional counterparties, ensuring compliance with Group policy relating to limits on the credit ratings of counterparties between BBB and AAA.
Excessive credit risk concentration is avoided through adhering to authorised limits for all counterparties.

The capital of the Group consists of equity, debt and a compound financial instrument.
The Group aims to access both debt and equity capital markets with maximum efficiency and flexibility.
The key ratios used to monitor the capital structure of the Group are the debt to assets ratio and interest cover.
The Groups stated medium to long-term preference is for the debt to assets ratio to be within the 40 to 50 per cent range and interest cover to be greater than 1.60x.
The debt to assets ratio has increased to 53.1 per cent since 31 December 2017 due to the deficit on property revaluation in the year.
As detailed in the financial review, the Group will be looking to reduce this to below 50 per cent.
The interest cover ratio continues to be above the preferred level.
As the Groups debt is sometimes secured on its interests in joint ventures, these ratios are monitored for the Group including share of joint ventures.
A reconciliation from the relevant IFRS amounts as presented to those including the Groups share of joint ventures is included in the other information section.

In accordance with the requirements of IAS 12 Income Taxes, the deferred tax asset has not been recognised on the Groups balance sheet due to uncertainty over the level of profits that will be available in the non-REIT elements of the Group in future periods.

The Group individually assesses each acquisition to determine if it should be accounted for as a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
In respect of the below acquisition, the Group has concluded the assets and liabilities acquired constitute a business.
They include the shopping centre asset itself along with the employees and processes that operate the centre on a day-to-day basis.
These inputs and processes in turn drive the operation of the centre and the related output for its beneficial owner.
As a result, this acquisition is to be accounted for as a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3.
Acquisition during 2017 On 10 March 2017 the Group acquired 100 per cent interests in three entities, which together own and manage intu Xanad shopping centre, for total cash consideration of 517.3 million 453.9 million.
The cash flow statement outflow of 446.7 million reflects the 453.9 million less the unrestricted cash acquired of 7.2 million.
Acquisition related costs of 0.8 million were incurred and recognised in the income statement in exceptional administration expenses during 2018 and 2017.
The fair value of assets and liabilities acquired, at 100 per cent, are set out in the table below: Fair value m Assets Investment and development property 461.4 Cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash of 3.1 million 10.3 Trade and other receivables 0.1 Total assets 471.8 Liabilities Trade and other payables 21.3 Deferred tax 77.7 Total liabilities 99.0 Net assets 372.8 Fair value of consideration paid 453.9 Goodwill on acquisition of business 81.1 The fair value of the consideration is greater than the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired, resulting in goodwill of 81.1 million being recognised on acquisition.
The goodwill balance is primarily attributable to the recognition of a deferred tax balance which is required to be recorded in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes but has not been taken into account as part of the purchase price as it is not expected to be realised.
From the date of acquisition to the end of 2017, the acquired subsidiaries and subsequent joint venture interest see note 34 contributed 13.2 million of revenue and 3.1 million of profit to the Group.
Had the entities been acquired on 1 January 2017, the Group would have reported revenue of 622.9 million and profit of 206.0 million for 2017. intu properties plc Annual report 2018 147 intu properties plc Annual report 2018 147 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 34 Disposal of subsidiaries Disposal during 2018 On 31 January 2018 the Group sold 50 per cent of its interest in intu Chapelfield, a wholly owned subsidiary, to LaSalle Investment Management acting on behalf of Greater Manchester Pension Fund and West Yorkshire Pension Fund for final cash consideration of 145.1 million before expenses of 1.6 million.
Following this transaction intu Chapelfield ceased to be accounted for as a subsidiary and is now a joint venture.
Therefore the assets and liabilities of intu Chapelfield are no longer recorded at 100 per cent in the Groups balance sheet but the remaining 50 per cent interest is included in investment in joint ventures at an initial value of 151.9 million.
As a result of this transaction the Group has recorded a loss on disposal of 9.0 million in the income statement.
The cash flow statement records a net inflow of 143.2 million comprising the net consideration received of 143.5 million less cash in the business of 0.8 million reclassified to investment in joint venture, net of cash classified as held for sale at 31 December 2017 of 0.5 million.
Assessing control over joint arrangements is a significant judgement as referenced in note 1.
Based on the terms set out in the joint venture agreement, the Group has classified its retained 50 per cent interest as a joint venture as key decisions require the consent of both partners.
The assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries disposed of, at 100 per cent, are set out below: m Assets Investment and development property 302.0 Cash and cash equivalents 0.8 Trade and other receivables 6.6 Total assets 309.4 Liabilities Trade and other payables 5.0 Total liabilities 5.0 Net assets 304.4 Net assets at 50 per cent 152.2 Fair value of consideration received including fair value adjustments of 0.3 million 143.2 Loss on disposal of subsidiaries 9.0 148 intu properties plc Annual report 2018 148 intu properties plc Annual report 2018 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Financial statements 34 Disposal of subsidiaries continued Disposal during 2017 On 31 July 2017 the Group sold 50 per cent of its interest in Xanad Retail and Leisure S. L. U. a wholly owned subsidiary, to TH Real Estate for total consideration of 131.7 million 117.9 million before expenses of 1.0 million.
Xanad Retail and Leisure S. L. U. owns, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, intu Xanad.
Following this transaction intu Xanad ceased to be accounted for as a subsidiary and is now a joint venture.
Therefore the assets and liabilities of intu Xanad are no longer recorded at 100 per cent in the Groups balance sheet but the remaining 50 per cent interest is included in investment in joint ventures at an initial value of 117.1 million.
As a result of this transaction the Group has recorded a loss on disposal of 1.0 million in the income statement.
The cash flow statement inflow of 104.1 million represents the net consideration received of 116.9 million net of unrestricted cash in the business of 12.8 million.
Based on the terms set out in the partnership agreement, the Group has classified its retained 50 per cent interest as a joint venture as key decisions require the consent of both partners.
The assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries disposed of, at 100 per cent, are set out below: m Assets Investment and development property 472.3 Goodwill 81.1 Cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash of 3.2 million 16.0 Trade and other receivables 7.3 Total assets 576.7 Liabilities Trade and other payables 28.4 Deferred tax 79.6 Derivative financial instruments 1.6 Borrowings 231.4 Total liabilities 341.0 Net assets 235.7 Net assets at 50 per cent 117.9 Fair value of consideration received 116.9 Loss on disposal of subsidiaries 1.0 35 Assets classified as held for sale In November 2017 the Group announced the formation of a joint venture with LaSalle Investment Management acting on behalf of Greater Manchester Pension Fund and West Yorkshire Pension Fund for them to take ownership of 50 per cent of intu Chapelfield.
This transaction completed on 31 January 2018 see note 34 following the receipt of EU merger approval.
As a result, at 31 December 2017 in accordance with IFRS the Group classified 100 per cent of intu Chapelfield which is part of the UK operating segment and all its related assets and liabilities as held for sale.
Assessing non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale is a significant judgement as referenced in note 1.
The assets and liabilities below at 31 December 2017 are presented at their carrying amount.
There were no material differences between their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.

E Save As You Earn Scheme SAYE The Group operates a SAYE under which all eligible UK employees may save up to a maximum of 500 per month for a period of three or five years and use the proceeds at the end of their saving period to purchase shares in the Company.

Options may normally be exercised within six months following the end of the savings period.
