Financial risk management Financial risk factors The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including foreign exchange risk, cash flow and fair value interest rate risk and price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out in accordance with policies approved by the Board of directors.
Management identifies, evaluates and manages financial risks in close co-operation with the Groups business units.
The Board provides guidance on overall market risk management including use of derivative financial instruments and investment of excess liquidity.
In addition, treasury matters are dealt with by the Treasury Committee.
Market risk Foreign exchange risk The Group operates internationally.
The Group primarily buys and sells in sterling but does make purchases and sales denominated in US dollars and euros.
Due to the hedging arrangements that have been in place for the year ended 27 January 2018, if sterling had weakened strengthened by 10% against the US dollar or euro, with all other variables held constant, there would have been an immaterial effect on post-tax profit year ended 28 January 2017: immaterial impact on post-tax profit.
The Group periodically enters into forward option contracts to purchase foreign currencies for known purchases where the value and volume of trading purchases is known.
The Treasury Committee assesses whether hedge accounting should be applied for each forward option contract.
Price risk The Group is not exposed to equity securities price risk because no such investments are held by the Group other than within Pension Scheme assets.
The Group purchases a wide range of commodities in the ordinary course of business.
Exposure to changes in the market price of certain of these commodities, including sugar, plastic, aluminium and mango, is managed through the use of forward physical supply contracts, primarily to convert floating or indexed prices to fixed prices.
The use of such contracts to hedge commodity exposures is governed by the Groups risk management policies and is continually monitored by the Treasury Committee.
Commodity derivatives also provide a way to meet customers pricing requirements whilst achieving a price structure consistent with the Groups overall pricing strategy.
All of the Groups commodity derivatives are treated as own use contracts, which are outside the scope of IAS 39, since they are both entered into, and continue to be held, for the purposes of the Groups ordinary operations, and are not net settled the Group takes physical delivery of the commodity concerned.
Own use contracts do not require accounting entries until the commodity purchase actually crystalises.
The majority of the Groups forward physical contracts and commodity derivatives have original maturities of less than one year.
As all of the commodity contracts qualify for the own use treatment, no sensitivity analysis has been carried out.

Financial risk management continued Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk As the Group has no significant interest-bearing assets, the Groups income and operating cash inflows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
The Groups interest rate risk arises from long term borrowings.
Borrowings obtained at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, which is partially offset by cash held at variable rates.
For the year ended 27 January 2018, if interest rates on sterling-denominated borrowings at that date had been 0.5% higher lower with all other variables held constant, there would have been an immaterial change in the post-tax profit for the year year ended 28 January 2017: immaterial impact.
Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a Group basis.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to major and direct to store customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with a minimum rating of A are accepted.
If major customers are independently rated, these ratings are used.
Otherwise, if there is no independent rating, risk control processes assess the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors.
Individual risk limits are set by the Management Committee based on internal or external ratings.
The utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored.
Sales to direct to store customers are largely settled in cash in order to manage credit risk from smaller, independent stores.
Liquidity risk Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying business, the Group maintains flexibility in funding by maintaining sufficient cash reserves and the availability of borrowing facilities.
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups liquidity reserve which comprises undrawn borrowing facilities and cash and cash equivalents on the basis of expected cash flows.
This is carried out at a Group level and involves projecting forward cash flows and considering the level of liquid assets necessary to meet excesses of expenditure relative to income.
Capital risk management The Group defines capital as being net debt plus equity.
The Groups objective when managing capital is to maintain an appropriate capital structure to balance the needs of the Group, whilst operating within its bank covenants.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group has a number of options available to it including modifying dividend payments to shareholders, returning capital to shareholders or issuing new shares.
In this way, the Group balances returns to shareholders between long term growth and current returns whilst maintaining capital discipline in relation to investing activities and taking any necessary action on costs to respond to the current environment.
The Group monitors existing equity in issuance on the basis of the net debt EBITDA before exceptional items ratio.
Net debt is calculated as being the net of cash and cash equivalents, interest-bearing loans and borrowings.
The net debt position is discussed in the Financial Review on pages 28 to 33.
The net debt EBITDA before exceptional items ratio enables the Group to plan its capital requirements in the medium term.
The Group uses this measure to provide useful information to financial institutions and investors.
The Group believes that the current net debt EBITDA before exceptional items ratio together with existing shares in issuance provides an efficient capital structure and an acceptable level of financial flexibility.
For the year ended 27 January 2018, there was a net cash surplus of 15.0m year ended 28 January 2017: net cash surplus of 9.7m.
The Group monitors capital efficiency on the basis of the return on capital employed ratio ROCE.
In the financial year ended 27 January 2018, ROCE increased to 20.4% from 20.2%.
