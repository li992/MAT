Adoption of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9 Financial Instruments is the new reporting standard for financial instruments, and became effective on 1 January 2018.
IFRS 9 has replaced previous financial instrument standards and interpretations covered by IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, bringing together all aspects of the accounting for financial instruments: classification and measurement, impairment and hedge accounting.
In 2018 the company has applied IFRS 9 for the first time.
Classification and measurement of financial assets The standard introduces new assessments for the classification and measurement of financial assets, as detailed under Investments below.
The business model assessment was made as at the date of initial application, and then applied to those financial assets that were not derecognised before 1 January 2018.
The SPPI test was performed based on facts and circumstances as at the initial recognition of the asset.
There has been no change in classification and measurement of the companys financial assets as a result of the introduction of IFRS 9.
Loans to subsidiaries and receivable balances remain at amortised cost.
Other financial investments continue to be held at FVTPL.
Classification and measurement of financial liabilities IFRS 9 largely retains the existing requirements in IAS 39 for the classification and measurement of financial liabilities.
The adoption of IFRS 9 has not had a significant effect on the companys accounting policies related to financial liabilities.
Impairment IFRS 9 introduces a new impairment model for financial assets not held at FVTPL.
As a result, the company must now determine forward looking expected credit losses ECL for all its financial assets held at amortised cost.
The company measures loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs, except for debt securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date and other debt securities for which credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition.
In these cases, ECLs are based on the 12-month ECL, which is the ECL that results from a possible default up to 12 months after the reporting date.
The company uses relevant quantitative and qualitative information and analysis based on historical experience, and informed credit assessment including forwardlooking information in order to evaluate the credit-worthiness of each security at each reporting date, to determine whether a significant increase in credit risk since origination occurred.
Should this be the case, the allowance will be based on the lifetime ECL.
Legal & General Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 229 Financial Statements 1 Accounting policies continued ECLs are calculated by considering the probability of default PD, the loss given default LGD and the exposure at default EAD.
The PD is determined by reference to third party information on available companies, or using qualitative information available to the company, and depends on whether a financial asset requires determination of a 12-month ECL or lifetime ECL.
The LGD is determined with reference to any exposure reducing instruments such as collateral or liquid assets that the counterparty may have.
The EAD is determined as the amount of the loan balance outstanding at the reporting date.
The adoption of the ECL requirements of IFRS 9 did not result in the recognition of impairment losses as at the date of initial application or at the reporting date.
The company has applied the new standard retrospectively with an initial application date of 1 January 2018, however, as permitted by the transition provisions of IFRS 9, the company has elected not to restate comparative period information and the accounting policies as set out in the basis of preparation in the company Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2017.
Differences in the carrying amounts of financial assets andfinancial liabilities resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 are recognised as an adjustment to retained earnings as at 1 January 2018.
All hedging relationships designated under IAS 39 at 31 December 2017 met the criteria for hedge accounting under IFRS 9 at 1 January 2018 and are thereforeregarded as continuing hedging relationships.
Financial assets On initial recognition, financial assets are measured at fair value.
Subsequently, they can be measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI or fair value through profit or loss FVTPL.
The classification depends on two criteria: i the business model within which financial assets are managed: and ii their contractual cash flow characteristics whether the cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest SPPI.
A debt instrument is measured at amortised cost if it meets the following conditions: i it is held within a business model that has an objective to hold financial assets to collect contractual cash flows: and ii the contractual terms of the financial asset result in cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding SPPI.
A debt security is measured at FVOCI if it meets the following conditions: i it is held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets: and ii the assets cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest.
Movements in the carrying amount are recognised in other comprehensive income except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses and interest revenue which are recognised in the income statement.
When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to the income statement.
Assets that are held at FVTPL include derivative assets which are held for trading HFT and financial assets that fail both the business model and SPPI tests.
A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at FVTPL is recognised in the income statement.
The company has no equity instruments.
Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently held at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Investment income Investment income includes dividends and interest.
Dividends receivable from group companies are recognised in the period in which the dividends are declared and approved at the general meeting or paid.
Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method.
Distributions Dividend distribution to the companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividends are authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the company.
Interest expense Interest expense reflects the underlying cost of borrowing, based on the effective interest method and includes payments and receipts made under derivative instruments which are amortised over the interest period to which they relate.
Investment in subsidiary undertakings Investments in subsidiaries are held at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Derivative financial instruments The companys activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
The company uses derivatives such as foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs.
Borrowings classified as liabilities are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
The difference between the net proceeds and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the borrowing period using the effective interest method.
230 Legal & General Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial Statements Company financial statements Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions orevents that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is recognised as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits against which to recover carried forward tax losses and from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable or a binding agreement to distribute past earnings in future periods has been entered into by the subsidiary.
Foreign currencies Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange prevailing at the time of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities expressed in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary items are maintained at historic rates.
Exchange gains or losses are recognised in the income statement.
Pension costs The company participates in the group defined benefit schemes which are recognised on the Balance Sheet of Legal & General Resources Limited.
These are multi-employer defined benefit schemes for which the companys share of the underlying assets and liabilities cannot be separately identified.
Therefore the companys cost of participation has been treated as that of a defined contribution scheme for reporting purposes.
In addition to these schemes the company also contributes to defined contribution schemes.
The company charges the costs of its pension schemes against profit as incurred.
Any difference between the cumulative amounts charged against profits and contribution amounts paid is included as a provision or prepayment in the balance sheet.
The assets of the defined benefit schemes and the defined contribution schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds, which have been subject to regular valuation every three years and updated by formal reviews at reporting dates by qualified actuaries.
Share-based payments The company operates a number of share-based payment plans on behalf of its subsidiaries.
The fair value of the equity instruments granted is spread over the vesting period of the instrument and treated as a capital contribution to the respective subsidiary.
The total capital contribution is determined by reference to the fair value of the awards, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
The capital contribution to the subsidiaries is accounted for as an increase in the investment in the parent companys financial statements.
At each balance sheet date, the company revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments which are expected to become exercisable.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimate, if any, in the cost of the investment in the subsidiary and a corresponding adjustment is made to equity over the remaining vesting period.
On vesting or exercise, the difference between the accumulated capital contribution and the actual cost to the company is transferred to retained earnings.
Where new shares are issued, the proceeds received are credited to share capital and share premium.
Any capital contribution is subsequently recharged to the respective subsidiary as incurred and the corresponding cost of investment is reduced.
