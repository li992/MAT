Taxation In the opinion of the Directors, the Company has complied with the requirements of Section 1158 and Section 1159 of the CTA 2010 and will therefore be exempt from corporation tax on any capital gains reported in the capital return during the year.
To the extent possible, the Company will elect to designate all of the proposed dividend see note 11 as an interest distribution to its shareholders.
This distribution is treated as a tax deduction against taxable income in the revenue return and results in a reduction of corporation tax being payable by the Company at 31 December 2018.
