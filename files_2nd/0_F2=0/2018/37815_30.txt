NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies This section sets out the Groups our or we accounting policies which relate to the financial statements as a whole.
Where an accounting policy relates specifically to a note then the related accounting policy is set out within that note.
All policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented unless stated otherwise.
1.1 General information MetroBank the Company together with its subsidiaries the Group provides retail and commercial banking services in the UK and isa public limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006 Registration number 6419578.
The address of our registered office is One Southampton Row, London WC1B 5HA.
1.2 Basis of preparation Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS asadopted by the EU, the IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRS IC and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reportingunder IFRS.
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, as our Directors are satisfied that the Group and the Company have the resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future.
In publishing the Company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, we have taken advantage of the exemption in section 408 3 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present an individual income statement and related notes that form apart of these financial statements.
1.3 cash flow statement Cash and cash equivalents comprise balances with less than three months maturity from the date of acquisition, including cash inhand, deposits held at call with banks and balances held with the Bank of England.
The consolidated cash flow statement shows the changes in cash and cash equivalents arising during the year from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities.
The cash flows from operating activities are determined by using the indirect method.
Under that method, profit before tax is adjusted for non-cash items, changes in other assets and liabilities and other items that relate to investing and financing cash flows, to determine net cash inflows or outflows from operating activities.
Cash flows from investing and financing activities are determined using the direct method, that is by directly reporting the cash effects of transactions.
1.4 changes in accounting policy and disclosures During the year we adopted the following standards across all Group companies: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments On 1 January 2018 we adopted IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, which replaced IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
This resulted in changes in accounting policies and adjustments to the amounts previously recognised in the financial statements.
In accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 9, comparative figures have not been restated: accordingly, all comparative period information is presented in accordance with our previous accounting policies.
Reconciliation of balance sheet balances from IAS 39 to IFRS 9 The following tables reconcile the carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities, from their previous measurement category in accordance with IAS 39 as at 31 December 2017 to their new measurement categories upon transition to IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018.

They were subsequently transferred to the held to maturity category, with the carrying value at the point of transfer being equal to the fair value.
This adjustment restates the carrying value of these assets to reflect the appropriate amortised cost as if the assets had always been measured at amortised cost.
The total amount of remeasurement of 20 million was adjusted through opening equity on 1 January 2018.
A corresponding increase in deferred tax assets of approximately 5 million was also adjusted through opening equity on 1 January 2018.
Financial assets measured at FVOCI under IFRS 9 Investment securities IAs39: million Available for sale total Carrying value under IAS 39 361 361 Transfer from amortised cost Carrying amount transferred 332 332 Remeasurement from amortised cost to fair value 5 5 Remeasurement of impairment allowance Carrying value under IFRS 9 FVOCI 698 698 332 million fixed rate securities classified as held to maturity under IAS 39 have been classified as FVOCI under IFRS 9.
Going forward, this pool of assets will be held to collect cash flows and to sell if required in order to effectively manage our interest rate risk, therefore it has been classified as FVOCI.
Had IAS 39 remained in force, we would have maintained our intention and ability to hold these assets to maturity, and we would have sought other methods to manage our interest rate risk.
The total amount of remeasurement of 5 million was adjusted through opening equity on 1 January 2018.
A corresponding decrease in deferred tax assets of approximately 1 million was also adjusted through change to equity on 1 January 2018.

Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued Reconciliation of impairment allowance balance from IAS 39 to IFRS 9 The following table reconciles the previous impairment allowance measured in accordance with the IAS 39 incurred loss model and the new impairment allowance measured in accordance with the IFRS 9 expected loss model at 1 January 2018: loan loss loan loss allowance under reclassification remeasurement allowance under Measurement category IAs 39 IFrs 9 IAs 39 million million million IFrs 9 million Loans and receivables Financial assets at amortised cost 15 22 37 Available-for-sale financial instruments Financial assets at FVOCI Total 15 22 37 The increase in loss allowance under IFRS 9 when compared to that measured under IAS 39 is primarily due to earlier recognition of credit losses under the new expected loss model.
The most significant impact has been observed in relation to our unsecured lending portfolios.
For a number of these portfolios, no new lending is being originated.
The European Banking Authority has amended the Capital Requirements Regulation to establish IFRS 9 related transitional arrangements.
On adoption of IFRS 9, movements in the opening impairment provision were posted as an adjustment to reserves, and therefore to capital.
The transitional arrangement enables firms to add back a portion of this capital adjustment in early years, thereby reducing the initial impact on capital.
Add-back adjustments are also allowable for movements in provisions in subsequent years.
Wehave elected to adopt the transitional arrangements.
Hedge accounting IFRS 9 includes an accounting policy choice to remain with IAS 39 hedge accounting.
Hedge accounting is not currently material for usand we have elected to continue applying the requirements of IAS 39.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers From 1 January 2018, we adopted IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers applying the modified retrospective method.
Themajority of our revenue is net interest income which is accounted for under IFRS 9, as such there are no material changes to the timing of revenue recognition which have arisen from the adoption of IFRS 15.
1.5 Future accounting developments At the year end the following standards were in issue but not yet effective and have not been adopted early in these financial statements: IFRS 16 Leases On 1 January 2019 we adopted IFRS 16 Leases.
IFRS 16 provides guidance on the classification, recognition and measurement of leases to help provide useful information to the users of financial statements.
IFRS 16 provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise right of use RoU assets and lease liabilities for all applicable leases, with operating leases being brought onto the face of the balance sheet.
We have adopted IFRS 16 on the modified retrospective basis and as such there will be no restatement of comparators within the 2019Annual Report & Accounts, which will continue to be presented under IAS 17.
On adoption of the standard on 1 January 2019, we recognised lease liabilities for operating leases of 328 million.
We elected the transitional option to set the RoU asset equal to the related lease liability adjusted for current amounts accrued in respect of rent free periods for all leases as at 1 January 2019 and therefore there is no opening adjustment to retained earnings.
The total amount of RoU asset recognised on 1 January was 313 million.
The weighted average incremental borrowing rate used to measure lease liabilities is5.5%.
We have applied the available practical expedients of exempting leases with a short life less than 12 months or low value less than 5,000.
These leases will continue to be recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term and in total are immaterial to the bank.
As a result, the key leases to which the full requirements of IFRS 16 have been applied are our leases of store and head office sites.
For all stores, the lease liability represents the present value of future lease payments for the full lease term, irrespective of any tenant break clauses.
For office space, where it is certain we will exercise a break the lease liability has only been calculated up to such date.
The key judgement used in the lease liability calculation is the choice of discount rate, which has been set at our incremental cost ofborrowing.
114 Metro Bank Plc AnnuAl report And Accounts 2018 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued Due to the relatively young age of the Group coupled with our store opening profile over recent years, the majority of our leases remain in the first half of their terms, with an average remaining lease length of 20 years.
Our business model will also see us continue to open stores in the years ahead, leading to an expanding lease portfolio.
These two factors will lead to significantly higher charges recognised in the income statement in the near term when compared to IAS 17, reflecting a different profile of cost recognition under each standard.
Charges under IFRS 16 are front loaded in the earlier years of a lease: IAS 17 requires lease expenses to be recognised ona straight line basis.
Our net interest margin NIM will be reduced by the adoption of IFRS 16 since the rental expense part of operating expenses under IAS 17 will be replaced by a depreciation and interest expense charge.
This interest expense will be recognized within NIM, thus reducing it going forward.
Customer NIM fees considers the margin derived from customer deposits and lending only, and therefore is not impacted by the adoption of IFRS 16.
The undiscounted value of our lease commitments can be found in note 22.
The table below reconciles this to the opening lease liability we will recognise under IFRS 16. million Total undiscounted lease commitments at 31 December 2018 See note 22 659 Exclusion of VAT from lease liability 116 Discounting at a weighted average rate of 5.5% 215 Lease liability to be included in the statement of financial position at 1 January 2019 328 Other standards No other standards which are currently not yet effective, including IFRS 17 insurance contracts are deemed to have a significant impact on our financial statements.
1.6 Segmental reporting IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports and components of the Group which are regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker to allocate resources to segments and to assess their performance.
For this purpose, the Chief Operating Decision Maker of the Group is our Board of Directors.
The Board considers the results of the Group as a whole when assessing the performance of the Group and allocating resources.
Accordingly, the Group has a single operating segment.
We operate solely within the UK and, as such, no geographical analysis is required.
We are not reliant on any single customer.
1.7 Foreign currency translation a Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements are measured using pounds Sterling, the currency of the UK, which is the primary economic environment in which we operate the functional currency.
The financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling, which is our presentation currency.
b Transactions and balances Transactions in a foreign currency are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction.
Monetary items denominated in a foreign currency are translated using the closing rate as at the reporting date.
Non-monetary items measured at historical cost denominated in a foreign currency are translated with the exchange rate as at the date of initial recognition: non-monetary items in a foreign currency that are measured at fair value are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined.
Foreign currency differences arising on translation are recognised in other income.
Gains and losses arising from foreign currency transactions offered to customers are also recognised in other income.
Metro Bank Plc AnnuAl report And Accounts 2018 115 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1.
Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued 1.8 critical accounting judgements and estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires us to make judgements and estimates which although based on our best assessment, by definition will seldom equal the actual results.
Management believes that the underlying assumptions applied at 31 December 2018 are appropriate and that these financial statements therefore present the financial position and results ofthe Group fairly.
The areas involving a higher degree of complexity, or areas where estimates have a significant risk of resulting in amaterial adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are disclosed below.
Measurement of the expected credit loss allowance The recognition and measurement of expected credit losses ECL is complex and involves the use of significant estimation and judgements.
We consider that the key judgement assumption for us relates to the determination of whether a significant increase incredit risk has occurred.
We consider that the key source of estimation uncertainty relates to the formulation and incorporation ofmultiple forward-looking economic scenarios into the ECL estimates to meet the measurement objective of IFRS 9.
Significant increase in credit risk critical accounting judgement As described in more detail in note 23, IFRS 9 requires a higher level of expected credit loss to be recognised for underperforming loans.
This is considered based on a staging approach.
Financial assets that have had no significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition or that have low credit risk at the reporting date are considered to be performing loans and are classified as Stage 1.
Losses are calculated based on our expectation of losses expected on defaults which may occur within the next 12 months.
Assets which are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, but that do not have objective evidence of impairment, are classified as Stage 2.
Losses are calculated based on defaults which may occur at any point in the assetslifetime.
Judgement is required to determine when a significant increase in credit risk has occurred.
An assessment of whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, resulting in transfer to stage 2, is performed at each reporting period by considering the change in the probability of default PD occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument.
The assessment explicitly or implicitly compares the PD occurring at the reporting date compared to that at initial recognition, taking into account reasonable and supportable information, including information about past events, current conditions and future economic conditions.
We assess whether PD has increased using qualitative and quantitative measures, as described in note 23.
Multiple forward-looking economic scenarios critical accounting estimate As described in note 23, the ECL recognised in the financial statements reflects the effect on expected credit losses of a range of possible outcomes, calculated on a probability-weighted basis, based on a number of economic scenarios and including management overlays where required.
These scenarios are representative of our view of forecast economic conditions, sufficient to calculate unbiased ECL.
At 31 December 2018, three main scenarios were applied Baseline, Upside and Downside, plus a specific Hard Brexit scenario incorporating the high degree of uncertainty in estimating the current uncertainty in the UK economy ahead of the UKs departure from the European Union in 2019.
The following assumptions, considered to be the key drivers of ECL, have been used for the scenarios applied: UK interest rates UK unemployment rates UK house price index HPI changes, year on year UK gross domestic product GDP changes, year on year The weightings applied to each scenario at 31 December 2018 are: Baseline - 37% Upside and downside - 28% each Hard Brexit - 7% The weighted ECL is higher than the baseline scenario, reflecting the impact of the downside and Hard Brexit scenarios, offset by the impact of the upside scenario.
Further details on how the assumptions and scenario weightings have been determined can be found in note 23.
116 Metro Bank Plc AnnuAl report And Accounts 2018 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued The weightings applied to each scenario are considered to represent a significant accounting estimate.
We have performed an assessment of the impact on the ECL if each of the Baseline, Upside, Downside and Hard Brexit scenarios were applied to the ECL calculation using a 100% weighting that is, ignoring all other scenarios in each case : Scenario ecl million Variance to reported weighted ecl at 31 december 2018 Weighted 33.8 Baseline 31.6 7% Upside 26.5 22% Downside 40.4 19% Hard Brexit 49.4 46% We note that the sensitivities disclosed above represent example scenarios and may not represent actual scenarios which occur in thefuture.
If one of these scenarios did arise then at that time the ECL would not equal the amount disclosed above, as the amounts disclosed do not take account of the alternative possible scenarios which would be considered at that time.
We also note that the sensitivities disclosed above do not take into account movements in impairment stage allocations that would result under the different scenarios 2.
Net interest income Accounting policy We recognise interest income and expense for all interest-bearing financial instruments within interest income and interest expense in the income statement using the effective interest rate method.
The effective interest rate method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or a financial liability and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability.
When calculating the effective interest rate we estimate cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument for example, prepayment options but do not consider future credit losses except for purchased or originated credit impaired assets.
The calculation includes all fees paid or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts.
For loans that are credit impaired interest income is calculated on the carrying amount of the loan net ofcredit impairment.

Fee and commission income Accounting policy Fee and commission income is earned from a wide range of services we provide to our customers.
We account for fees and commissions as follows: Product or service Nature, timing and satisfaction of performance obligations and payment terms Service charges and We levy a range of standard charges and fees for account maintenance or specific other fee income account services.
Where the fee is earned upon the execution of a significant act at apoint in time, for example CHAPs payment charges, these are recognised as revenue when the act is completed for the customer.
Where the income is earned from the provision of services, for example an account maintenance fee, this is recognised asrevenue when the service is delivered.
Safe deposit box Revenue is recognised over the period the customer has access to the box from the date possession is taken.
Safe deposit box fees are billed on either a monthly or annual basis with a standard set price payable dependent on the size of box.
ATM and interchange Where we earn fees from our ATMs or from interchange this is recognised at the point fees the service is delivered.
As disclosed in note 1.6, we provide services solely within the UK and therefore revenues are not presented on ageographic basis.
Revenue is grouped solely by contract-type as we believe this best depicts how the nature, amount and timing of our revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.
2018 2017 Group million million Service charges and other fee income 23.2 17.9 Safe deposit box income 11.1 9.1 ATM and interchange fees 3.3 2.7 Total fee and commission income 37.6 29.7 4.
Other income Accounting policy Other income is accounted for as follows: Product or service Nature, timing and satisfaction of performance obligations and payment terms Gains on foreign Gains on foreign currency transactions is the spread earned on foreign currency currency transactions transactions performed for our customers along with any associated fees.
It is recognised at the point in time that the exchange is executed.
Rental income Rental income is primarily earned from the letting out of surplus space in some of our properties.
The revenue is recognised on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Further details of future amounts due can be found in note 22.

Contributions to colleagues individual personal pension plans are made on a contractual basis, with no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
These contributions are recognised as an expense when they fall due.

Taxation Accounting policy Current tax Our current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable profit for the year and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years.
It is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Where we have tax losses that can be relieved only by carry-forward against taxable profits of future periods, adeductible temporary difference arises.
Those losses carried forward are set off against deferred tax liabilities carried in the balance sheet.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates andlaws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the date of the balance sheet and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
The principal differences arise from trading losses, depreciation of property, plant and equipment and relief onresearch and development expenditure.
We recognise a deferred tax asset to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used and deferred tax liabilities are provided on taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised or the deferred tax liability settled.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and where the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle on a net basis.
tax expense The components of the tax expense for the year are: 2018 2017 Group million million Current tax Current tax 2.8 1.0 Adjustment in respect of prior years 0.7 0.1 Total current tax expense 0.9 3.5 Deferred tax Origination and reversal of temporary differences 9.8 5.2 Effect of changes in tax rates 0.7 3.0 Adjustment in respect of prior years 0.5 1.2 Total deferred tax expense 10.0 7.0 Total tax expense 13.5 7.9 reconciliation of the total tax expense The tax expense shown in the income statement differs from the tax expense that would apply if all accounting profits had been taxed at the UK corporation tax rate.

Taxation continued A reconciliation between the tax expense and the accounting profit multiplied by the UK corporation tax rate is as follows: effective effective 2018 tax rate 2017 tax rate Group million % million % Accounting profit before tax 40.6 18.7 Tax expense at statutory tax rate of 19% 2017: 19.25% 7.7 19.0% 3.6 19.25% Tax effects of: Non-deductible expenses depreciation on non-qualifying fixed assets 2.6 6.4% 2.6 14.10% Non-deductible expenses - investment property impairment 0.5 1.2% Non-deductible expenses other 0.6 1.4% 0.5 2.90% Share-based payments 1.3 3.1% 0.6 3.40% Adjustment in respect of prior years 0.2 0.5% 1.2 6.50% Effect of changes in tax rates 0.6 1.5% 3.0 15.90% Tax expense reported in the consolidated income statement 13.5 33.2% 7.9 42.20% Share based payments During the year the MetroBank share price fell from 35.84 to 16.93.
This had the impact of significantly reducing the deferred tax asset held for share options and in turn resulted in an associated deferred tax charge of 1.3 million.
This charge contributes 3.1% to the2018 effective tax rate.
effective tax rate The effective tax rate for the year is 33.2% 2017: 42.2%.
The effective tax rate for the year excluding the effect of changes in tax rates and prior year adjustments is 31.2% 2017: 32.8%.
Further excluding the impact of the deferred tax charge relating to the fall in the share price and the investment property impairments the effective tax rate for the year is 26.9% 2017: 32.8% Deferred tax A deferred tax asset must be regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not there will be suitable tax profits from which the future of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Due to the investment property impairment being unrealised there is an unrecognised DTA of 0.5m.

Financial instruments Accounting policy Financial assets We account for our financial assets under three measurement categories, as defined by IFRS 9: Measured at amortised cost Measured at fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI Measured at fair value through profit or loss FVPL IFRS 9 applies one classification approach for all types of financial assets.
Two criteria are used to determine how financial assets should be classified and measured: a Business model: how an entity manages its financial assets in order to generate cash flows by collecting contractual cash flows, selling financial assets or both.
Factors considered in determining the business model for a group of assets include, for example, past experience on how the cash flows for these assets were collected, how their performance is assessed, how related risks are managed and how their managers are compensated: and b SPPI test: whether contractual cash flows are consistent with a basic lending arrangement: that is whether cash flows solely comprise payments of principal and interest SPPI.
Examples of contract terms which may cause a financial asset not to pass the SPPI test include: interest being linked to the share price of the issuer, or some other index, rather than reflecting the time value of money: timing differences on interest reset points, such as an interest rate which resets monthly to a three month LIBOR rate: or a bond that is convertible into equity.
If assets pass the SPPI test, and are within a business model that holds to collect contractual cash flows, they are measured at amortised cost.
If assets pass the SPPI test, and are within a business model that holds to collect contractual cash flows and for sale, they are measured at FVOCI.
If an asset does not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI, it is measured at FVPL.
Under IFRS 9, assets will only move between categories if there is a significant change to the business model within which they are held: this is expected to be infrequent.
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or when the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset are transferred toanother entity.
Financial liabilities All financial liabilities are classified and subsequently measured at amortised cost, except for those designated atfair value through profit or loss at initial recognition.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when they are extinguished, i. e. when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires.
2017 comparative data 2017 comparative data is disclosed under IAS 39.
The specific policies applied to loans and advances to customers and investment securities are described in note 10 and 11.
There are no significant differences relating to the classification and measurement of our financial liabilities.

Financial instruments continued Our financial instruments primarily comprise customer deposits, loans and advances to customers, cash held at banks and investment securities, all of which arise as a result of our normal operations.
Information on loans and advances to customers can be found in note 10, and on investment securities in note 11.
We do not enter into transactions for speculative purposes and there are no instruments held for trading.
From time to time, we may use interest rate derivatives such as swaps to manage part of our interest rate risk.
The main financial risks arising from our financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk and market risks price and interest rate risk.
Further details on these risks can be found in notes 23 to 25.
The financial instruments we hold are simple in nature and we do not consider that we have made any significant or material judgments relating to the classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9.
Loans and advances to customers Accounting policy Loans and advances to customers are classified as held at amortised cost.
All customer lending is held to collect cash flows, with no sales expected in the normal course of business.
We aim to offer products with simple terms to customers, and as a result, all loans comprise solely payments of principal and interest.
Loans are initially recognised when cash is advanced to the borrower at fair value which is the cash consideration tooriginate the loan including any transaction costs and measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, which is detailed further in note 2.
Interest on loans is included in the income statement and is reported as Interest income.
Expected credit losses ECL are reported as a deduction from the carrying value of the loan.
Changes to the ECL during the year are recognised in the income statement asExpected credit loss expense.
2017 comparative data is disclosed under IAS 39: instead of an ECL an allowance for impairment is held.
The allowance for impairment represents the cumulative credit impairment losses recognised and are reported as adeduction from the carrying value of the loan.
Credit impairment losses recognised during the year are shown as in the income statement as Credit impairment charges.

Investment securities Accounting policy Our investment securities may be categorised as amortised cost, FVOCI or FVPL.
Currently all investment securities are non-complex, with cash flows comprising solely payments of principal and interest.
We hold some securities to collect cash flows: other securities are held to collect cash flows, and to sell if the need arises e. g. to manage and meet day to day liquidity needs.
Therefore, we have a mixed business model and securities are classified as either amortised cost or FVOCI as appropriate.
We do not categorise any investment securities asFVPL.
Investment securities held at amortised cost Investment securities held at amortised cost consist entirely of debt instruments.
They are accounted for using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Investment securities held at FVOCI Investment securities held at FVOCI consist entirely of debt instruments.
Investment securities held at FVOCI are initially recognised at fair value, which is the cash consideration including any transaction costs, and measured subsequently at fair value with gains and losses being recognised in other comprehensive income, except for impairment losses and foreign exchange gains and losses, until the investment security is derecognised.
Interest is calculated using the effective interest method.
At 31 December 2017, under IAS 39, investment securities were classified as held to maturity or available for sale.
Investment securities held to maturity Held to maturity investments are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
A sale or reclassification of more than an insignificant amount of held to maturity investments would result in the reclassification of all held to maturity investments as available-for-sale and would prevent us from classifying investment securities as held to maturity for the current and the two following financial years.
Available-for-sale investment securities Available-for-sale investment securities are initially recognised at fair value, which is the cash consideration including any transaction costs, and measured subsequently at fair value with gains and losses being recognised in other comprehensive income, except for impairment losses and foreign exchange gains and losses, until the investment security is derecognised.
If an available-for-sale investment security is determined to be impaired, thecumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the statement of comprehensive income is recognised in theincome statement.
Interest is calculated using the effective interest method, and foreign currency gains andlosses on monetary assets classified as available-for-sale are recognised in the income statement.

The two levels of the fair value hierarchy relevant to the Group and Company are defined below.
Quoted market prices level 1 Investment securities are classified as Level 1 if their value is observable in an active market.
Such instruments are valued by reference to unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets where the quoted price is readily available, and the price represents actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arms length basis.
An active market is one in which transactions occur with sufficient volume and frequency to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

Investment securities continued Valuation technique using observable inputs level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset, either directly as prices or indirectly derived from prices.
Investment securities held at amortised cost At 31 December 2018, financial investments classified at amortised cost 31 December 2017: held to maturity were as follows: carrying amount Fair value Group and company million million At 31 December 2018 held at amortised cost 3,458 3,429 At 31 December 2017 held to maturity 3,554 3,590 reclassifications between categories On 17 February 2017 33.2 million, 18 April 2017 60.4 million, 21 November 2017 95.0 million, 19 December 2017 87.8 million and on 22 December 2017 46.1 million of financial assets classified as available-for-sale were reclassified as held to maturity.
The carrying amount excluding accrued interest and fair value of the assets at 31 December 2017 were as follows: carrying amount Fair value million million At 31 December 2017 314 324 A 1.2 million fair value gain was recognised with respect to the reclassified assets in 2017: had these assets not been reclassified, an additional fair value gain of 0.9 million would have been recognised in other comprehensive income.
The effective interest rates on available-for-sale assets reclassified to held to maturity at 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2017 ranged from 0.96% to 3.65%, with all cash flows expected to be recoverable.
Property, plant and equipment Accounting Policy Our property, plant and equipment primarily consists of investments and improvements in our store network and is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment.
We depreciate property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis to its residual value using the following useful economic lives: Leasehold improvements Lower of the remaining life of the lease or the useful life of the asset Freehold land Not depreciated Buildings Up to 50 years Fixtures and fittings and equipment 5 years IT hardware 3 to 5 years We keep depreciation rates, methods and the residual values underlying the calculation of depreciation of items of property, plant and equipment under review to take account of any change in circumstances.
All items of property, plant and equipment are reviewed annually for impairment.
Investment property Investment property is also stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment.
Depreciation is calculated on a consistent basis with that applied to land and buildings as disclosed in the table above.
All items of investment property are reviewed annually for impairment.

Intangible assets Accounting policy Goodwill Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over our interest in net fair value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree and the fair value of the non-controlling interest in the acquiree.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the cash-generating units CGUs, or groups of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
Goodwill is not amortised, however it is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its fair value less cost to sell, and the present value of its expected future cash flows.
If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is charged to the income statement.
Goodwill is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Any impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.
Other intangible assets Software includes both purchased items and internally developed systems, which consists principally of identifiable and directly associated internal staff and other costs.
Purchased intangible assets and costs directly associated with the development of systems are capitalised as intangible assets where there is an identifiable asset which we control and which will generate future economic benefits in accordance with IAS 38.
Costs to establish feasibility or to maintain existing performance are recognised as an expense.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis within the income statement using the following useful economic lives: Core banking software1 20 years Other banking software 3 to 10 years Software licences Licence period Customer contracts 10 years 1.
Core banking software consists of our central banking transaction platform.
It has been assessed as having a 20 year life due to it being the central component of our digital infrastructure.
It has been in use since we first opened and given its significance is unlikely to be replaced within the foreseeable future.
All intangible assets are reviewed annually for impairment.

For the purposes of impairment testing the goodwill is allocated to the appropriate CGU: of the total balance of 4.1 million 2017: 4.1 million, 100% has been allocated to SME Invoice Finance Limited.
The recoverable amount of SME Invoice Finance Limited has been based on a value-in-use calculation using pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets and plans approved by management covering a seven-year period and a discount rate of 7.9%.
The long-term growth rate is consistent with external sources of information reviewed by management.
Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions above would not cause the recoverable amount of SME Invoice Finance Limited to fall below the balance sheet carrying value.
Seven years was used as the basis for discounted cash flow calculation to align with the 2018-2024 plan, prepared by management and approved by the Board, and used in decision-making.
The plan is reviewed and updated annually.

Share options Accounting policy The grant date fair value of options awarded to colleagues is recognised as an expense over the period in which colleagues become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The expense representing the value of the services received by us is measured by reference to the fair value of the shares or share options granted on the date of the grant.
The cost of the colleague services received in respect of the share options granted is recognised in the consolidated income statement over the period that the services are received, which is the vesting period.
Graded vesting is applied where relevant.
The fair value of colleague share option plans is calculated at the grant date using a Black-Scholes model.
The resulting cost is charged to the income statement over the vesting period.
The value of the charge is adjusted toreflect expected and actual levels of vesting.
We offer options to Executive Directors and colleagues.
The exercise price of the granted options is equal to the estimated market price determined at the date of the grant.
Options generally vest in equal tranches over five years and have a contractual option term of ten years, with the only vesting condition being the continuing service of the colleague.
Options acquired via exchange of some or all of the cash element of a colleagues variable reward vest immediately.
All our options are equity settled and we have no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase the shares or settle the options in cash.
The table below summarises the movements in the number of options outstanding and their weighted average exercise price: 2018 2017 Weighted Weighted Number of average exercise number of average options price options exercise price Group 000 000 Outstanding at 1 January 3,377 18.98 2,907 15.04 Granted 1,001 35.36 768 32.73 Exercised 144 16.14 195 13.94 Lapsed 131 25.05 103 20.37 Outstanding at 31 December 4,104 22.90 3,377 18.98 Exercisable at 31 December 2,287 18.22 1,694 16.19 The average share price during 2018 was 3,075p 2017: 3,488p.
Share options continued The fair value of the options granted during the year is determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model.
The total fair value of options granted in 2018 was 4.3 million 2017: 3.3 million, based on the following assumptions: 2018 2018 cash bonus share Group exchange options Weighted average risk-free interest rate 0.87% 0.94% Weighted average expected life 2.5 years 3.25 years Weighted average expected volatility 22.52% 21.96% Weighted average expected dividend yield nil nil Weighted average share price 35.36 35.36 Weighted average exercise price 35.36 35.36 Expected volatility is a measure of the amount by which our shares are expected to fluctuate during the life of an option.
The expected volatility is estimated based on a statistical analysis of the historic share prices of other FTSE 350 banks over the most recent period which is commensurate with the expected life of the option.
The analysis is based on FTSE 350 banks rather than our own share price due to insufficient available price data, having only been listed since March 2016.

Leases All of our leases are classified as operating leases.
Total payments made under our operating leases are charged Accounting policy to other operating expenses in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
When an operating lease is terminated before the lease period has expired, any payment we are required to make to the lessor by way of penalty is recognised as an expense in the period in which termination takes place.
commitments under leases We lease various offices and stores under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements.
The total operating lease expenditure recognised in the statement of comprehensive income during the year was 25.5 million 2017: 19.6 million.
The leases have various terms, escalation, renewal and rights.
At the balance sheet date, future minimum payments under operating leases relating to land and buildings, inclusive of irrecoverable VAT, were as follows: 31 December 31 december 2018 2017 Group million million Due Within one year 30 20 Due in one to five years 133 81 Due in more than five years 495 318 Total 659 419 On 1 January 2019 we adopted IFRS 16 which will significantly change the way we account for leases.
Further details on the impact ofthe adoption of IFRS 16 can be found in note 1.5.
Future income due under non-cancellable operating leases We lease out surplus space in some of our properties.
The table below sets out the cash payments expected over the remaining non-cancellable term of each lease, exclusive of any VAT.
Of the total below, 11.3 million 2017: 12.0 million relates to sub-letting of leased stores.

Credit risk Accounting policy We assess on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses ECL associated with the assets carried atamortised cost and FVOCI and recognise a loss allowance for such losses at each reporting date.
Impairment provisions are driven by changes in credit risk of loans and securities, with a provision for lifetime expected credit losses recognised where the risk of default of an instrument has increased significantly.
Risk ofdefault and expected credit losses must incorporate forward looking and macroeconomic information.
Loans and advances Sophisticated impairment models have been developed for our retail and commercial loan portfolios, with three core models: revolving products: fixed term loans: and mortgages.
Expected credit losses are calculated for drawn loans, and for committed lending.
The same broad calculation approach is applied for each core model.
Expected credit losses are calculated by multiplying three main components, being the probability of default, loss given default and the exposure at default, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
Key model inputs and judgements include: Consideration of when a significant increase in credit risk occurs Probability of default PD, loss given default, and exposure at default Macro economic scenarios to be applied Significant increase in credit risk IFRS 9 requires a higher level of expected credit loss to be recognised for underperforming loans.
This is considered based on a staging approach: Stage Description ECL recognised Stage 1 Financial assets that have had no 12-month expected credit losses significant increase in credit risk since Total losses expected on defaults which initial recognition or that have low credit may occur within the next 12 months.

136 Metro Bank Plc AnnuAl report And Accounts 2018 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 23. Credit risk continued A significant increase in credit risk may be identified in a number of ways: Quantitative criteria where the numerically calculated probability of default on a loan has increased significantly since initial recognition.
This is assessed using detailed models which assess whether the lifetime PD at observation is greater than the lifetime PD at origination by a portfolio specific threshold.
Given the different nature of the products and the dissimilar level of lifetime PDs at origination, we implement different thresholds by sub-products within each portfolio term loans, revolving loan facilities and mortgages.
The selection of the threshold is such that the PD threshold of the observed median lifetime PD at origination is 3 times this median.
Qualitative criteria Instruments that are 30 days past due or more are allocated to stage 2, regardless of the results of the quantitative analysis.
Instruments that are 30 days past due or more or instruments classified on the watchlist as higher risk are allocated to Stage 2, regardless of the results of the quantitative analysis.
A loan will be considered to be non-performing or credit impaired when it meets our definition of default that is to say, the loan is 90 days past due, or the borrower is considered unlikely to pay without realization of collateral.
Unlikeliness to pay is assessed through the presence of triggers including the loan being in repossession, the customer having been declared bankrupt, or evidence of financial distress.
A loan may also be considered to be non-performing when it is subject to forbearance measures, consisting ofconcessions in relation to: A modification of the previous terms and conditions of the loan which the borrower is not considered able tocomply with: or A total or partial refinancing of a troubled debt contract that would not have been granted had the borrower notbeen in financial difficulties.
It may not be possible to identify a single discrete event which defines an asset as non-performing or credit impaired.
Instead, the combined effect of several events may cause financial assets to become credit impaired.
A probation period is implemented before transferring a financial instrument to a lower stage ie, from Stage 3 to Stage 2, or from Stage 2 to Stage 1.
Specifically, in order to move an account from Stage 3 to Stage 2, we apply a backstop such that the instrument should meet the Stage 2 criteria for three consecutive months.
The same logic is applied when transferring an account from Stage 2 to Stage 1.
Probability of default The probability of default represents the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on its financial obligation either over the next 12 months for Stage 1 accounts, or over the remaining lifetime of the loan for Stage 2 and 3 accounts.
Aprobability of default is calculated for all loans based on historic data and incorporates: Credit quality scores Lifecycle trends depending on a loans vintage Factors indicating the quality of the vintage Characteristics of the current and future economic environment Loss given default The loss given default LGD represents our expectation of the extent of a loss on a defaulted exposure, and is expressed as a percentage considering expected recoveries on defaulted accounts.
We apply two LGD rates onefor unsecured lending and one for secured lending.
LGD rates have been modelled considering a range of inputs, including: Value of collateral on secured portfolios a key driver of the expected recovery in the event of default Expected haircut applied to the collateral value to reflect a forced sale discount Price index forecasts applied to project collateral values into the future Stress factors based on macro-economic scenarios Exposure at default This is the amount that we expect to be owed at the point of default.
This is subject to judgement since a balance will not necessarily remain static between the balance sheet date and the point of expected default.
For example: Interest should be accrued Repayments may be received on mortgages For a revolving product, further drawings may be taken between the current point in time and the point of default Estimations of these factors will be incorporated into our estimate of exposure at default.
PD, LGD and exposure at default are calculated and applied at an individual account level for secured lending.
For unsecured lending, PD and exposure at default are calculated and applied at an individual account level, butLGD is assessed at a portfolio level and applied to accounts on an individual basis.
Metro Bank Plc AnnuAl report And Accounts 2018 137 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 23. Credit risk continued Macro economic scenarios The ECL recognised in the financial statements reflects the effect on expected credit losses of a range of possible outcomes, calculated on a probability-weighted basis, based on a number of economic scenarios and including management overlays where required.
These scenarios are representative of our view of forecast economic conditions, sufficient to calculate unbiased ECL, and are designed to capture material non-linearities i. e. where the increase in credit losses if conditions deteriorate, exceeds the decrease in credit losses if conditions improve.
In the normal course of business, we use three scenarios.
These represent a most likely outcome, the Baseline scenario and two, less likely, Outer scenarios on either side of the Baseline scenario, referred to as an Upside and a Downside scenario respectively.
The Baseline scenario captures the most likely economic future: the downside scenario presents particular adverse economic conditions: and the upside scenario presents more favourable economic conditions.
Key scenario assumptions are set using data sourced from independent external economists.
This helps ensure that the IFRS 9 scenarios are unbiased and maximise the use of independent information.
The following assumptions, considered to be the key drivers of ECL, have been used for the scenarios applied: UK interest rates UK unemployment rates UK house price index HPI changes, year on year UK gross domestic product GDP changes, year on year Macroeconomic scenarios impact the ECL calculation through varying PDs and LGDs.
We use UK HPI to index collateral which has a direct impact on LGDs.
Other metrics are considered to have a direct impact on PDs and were selected following a search and data calibration exercise of possible drivers.
A list of around 15 potential drivers were initially considered, representing drivers which capture trends in the economy at large, and may indicate economic trends which will impact UK borrowers.
The list included variables which impact economic output, interest rates, inflation, stock prices, borrower income and the UK housing market.
An algorithm was then used to choose the subset of drivers which had the greatest significance and predictive fit to MetroBank data.
Each scenario was determined by flexing the baseline scenario, taking into account a number of factors in the global and UK economy such as commodity prices, global interest rates, UK investment spend and exchange rates, as well as the possible impact of recessionary conditions or financial shocks.
A large number of possible future paths is simulated.
The Downside scenario has been set to be worse than 90% of possible future outcomes: the Upside scenario has been set to be better than 90% of possible future outcomes.
These assumptions are considered sufficient to capture any material nonlinearities.
A simulation process was designed to determine the weighting to apply to each scenario based on the severity ofeach scenario and the range of possible scenarios for which that scenario was representative.
We recognise that applying the above three scenarios will not always be sufficient to determine an appropriate ECL in all economic environments.
A forth scenario has been included in the 31 December 2018 ECL, a Hard Brexit scenario, adding to the result derived using the three scenarios detailed above.
This additional scenario reflects managements judgement that the scenarios above do not fully reflect the high degree of uncertainty in estimating the current uncertainty in the UK economy ahead of the UKs departure from the European Union in 2019 Brexit.
The Hard Brexit scenario is more severe than the current downside scenario and is considered to be in keeping with some of the more severe outcomes published by UK government departments and industry bodies.
The Hard Brexit scenario is used as an add-on to the three business as usual scenarios.
The weightings applied to each scenario at 31 December 2018 are: Baseline 37% Upside and downside 28% each Hard Brexit 7% This weighting scheme is deemed as being appropriate for the computation of unbiased ECL.

We note that the scenarios applied comprise our best estimate of economic impacts on the ECL, and the actual outcome may be significantly different.
Investment securities and other financial assets Impairment provisions have been calculated based on our best estimate of expected credit losses on other assets classified and measured at amortised cost and fair value through other comprehensive income.
These include investment securities, cash held at banks and other financial assets.
Impairment provisions are not material.
Metro Bank Plc AnnuAl report And Accounts 2018 139 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 23. Credit risk continued Previous accounting policy 2017 comparative data is disclosed under IAS 39, with principal accounting policies outlined below.
Assets carried at amortised cost We assess at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset is impaired.
The impairment relating to loans and advances is calculated and assigned in accordance with the accounting standards for individual and collective impairment: Impairment of individual loans is designed to recognise specific risks identified following the occurrence of aloss event: for example, a commercial customer whose business has gone into administration.
If loans are considered to be at risk, an individual assessment will be performed.
For loans that are not considered to be individually impaired whether individually significant or not, a collective impairment assessment is performed.
Collective provisions are intended to reflect the estimated amount of losses incurred on a collective basis, but which have yet to be individually identified.
The lending exposure subject to collective impairment is assessed for each group of loans with similar credit risk characteristics.
Collective impairment models are based on analysis of historical arrears data and estimated loss rates, in order toderive the expected loss net of the recoverable value.
For the purposes of a collective evaluation of impairment, financial assets are grouped on the basis of the product risk profile: residential mortgage lending, commercial lending and consumer lending.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement.
When a loan is uncollectable, it is written off against the related allowance for loan impairment.
Such loans arewritten off after all the necessary procedures have been completed and the amount of the loss has been determined.
The maximum time a loan can remain in past due without being written off is 24 months.
Impairment charges relating to loans and advances to banks and customers are classified in credit impairment charges while impairment charges relating to investment securities held to maturity are classified in Net gains losses on investment securities.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed by adjusting the allowance account.
The amount of the reversal is recognised in the income statement.
Assets classified as available-for-sale We assess at each date of the balance sheet whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.
Impairment losses on available-for-sale assets are recognised by reclassifying the losses accumulated in the fair value reserve in equity to profit or loss.
The cumulative loss that is reclassified from equity to profit or loss is the difference between the acquisition cost, net of any principal repayment and amortisation, and the current fair value, less any impairment loss previously recognised in profit or loss.
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to us if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from our loans and advances to customers and other banks, and investment debt securities.
Givenour main income generating activity is lending money to customers, credit risk is one of our principal risks.
credit risk management Details of how we manage our credit risk can be found on pages 32 to 33. collateral The principal method by which we mitigate credit risk is through requesting collateral and guarantees against our retail mortgage andcommercial lending.
The principal collateral types for loans and advances are: Mortgages over residential properties: Charges over business assets such as premises, inventory and accounts receivable: charges over financial instruments such as debt securities and equities.
Longer-term finance and lending to corporate entities are generally secured: revolving individual credit facilities are generally unsecured.
In addition, in order to minimise credit loss, we will seek additional collateral from the counterparty as soon as a significantincrease in credit risk is identified for the relevant individual loans and advances.
140 Metro Bank Plc AnnuAl report And Accounts 2018 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 23. Credit risk continued Collateral held as security for financial assets other than loans and advances depends on the nature of the instrument.
Our investment securities are generally unsecured with the exception of asset-backed securities and similar instruments, which are secured by portfolios of financial instruments.
We prepare a valuation of the collateral obtained as part of the loan origination process.
This assessment is reviewed periodically for longer-term financing or when a significant increase in credit risk has been identified.
Our policies regarding obtaining collateral have not significantly changed during the reporting period and there has been no significant change in the overall quality of the collateral held by the Group.
Investment securities We invest in high-quality liquid debt instruments as required by our Securities Trading and Investment policy.

Metro Bank Plc AnnuAl report And Accounts 2018 143 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 23. Credit risk continued credit risk exposure We assess the credit quality of all financial instruments that are subject to credit risk.
The credit quality of financial instruments is a point in time assessment of the probability of default of financial instruments, whereas IFRS 9 Stages 1 and 2 are determined based on relative deterioration of credit quality since initial recognition.
We consider that the arrears status of customer lending is an appropriate method of assessing the credit quality of that lending.
The stage of customer lending is also influenced by other metrics as described in our accounting policy above.
The tables below set out the distribution of customer lending by credit quality and stage allocation.

Credit risk continued Write-off policy We write off financial assets either partially or fully when there is no realistic expectation of receiving further payment from the customer.
Indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include debt sale to a third party and ceasing enforcement activity.
We may write-off financial assets that are still subject to enforcement activity.
The outstanding contractual amounts of such assets written off during the year ended 31 December 2018 was 0.4 million.
Modification of financial assets We sometimes renegotiate the terms of loans provided to customers with a view to maximising recovery.
Restructuring activities include extended payment arrangements or the modification or deferral of payments.
Restructuring policies and practices are based on indicators or criteria which, in the judgement of management, indicate that payment will most likely continue.
These policies are kept under continuous review.
Restructuring is most commonly applied to term loans.
In the majority ofcases, restructuring results in the asset continuing to be credit-impaired.
During the year only an immaterial amount of loans weremodified and none of the modifications gave rise to a modification gain or loss.
2017 credit risk disclosures The disclosures below were included in our 2017 financial statements, however have no directly comparable equivalent this year owing to the adoption of IFRS 9.
These disclosures have therefore been shown separately rather than adjacent to the 2018 tables.
loan asset credit quality All loans and advances are categorised as either neither past due nor impaired, past due but not impaired, individually impaired orportfolio impaired.
For the purposes of the disclosures in the loan asset credit quality section below: A loan is considered past due when the borrower has failed to make a payment when due under the terms of the loan contract.
The impairment allowance includes allowances against financial assets that have been individually impaired and those subject tocollective impairment.
Loans neither past due nor impaired and loans that are past due but not impaired consist predominantly of commercial and retail loans that are performing and whilst not individually impaired, may be subject to a collective impairment allowance.
Impaired loans that are individually assessed consist predominantly of commercial loans that are past due and for which an individual allowance has been raised.
Portfolio impaired loans, which are not included in the categories above, are a subset of collectively impaired loans and consist predominantly of retail loans that are 90 days or more past due.

Maturity analysis for financial assets and financial liabilities The tables below set out the maturity structure of our financial assets and liabilities by their earliest possible contractual maturity date: this differs from the behavioural maturity characteristics in both normal and stressed conditions.
The behavioural maturity of customer deposits is much longer than their contractual maturity.
On a contractual basis these are repayable on demand or at short notice, however in reality are static in nature and provide long-term stable funding for our operations and liquidity.
Equally our Loans and advances to customers, specifically mortgages, are lent on longer contractual terms however are often redeemed or remortgaged earlier.

Liquidity risk continued Financial assets pledged as collateral We have pledged 5,768 million 2017: 4,478 million of assets as encumbered collateral which can be called upon in the event of default.
Of this, 1,762 million 2017: 2,419 million is made up of high-quality securities and 4,006 million 2017: 2,059 million is from our own loan portfolio prepositioned with the Bank of England to support some of the Term Funding Scheme TFS drawings.
5,412 million 2017: 4,358 million of this encumbered collateral is pledged to the Bank of England through the Banks participation in the TFS to support the 3,801 million 2017: 3,321million of cash drawn down.
The remaining 356 million 2017: 120 million is pledged with market participants in the form of repurchase agreements.
While we have drawn down borrowings from the Bank of Englands Term Funding Scheme TFS, our business model is primarily that of a deposit-led bank with more deposits than loans.
At the 31 December 2018 our loan-to-deposit ratio was 91% 31 December 2017: 82% in line with our long term target.
The closure of the TFS drawdown window in 2018 will not adversely affect us from the perspective of obtaining future funding.
We anticipate refinancing our TFS drawings through future deposit growth.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as interest rates will affect our income or the value of our holdings of financial instruments.
Market risk management Details of how we manage our market risk can be found on page 36.
Interest rate risk We are exposed to movements in interest rates arising from the mismatch between the dates on which interest receivable on financial assets and interest payable on financial liabilities are next reset to market rates.
We manage this risk within a risk appetite framework that is set and approved by the Board.
Limits are set for the economic value of equity EVE and net interest income NII.
EVE shall not drop more than 20 million based on the worse of a 200bps or -200bps instantaneous symmetrical parallel shock to interest rates, and one-year NII shall not drop more than 15 million based on the same shock.
The EVE limits are monitored daily by risk, whilst NII limits are monitored weekly.
Performance against limits are reported monthly to the ALCO with exceptions communicated by email and more regularly to senior management, as well as being noted by the Risk Oversight Committee and the Board.
Furthermore, a 15 million limit is set for a set of asymmetrical movements between LIBOR and the Bank of England Base Rate.
Our Treasury Risk function runs a series of other interest rate risk simulations on a monthly basis to ensure that the ALCO is kept updated of any other risks not captured by the policy measures.
While we occasionally enter into hedging arrangements the impact of these arrangements is immaterial.

The converse is true for a negative interest rate sensitivity gap.

Financial commitments Accounting policy To meet the financial needs of our customers, we enter into various irrevocable commitments.
These generally consist of financial guarantees, letters of credit and other undrawn commitments to lend.
Even though these obligations are not recognised on the balance sheet, they do contain credit risk and an ECL is calculated and recognised for them see note 23.
When these commitments are drawn down or called upon, and meet the recognition criteria as detailed in note 9, these are recognised within our loans and advances to customers.
At 31 December 2018, we had undrawn loan facilities granted to retail and commercial customers of 883 million 2017: 688 million.
In addition, as part of our retail and commercial operations, we had commitments of 242 million 2017: 138 million in respect of credit card and overdraft facilities.
These commitments represent agreements to lend in the future, subject to certain conditions.
Suchcommitments are cancellable, subject to notice requirements, and given their nature are not expected to be drawn down to thefull level of exposure.
Fair value of financial instruments Accounting policy Determination of fair value Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which we have access at that date.
The fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance risk.
In order to show how fair values have been derived, financial instruments are classified based on a hierarchy of valuation techniques, as summarised below: Level 1 financial instruments Those where the inputs used in the valuation are unadjusted quoted prices from active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have access to at the measurement date.
We consider markets as active only if there are sufficient trading activities with regards to the volume and liquidity of the identical assets or liabilities and when there are binding and exercisable price quotes available on the balance sheet date.
Level 2 financial instruments Those where the inputs that are used for valuation and are significant, are derived from directly or indirectly observable market data available over the entire period of the instruments life.
Suchinputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical instruments in inactive markets and observable inputs other than quoted prices such as interest rates and yield curves, implied volatilities, and credit spreads.
In addition, adjustments may be required for the condition or location of the asset or the extent to which it relates to items that are comparable to the valued instrument.
However, if such adjustments are based on unobservable inputs which are significant to the entire measurement, we will classify the instruments as Level 3.
Level 3 financial instruments Those that include one or more unobservable input that is significant to the measurement as whole.

Information on how fair values are calculated for the financial assets and liabilities noted above are explained below: cash and balances with the Bank of england loans and advances to banks Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the balance sheet date.
Fair values approximate carrying amounts as their balances are generally short-dated.
loans and advances to customers Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the balance sheet date, adjusted for future credit losses and prepayments, if considered material.
Investment securities The fair value of investment securities is based on either observed market prices for those securities that have an active trading market fair value Level 1 assets, or using observable inputs in the case of fair value Level 2 assets.
Deposits from customers Fair values are estimated using discounted cash flows, applying current rates offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities.
The fair value of a deposit repayable on demand is approximated by its carrying value.
Debt securities Fair values are determined using the quoted market price at the balance sheet date.
Deposits from central banks repurchase agreements Fair values are estimated using discounted cash flows, applying current rates.

InterArch, a firm which is owned by Shirley Hill, thewife of Vernon W. Hill, II, the Chairman.
In order to ensure that the terms of the InterArch arrangements are consistent with those that could be obtained from an independent third party, and in accordance with the Articles, the contractual arrangements with InterArch are subject to an annual review by our Audit Committee using benchmarking reviews conducted by independent third parties.
For the architectural design contract, which covers the build and design of our stores, a big four professional services firms carries out the benchmarking review.
The creative and brand services contract which covers branding, marketing and advertising services is reviewed by the largest independent global marketing audit firm.
For 2018, having reviewed the output from the independent audit of each contract, the Audit Committee has concluded that the contracts for services with InterArch are at arms length and are at least as beneficial as those which could be obtained in the market from an alternative supplier.
In order to expand the suppliers used, the management intends to run a competitive tender in 2019 to identify an additional alternative supplier of architecture services.
Further details of the review conducted by the Audit Committee can be found on page 71. architectural design services InterArch provide various architectural design services, including pre-design, architectural design, interior design, construction management, landscape architectural, signage, security design and layout and procurement services.
The fee structure for each project is based on a fixed percentage of final construction costs.
Certain additional services are provided on an hourly basis.
The contract for architectural design services has recently been renegotiated.
As part of the renegotiation, any recommendations of the independent audit have been picked up and included in the contract.
creative and brand services InterArch also provide branding, marketing and advertising services.
The contract for creative and brand services has recently been renegotiated.
For 2019, both the architectural design services and creative and brand services contracts have been aligned to be effective from 28 February 2019, for one year.

Capital management Capital is held to protect our depositors, cover our inherent risks, provide a cushion for stress events and to support our business strategy.
In assessing the adequacy of our capital resources, we consider our business plan, risk appetite, the material risks to which we are exposed and the appropriate strategies required to manage those risks.
We prepare an annual Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process document that sets out how we identify and manage the key risks to which we are exposed and details our capital requirements, capital resources and capital adequacy over the planning period, including under stress scenarios.
This process is used to ensure that we apply appropriate management buffers to regulatory capital requirements in line with risk appetite.
In order to appropriately monitor and manage the Banks capital resources, we produce regular reports on the current and forecasted level of capital for the Board and the Executive Leadership Team chaired by the Chief Executive Officer.
The key assumptions and risk drivers used to create the stress tests are regularly monitored and reported, and are used in determining how we will evolve our capital resources and ensure they are appropriate for growth.
We manage capital in accordance with prudential rules issued by the PRA and FCA, in line with the EU Capital Requirements Directive.
In June 2013 the European Parliament approved new capital reforms referred to as CRD IV, which implements Basel III in Europe.
CRD IV legislation has been effective from 1 January 2014.
We are committed to maintaining a strong capital base under both existing and future regulatory requirements.
The strength of our capital base is dependent upon the size of our capital relative to Risk Weighted Assets.
In January 2019, we announced that we had adjusted the risk weighting of certain commercial loans secured on commercial property and certain specialist buy-to-let loans that had the combined effect of increasing our RWAs by 900 million.
Whilst the risk weightings have been adjusted, there is no deterioration in the credit quality of the affected assets.
We are learning the lessons from this and will continue to improve our systems and controls around capital and risk-weighted assets.
