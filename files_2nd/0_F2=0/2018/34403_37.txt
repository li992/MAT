Goodwill Goodwill recognised in a business combination does not generate cash flows independently of other assets or groups of assets.
As a result, the recoverable amount, being the value in use, is determined at a cash generating unit CGU level.
How do we determine our CGUs?
The determination of our CGUs is judgemental.
The identification of CGUs involves an assessment of whether the asset or group of assets generate largely independent cash inflows.
This involves consideration of how our core assets are operated and whether these generate independent revenue streams.
Our CGUs are deemed to be BT Consumer, EE, Business and Public Sector, Global Services and Wholesale and Ventures which are the same units we report in our segmental reporting.
For impairment purposes goodwill is tested at the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, and cannot be larger than our operating segments.
We test goodwill at the CGU level.
What critical estimates and assumptions have we made?
In 2016 17 we re-allocated goodwill among our CGUs based on the relative fair value of the business transferred to reflect our new customer-facing units structure effective as of 1 April 2016.
We estimated the relative fair values on a discounted cash flow basis using the three-year financial plans effective at the time of the re-organisation.
The assumptions used were set in the same way as those used in our value in use calculations as set out below.
Our value in use calculations require estimates in relation to uncertain items, including managements expectations of future revenue growth, operating costs, profit margins, operating cash flows, and the discount rate for each CGU.

Expectations about future growth reflect the expectations of growth in the markets to which the CGU relates.
The future cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money.
The discount rate used in each CGU is adjusted for the risk specific to the asset, including the countries in which cash flow will be generated, for which the future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted.
The group is required to test goodwill acquired in a business combination annually for impairment.
This was carried out as at 31 January 2018.
The carrying value of goodwill and the key assumptions used in performing the annual impairment assessment and sensitivities are disclosed below.
How have we carried out our goodwill impairment review?
We perform an annual goodwill impairment review, based on our CGUs.
These CGUs represent the smallest identifiable groups of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other groups of assets, and to which goodwill is allocated.
From 1 April 2016, we re-organised our customer-facing units resulting in the change of the CGUs that have associated goodwill.
We allocated goodwill to BT Consumer, EE, Business and Public Sector, Global Services and Wholesale and Ventures.
Previously no goodwill was allocated to Wholesale and Ventures.
In addition to goodwill being allocated to this CGU for the first time, there were changes to the amount allocated to the other CGUs as a result of the re-organisation.
Goodwill is allocated to these CGUs as follows: Business BT and Public Global Wholesale Consumer EE Sector Services and Ventures Total Cost m m m m m m At 1 April 2016 1,183 4,917 662 1,153 7,915 Re-organisation 2,149 1,921 709 937 Exchange differences 10 135 145 Acquisitions and disposals 23 5 18 At 31 March 2017 1,183 2,768 2,570 579 942 8,042 Exchange differences 8 92 100 Acquisitions and disposals 11 11 At 31 March 2018 1,183 2,768 2,562 498 942 7,953 How do we calculate the recoverable amount?
The value in use of each CGU is determined using cash flow projections derived from financial plans approved by the BT Group plc Board covering a five-year period.
They reflect managements expectations of revenue, EBITDA growth, capital expenditure, working capital and operating cash flows, based on past experience and future expectations of business performance.
Cash flows beyond the fifth year have been extrapolated using perpetuity growth rates.
What discount rate have we used?
The pre-tax discount rates applied to the cash flow forecasts are derived from our post-tax weighted average cost of capital.
The assumptions used in the calculation of the groups weighted average cost of capital are benchmarked to externally available data.
The pre-tax discount rate used in performing the value in use calculation in 2017 18 was 8.4% 2016 17: 8.6%.
Weve used the same discount rate for all CGUs except Global Services where we have used 8.8% 2016 17: 9.0% reflecting higher risk in some of the countries in which Global Services operates.
What growth rates have we used?
The perpetuity growth rates are determined based on the forecast market growth rates of the regions in which the CGU operates, and they reflect an assessment of the long-term growth prospects of that market.
The growth rates have been benchmarked against external data for the relevant markets.
None of the growth rates applied exceed the expected long-term average growth rates for those markets or sectors.
The perpetuity growth rate for Global Services was 2.3% 2016 17: 2.4% and 2.0% 2016 17: 2.0% for Business and Public Sector, BT Consumer, EE and Wholesale and Ventures.
What sensitivities have we applied?
There is significant headroom in Business and Public Sector, BT Consumer, Wholesale and Ventures and EE.
No reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions in isolation would cause the carrying amount of the CGUs to exceed the recoverable amount.
For Global Services, the value in use exceeds the carrying value of the CGU by approximately 768m 2016 17: 586m.
Any of the following changes in assumptions in isolation would cause the recoverable amount for the CGU to equal its carrying amount: reduction in the perpetuity growth rate from the 2.3% assumption applied to a revised assumption of a decline of 1.4%.
an increase in the discount rate from the 8.8% assumption applied to a revised assumption of 11.5%.
shortfalls in trading performance against forecast resulting in operating cash flows decreasing by 34% each year and in perpetuity.
