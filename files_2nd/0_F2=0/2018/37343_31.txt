The Groups income statement is prepared using the equity accounting method for joint ventures and includes 100% of the results of the Groups non-wholly owned subsidiaries.
In contrast, the segmental information note is prepared on a proportionately consolidated basis and excludes the non-wholly owned share of the Groups subsidiaries.
This is consistent with the financial information reviewed by management.

EPRA adjusted earnings and EPRA adjusted earnings per share include the amortisation of bond exchange fide-recognition adjustment of 19m.
EPRA adjusted net assets and adjusted diluted net assets per share include the bond exchange fide-recognition adjustment of 106m.
Our NIY and Topped-up NIY relate to the Combined Portfolio, excluding properties in the development programme that have not yet reached practical completion, and are calculated by our external valuer.
EPRA NIY and EPRA Topped-up NIY calculations are consistent with ours, but exclude all developments.
Topped-up NIY reflects an adjustment of 61m and 59m for rent free periods and other incentives for the Landsec measure and EPRA measure, respectively.
Our measure reflects voids in our like-for-like portfolio only.
The EPRA measure reflects voids in the Combined Portfolio excluding only the development programme.
The EPRA cost ratio is calculated based on gross rental income after rents payable and excluding costs recovered through rents but not separately invoiced, whereas our measure is based on gross rental income before rents payable and excluding costs recovered through rents but not separately invoiced.
We do not calculate a cost ratio excluding direct vacancy costs as we do not consider this to be helpful.
