139 Company Overview Strategic report Governance FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3 NON-STATUTORY PROFIT MEASURES Headline profit measures The Company seeks to present a measure of performance which is not impacted by material non-recurring items or items considered nonoperational in nature.
This measure of profit is described as headline and is used by management to measure and monitor performance.
See the disclosures on presentation of results in accounting policies for an explanation of the adjustments.
The items excluded from 'headline' are referred to as non-headline items.
Non-headline operating profit items The non-headline items included in statutory operating profit are as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 July 2018 31 July 2017 Notes m m Morpho Detection integration and fair value adjustment unwind Integration programme costs 19 4 Unwind of fair value uplift of inventory on the acquisition balance sheet 2 3 Non-headline litigation provision movements Net release of provision held against Titeflex Corporation subrogation claims 22 2 4 Provision for John Crane, Inc. asbestos litigation 22 10 15 Cost recovery for John Crane, Inc. asbestos litigation 6 Legacy pension scheme arrangements Administration costs for post-retirement benefit schemes 8 7 Settlement gain losses on post-retirement benefit schemes 8 4 2 Other items Restructuring programmes 33 Amortisation of acquisition related intangible assets 10 29 17 Acquisition costs and provision releases 3 19 Profit on disposal of businesses 28 7 175 Non-headline items in operating profit 50 85 Morpho Detection integration and fair value adjustment unwind Integration programmes comprise 19m FY2017: 4m in respect of the integration of the Morpho Detection acquisition into the existing Smiths Detection business.
This item includes site rationalisation costs, IT system harmonisation expenses, organisational change and severance costs.
This integration programme has been included as a non-headline item as it is non-operational in nature and non-recurring.
The impact of unwinding the business combination fair value adjustment on the inventory held on Morpho Detection's acquisition balance sheet is included in non-headline items as this charge is a result of acquisition accounting and does not relate to current trading activity.
Non-headline litigation provision movements The following litigation costs and recoveries have been treated as non-headline items because the provisions were treated as non-headline when originally recognised and the subrogation claims and litigation relate to products that the Group no longer sells in these markets: A provision release of 2m FY2017: 4m has been recognised by Titeflex Corporation in respect of changes to the estimated cost of future claims.
The release is principally related to a decrease in the expected number of claims.
See note 22 for further details: and The 10m FY2017: 15m charge in respect of John Crane, Inc. asbestos litigation is principally due to an increased provision for legal defence costs.
The costs recovered via insurer settlements in the current year were nil FY2017: 6m.
See note 22 for further details.
Legacy pension scheme arrangement A 4m settlement gain FY2017: 2m loss was recognised in the current year when US funded plan members opted to take lump sums in lieu of annuities.
This is included in non-headline as it relates to legacy pension liabilities.
See note 8 for further details.
Pension administration costs are included as headline items in the current year.
In the prior year 7m of pension administration costs were treated as non-headline.
Other items In the prior year 33m of costs for the Fuel for Growth restructuring programme were recognised as non-headline items.
No costs have been recognised in respect of this programme in the current year.
Acquisition related intangible asset amortisation costs of 29m FY2017: 17m were recognised in the current year.
This is considered to be a non-headline item on the basis that these charges result from acquisition accounting and do not relate to current trading activity.
Acquisition costs and provision releases comprise 3m FY2017: 19m of directly linked incremental transaction costs.
These costs do not include the cost of employees working on transactions and are reported as non-headline because they are dependent on the level of acquisition activity in the year.
The profit on disposal of businesses of 7m FY2017: 175m principally relates to the sale of John Crane Bearings.
See note 28 for further details.
It is considered to be a non-headline item since the proceeds and cash impact are material and non-recurring.
140 SMITHS GROUP PLC Annual Report 2018 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 3 NON-STATUTORY PROFIT MEASURES CONTINUED Headline profit measures continued Non-headline finance costs items The non-headline items included in finance costs are as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 July 2018 31 July 2017 Notes m m Unwind of discount on provisions 22 7 6 Other financing losses 2 8 Other finance income retirement benefits 8 7 2 Non-headline items in finance costs 2 12 Non-headline loss profit before taxation 52 73 The unwind of discount on provisions has been excluded from headline finance costs because these provisions were originally recognised as non-headline and this treatment has been maintained for ongoing costs and credits.
Other financing gains and losses represent the potentially volatile gains and losses on derivatives, loans inside the group and other financial instruments which are not hedge accounted under IAS 39.
They have been excluded from headline finance costs because they do not accurately reflect the aggregate risks of the group, since offsetting gains have been recognised in reserves or deferred in assets and liabilities which are not held at fair value.
Other finance income comprises financing credits relating to retirement benefits.
These are excluded from headline finance costs because the ongoing costs and credits are a legacy of previous employee pension arrangements.
Non-headline taxation items A non-headline tax charge of 30m FY2017: 111m credit has been taken in the year.
See note 6 for further details.

141 Company Overview Strategic report Governance FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 5 EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders of the Parent Company by the average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.

For the year ended 31 July 2018, zero options FY2017: zero were excluded from this calculation because their effect was anti-dilutive for continuing operations.
A reconciliation of basic and headline earnings per share continuing is as follows: Year ended 31 July 2018 Year ended 31 July 2017 EPS EPS m p m p Profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Parent Company 277 70.0 570 144.1 Exclude: Non-headline items and related tax note 3 82 20.7 184 46.5 Headline profit attributable to equity shareholders for the year 359 90.7 386 97.6 Statutory earnings per share diluted p 69.1 142.3 Headline earnings per share diluted p 89.5 96.3 6 TAXATION This note only provides information about corporate income taxes under IFRS.
Smiths companies operate in over 50 countries across the world.
They pay and collect many different taxes in addition to corporate income taxes including: payroll taxes: value added and sales taxes: property taxes: product-specific taxes and environmental taxes.
The costs associated with these other taxes are included in profit before tax.
Year ended Year ended 31 July 2018 31 July 2017 m m The taxation charge in the consolidated income statement for the year comprises: Continuing operations current income tax charge 109 58 current tax adjustments in respect of prior periods 6 3 Current taxation 115 61 deferred taxation 41 32 Total taxation expense continuing operations 156 29 Discontinued operations current income tax credit 9 deferred taxation 6 Total taxation expense in the consolidated income statement 156 26 Year ended Year ended 31 July 2018 31 July 2017 m m Tax on items charged credited to equity Deferred tax charge credit : retirement benefit schemes 18 13 cash-flow hedge accounting 1 1 share options 1 3 18 11 Of the 18m charge to equity for retirement benefits, a 17m charge relates to UK retirement schemes and 1m to US pension schemes.
142 SMITHS GROUP PLC Annual Report 2018 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 6 TAXATION CONTINUED Reconciliation of the tax charge The tax expense on the profit for the year for continuing operations is different from the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 19.0% FY2017: 19.7%.
The difference is reconciled as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 July 2018 31 July 2017 m m Profit before taxation 435 602 Notional taxation expense at UK rate of 19.0% FY2017: 19.7% 83 118 Different tax rates on non-UK profits and losses 33 55 Non-deductible expenses 9 14 Tax credits and non-taxable income 13 15 Non-headline recognition of UK deferred tax 69 Other adjustments to unrecognised deferred tax 1 23 Non-headline impact of US tax reform deferred tax revaluation 34 Non-headline impact of US tax reform deemed repatriation tax 18 Current and deferred benefits from closed financing arrangement 19 Effect of non-taxable profits on business disposals 1 35 Prior year true-up 6 3 Tax on discontinued activities 3 156 26 Comprising: taxation on headline profit 126 140 tax on non-headline loss 22 27 non-headline impact of US tax reform 52 change in deferred tax recognition treated as non-headline 84 taxation on discontinued operation 3 Taxation expense in the consolidated income statement 156 26 The head office of Smiths Group is domiciled in the UK so the tax charge has been reconciled to UK tax rates.
US Tax Reform The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act the Act enacted on 22 December 2017 reduced the US Federal tax rate from 35% to 21% from 1 January 2018.
This revised rate has been used to revalue net deferred tax assets in the United States, leading to a charge to the income statement of 34m.
In addition there is a one-time deemed repatriation tax charge of 18m related to unremitted foreign earnings.
Current taxation Current tax m At 31 July 2016 10 Foreign exchange gains and losses 2 Charge to income statement continuing 61 Credit to income statement discontinued 9 Business combinations 1 Business disposals 4 Tax paid 82 At 31 July 2017 17 Foreign exchange gains and losses 1 Charge to income statement 115 Tax paid 65 At 31 July 2018 34 Current tax receivable 38 Current tax payable 72 At 31 July 2018 34 Provisions included in current tax liabilities are established based on reasonable estimates of the possible consequences of tax authority audits in the various countries in which the Group operates.
Management judgement is used to determine the amount of such provisions based on an understanding of the relevant local tax law, taking into account the differences of interpretation that can arise on a wide variety of issues, depending on the prevailing circumstances, including the nature of current tax audits and the experience of previous enquiries.
143 Company Overview Strategic report Governance FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Deferred taxation Property, plant and equipment and Losses intangible Employment carried assets benefits forward Provisions Other Total m m m m m m At 31 July 2016 145 8 87 140 61 151 Reallocation 4 4 Charge credit to income statement continuing 11 9 43 7 6 32 Charge credit to income statement discontinued 6 6 Charge to equity 10 1 11 Business combinations 6 2 4 Business disposals 3 3 Exchange adjustments 1 1 1 1 2 At 31 July 2017 148 10 129 138 52 161 Deferred tax assets 4 10 127 133 26 272 Deferred tax liabilities 144 2 5 26 111 At 31 July 2017 148 10 129 138 52 161 Reallocation 2 2 Charge credit to income statement continuing 60 21 7 55 18 41 Charge credit to income statement discontinued 2 1 1 Charge to equity 18 18 Business combinations 1 1 Exchange adjustments 1 1 1 1 At 31 July 2018 84 50 121 84 32 103 Deferred tax assets 3 56 120 80 33 180 Deferred tax liabilities 87 6 1 4 1 77 At 31 July 2018 84 50 121 84 32 103 The deferred tax asset relating to losses has been recognised on the basis that evidence demonstrates a consistent pattern of improving results and the Group has implemented plans to support continuing improvements, or the losses relate to specific, identified non-recurring events.
The closing net deferred tax asset balance related to UK activities and included in the balance at 31 July 2018 amounted to 41m.
The net deferred tax asset has reduced significantly from previous year.
This is mainly due to the two following items: US Tax reform, resulting in a 34m reduction in net US deferred tax assets Increase in the deferred tax liability of 30m related to an increase in the UK retirement benefits surplus Deferred tax on provisions includes 48m FY2017:79m relating to John Crane, Inc. litigation provision, and 19m FY2017: 33m relating to Titeflex Corporation.
See note 22 for additional information on provisions.
Included in other deferred tax balances above are deferred tax assets related to inventory of 8m FY2017: 14m, deferred revenue of 9m FY2017: 14m and rebate reserve of 6m FY2017: 9m.
Unrecognised Deferred Tax The Group has unrecognised deferred tax relating to non-UK losses amounting to 73m FY2017:67m.
The expiry date of operating losses carried forward is dependent upon the law of the various territories in which the losses arise.
A summary of expiry dates for losses in respect of which deferred tax has not been recognised is set out below: 2018 Expiry of 2017 Expiry of m losses m losses Restricted losses Asia 16 2019-2025 12 2018-2024 Unrestricted losses operating losses 57 No expiry 55 No expiry Total losses 73 67 144 SMITHS GROUP PLC Annual Report 2018 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 6 TAXATION CONTINUED Franked Investment Income Group Litigation Order FII GLO Smiths Group is one of the companies enrolled in the FII GLO litigation against HMRC.
The court actions first filed in 2003 are nearing an end and some claimants with different fact patterns have received payments.
There are further relevant legal actions that could impact Smiths recoveries that amount to around 22m computed on a simple interest basis and after deducting 45% withholding tax.
Claims related to the impact of the Foreign Income Dividends FID regime are included in the FII GLO litigation claims Smiths issued in 2009.
Under the final relevant ECJ decision, FID claims are now conclusively successful and accordingly Smiths Group made its claim in respect of FIDs and received 2.1m in August 2017.
This amount was calculated using simple interest and has been paid under deduction of withholding tax.
The Group has not recognised any impact to the financial statements in the current period or the prior year, due to the uncertainty of the eventual outcome, except for the amount received in the period in respect of FID.
EU Commission Investigation re Claims for Partial 75% Exemption for Profits from qualifying loan relationships The European Commission has opened a state aid investigation into the Group Financing Exemption in the UK controlled foreign company CFC rules.
The Group Financing Exemption was introduced in legislation by the UK government in 2013.
In common with other UK-based international companies whose arrangements were in line with current UK CFC legislation, Smiths Group may be affected by this investigation and is monitoring developments.
If the European Commissions investigation is upheld, the estimated maximum potential liability is approximately 14m.
Based on our current assessment, no provision is being made in respect of this issue.

The total expense recognised in the consolidated income statement in respect of all these plans was 34m FY2017: 33m.
Defined benefit and post-retirement healthcare plans The principal defined benefit pension plans are in the UK and in the US and these have been closed so that no future benefits are accrued.
For all schemes, pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries.
These valuations have been updated by independent qualified actuaries in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes as at 31 July 2018.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values.
Contributions to the schemes are made on the advice of the actuaries, in accordance with local funding requirements.

Scheme trustees need to obtain regular actuarial valuations to assess the scheme against this funding objective.
The trustees and sponsoring companies need to agree funding plans to improve the position of a scheme when it is below the acceptable funding level.
The UK Pensions Regulator has extensive powers to protect the benefits of members, promote good administration and reduce the risk of situations arising which may require compensation to be paid from the Pension Protection Fund.
These include imposing a schedule of contributions or the calculation of the technical provisions, where a trustee and company fail to agree appropriate calculations.
Smiths Industries Pension Scheme SIPS This scheme was closed to future accrual effective 1 November 2009.
SIPS provides index-linked pension benefits based on final earnings at date of closure.
SIPS is governed by a corporate trustee SI Pension Trustees Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Smiths Group plc.
The board of trustee directors currently comprises four company-nominated trustees and four member-nominated trustees, with an independent chairman selected by Smiths Group plc.
Trustee Directors are responsible for the management, administration, funding and investment strategy of the scheme.
The most recent actuarial valuation of this scheme has been performed using the Projected Unit Method as at 31 March 2017, and experience gains and losses identified during this valuation have been incorporated into the IAS 19 valuation.
Under the funding plan for SIPS agreed in 146 SMITHS GROUP PLC Annual Report 2018 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 8 POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS CONTINUED UK pension schemes continued June 2018 Smiths pays cash contributions of 1m a month until the Scheme reaches full funding on a 'gilts 0%' basis.
Under the governing documentation of the SIPS, any future surplus would be returnable to Smiths Group plc by refund, assuming gradual settlement of the liabilities over the lifetime of the scheme.
Subject to clarification of the legal position, SIPS expects to implement Guaranteed Minimum Pensions equalisation in respect of members contracted out of the State Earnings Related Pensions Scheme prior to 6 April 1997, once the government has completed its consultations and confirmed an approach.
It is not yet possible to reliably quantify the impact of this adjustment.
The duration of SIPS liabilities is around 23 years FY2017: 23 years for active deferred members, 22 years FY2017: 22 years for deferred members and 11 years FY2017: 11 years for pensioners and dependants.
On 31 August 2017, SIPS bought in a tranche of the scheme's pension population with Canada Life for a premium of 207m.
An actuarial loss of 26m was recognised as a result of this buy-in agreement.
TI Group Pension Scheme TIGPS This scheme was closed to future accrual effective 1 November 2009.
TIGPS provides index-linked pension benefits based on final earnings at the date of closure.
TIGPS is governed by a corporate trustee TI Pension Trustee Limited, an independent company.
The board of trustee directors comprises four company-nominated trustees and four member-nominated trustees, with an independent trustee director selected by the Trustee.
The Trustee is responsible for the management, administration, funding and investment strategy of the scheme.
The most recent actuarial valuation of this scheme has been performed using the Projected Unit Method as at 5 April 2017.
Under the funding plan for TIGPS agreed in June 2018, Smiths pays cash contributions of 1m a month until the Scheme is fully funded on a solvency basis.
Under the governing documentation of the TIGPS, any future surplus would be returnable to Smiths Group plc by refund, assuming gradual settlement of the liabilities over the lifetime of the scheme.
Subject to clarification of the legal position, TIGPS will implement Guaranteed Minimum Pensions equalisation in respect of members contracted out of the State Earnings Related Pensions Scheme prior to 6 April 1997, once the government has completed its consultations and confirmed an approach.
The duration of the TIGPS liabilities is around 24 years FY2017: 24 years for active deferred members, 22 years FY2017: 22 years for deferred members and ten years FY2017: 11 years for pensioners and dependants.
US pension plans The valuations of the principal US pension and post-retirement healthcare plans were performed using census data at 1 January 2018.
The pension plans were closed with effect from 30 April 2009 and benefits were calculated as at that date and are not revalued.
Governance of the US pension plans is managed by a Settlor Committee appointed by Smiths Group Services Corp, a wholly-owned subsidiary.
The duration of the liabilities for the largest US plan is around 19 years FY2017: 19 years for active deferred members, 19 years FY2017: 19 years for deferred members and 12 years FY2017: 12 years for pensioners and dependants.
On 26 December 2017, the US funded plans paid $36m to members who opted to take lump sums in lieu of annuities.
A settlement gain of 4m was recognised on this transaction see note 3.
Risk management The pensions schemes are exposed to risks that: investment returns are below expectations, leaving the scheme with insufficient assets in future to pay all its pension obligations: members and dependants live longer than expected, increasing the value of the pensions the scheme has to pay: inflation rates are higher than expected, causing amounts payable under index-linked pensions to be higher than expected: and increased contributions may be required to meet regulatory funding targets if lower interest rates increase the current value of liabilities.
These risks are managed separately for each pension scheme.
However Smiths has adopted a common approach of closing defined benefit schemes to cap members entitlements and supporting trustees in adopting investment strategies which aim to match assets to future obligations, after allowing for the funding position of the scheme.
TI Group Pension Scheme TIGPS TIGPS with a mature member profile, and a strong funding position, has been able to progress its matching strategy to the point where roughly 50% of liabilities are covered by matching annuities, eliminating investment return, longevity, inflation and funding risks.
Smiths Industries Pension Scheme SIPS The trustees of SIPS have adopted a leveraged liability matching strategy.
The scheme uses repurchase arrangements, total return swaps, inflation swaps and interest rate swaps to hedge the interest and inflation risks of the scheme liabilities.
Repurchase agreements exchange government bonds held by the scheme for cash with an obligation to buy back the asset at a fixed future date and price.
The cash is invested in liability matching assets, reducing funding risk.
A total return swap exchanges the return on a specified asset for example an index-linked bond and an interest payment fixed or floating.
Contracts are spread across a panel of banks.
To minimise the risk that counterparties fail to settle obligations, positions are collateralised.
At 31 July 2018, SIPS assets were net of 866m FY2017: 773m repurchase obligations, and included 12m gains FY2017: 4m gains on interest rate swaps, 3m gains FY2017: 8m gains on inflation swaps and 2m gain FY2017: 1m gain on total return assets.
The scheme was holding 67m FY2017: 1m in liquidity funds to meet potential future obligations to collateralise repurchase arrangements or swap agreements.
147 Company Overview Strategic report Governance FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The principal assumptions used in updating the valuations are set out below: 2018 2018 2018 2017 2017 2017 UK US Other UK US Other Rate of increase in salaries n a n a 3.1% n a n a 2.8% Rate of increase for active deferred members 4.1% n a n a 4.1% n a n a Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.2% n a 2.5% 3.2% n a 1.5% Rate of increase in deferred pensions 3.2% n a n a 3.2% n a 0.1% Discount rate 2.8% 4.15% 3.4% 2.6% 3.85% 2.6% Inflation rate 3.2% n a 3.3% 3.2% n a 2.2% Healthcare cost increases 4.7% n a n a 4.2% n a 1.8% The assumptions used in calculating the costs and obligations of the Groups defined benefit pension plans are set by Smiths after consultation with independent professionally qualified actuaries.
The assumptions used are estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily occur in practice.
For countries outside the UK and USA assumptions are disclosed as a weighted average.
Discount rate assumptions The UK schemes use a discount rate based on the yield on the iBOXX over 15-year AA-rated corporate bond index, adjusted if necessary to better reflect the shape of the yield curve considering the Aon Hewitt GBP Select AA curve.
For the USA, the discount rate is based on the Towers Watson cash-flow matching models and set with reference to Moodys Aa annualised yield, the Citigroup High Grade Index and the Merrill Lynch 15 years High Quality Index.
Mortality assumptions The mortality assumptions used in the principal UK schemes are based on the SAPS S2 All Birth year tables with relevant scaling factors based on the recent experience of the schemes.
The assumption allows for future improvements in life expectancy in line with the 2017 CMI projections, with a smoothing factor of 7.5, blended to a long-term rate of 1.25%.
The mortality assumptions used in the principal US schemes are based on the RP-2014 table adjusted backward to 2006 with MP-2014 and projected forward using MP-2017 as of 31 July 2017.
The table selected allows for future mortality improvements and applies an adjustment for job classification blue collar versus white collar.

The value of the scheme assets is affected by changes in mortality rates, inflation and discounting because they affect the carrying value of the insurance assets.
Asset valuation Liquidity funds, equities and bonds are valued using quoted market prices in active markets.
Exchange traded equity index futures are valued at market prices.
Total return, interest and inflation swaps are bilateral agreements between counterparties and do not have observable market prices.
These derivative contracts are valued using observable market inputs.
Insured liabilities comprise annuity policies matching the scheme obligation to identified groups of pensioners.
These assets are valued at the actuarial valuation of the corresponding liability, reflecting this matching relationship.
Property is valued by specialists applying recognised property valuation methods incorporating current market data on rental yields and transaction prices.

In addition, 7m FY2017: 6m was spent on providing benefits under unfunded defined benefit pension and post-retirement healthcare plans.
In 2019 the cash contributions to the Groups schemes are expected to total about 45m, including 12m to SIPS and 12m to TIGPS, with the balance relating mainly to the US scheme.
Group contributions in respect of the unfunded schemes and post-retirement healthcare are expected to be in line with 2018.
151 Company Overview Strategic report Governance FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 9 EMPLOYEE SHARE SCHEMES The Group operates share schemes and plans for the benefit of employees.
The nature of the principal schemes and plans, including general conditions, is set out below: Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP is a share plan under which an award over a capped number of shares will vest after the end of the three-year performance period if performance conditions are met.
LTIP awards are made to selected senior executives, including the executive directors.
Awards made prior to 2016 were made with different targets for corporate executives and divisional executives.
Since 2016 all LTIP awards have had one set of targets.
LTIP performance conditions Each performance condition has a threshold below which no shares vest and a maximum performance target at or above which the award vests in full.
For performance between threshold and maximum, awards vest on a straight-line sliding scale.
The performance conditions are assessed separately so performance on one condition does not affect the vesting of the other elements of the award.
To the extent that the performance targets are not met over the three-year performance period, awards will lapse.
There is no re-testing of the performance conditions.
Both Group and Divisional LTIP awards have performance conditions relating to underlying revenue growth, growth in headline EPS adjusted to exclude tax, ROCE and cash conversion.
Smiths Share Matching Plan SMP Under the scheme participants are required to invest between 25% and 50% of their post-tax bonus purchasing the Companys shares at the prevailing market price.
At the end of a three-year period, if the executive is still in office and provided the performance test is passed, matching shares will be awarded in respect of any invested shares retained for that period.
The number of matching shares to be awarded is determined by the Remuneration Committee at the end of the year in which the bonus is earned by reference to annual bonus, and other corporate financial criteria.
The maximum award will not exceed the value, before tax, of the bonus or salary invested in shares by the executive.
Vesting of matching shares will occur, and the matching shares will be released, at the end of the three-year period depending on the performance of the Group LTIP issued for the same performance period.
The first matching share is awarded if the Group LTIP vests under any performance condition.
No future awards will be made under the SMP.
Smiths Excellence Plan SEP In September 2016 the Smiths Excellence plan SEP was introduced.
The SEP is designed to reinforce value creation over the medium term by focusing on specific objectives in key areas of operational performance.
Awards vest after two years, depending on performance on the operational objectives during the first year and continued employment with the Group.
There is no retesting of performance.
However the Remuneration Committee has discretion to adjust vesting rates if material misstatements in reported performance are subsequently identified and awards are subject to clawback provisions in the event of misconduct.
Directors are not eligible to participate in the SEP.
Restricted stock The restricted stock is used by the Remuneration Committee, as a part of the recruitment strategy, to make awards in recognition of incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
If an award is considered appropriate, the award will take account of relevant factors including the fair value of awards forfeited, any performance conditions attached, the likelihood of those conditions being met and the proportion of the vesting period remaining.
The average closing share price over the financial year was 1,589.60p FY2017: 1,499.95p.
There has been no change to the effective option price of any of the outstanding options during the period.

The key assumptions used in the models for 2018 and 2017 are volatility of 25% to 20% FY2017: 25% to 20% and dividend yield of 3% FY2017: 3.50%, based on historical data, for the period corresponding with the vesting period of the option.
These generated a weighted average fair value for SEP of 14.87 FY2017: 12.86, LTIP of 13.48 FY2017: 12.68, and restricted stock of 12.73 FY2017: 12.59.
Included within staff costs is an expense arising from share-based payment transactions of 16m FY2017: 15m, of which 14m FY2017: 14m relates to equity-settled share-based payment.

Recoverable amount is determined by value in use or fair value less cost to sell calculations for each group of cash generating units CGU that goodwill is allocated to.
Value in use is calculated as the net present value of the projected risk-adjusted cash-flows of the CGU.
These forecast cash-flows are based on the 2018 budget, the five-year strategic plan approved by the Board and detailed divisional strategic projections, where these have been prepared and approved by the Board.
Fair value less cost to sell is calculated using available information on past and expected future profitability, valuation multiples for comparable quoted companies and similar transactions adjusted as required for significant differences and information on costs of similar transactions.
Fair value less costs to sell models are used when trading projections in the strategic plan cannot be adjusted to eliminate the impact of a major restructuring.
Goodwill is allocated by division as follows: 2018 2017 2018 Number of 2017 Number of m CGUs m CGUs John Crane 133 1 111 1 Smiths Medical 563 1 561 1 Smiths Detection 642 1 629 2 Smiths Interconnect 243 2 242 2 Flex-Tek 35 2 27 2 1,616 7 1,570 8 Smiths Detections acquired Morpho Detection in April 2017 and a single management team was in place covering Smiths Detection and Morpho Detection.
As discussed and anticipated in the 2017 Annual Report, the integration of the two businesses during the current year has been such that they are now considered to be a single CGU for impairment testing.
154 SMITHS GROUP PLC Annual Report 2018 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 11 IMPAIRMENT TESTING CONTINUED Goodwill continued Impairment testing assumptions John Crane and Smiths Medical have strong aftermarket and consumables businesses, with consistent sales trends.
Smiths Detection and Smiths Interconnect have greater sales and margin volatility due to lower levels of recurring revenue and involvement in government-funded programmes, particularly defence, and customer-led technology innovation.
The key assumptions used in value in use calculations are: Sales: projected sales are built up with reference to markets and product categories.
They incorporate past performance, historical growth rates and projections of developments in key markets: Margins: projected margins reflect historical performance and the impact of all completed projects to improve operational efficiency and leverage scale.
The projections do not include the impact of future restructuring projects to which the Group is not yet committed: Discount rate: the discount rates have been calculated based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital and risks specific to the CGU being tested.
The discount rates disclosed incorporate risk adjustments where the projected sales and margins are affected by significant delivery risks.
Pre-tax rates of 12.0% to 14.9% FY2017: 12.2% to 16.9% have been used for the impairment testing: and Long-term growth rates: as required by IAS 36, growth rates for the period after the detailed forecasts are based on the long-term GDP projections of the primary market for the CGU.
The average growth rate used in the testing was 2.0% FY2017: 2.1%.
These rates do not reflect the long-term assumptions used by the Group for investment planning.
The assumptions used in the impairment testing of CGUs with significant goodwill balances are as follows: Year ended 31 July 2018 John Crane Smiths Medical Smiths Detection Smiths Interconnect Microwave Connectors and Subsystems Components Net book value of goodwill m 133 563 642 75 168 Basis of valuation Value in use Value in use Value in use Value in use Value in use Discount rate 14.0% 12.0% 13.5% 12.4% 14.9% Period covered by management projections 5 years 5 years 5 years 5 years 5 years Long-term growth rates 2.2% 1.9% 1.8% 2.0% 2.0% The discount rate for Smiths Interconnect Connectors and Components includes a risk adjustment.
The remaining balance of the goodwill represents smaller individual amounts which have been allocated to smaller CGUs.
Year ended 31 July 2017 John Crane Smith Medical Smiths Detection Smiths Interconnect Original Smiths Morpho Microwave Connectors and Detection Detection Subsystems Components Net book value of goodwill m 111 561 429 200 75 167 Fair value less Basis of valuation Value in use Value in use Value in use costs to sell Value in use Value in use Discount rate 14.9% 12.2% 14.1% n a 12.2% 16.9% Period covered by management projections 5 years 5 years 5 years 1 year 5 years 5 years Long-term growth rates 2.2% 2.1% 2.0% n a 2.2% 2.1% Sensitivity analysis Smiths Interconnect Microwave Subsystems business Microwave Subsystems' value in use exceeds its carrying value by 11m.
Sensitivity analysis performed around the base case assumptions has indicated that for Microwave Subsystems, the following changes in assumptions in isolation, would cause the value in use to fall below the carrying value: Year ended 31 July 2018 Year ended 31 July 2017 Change required Change required to trigger impairment to trigger impairment Forecast earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation -11.3% -33.3% Discount rate 8.2% 26.5% Forecast earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation have been projected using: expected future sales based on the strategic plan, which was constructed at a market level with input from key account managers, product line managers, business development and sales teams.
An assessment of the market and existing contracts programmes was made to produce the sales forecast: and current cost structure and production capacity.
The projections do not include the impact of future restructuring projects to which the Group is not yet committed.
155 Company Overview Strategic report Governance FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Other CGUs For the other CGUs, sensitivity analysis performed around the base case assumptions has indicated that no reasonable changes in key assumptions would cause the carrying amount of any of the CGUs to exceed their respective recoverable amounts.
Goodwill impairment No impairment charges have been incurred FY2017: nil.
Revised CGU structure for year ended 31 July 2019 Impairment testing Following a re-organisation and rationalisation of management and reporting structures within the Interconnect and Flex-Tek divisions, the CGU structures used for the testing of goodwill has been reassessed.
Given the commonality of reporting, policies, leadership and intradivisional trading relationships, it is considered that the Interconnect and Flex-Tek divisions are now single CGUs for impairment testing.
Impairment testing and sensitivity analysis has been undertaken for the revised Interconnect CGU and Flex-Tek CGU structures, which have indicated that no reasonable change in key assumptions would cause an impairment of goodwill in either CGU.
The assumptions used in this impairment testing were as follows: Interconnect: Discount rate: 14.9%: Period covered by management projections 5 years: Long-term growth rates 2.0% Flex-Tek: Discount rate: 12.1%: Period covered by management projections 5 years: Long-term growth rates 2.2% Other intangible assets The Group has no indefinite life intangible assets other than goodwill.
During the year impairment tests were carried out for development projects which have not yet started to be amortised and acquired intangibles where there were indications of impairment.
Value in use calculations were used to determine the recoverable values of these assets.
No impairment charges have been incurred FY2017: nil.

The Group also has cash received of 87m FY2017: 78m deferred in trade and other payables relating to Smiths Detection contracts.
Trade receivables do not carry interest.
Management considers that the carrying value of trade and other receivables approximates to the fair value.
Trade and other receivables, including prepayments, accrued income and other receivables qualifying as financial instruments are classified as loans and receivables.
The maximum credit exposure arising from these financial assets is 688m FY2017: 720m.
Trade receivables are disclosed net of provisions for bad and doubtful debts.
The provisions for bad and doubtful debts are based on specific risk assessment and reference to past default experience.
Credit risk is managed separately for each customer and, where appropriate, a credit limit is set for the customer based on previous experience of the customer and third party credit ratings.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.
The largest single customer is the US Federal Government, representing less than 5% FY2017: less than 5% of Group revenue.

The cash pooling agreements incorporate a legally enforceable right of net settlement.
However, as there is no intention to settle the balances net, these arrangements do not qualify for net presentation.
At 31 July 2018 the total value of overdrafts on accounts in interest compensation cash pooling systems was nil FY2017: nil.
The balances held in zero balancing cash pooling arrangements have daily settlement of balances, therefore netting is not relevant.

18 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Groups international operations and debt financing expose it to financial risks which include the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in debt market prices, interest rates, credit risks and liquidity risks.
The management of operational credit risk is discussed in note 14.
Treasury Risk Management Policy The Board maintains a Treasury Risk Management Policy, which governs the treasury operations of the Group and its subsidiary companies and the consolidated financial risk profile to be maintained.
A report on treasury activities, financial metrics and compliance with the Policy is prepared monthly.
This is circulated to the Chief Financial Officer each month and to the Audit Committee on a semi-annual basis.
The Policy maintains a treasury control framework within which counterparty risk, financing and debt strategy, cash and liquidity, interest rate risk and currency translation management are reserved for Group Treasury, while currency transaction management is devolved to operating divisions.
Centrally directed cash management systems exist globally to manage overall liquid resources efficiently across the divisions.
The Group uses financial instruments to raise financing for its global operations, to manage related interest rate and currency financial risk and to hedge transaction risk within subsidiary companies.
The Group does not speculate in financial instruments.
All financial instruments hedge existing business exposures and all are recognised on the balance sheet.
The Policy defines four treasury risk components and for each component a set of financial metrics to be measured and reported monthly compared against pre-agreed objectives.
159 Company Overview Strategic report Governance FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Credit quality The Groups strategy is to maintain a solid investment-grade rating to ensure access to the widest possible sources of financing at the right time and to minimise the resulting cost of debt capital.
The credit ratings at the end of July 2018 were BBB Baa2 both stable from Standard & Poors and Moodys respectively.
An essential element of an investment-grade rating is consistent and robust cash-flow metrics.
The Groups objective is to maintain a net debt headline EBITDA ratio at two times or lower over the medium term.
Capital management is discussed in more detail in note 25.
Debt and interest rate The Groups risk management objectives are to ensure that over time funding drawn from the bank market is less than 30% of net debt, the average maturity profile of gross debt is at or greater than four years and over 55% of gross debt is at fixed rates.
The Group remains in full compliance with all covenants within its external debt agreements.
Interest rate risk management is discussed in note 18 b.
Liquidity management The Groups objective is to ensure that at any time undrawn committed facilities, net of short-term overdraft financing, are greater than 200m and that committed facilities have at least 18 months to run until maturity.
Liquidity risk management is discussed in note 18 d. The Group aims to ensure that cash resources are placed on deposit with highly-rated relationship bank counterparties at short-notice availability.
Financial credit risk management is discussed in note 18 c. Currency management The Group is an international business with the majority of its net assets denominated in foreign currency.
We protect our balance sheet and reserves from adverse foreign exchange movements by financing our foreign currency assets where appropriate in the same currency and targets that, where the value of net asset exposure is over 30m equivalent, over 50% of those assets are matched with the same currency liability.
The Groups objective for managing transaction currency exposure is to reduce medium-term volatility to cash-flow, margins and earnings.
Foreign exchange risk management is discussed in note 18 a below.
a Foreign exchange risk Transactional currency exposure The Group is exposed to foreign currency risks arising from sales or purchases by businesses in currencies other than their functional currency.
It is Group policy that, when the net foreign exchange exposure to known future sales and purchases is material, this exposure is hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts.
The net exposure is calculated by adjusting the expected cash-flow for payments or receipts in the same currency linked to the sale or purchase.
This policy minimises the risk that the profits generated from the transaction will be affected by foreign exchange movements which occur after the price has been determined.
Hedge accounting documentation and effectiveness testing are only undertaken if it is cost effective.
The following table shows the currency of financial instruments.
It excludes loans and derivatives designated as net investment hedges.

Similarly, financial instruments included in trade and other payables comprise trade payables, accrued expenses and other payables that qualify as financial instruments.
Based on the assets and liabilities held at the year-end, if the specified currencies were to strengthen 10% while all other market rates remained constant, the change in the fair value of financial instruments not designated as net investment hedges would have the following effect: Impact on Gain loss Impact on Gain loss profit recognised in profit recognised in for the year reserves for the year reserves 31 July 2018 31 July 2018 31 July 2017 31 July 2017 m m m m US dollar 19 4 5 5 Euro 1 2 3 2 Sterling 32 6 1 1 These sensitivities were calculated before adjusting for tax and exclude the effect of quasi-equity intra-group loans.
During the current year cross-currency swaps related to the 2027 Eurobond were fide-designated from net investment hedge relationships, increasing the notional US Dollar exposure at 31 July 2018 by $318m.
This additional notional US Dollar exposure is the driver of 24m of the US dollar and Sterling profit sensitivity in the table above.
These swaps have since been re-designated as net investment hedges.
Cash-flow hedging The Group uses foreign currency contracts to hedge future foreign currency sales and purchases.
At 31 July 2018 contracts with a nominal value of 385m FY2017: 407m were designated as hedging instruments.
In addition, the Group had outstanding foreign currency contracts with a nominal value of 275m FY2017: 243m which were being used to manage transactional foreign exchange exposures, but were not accounted for as cash-flow hedges.
The fair value of the contracts is disclosed in note 19.
The majority of hedged transactions will be recognised in the consolidated income statement in the same period that the cash flows are expected to occur, with the only differences arising because of normal commercial credit terms on sales and purchases.
Of the foreign exchange contracts designated as hedging instruments 81% are for periods of 12 months or less FY2017: 86%.
The movements in the cash-flow hedge reserve during the period are summarised in the table below: Year ended Year ended 31 July 2018 31 July 2017 m m Brought forward cash-flow hedge reserve at start of year 1 7 Gains on effective cash-flow hedges recognised in equity 2 3 Amounts removed from the hedge reserve and recognised in the following lines on the income statement: revenue 1 9 cost of sales 2 4 Carried forward cash-flow hedge reserve at end of year 2 1 Translational currency exposure The Group has significant investments in overseas operations, particularly in the United States and Europe.
As a result, the sterling value of the Groups balance sheet can be significantly affected by movements in exchange rates.
The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of these translational currency exposures by matching the net investment in overseas operations with borrowings denominated in their functional currencies, except where significant adverse interest differentials or other factors would render the cost of such hedging activity uneconomic.
This is achieved by borrowing primarily in the relevant currency or in some cases indirectly using forward foreign exchange contracts and cross-currency swaps.

All the currency swap contracts designated as net investment hedges are current FY2017: current.
The cross-currency swap contracts are non-current.
Swaps generating 329m of the US dollar exposure FY2017: 327m will mature in April 2023 and swaps generating 241m of the US dollar exposure during 2017, maturing in February 2027, have been fide-designated during the current year.
The gains and losses that have been deferred in the net investment hedge reserve, and recycled in the period, are shown in the table below: Year ended Year ended 31 July 2018 31 July 2017 m m Brought forward net investment hedge reserve at start of year 291 294 Amounts removed from the hedge reserve and recognised in the income statement 5 20 Amounts deferred in the period on effective net investment hedges 8 17 Carried forward net investment hedge reserve at end of year 304 291 The fair values of these net investment hedges are subject to exchange rate movements.
Based on the hedging instruments in place at the year-end, if the specified currencies were to strengthen 10% while all other market rates remained constant, it would have the following effect: Loss recognised Loss in hedge recognised in reserve hedge reserve 31 July 2018 31 July 2017 m m US dollar 91 132 Euro 53 53 These movements would be fully offset by an opposite movement on the retranslation of the net assets of the overseas subsidiaries.
These sensitivities were calculated before adjusting for tax.
b Interest rate risk The Group operates an interest rate policy designed to optimise interest cost and reduce volatility in reported earnings.
The Groups current policy is to require interest rates to be fixed for greater than 55% of the level of gross debt.
This is achieved through fixed rate borrowings and interest rate swaps.
At 31 July 2018 55% FY2017: 57% of the Groups gross borrowings were at fixed interest rates, after adjusting for interest rate swaps and the impact of short maturity derivatives designated as net investment hedges.
The Group monitors its fixed rate risk profile against both gross and net debt.
For medium-term planning, it now focuses on gross debt to eliminate the fluctuations of variable cash levels over the cycle.
The weighted average interest rate on borrowings and cross-currency swaps at 31 July 2018, after interest rate swaps, is 3.69% FY2017: 3.52%.

At 31 July 2017 the Group had designated the following hedge against variability in the fair value of borrowings arising from fluctuations in base rates and exchange rates: the fixed floating and exchange exposure of 300m of US$ interest rate swaps which mature on 23 February 2027 partially hedging the 2027 Eurobond.
The above hedge was fide-designated in the year to 31 July 2018.
The fair values of the hedging instruments are disclosed in note 19.
The effect of the swaps is to convert 471m FY2017: 741m debt from fixed rate to floating rate.
Sensitivity of interest charges to interest rate movements The Group has exposure to sterling, US dollar and euro interest rates.
However the Group does not have a significant exposure to interest rate movements for any individual currency.
Based on the composition of net debt and investments at 31 July 2018, and taking into consideration all fixed rate borrowings and interest rate swaps in place, a one percentage point 100 basis points change in average floating interest rates for all three currencies would have less than 3m impact FY2017: 1m impact on the Groups profit before tax.
c Financial credit risk The Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments, but does not currently expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.
Credit risk is mitigated by the Board-approved policy of only placing cash deposits with highly rated relationship bank counterparties within counterparty limits established by reference to their Standard & Poors long-term debt rating.

165 Company Overview Strategic report Governance FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Netting International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA master netting agreements are in place with derivative counterparties except for contracts traded on a dedicated international electronic trading platform used for operational foreign exchange hedging.
Under these agreements if a credit event occurs, all outstanding transactions under the ISDA are terminated and only a single net amount per counterparty is payable in settlement of all transactions.
The ISDA agreements do not meet the criteria for offsetting, since the offsetting is enforceable only if specific events occur in the future, and there is no intention to settle the contracts on a net basis.

Trading Warranty provision and product liability At 31 July 2018 there are warranty and product liability provisions of 22m FY2017: 28m.
Warranties over the Groups products typically cover periods of between one and three years.
Provision is made for the likely cost of after-sales support based on the recent past experience of individual businesses.
Commercial disputes and litigation in respect of ongoing business activities The Group has on occasion been required to take legal action to protect its intellectual property and other rights against infringement.
It has also had to defend itself against proceedings brought by other parties, including product liability and insurance subrogation claims.
Provision is made for any expected costs and liabilities in relation to these proceedings where appropriate, though there can be no guarantee that such provisions which may be subject to potentially material revision from time to time will accurately predict the actual costs and liabilities that may be incurred.
Contingent liabilities In the ordinary course of its business, the Group is subject to commercial disputes and litigation such as government price audits, product liability claims, employee disputes and other kinds of lawsuits, and faces different types of legal issues in different jurisdictions.
The high level of activity in the US, for example, exposes the Group to the likelihood of various types of litigation commonplace in that country, such as mass tort and class action litigation, legal challenges to the scope and validity of patents, and product liability and insurance subrogation claims.
These types of proceedings or the threat of them are also used to create pressure to encourage negotiated settlement of disputes.
Any claim brought against the Group with or without merit, could be costly to defend.
These matters are inherently difficult to quantify.
In appropriate cases a provision is recognised based on best estimates and management judgement but there can be no guarantee that these provisions which may be subject to potentially material revision from time to time will result in an accurate prediction of the actual costs and liabilities that may be incurred.
There are also contingent liabilities in respect of litigation for which no provisions are made.
The Group operates in some markets where the risk of unethical or corrupt behaviour is material and has procedures, including an employee Ethics Alertline, to help it identify potential issues.
Such procedures will, from time to time, give rise to internal investigations, sometimes conducted with external support, to ensure that Smiths Group properly understands risks and concerns and can take steps both to manage immediate issues and to improve its practices and procedures for the future.
The Group also co-operates with relevant authorities in investigating business conduct issues whenever requested to.
The Group is not aware of any issues which are expected to generate material financial exposures.
Non-headline and legacy John Crane, Inc. John Crane, Inc. JCI is one of many co-defendants in numerous lawsuits pending in the United States in which plaintiffs are claiming damages arising from alleged exposure to, or use of, products previously manufactured which contained asbestos.
Until 2006, the awards, the related interest and all material defence costs were met directly by insurers.
In 2007, JCI secured the commutation of certain insurance policies in respect of product liability.
Provision is made in respect of the expected costs of defending known and predicted future claims and of adverse judgments in relation thereto, to the extent that such costs can be reliably estimated.
The JCI products generally referred to in these cases consist of industrial sealing product, primarily packing and gaskets.
The asbestos was encapsulated within these products in such a manner that causes JCI to believe, based on tests conducted on its behalf, that the products were safe.
JCI ceased manufacturing products containing asbestos in 1985.
167 Company Overview Strategic report Governance FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JCI continues to actively monitor the conduct and effect of its current and expected asbestos litigation, including the most efficacious presentation of its safe product defence, and intends to continue to resist these asbestos claims based upon this defence.
The table below summarises the JCI claims experience over the last 39 years since the start of this litigation: Year ended Year ended Year ended Year ended Year ended 31 July 2018 31 July 2017 31 July 2016 31 July 2015 31 July 2014 JCI claims experience Claims against JCI that have been dismissed 277,000 273,000 247,000 242,000 235,000 Claims JCI is currently a defendant in 43,000 50,000 74,000 76,000 80,000 Cumulative final judgments, after appeals, against JCI since 1979 140 138 137 133 131 Cumulative value of awards $m since 1979 164 160 158 153 149 The number of claims outstanding at 31 July 2018 reflects the benefit of 4,000 claims being dismissed in the year.
JCI has also incurred significant additional defence costs.
The litigation involves claims for a number of allegedly asbestos related diseases, with awards, when made, for mesothelioma tending to be larger than those for the other diseases.
JCIs ability to defend mesothelioma cases successfully is, therefore, likely to have a significant impact on its annual aggregate adverse judgment and defence costs.
John Crane, Inc. litigation provision The provision is based on past history of JCI claims and well-established tables of asbestos-related disease incidence projections.
The provision is determined using advice from asbestos valuation experts, Bates White LLC.
The assumptions made in assessing the appropriate level of provision include: the period over which the expenditure can be reliably estimated: the future trend of legal costs: the rate of future claims filed: the rate of successful resolution of claims: and the average amount of judgments awarded.
Established incidence curves can be used to estimate the likely future pattern of asbestos related disease.
However, JCIs claims experience is also significantly impacted by other factors which influence the US litigation environment.
These can include: changing approaches on the part of the plaintiffs bar: changing attitudes amongst the judiciary at both trial and appellate levels in specific jurisdictions which move the balance of risk and opportunity for claimants: and legislative and procedural changes in both the state and federal court systems.
The build-up of assets in trusts established by asbestos defendants in Chapter 11 restructuring 524 g trusts will increase the influence of these trusts on the behaviour of claimants.
Developments in the Garlock Sealing Technologies LLC Chapter 11 proceedings have provided additional data on plaintiff claims to 524 g trusts.
Given the evidence that emerged of inconsistent duplicate claims, there is a significant likelihood that this will lead to changes in the pattern of claims made in the future, and the costs arising from claims.
The projections use a limited time horizon on the basis that Bates White LLC consider that there is substantial uncertainty in the asbestos litigation environment so probable expenditures are not reasonably estimable beyond this time horizon.
Asbestos is the longest running mass tort litigation in American history which is constantly evolving in ways that cannot be anticipated.
JCIs defence strategy also generates a significantly different pattern of legal costs and settlement expenses from other defendants, thus JCI is in an extremely rare position, and evidence from other litigation cannot be used to improve the reliability of the projections.
A ten year FY2017: ten year time horizon has been used based on past experience regarding significant changes in the litigation environment that have occurred every few years and on the amount of time taken in the past for some of those changes to impact the broader asbestos litigation environment, and recent events, like the Garlock Sealing Technologies LLC Chapter 11 proceedings, which may lead to further major changes.
The rate of future claims filed has been estimated using well-established tables of asbestos incidence projections to determine the likely population of potential claimants, and JCIs past experience to determine what proportion of this population will make a claim against JCI.
The JCI products generally referred to in claims had industrial and marine applications.
As a result, the incidence curve used for JCI projections excludes construction workers, and is a composite of the curves that predict asbestos exposure-related disease from shipyards and other occupations.
This is consistent with JCIs litigation history.
The rate of successful resolution of claims and the average amount of any judgments awarded are projected based on the past history of JCI claims, since this is the best available evidence, given JCIs unusual strategy of defending all claims.
The future trend of legal costs is estimated based on JCIs past experience, adjusted to reflect the assumed levels of claims and trial activity, since the number of trials is a key driver of legal costs.
John Crane, Inc. litigation insurance recoveries While JCI has excess liability insurance, the availability of such insurance and scope of the cover are currently the subject of litigation in the United States.
Pending the outcome of that litigation, JCI has met defence costs directly.
The calculation of the provision does not take account of any potential recoveries from insurers.
168 SMITHS GROUP PLC Annual Report 2018 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 22 PROVISIONS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES CONTINUED Non-headline and legacy continued John Crane, Inc. continued John Crane, Inc. litigation provision history The JCI asbestos litigation provision has developed over the last five years as follows: Year ended Year ended Year ended Year ended Year ended 31 July 2018 31 July 2017 31 July 2016 31 July 2015 31 July 2014 m m m m m John Crane, Inc. litigation provision Gross provision 251 260 267 236 227 Discount 28 23 15 20 23 Discounted provision 223 237 252 216 204 Operating profit charge credit Increased provisions for adverse judgments and legal defence costs 13 17 8 14 49 Change in US risk free rates 6 13 7 1 2 Litigation management, legal fees in connection with litigation against insurers and 3 11 8 4 1 defence strategy Recoveries from insurers 6 16 Operating profit charge 10 9 7 19 48 Cash-flow Provision utilisation 27 24 22 24 36 John Crane, Inc. litigation spend 30 32 32 27 25 The reduction in 2018 is due to increasing US dollar discount rates, with no material movement in the gross provision.
The operating charge for John Crane, Inc. litigation comprises: a charge of 13m FY2017: 17m in respect of the net increased provision for adverse judgments and legal defence costs: a credit of 6m arising from an increase in US risk free rates FY2017: credit of 13m : and 3m FY2017: 11m costs for litigation management, defence strategy and legal fees in connection with litigation against insurers.
In the year ended 31 July 2017 JCI recognised the recovery of 6m through a settlement with an insurer.
This agreement does not provide any cover for future costs so there is no material impact on the closing litigation provision.
John Crane, Inc. litigation provision sensitivities The provision may be subject to potentially material revision from time to time if new information becomes available as a result of future events.
There can be no guarantee that the assumptions used to estimate the provision will result in an accurate prediction of the actual costs that may be incurred because of the significant uncertainty associated with the future level of asbestos claims and of the costs arising out of related litigation.
Statistical reliability of projections over the ten year time horizon In order to evaluate the statistical reliability of the projections, a population of outcomes is modelled using randomised verdict outcomes.
This generated a distribution of outcomes with future spend at the 5th percentile of 230m and future spend at the 95th percentile of 290m FY2017: 231m and 304m, respectively.
Statistical analysis of the distribution of these outcomes indicates that there is a 50% probability that the total future spend will fall between 238m and 263m FY2017: between 243m and 272m, compared to the gross provision value of 251m FY2017: 260m.
Sensitivity of the projections to changes in the time horizon used If the asbestos litigation environment becomes more volatile and uncertain, for example if defendants are successful in legal cases against plaintiff law firms and this impacts the nature of claims filed, the time horizon over which the provision can be calculated may reduce.
Conversely, if the environment became more stable, or JCI changed approach and committed to long-term settlement arrangements, the time period covered by the provision might be extended.
The projections use a 10 year time horizon.
Reducing the time horizon by one year would reduce the provision by 15m FY2017: 17m and reducing it by five years would reduce the provision by 91m FY2017: 98m.
We consider, after obtaining advice from Bates White LLC, that to forecast beyond ten years requires that the litigation environment remains largely unchanged with respect to the historical experience used for estimating future asbestos expenditures.
Historically, the asbestos litigation environment has undergone significant changes more often than every ten years.
If one assumed that the asbestos litigation environment would remain unchanged for longer and extended the time horizon by one year it would increase the provision by 13m FY2017: 14m and extending it by five years would increase the provision by 52m FY2017: 58m.
However, there are also reasonable scenarios that, given certain recent events in the US asbestos litigation environment, would result in no additional asbestos litigation for JCI beyond ten years.
At this time, how the asbestos litigation environment may evolve beyond 10 years is not reasonably estimable.
169 Company Overview Strategic report Governance FINANCIAL STATEMENTS John Crane, Inc. contingent liabilities Provision has been made for future defence costs and the cost of adverse judgments expected to occur.
JCIs claims experience is significantly impacted by other factors which influence the US litigation environment.
These can include: changing approaches on the part of the plaintiffs bar: changing attitudes amongst the judiciary at both trial and appellate levels: and legislative and procedural changes in both the state and federal court systems.
As a result, whilst the Group anticipates that asbestos litigation will continue beyond the period covered by the provision, the uncertainty surrounding the US litigation environment beyond this point is such that the costs cannot be reliably estimated.
Although the methodology used to calculate the JCI litigation provision can in theory be applied to show claims and costs for longer periods, the Directors consider, based on advice from Bates White LLC, that the level of uncertainty regarding the factors used in estimating future costs is too great to provide for reasonable estimation of the numbers of future claims, the nature of such claims or the cost to resolve them for years beyond the 10 year time horizon.
Titeflex Corporation Titeflex Corporation, a subsidiary of the Group in the Flex-Tek division, has received a number of claims from insurance companies seeking recompense on a subrogated basis for the effects of damage allegedly caused by lightning strikes in relation to its flexible gas piping product.
It has also received a number of product liability claims regarding this product, some in the form of purported class actions.
Titeflex Corporation believes that its products are a safe and effective means of delivering gas when installed in accordance with the manufacturers instructions and local and national codes: however some claims have been settled on an individual basis without admission of liability.
Equivalent third-party products in the US marketplace face similar challenges.
Titeflex Corporation litigation provision The continuing progress of claims and the pattern of settlement, together with the recent market place activity, provide sufficient evidence to recognise a liability in the accounts.
Therefore provision has been made for the costs which the Group is expected to incur in respect of future claims to the extent that such costs can be reliably estimated.
Titeflex Corporation sells flexible gas piping with extensive installation and safety guidance revised in 2008 designed to assure the safety of the product and minimise the risk of damage associated with lightning strikes.
The assumptions made in assessing the appropriate level of provision, which are based on past experience, include: the period over which expenditure can be reliably estimated: the number of future settlements: the average amount of settlements: and the impact of statutes of repose and safe installation initiatives on the expected number of future claims.
The provision of 78m FY2017: 84m is a discounted pre-tax provision using discount rates, being the risk-free rate on US debt instruments for the appropriate period.
The deferred tax asset related to this provision is shown within the deferred tax balance note 6.

An offsetting provision release of 8m is principally driven by a reduction in subrogation payments.
Titeflex Corporation litigation provision sensitivities The significant uncertainty associated with the future level of claims and of the costs arising out of related litigation means that there can be no guarantee that the assumptions used to estimate the provision will result in an accurate prediction of the actual costs that may be incurred.
Therefore the provision may be subject to potentially material revision from time to time, if new information becomes available as a result of future events.
The projections incorporate a long-term assumption regarding the impact of safe installation initiatives on the level of future claims.
If the assumed annual benefit of bonding and grounding initiatives were 0.5% higher, the provision would be 4m FY2017: 5m lower, and if the benefit were 0.5% lower, the provision would increase by 5m FY2017: 5m.

Capital management Capital employed comprises total equity adjusted for goodwill recognised directly in reserves, net post-retirement benefit related assets and liabilities, net litigation provisions relating to non-headline items and net debt.
The efficiency of the allocation of the capital to the divisions is monitored through the return on capital employed ROCE.
This ratio is calculated over a rolling 12-month period and is the percentage that headline operating profit comprises of monthly average capital employed.
The capital structure is based on the directors judgement of the balance required to maintain flexibility while achieving an efficient cost of capital.
The ratio of net debt to headline EBITDA of 1.4 FY2017: 1.4 is within the Groups stated policy of 2.0 or less over the medium term.
The Groups robust balance sheet and record of strong cash generation is more than able to fund the immediate investment needs and other legacy obligations.
See note 30 for the definition of headline EBITDA and the calculation of this ratio.
As part of its capital management the Group strategy is to maintain a solid investment grade credit rating to ensure access to the widest possible sources of financing and to minimise the resulting cost of capital.
At 31 July 2018 the Group had a credit rating of BBB Baa2 FY2017: BBB Baa2 with Standard & Poors and Moodys respectively.
The Board has a progressive dividend policy for future payouts, with the aim of increasing dividends in line with the long-term underlying growth in earnings.
In setting the level of dividend payments, the Board will take into account prevailing economic conditions and future investment plans, along with the objective to maintain minimum dividend cover of around 2.0.
