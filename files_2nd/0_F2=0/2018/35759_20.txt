The Group is organised into four segments: Asset Management: Pricing, Data & Market Intelligence: Banking & Finance: and Commodity Events.
Revenues generated in the Asset Management and Pricing, Data & Market Intelligence segments are primarily from subscriptions.
Banking & Finance revenues consist mainly of sponsorship income and delegates revenue.
Commodity Events revenue is mainly delegates revenue.
A breakdown of the Groups revenue by type is set out below.
During the year, the Group sold Global Markets Intelligence Division GMID, Adhesion, World Bulk Wine and Institutional Investor Journals note 15.
As a result, segment information for these businesses has been reclassified as sold businesses and the comparative split of segmental revenues, revenue by type, operating profits, acquired intangible amortisation, exceptional items and depreciation and amortisation has been restated.
GMID has been classified as discontinued operations note 11 and therefore presented as such throughout this report.
In addition, the operating profit segments have been restated to reflect a change in the way unallocated corporate costs are recharged.
From 1 October 2017, central costs over which a segment had no influence were not recharged to that segment.
This restatement has no effect on the total Group's results but reflects the operating profit of each segment as if the new recharge methodology had been applied from 1 October 2016.
Central costs of 17.6m for 2017 were reallocated to unallocated corporate costs.
Analysis of the Groups three main geographical areas is also set out to provide additional information on the trading performance of the businesses.
Inter-segment sales are charged at prevailing market rates and shown in the eliminations columns.

The net gain has been excluded from adjusted finance costs as it would not have crystallised had the disposal of GMID not completed.

In arriving at this rate, the Group removes the tax effect of exceptional and adjusting items that reconcile statutory to adjusted profit.
A detailed reconciliation of the Groups statutory results to the adjusted and underlying results is set out on pages 27 to 29.
However, the current tax effect of goodwill and intangible items is not removed.
The current tax benefit of tax deductible goodwill and intangible items amounting to 3.0m is recognised in the adjusted effective tax rate as the Group considers that this more accurately reflects its expected cash tax payable position as the deferred tax effect on the goodwill and intangible items is not expected to crystallise.
The deferred tax effect on goodwill and intangible items would only crystallise in the event of a disposal and that is not the current intention.
Other tax adjusting items include non-recoverable withholding tax of 14.6m, a one-time deemed repatriation tax charge relating to unremitted foreign earnings of 3.2m arising from US tax reform and a tax credit of 4.7m arising as a result of revaluation of net US deferred tax liabilities following a reduction in the US federal tax rate from 35% to 21%.
These items are excluded from adjusted tax as they are significant and not in the ordinary course of business.
The non-recoverable withholding tax arises as a direct consequence of a $380m intercompany dividend which was triggered by the disposal of GMID and other restructuring that took place.
Adjustments in respect of prior years are excluded on the basis that the adjusted tax expense should reflect the tax rate of the Group for the current year.
Share of tax on profits of associates and joint ventures is calculated on the adjusted profits of associates and joint ventures and excludes tax on exceptional items consistent with the Groups historical approach and policy.

Different tax rates of subsidiaries operating in overseas jurisdictions of 7.3m 2017: 3.8m reflects higher profits earned in jurisdictions which have a higher tax rate than the UK.
Disposal of businesses relates to the disposals of GMID and Dealogic during the year which crystallised a US tax charge of 16.8m 6.7m from GMID and 10.1m from Dealogic but is non-taxable in the UK.
Goodwill and intangibles for the year ended 30 September 2018 are 1.2m which relate primarily to non-deductible goodwill impairment for Layer123.
The other items deductible for tax purposes of 3.9m 2017: 5.1m arise as a result of financing arrangements that result in different tax treatment in the territories involved, primarily from debt financing provided to US affiliates.
Following the anti-hybrid legislation and new interest restriction rules enacted as part of US Tax Reform, these financing arrangements have been partially unwound during the year and will be fully unwound by the end of next financial year.
A one-time deemed repatriation tax charge of 3.2m related to unremitted foreign earnings arises as a result of the US Tax Reform.
As a result of the disposal of GMID and other restructuring that took place during the year, a dividend payment of $380m was made in September 2018 from BCA Research Inc. to Euromoney Canada Limited, a UK group entity.
Canadian withholding tax of 14.6m arose from the dividend payment and was paid in full to the Canadian Revenue Agency in October 2018.
The impact of change in rate relates to a one-off deferred tax credit of 4.7m arising from the revaluation of the Groups net US deferred tax liabilities following the change in the US federal tax rate from 35% to 21%.
Adjustments in respect of prior years of 7.3m 2017: 2.3m reflect a further provision made in respect of a potential exposure in relation to an HMRC enquiry and several small items across numerous jurisdictions that relate to changes in estimates.

Mining Indaba meets the IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations criteria to be classified as held for sale at 30 September 2018.
Mining Indaba does not meet the IFRS 5 criteria to be treated as discontinued operations.
The assets and liabilities of this business have been disclosed separately on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
The assets and liabilities held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying value and fair value less costs to sell.
No impairment of these net assets has been identified at 30 September 2018.
The disposal has been disclosed as an event after the balance sheet date note 30.
The main classes of assets and liabilities comprising the business classified as held for sale are set out in the table below.
Intangible assets, other than goodwill, have a finite life and are amortised over their expected useful lives at the rates set out in the accounting policies in note 1 of this report.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units CGU that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
During the year, the goodwill in respect of each of the businesses was tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets value in use or fair value less costs of disposal.
The following methodologies applied and key assumptions, reflecting past experience and external sources of information, included: Value in use: budgets by business based on pre-tax cash flows with a CAGR of 3% to 18% for the next three years derived from approved 2018 budgets.
Management believes these budgets to be reasonably achievable pre-tax discount rates between 11% and 19%, derived from the Groups benchmarked weighted average cost of capital WACC of 9% adjusted for risks specific to the nature of CGUs and risks included within the cash flows themselves long-term nominal growth rate of between 1% and 2% Fair value less costs of disposal: fair value less costs of disposal is calculated using a discounted cash flow approach, with a post-tax discount rate applied to the projected risk-adjusted post-tax cash flows and terminal value post-tax cash flows are derived from approved 2018 budgets.
Management believes these budgets to be reasonably achievable the period of specific projected cash flows is five years post-tax discount rates between 8% and 10%, derived from the Groups benchmarked WACC of 9% adjusted for risks specific to the nature of CGUs and risks included within the cash flows themselves long-term nominal growth rate of between 1% and 2% uses significant inputs which are not based on observable market data.
Therefore, this valuation technique is classified as level 3 inthefair value hierarchy The recoverable amount of RISI is calculated on the fair value less costs of disposal methodology and the rest of the Groups CGUs on the value in use basis.
Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 115 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 12 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued Following the impairment review, the impairment losses recognised in exceptional items note 5 in respect of goodwill and intangibles are as follows: Goodwill Recoverable Discount 2018 impairment amount rate CGU Reportable segment 000 000 % Layer123 Pricing, Data & Market Intelligence 3,048 6,167 11.0 Goodwill Recoverable Discount 2017 impairment amount rate CGU Reportable segment 000 000 % NDR Asset Management 27,360 46,114 14.2 For the year ended 30 September 2018, no impairments were required to the Indaba CGU on a value in use basis before being transferred to held for sale.
Upon classification as held for sale, the CGU was assessed by reference to expected sale proceeds and no impairment was required.
Further disclosures in accordance with IAS 36 are provided where the Group holds an individual goodwill item relating to a CGU that is significant, which the Group considers to be 15% or more of the Groups total carrying value of goodwill.
Significant items of goodwill relate to BCA of 177.5m 2017: 172.6m.
The remaining carrying value of goodwill and acquired intangible assets consists of a number of CGUs, none of which are individually significant to the Group.
The aggregate value of goodwill for these CGUs is 237.2m 2017: 227.4m.
For BCA, using the value in use methodology, a pre-tax discount rate of 12.8% 2017: 13.6% and long-term nominal growth rate of 1.4% 2017: 1.7%, the recoverable amount exceeded the total carrying value by 43.0m 2017: 130.0m.
The Directors performed a sensitivity analysis on the total carrying value of this CGU.
For the recoverable amount to fall to the carrying value, the discount rate would need to be increased by two percentage points 2017: seven percentage points or the long-term growth rate reduced by three percentage points 2017: 10 percentage points.
For RISI, using the fair value less costs to disposal methodology, a post-tax discount rate of 9.9%, cash flows for the initial five-year period growing between 3% and 24% projected into perpetuity using a long-term nominal growth rate of 1.4%, the recoverable amount exceeded the total carrying value by 23.8m.
Sensitivity analysis performed around the base case assumptions has indicated that for RISI, the following changes in assumptions in isolation, would cause the fair value less costs of disposal to fall below the carrying value: the discount rate increased by two percentage points operating profit growth rate decreasing to 9% for the initial five-year period Impairment for Layer123 of 3.0m is the result of its disappointing financial performance post acquisition.

Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates but are not employed for speculative purposes.
Full details of the objectives, policies and strategies pursued by the Group in relation to financial risk management are set out in this note and on pages 98 and 99 of the accounting policies.
The Groups Tax and Treasury Committee is responsible for recommending policy to the Board.
The Groups treasury policies are directed to giving greater certainty of future costs and revenues and ensuring that the Group has adequate liquidity for working capital and debt capacity for funding acquisitions.
The treasury department does not act as a profit centre, nor does it undertake any speculative trading activity and it operates within policies and procedures approved by the Board.
Interest rate swaps are used to manage the Groups exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on its floating rate borrowings.
Further details are set out in the interest rate risk section page 129.
Forward contracts are used to manage the Groups exposure to fluctuations in exchange rate movements on foreign currency transactions.
Further details are set out in the foreign exchange rate risk section pages 127 and 128.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The Groups overall strategy remains unchanged from 2017.
The capital structure of the Group comprises equity attributable to equity holders, comprising share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Statement of Changes in Equity.
Net cash debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio The Groups Tax and Treasury Committee reviews the Groups capital structure at least twice a year.
Committed bank facilities available to the Group until December 2021 contain covenants based on a maximum 3.0 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA and a minimum interest cover ratio of 3.0 times.
The amounts and foreign exchange rates used in the covenant calculations are subject to adjustments as defined under the terms of the arrangement.
Management regularly monitors the covenants and prepares detailed cash flow forecasts to ensure that sufficient headroom is available and that the covenants are not at risk of a breach.
Additionally, the Group arranges its currency borrowings in order that they are in proportion to the ratio of earnings in that particular currency to total Group earnings.
The bank covenant ratio uses an average exchange rate in the calculation of net debt.
The resultant net cash debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is 0.69 times 2017: 1.24 times.
Using a closing rate basis for the valuation of net cash debt, the ratio was 0.71 times 2017: 1.23 times.
126 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial Statements 19 Financial instruments and risk management continued Categories of financial instruments The Groups financial assets and liabilities at 30 September are as follows: 2018 2017 000 000 Financial assets Derivative instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships 186 3,110 Derivative instruments recognised at fair value through profit and loss 238 Available-for-sale investments note 14 3,546 3,546 Convertible loan note held at cost 2,677 2,503 Deferred consideration note 25 loans and receivables 1,120 1,989 Loans and receivables including cash at bank and short-term deposits 136,163 59,299 Classified as held for sale loans and receivables including cash at bank and short-term deposits 936 18,987 144,628 89,672 Financial liabilities Derivative instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships 2,590 1,231 Deferred consideration note 25 borrowings and payables 98 350 Deferred consideration note 25 fair value through profit and loss 236 Acquisition commitments note 25 borrowings and payables 272 13,125 Borrowings and payables including bank overdrafts 91,427 264,782 Classified as held for sale borrowings and payables including bank overdrafts 302 10,002 94,925 289,490 Derivative instruments are classified as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy on page 132 and deferred consideration held at fair value through the profit and loss are classified as level 3.
Available-for-sale investments are held at cost less any identified impairments as they do not have a quoted market price in an active market and the fair value cannot be reliably measured.
No other financial assets or liabilities are held at fair value.
The Directors consider that the carrying value amounts of financial assets and liabilities are equal to their fair value.
The Group has derivative assets of 0.2m 2017: 3.3m and derivative liabilities of 2.6m 2017: 1.2m with a number of banks.
These derivatives do not meet the offsetting criteria of IAS 32, but the Group would have the right to setoff same currency cash flows with the same counterparties of which settled on the same date.
Consequently, the gross amount of the derivative assets and the gross amount of the derivative liabilities are presented separately in the Group's Statement of Financial Position.
The convertible loan note is held at cost as it contains an embedded derivative of non-quoted equity for which the Group is unable to accurately determine a fair value.
The Group has entered into an omnibus guarantee and setoff agreement with Lloyds Banking Group plc with a right to setoff outstanding credit balances against cash balances.
Cash and cash equivalents include no overdrafts 2017: 0.2m offset under the cash pooling arrangements.
This agreement meets the offsetting criteria of IAS 32. i Market price risk Market price risk is the possibility that changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates or commodity prices will adversely affect the value of the Groups financial assets, liabilities or expected future cash flows.
The Groups primary market risks are interest rate fluctuations and exchange rate movements.
Derivatives are used to hedge or reduce the risks of interest rate and exchange rate movements and are not entered into unless such risks exist.
Derivatives used by the Group for hedging a particular risk are not specialised and are generally available from numerous sources.
The fair values of forward exchange contracts are set out in this note and represent the value for which an asset could be sold or liability settled between knowledgeable willing parties in an arms length transaction calculated using the market rates of interest and exchange at 30 September 2018.
The Group has no other material market price risks.
Market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis.
There has been no change to the Groups exposure to market risks or the manner in which it manages and measures the risks during the year.
ii Foreign exchange rate risk The Groups principal foreign exchange exposure is to the US dollar.
The Group generates approximately two-thirds of its revenues in US dollars, including approximately 40% of the revenues in its UK-based businesses, and approximately two-thirds of its operating profits are US dollar-denominated.
The Group is therefore exposed to foreign exchange risk on the US dollar revenues in its UK businesses, the translation of results of foreign subsidiaries and external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group where the denomination of the loan is not in the functional currency of the lender borrower.
Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 127 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 19 Financial instruments and risk management continued ii Foreign exchange rate risk continued The Group does not hedge the translation of the results of foreign subsidiaries.
Fluctuations in the value of sterling versus foreign currencies could materially affect the amount of these items in the Consolidated Financial Statements, even if their values have not changed in their original currency.
The Group does endeavour to match foreign currency borrowings to investments in order to provide a natural hedge for the translation of the net assets of overseas subsidiaries.
The carrying amounts of the Groups US dollar-denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are as follows: Assets Liabilities 2018 2017 2018 2017 000 000 000 000 US dollar 130,459 62,742 167,253 319,446 Subsidiaries normally do not hedge transactions in foreign currencies into the functional currency of their own operations.
However, at a Group level, a series of US dollar and euro forward contracts are put in place to sell forward surplus US dollars and euros so as to hedge 80% of the Groups UK based US dollar and euro revenues for the coming 12 months and 50% of the Groups UK based US dollar and euro revenues for the subsequent six months.
The timing and value of these forward contracts is based on managements estimate of its future US dollar and euro revenues over an 18 month period and is regularly reviewed and revised with any changes in estimates resulting in either additional forward contracts being taken out or existing contracts maturity dates being moved forward or back.
If management materially underestimates the Groups future US dollar and euro denominated revenues, this would lead to too few forward contracts being in place and the Group being more exposed to swings in US dollar and euro to sterling exchange rates.
An overestimate of the Groups US dollar and euro denominated revenues would lead to associated costs in unwinding the excess forward contracts.
The Group also has a significant operation in Canada whose revenues are mainly in US dollars.
A series of forward contracts are put in place up to 18 months forward to hedge the operations Canadian dollar cost base.
In addition, each subsidiary is encouraged to invoice sales in its local functional currency where possible.
Forward exchange contracts are gross settled at maturity.
Impact of 10% strengthening of sterling against US dollar The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in sterling against US dollar.
A 10% sensitivity has been determined by the Board as the sensitivity rate appropriate when reporting an estimated foreign currency risk internally and represents managements assessment of a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates at the reporting date.
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates.
The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group where the denomination of the loan is not in the functional currency of the lender borrower.
Where sterling strengthens 10% against the relevant currency, a negative number below indicates a decrease in profit and equity.
For a 10% weakening of sterling against the relevant currency, there would be an equal and opposite impact on the profit and other comprehensive income and the balances below would be positive.
2018 2017 000 000 Change in profit for the year in Income Statement $ net assets in UK companies 911 838 Change in other comprehensive income derivative financial instruments 7,167 6,545 Change in other comprehensive income loans to from foreign operations 12,122 17,751 The increase in the loss from the sensitivity analysis is due to an increase in the working capital assets.
The increase in other comprehensive income from 6.5m to 7.2m from the sensitivity analysis is due to the increase in the notional value of the derivative financial instruments.
The change in other comprehensive income from a 10% change in sterling against US dollars in relation to the translation of loans to from foreign operations within the Group where the denomination of the loan is not in the functional currency of the lender borrower would result in a change of 12.1m 2017: 17.8m.
However, the change in other comprehensive income is completely offset by the change in value of the foreign operations net assets from their translation into sterling.
The Group is also exposed to the translation of the results of its US dollar-denominated businesses, although the Group does not hedge the translation of these results.
Consequently, fluctuations in the value of sterling versus other currencies could materially affect the translation of these results in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
128 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial Statements 19 Financial instruments and risk management continued ii Foreign exchange rate risk continued Forward foreign exchange contracts It is the policy of the Group to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency payments and receipts.
A series of US dollar and euro forward contracts are put in place to sell forward surplus US dollars and euros so as to hedge 80% of the Groups UK-based US dollar and euro revenues for the coming 12 months and 50% for the subsequent six months.
In addition, at a Group level a series of US dollar forward contracts are put in place up to 18 months forward to hedge the subsidiarys Canadian cost base.
At 30 September 2018, the aggregate amount of unrealised losses under forward foreign exchange contracts deferred in the fair value reserve relating to future revenue transactions is 2.4m 2017: 1.8m gain.
It is anticipated that the transactions will take place over the next 18 months at which stage the amount deferred in equity will be released to the Income Statement.
At 30 September 2018, there were no ineffective cash flow hedges in place 2017: nil.
iii Interest rate risk It is the Groups policy to hedge approximately 80% of any term loan interest exposure, converting its floating rate debt into fixed debt by means of interest rate swaps.
The predictability of interest costs is deemed to be more important than the possible opportunity cost foregone of achieving lower interest rates.
In May 2018, the Group repaid term loans of $100m and 40m and simultaneously terminated swaps converting $80m and 32m of term debt from floating to fixed rates recognising a gain of 2.1m recycled from fair value reserves.
At 30 September 2017, the aggregate amount of unrealised gains on interest rate swaps deferred in the fair value reserve relating to future interest cash flows was 0.1m.
The Groups exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk section on pages 130 and 131.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date.
For floating rate instruments, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
A 100 basis point increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents the Directors assessment of a reasonably possible change in interest rates at the reporting date.
If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit for the year ended 30 September 2018 would decrease or increase by 0.8m 2017: 0.8m.
This is mainly attributable to the Groups exposure to interest rates on its variable rate cash deposits.
For the year ended 30 September 2018, there is no impact on the fair value equity reserves as a result of the changes in fair value of interest rate swaps, as the interest rate swaps were terminated 2017: decrease or increase by 3.4m.
Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 129 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 19 Financial instruments and risk management continued iv Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group seeks to limit interest rate and foreign currency risks described above by the use of financial instruments and as a result have a credit risk from the potential non-performance by the counterparties to these financial instruments, which are unsecured.
The amount of this credit risk is normally restricted to the amounts of any hedge gain and not the principal amount being hedged.
The Group also has a credit exposure to counterparties for the full principal amount of cash and cash equivalents.
Credit risks are controlled by monitoring the amounts outstanding with, and the credit quality of, these counterparties.
For the Groups cash and cash equivalents, these are principally AAA rated money market fund investments, licensed commercial banks and investment banks with strong long-term credit ratings.
Treasury policies in place do not allow concentrations of risk with individual counterparties and do not allow significant treasury exposures with counterparties which are rated below investment grade.
Included in cash and cash equivalents of 78.3m 2017: 4.4m is 50.2m 2017: nil directly deposited in AAA rated money market fund investments.
The Group also has credit risk with respect to trade and other receivables and accrued income.
The concentration of credit risk from trade receivables is limited due to the Groups large and broad customer base.
Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the business units where they arise.
Allowance is made for bad and doubtful debts based on managements assessment of the risk of nonpayment taking into account the ageing profile, experience and circumstance.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, recorded in the Statement of Financial Position.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar characteristics.
The Group defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are related entities.
Concentration of credit risk did not exceed 5% of gross monetary assets at any time during the year.
v Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as and when they fall due.
To manage this risk the Group has readily accessible funding arrangements in place and seeks to optimise group liquidity through cash pooling arrangements.
The Groups principal source of borrowings are provided through committed bank facilities available to the Group until December 2021.
These syndicated facilities include a 240m 2017: 130m multi-currency revolving credit facility which was undrawn at 30 September2018 2017: drawn down by 55.2m.
The Groups strategy is to use excess operating cash to pay down its drawings under the revolving credit facility and where undrawn invest in short-term bank deposits and money market funds.
The Group generally has an annual cash conversion rate the percentage by which cash generated from operations covers adjusted operating profit before acquired intangible amortisation and exceptional items of 100% or more due to much of its subscription, sponsorship and delegate revenue being paid in advance.
The Groups underlying operating cash conversion rate based on adjusted operating profit was 102%.
The Groups forecasts and projections, looking out to September 2022 and taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group should be able to operate within the level and covenants of its current and available borrowing facilities.

Level 2 The fair value of other financial assets and financial liabilities excluding derivative instruments is determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis using prices from observable current market transactions and dealer quotes for similar instruments.
Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts.
Level 3 If one or more significant inputs are not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.
At 30 September 2018 and the prior year, all the resulting fair value estimates have been included in level 2 other than the Groups deferred consideration payment which is classified as level 3.

The committed facility is available until December 2021.
There is a further accordion facility of 130m should the Group wish to request it.
Drawings under the revolving credit facility bear interest charged at LIBOR plus a margin, the applicable margin being based on the Groups ratio of adjusted net debt to EBITDA.
The facilitys covenant requires the Groups net debt to be no more than three times adjusted EBITDA and requires minimum levels of interest cover of three times on a rolling 12-month basis.
On this basis, at 30 September 2018, the Groups adjusted net cash to EBITDA was 0.69 times.
Management regularly monitors the covenants and prepares detailed cash flow forecasts to ensure that sufficient headroom is available and that the covenants are not close or potentially close to breach.

At the balance sheet date the Group has unused tax losses available for offset against future profits.
At 30 September, the deferred tax asset recognised in relation to these losses is analysed as follows: 2018 2017 000 000 UK 1,215 1,899 US 1,020 2,248 Europe 1,294 1,489 3,529 5,636 The Directors are of the opinion that based on recent and forecast trading it is probable that the level of profits in future years is sufficient to enable the above assets to be recovered.
The UK tax losses are expected to reverse in the short-term.
The US losses can be carried forward for a period of 20 years from the date they arose and have expiry dates between 2018 and 2038.
There is no expiry date on the other losses.
The increase in the net deferred tax liability relates to utilisation of tax losses and other tax attributes, partially offset by revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities following the reduction in the US federal tax rate from 35% to 21%.
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of 50.0m 2017: 300.0m relating to the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The temporary differences at 30 September 2018 represent the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries where remittance to the UK of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which these subsidiaries operate.

Save as You Earn SAYE Sharesave options The Group operates a SAYE Sharesave scheme in which all employees, including Directors, employed in the UK are eligible to participate.
Participants save a fixed monthly amount of up to 500 for three years and are then able to buy shares in the Company at a price set at a 20% discount to the market value at the start of the savings period.
In line with market practice, no performance conditions attach to options granted under this plan.
The SAYE Sharesave options were valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over a period of three years.
The expected term of the option used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Buy-out award A one-off award was made to A Rashbass on 1 October 2015.
Performance Share Plan PSP Under the PSP schemes, participants are awarded nil-cost options to obtain ordinary shares in the Company.
These options have a maximum life of 10 years and would not normally vest until the respective three or five years after the date of the award, provided that the performance conditions have been met.
The share price used to determine the number of shares awarded under the PSP grants is the average of the middle market quotations of an ordinary share as derived from the Daily Official List for the five dealing days preceding the date of grant.
Deferred bonus equity settled Any bonus earned in excess of 100% of salary for A Rashbass is awarded as a deferred award.

The remaining balance is subject to an additional performance condition, applicable for the vesting of the second tranche of awards, which requires the profits of each business in the subsequent vesting period to be at least 75% of that achieved in the year the first tranche of awards became exercisable.
The options lapse to the extent unexercised by 30 September 2020.
The remaining CAP 2010 share options were unlikely to vest and the charge was released in 2017.
The CAP 2014 and CSOP 2014 was approved by shareholders on 30 January 2014 as a replacement for CAP 2010.
The minimum performance target under CAP 2014 and CSOP 2014 was not achieved and the options lapsed in 2017.
25 Acquisition commitments and deferred consideration The Group is party to consideration arrangements in the form of acquisition commitments, acquisition deferred consideration payments and deferred consideration receipts on disposals.
Acquisition commitments comprise put options held by minority shareholders of acquired businesses which are held at amortised cost.
Deferred consideration payments comprise consideration contingent on the future performance of acquired businesses held at fair value and deferred consideration payable at a set amount in the future.
These liabilities are recognised at the discounted present value and re-measured each period.
The discount is unwound as a notional interest charge and the re-measurement of these liabilities is recognised in the Income Statement.

The total net pension costs from continuing operations of the Group for the year ended 30 September 2018 were 3.3m 2017: 3.1m.
Defined contribution schemes The Group operates the following defined contribution schemes: Euromoney PensionSaver and the Metal Bulletin Group Personal Pension Plan in the UK and a 401 k savings and investment plan in the US.
In compliance with the Pension Act 2008, the Group operated a defined contribution plan, DMGT PensionSaver, up to 30 June 2017 and thereafter the Euromoney PensionSaver, into which relevant employees are automatically enrolled.
The pension charge in respect of defined contribution schemes for the year ended 30 September comprised: 2018 2017 000 000 Euromoney and DMGT PensionSaver 2,111 2,048 Metal Bulletin Group Personal Pension Plan 17 14 Private schemes 1,061 966 3,189 3,028 Euromoney PensionSaver The Euromoney PensionSaver is the principal pension arrangement offered to employees of the Group.
Employees contribute at an initial default rate of 3% of salary with an equal company contribution in the first three years of employment and thereafter at twice the employee contribution rate, up to a maximum employer contribution of 10% of salary.
Assets are invested in funds selected by members and held independently from the Groups finances.
The investment and administration is undertaken by Fidelity Pension Management.
Metal Bulletin Group Personal Pension Plan The Metal Bulletin Group Personal Pension Plan is a defined contribution arrangement under which contributions are paid by the employer and employees.
The scheme is closed to new members.
The plans assets are invested under trust in funds selected by members and held independently from the Groups finances.
The investment and administration of the plan is undertaken by Skandia Life Group.
Private schemes Institutional Investor LLC contributes to a 401 k savings and investment plan for its employees which is administered by an independent investment provider.
Employees are able to contribute up to 50% of salary maximum of $52,000 a year with the company matching up to 50% of the employee contributions, up to 6% of salary.
Defined benefit schemes The Group operates the Metal Bulletin plc Pension Scheme MBPS and participates in the Harmsworth Pension Scheme HPS, which is a scheme operated by Daily Mail and General Trust DMGT, both of which are now closed to new entrants.
In 2016, due to a change in DMGTs policy to allocate the assets and liabilities of DMGT groups defined benefit plan on a buy-out basis, the Groups share of HPSs liability was recognised at 30September 2016.
In October 2018, the High Court ruled in the Lloyds Banking Group case that UK pension schemes which had contracted out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme will need to equalise benefits for the effect of unequal Guaranteed Minimum Pensions GMP between men and women.
The judgement also provided comments on the method to be adopted to equalise these benefits.
Assuming that there is not a successful appeal, it is expected that the ruling will result in a non-cash past service charge.
Due to the timing of this ruling, DMGT cannot yet estimate the impact on HPS with any reasonable certainty until the Scheme Actuary has carried out a full impact assessment.
This is expected before the 2019 interim results announcement.
The MBPS had not contracted out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme, and so is not impacted by the October 2018 High Court ruling in the Lloyds Banking Group case.
Harmsworth Pension Scheme HPS is a multi-employer defined benefit scheme operated by DMGT and closed to further accrual.
A full actuarial valuation of the scheme is carried out triennially by the scheme actuary.
Prior to its closure to future accrual on 1 January 2016, DMGT made annual contributions of 12% or 18% of members basic pay depending on membership section to HPS.
Following the results of the latest triennial valuation as at 31 March 2016, DMGT agreed a Recovery Plan involving annual funding payments of 13.0m on 5 October 2016 to 2018, 16.2m on 5 October 2019 to 2025 and 76.2m on 5 October 2026.
DMGT considers that these contribution rates are sufficient to eliminate the deficit over the agreed period.
This Recovery Plan will be reviewed at the next triennial valuation due to be completed with an effective date of 31 March 2019.
In February 2014, DMGT agreed with the Trustees that should it continue its share buyback programme, it would make additional contributions to its schemes amounting to 20% of the value of shares purchased.
No contributions relating to this agreement were made in the years to 30 September 2017 and 2018.
Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 139 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 27 Retirement benefit schemes continued DMGT enabled the Trustees of HPS scheme to acquire a beneficial interest in a Limited Partnership investment vehicle LP.
The LP has been designed to facilitate payment of 10.8m as part of the deficit funding payments described above over the period to 2026.
In addition, the LP is required to make a final payment to the scheme of 149.9m, or the funding deficit within the scheme on an ongoing actuarial valuation basis at the end of the period to 2026 if this is less.
For funding purposes, HPSs interest in the LP is treated as an asset of the scheme and reduces the actuarial deficit within the scheme.
However, under IAS 19 Employee Benefits the LP is not included as an asset of the scheme and therefore is not included in the disclosures below.
DMGT expects to contribute approximately 18.3m to the scheme during the year to 30 September 2019 including the deficit funding payments described above.
The Euromoney Group expects to contribute 0.1m during the year to 30 September 2019.
The International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee, in its document IFRIC 14, has interpreted the extent to which a company can recognise a pension surplus on its Statement of Financial Position.
Having taken account of the rules of the schemes, the Group considers that recognition of surpluses in the schemes on its Statement of Financial Position would be in accordance with the interpretation of IFRIC 14.
Northcliffe Trustees Limited the Trustee has been appointed by DMGT as an independent trustee to administer and manage the HPS on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the HPS Trust Deed and Rules and relevant legislation principally the Pension Schemes Act 1993, the Pensions Act 1995 and the Pensions Act 2004.
Metal Bulletin Pension Scheme A full actuarial valuation of the defined benefit scheme is carried out triennially by the Scheme Actuary.
The latest valuation of the MBPS was completed as at 1 June 2016.
As a result of the 2016 valuation, the Group agreed to make annual contributions of 38.9% per annum of pensionable salaries, plus 55,900 per month to the scheme over the period to 2022.
The Group considers that the contributions set at the last valuation date are sufficient to eliminate the deficit and that regular contributions, which are based on service costs, will not increase significantly.
The Group expects to contribute approximately 0.7m to the MBPS during the year to 30 September 2019.
Pension Legacy Trustees Limited the Trustee has been appointed by Euromoney Global Limited as an independent trustee to administer and manage the MBPS on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the MBPS Trust Deed and Rules and relevant legislation principally the Pension Schemes Act 1993, the Pensions Act 1995 and the Pensions Act 2004.

All the assets listed above, excluding property and cash and cash equivalents, have a quoted market price in an active market.
The assets do not include any of the Groups own financial instruments nor any property occupied by, or other assets used by, the Group.
The actual return on plan assets was 2.3m 2017: 4.0m.
The key financial assumptions adopted are as follows: MBPS HPS 2018 2017 2018 2017 % % % % Discount rate 2.80 2.55 2.80 2.60 Price inflation 3.15 3.10 3.25 3.20 Salary increases 2.50 2.50 2.50 2.50 Pension increases 3.00 3.00 3.10 3.00 The discount rate for both scheme liabilities and the fair value of scheme assets reflects yields at the year-end date on high-quality corporate bonds and are based on a cash flow-based yield curve, calculating a single equivalent discount rate reflecting the average duration of the schemes liabilities, rounded to the nearest 0.05% p. a.
This methodology incorporated bonds given an AA rating from at least two of the four main rating agencies.
RPI inflation is derived in a similar way to the discount rate but with reference to the Bank of England spot curve at the duration of the schemes weighted average duration with an appropriate allowance for inflation risk premium MBPS: 0.30% p. a. HPS: 0.20% p. a..
The nominal and real spot curves provided by the Bank of England were extrapolated up to 50 years using a bootstrapping method which uses gilt price information provided by the UK Debt Management Office.
Mortality assumptions take account of scheme experience, and also allow for further improvements in life expectancy based on the Continuous Mortality Investigation CMI projections but with a long-term rate of improvement in future mortality rates of 1.25% p. a. and a smoothing parameter of 7.5.
Allowance is made for the extent to which employees have chosen to commute part of their pension for cash at retirement.
Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 141 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 27 Retirement benefit schemes continued The average duration of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the year is approximately 19 years for MBPS 2017: 16 years and 18 years for HPS 2017: 20 years.
MBPS HPS 1 Assumed life expectancy in years, on retirement 2018 2017 2018 2017 Retiring at the end of the reporting year: Males 26.3 26.9 26.2 26.4 Females 28.3 29.0 28.2 28.3 Retiring 20 years after the end of the reporting year: Males 27.8 28.8 26.7 26.8 Females 29.8 31.0 29.2 29.2 1 MPBS 62 years: HPS 60 years.
Pension costs and the size of any pension surplus or deficit are sensitive to the assumptions adopted.
The sensitivity of the defined obligation to changes in the weighted principal assumptions is: Change in Change in Assumption assumption liabilities Discount rate Increase by 0.1% Decrease by 0.6% Inflation rate Increase by 0.1% Increase by 1.0% Salary increases Increase by 0.25% Increase by 0.1% Life expectancy Increase by one year Increase by 3.5% The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions has been estimated by projecting the results of the last full actuarial valuation at 1 June 2016 forward to 30 September 2018.
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the previous period.
These are the significant risks in connection with running defined benefit schemes, and the key risks are detailed below: Discount rate risk The present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to high-quality corporate bond yields.
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the present value of the defined benefit obligation, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of corporate bonds held by the schemes.
Inflation rate risk A significant proportion of the defined benefit obligation is linked to inflation, therefore increased inflation will result in a higher defined benefit obligation.
The Trustees have sought to acquire certain assets with exposure to inflationary uplifts in order to negate a proportion of this risk.
Life expectancy risk The present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated with reference to the best estimate of the mortality of scheme members.
An increase in assumed life expectancy will result in an increase in the defined benefit obligation.
Regular reviews of mortality experience are performed to ensure life expectancy assumptions remain appropriate.
Investment risk This is a measure of the uncertainty that the return on the schemes assets keeps pace with the discount rate.
The schemes hold a significant proportion of equities and similar growth assets, which are expected to outperform the discount rate in the long-term.
28 Contingent liabilities Claims in Malaysia Four writs claiming damages for libel were issued in Malaysia against the Group and three of its employees in respect of an article published in one of the Groups magazines, International Commercial Litigation, in November 1995.
The writs were served on the Group on 22 October 1996.
Two of these writs have been discontinued.
The total outstanding amount claimed on the two remaining writs is Malaysian ringgit 83.4m 15.5m.
No provision has been made for these claims in these Financial Statements as the Directors do not believe the Group has any material liability in respect of these writs.
European Commission Inspection In January 2018, the European Commission conducted an unannounced inspection at the Brussels office of RISI Sprl RISI, a wholly owned subsidiary within the Group, as part of an investigation into the sector of kraft paper and industrial paper sacks in the European Union European Economic Area.
A provision is made for the outcome of tax, legal and other disputes where it is both probable that the Group will suffer an outflow of funds and it is possible to make a reliable estimate of that outflow.
No proceedings have been issued and the Group is unable to make a reliable estimate of any potential liability.
Therefore, no provision has been recognised.
