Deferred stripping In certain mining operations, rock or soil overlying a mineral deposit, known as overburden, and other waste materials must be removed to access the orebody.
The process of removing overburden and other mine waste materials is referred to as stripping.
The Group defers stripping costs onto the balance sheet where they are considered to improve access to ore in future periods.
Where the amount to be capitalised cannot be specifically identified it is determined based on the volume of waste extracted compared with expected volume for the identified component of the orebody.
This determination is dependent on an individual mines design and Life of Mine Plan and therefore changes to the design or Life ofMine Plan will result in changes to these estimates.
Identification of the components of a mines orebody is made by reference to the Life of Mine Plan.
Theassessment depends on a range of factors including each mines specific operational features and materiality.
