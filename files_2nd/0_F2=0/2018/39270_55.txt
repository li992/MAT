130 Notes to the Financial Statements A13.
Income tax expense Income tax expense for the period includes both current and deferred tax.
Current tax expense represents the amount payable on this years taxable profits and any adjustment relating to prior years.
Deferred tax is an accounting adjustment to provide for tax that is expected to arise in the future due to differences between accounting and tax bases.
Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income.
In this case the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Companys subsidiaries and associates operate and generate taxable income.

This compares with a blended rate of tax for the countries in which the Group operates of 22% 2017: 24%.
The Groups ETR is expected to remain above the UK tax rate due to the proportion of overseas profits which are taxed at a higher rate than UK profits.
We expect our ETR for 2019 to be similar to 2018.
We are not currently expecting any material change over the medium term.
