Dividend tax allowance In respect of UK shareholders, from April 2018 the annual tax-free allowance on dividend income across an individuals entire share portfolio has reduced from 5,000 to 2,000.
Above this amount, individuals pay tax on their dividend income at a rate dependent on their income tax bracket and personal circumstances.
Shareholders should seek independent financial advice as to how this change will impact their personal tax obligations.
The Company will continue to provide registered shareholders with a confirmation of the dividends paid by SIG plc and this should be included with any other dividend income received when calculating and reporting total dividend income received.
It is the shareholders responsibility to include all dividend income when calculating any tax liability.
If you have any tax queries, please contact a financial advisor.
WEBSITE AND ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS Shareholders receive notification of the availability of the results to view or download on the Groups website www.

We encourage our shareholders to accept all shareholder communications and documents electronically instead of receiving paper copies by post as this helps to reduce the environmental impact by saving on paper and also reduces distribution costs.
