At 31 December 2018, a review of the future operating cashflows of SIG Trading Limited using the following year's budget as a base, taking into account current economic conditions, a headroom of 165.5m exists.
For there to be no headroom, sales would have to reduce by 6.6% or gross margin would have to reduce by 150bps.
The Group considers that a reasonably possible scenario would be a 50bps reduction in gross margin.
If this arose, no impairment would be required.
A more detailed sensitivity analysis of the Group's significant CGUs is given on page 147, Note 12 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
