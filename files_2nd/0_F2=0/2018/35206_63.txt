Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 24.
Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures The Groups financial instruments comprise cash deposits, bank loans and overdrafts, finance lease obligations, derivatives used for hedging purposes and trade receivables and payables.
Treasury Policy The Group reports in Sterling and pays dividends out of Sterling profits.
The role of the Groups treasury activities is to manage and monitor the Groups external and internal funding requirements and change to financing risks in support of the Groups corporate activities.
The Board of Directors has approved a policy which governs all treasury activities.
The Group uses a variety of financial instruments, including derivatives, to finance its operations and to manage market risks from these operations.
Derivatives, principally comprising forward foreign currency contracts, foreign currency options and interest rate swaps, are used to hedge against changes in foreign currencies and interest rates.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are also used in the management of foreign currency risk.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes and the Groups treasury policy specifically prohibits such activity.
All transactions in financial instruments are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities, not for speculation.
Capital Management The capital structure of the Group consists of net borrowings and shareholders equity.
At 30 June 2018, net borrowing was 211.4 million 2017: net borrowing was 120.0 million, whilst shareholders equity was 505.0 million 2017: 302.6 million.
The Group maintains a strong capital base so as to maintain investors, creditors and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Group manages its capital structure to maintain a prudent balance between debt and equity that allows sufficient headroom to finance the Groups product development programme and appropriate acquisitions.
There were no changes in the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
The Group operates globally, primarily through subsidiary companies established in the markets in which the Group trades.
The Groups operating subsidiaries are generally cash generative and none are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
There are financial covenants associated with the Groups borrowings, which are interest cover, and net debt to underlying EBITDA.
The Group complied with these covenants in 2018 and 2017.
Operating cash flow is used to fund investment in the development of new products as well as to make the routine outflows of capital expenditure, tax, dividends and repayment of maturing debt.
The Groups policy is to maintain borrowing facilities centrally which are then used to finance the Groups operating subsidiaries, either by way of equity investments or loans.
Financial Risk Management The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: liquidity risk market risk credit risk This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, and the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk.
Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not have sufficient funds to meet liabilities as they fall due.
Cash flows and covenants of the Group are monitored half yearly.
These are reviewed to ensure sufficient financial headroom exists for at least a 12 month period.
The Group manages its funding requirements through the following lines of credit: 235.0 million multi-currency revolving credit facility, with an accordion of 125.0 million: 350.0 million Term Loan facility: 6.9 million bank loans: and various finance leases.
The Groups revised borrowing facilities at 30 June 2018 are detailed in note 21.

Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures continued Market Risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates or interest rates, will affect the Groups income or the value of its holding of financial instruments.
Interest Rate Risk Management The majority of the Groups borrowings bear interest at floating rates linked to base rate or LIBOR and are consequently exposed to cash flow interest rate risk.
Foreign Exchange Risk Management Foreign currency transaction exposure arising on normal trade flows is not hedged.
The Group matches receipts and payments in the relevant foreign currencies as far as possible.
To this end, bank accounts are maintained for all the major currencies in which the Group trades.
Translational exposure in converting the income statements of foreign subsidiaries into the Groups presentational currency of Sterling is not hedged.
The Group hedges selectively expected currency cash flows outside normal trading activities.
The Group has designated a US Dollar loan of $97.0 million as a net investment hedge of US Dollar net assets.
Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
The Group considers its maximum credit risk to be 79.0 million 2017: 65.2 million, which is the total carrying value of the Groups financial assets excluding cash and cash equivalents.
Cash is only deposited with highly rated banks in line with our treasury policy.
The Group offers trade credit to customers in the normal course of business.
Trade and bank references are obtained prior to extending credit.
Our principal customers are pharmaceutical wholesalers and distributors.
The failure of a large wholesaler could have a material adverse impact on the Groups financial results.
The largest customer of the Group sits within the NA Pharmaceuticals segment and accounted for approximately 21.2% of gross trade receivables at 30 June 2018 2017: 15.4%.
This customer accounted for 19.8% 2017: 18.5% of total Group revenues.
One other customer accounted for more than 10% of total Group revenues 2017: one.
Receivables are written off when management considers the debt to be no longer recoverable.
Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities The following table presents the carrying amounts and the fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities at 30 June 2018 and 30 June 2017.
The following assumptions were used to estimate the fair values: Cash and cash equivalents approximated to the carrying amount.
Forward exchange contracts based on market price and exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
Available for sale financial instruments based on the market rates at year end.
Derivatives Interest rate swaps based upon the amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the instrument at the balance sheet date, being the market price of the instrument.
Receivables and payables approximated to the carrying amount.
Bank loans and overdrafts based upon discounted cash flows using discount rates based upon facility rates renegotiated at the year end.
Finance lease obligations based upon discounted cash flows using discount rates based upon the Groups cost of borrowing at the balance sheet date.

Foreign Currency Risk The Group has significant cash flows and net financial assets and liabilities in Danish Krone, US Dollar and Euro.
The Group does not hedge either economic exposure or the translation exposure arising from the profits of non-Sterling businesses.
The Group is hedging certain foreign currency translations through the designation of a US Dollar loan as a net investment hedge of US Dollar net assets.
During 2018, we have been exposed to transactional and translational currency risk.
In addition to the one-off transactional gain of 1.3 million being recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, 0.4 million foreign exchange loss translational impact was recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year.
As part of our acquisition strategy, we seek to balance the foreign exchange debt and related interest payable risk associated with non-Sterling acquisitions with the underlying related income and assets in foreign currencies.
The following table shows the impact on the Groups profit after taxation of a 10% appreciation of Sterling against each of these currencies compared to the rates prevailing at the year end date.
In this analysis, only financial assets and liabilities held on the balance sheet at the year end are assessed and are only considered sensitive to foreign exchange rates where they are not in the functional currency of the entity that holds them.
There is no impact on other equity reserves.
