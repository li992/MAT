Notes to the consolidated financial statements For the year ended 30 September 2018 1.
General information Countryside Properties PLC the Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom whose shares are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The Companys registered office is Countryside House, The Drive, Brentwood, Essex CM13 3AT.
The Groups principal activities are building new homes and regeneration of public sector land.
The parent company financial statements are on pages 124 to 128.
Critical accounting judgements and estimates The preparation of the Groups financial statements under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS requires the Directors to make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, expenses and related disclosures.
Critical accounting judgements In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, which are described in Note 3, the Directors have made no individual judgements that have a significant impact on the financial statements, apart from those involving estimates which are described below.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty Estimates and underlying assumptions affecting the financial statements are based on historical experience and other relevant factors and are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
This approach forms the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Changes in accounting estimates may be necessary if there are changes in the circumstances on which the estimate was based oras a result of new information.
Such changes are recognised in the year in which the estimate is revised.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities are described below.
Estimation of site profitability and carrying value of inventory In order to determine the profit or loss that the Group recognises on its developments and construction contracts in a specific period, the Group allocates the total cost of each development or construction contract between the proportion completing in the period and the proportion to complete in a future period.
The assessment of the total costs to be incurred requires a degree of estimation due to the long-term nature of the Groups activities and because actual costs are subject to market fluctuations.
Group management has established internal controls to review and ensure the appropriateness of estimates made on an individual development or contract basis.
No individual development or contract is sufficiently large that a plausible change in estimates would result in a material change to the Groups results.
However, a change in estimated margins on several sites due, for example, to changes in estimates of cost inflation or a material reduction in house prices in the private market could materially alter future profitability.
As an illustration, a change in margins of 5% across all sites in 2018 would have changed gross profits by an estimated 60m.
Accounting policies Basis of preparation These financial statements for the year to 30 September 2018 are those of the Company and all of its subsidiaries.
They have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRS IC interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis in Sterling and rounded to the nearest 0.1m under the historical cost convention, except for available-for-sale financial assets, share-based payments and for certain other assets and liabilities recognised at fair value inbusiness combinations.
Prior year restatement Following the review of the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts by the Financial Reporting Council described on page 30, the directors have concluded that, in applying IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, the discount rates applied to liabilities for deferred land and overage payments should not have been changed subsequent to their initial recognition.
As a result, 2017 net finance costs were overstated by 6.0m and profit after tax and net assets, taking into account also tax and the impact on joint ventures, were understated by 5.3m.
The comparatives for 2017 have been restated accordingly and the impact on affected line items is set out in the below table: 2017 2017 Restated Original m m Finance costs 12.3 18.3 Share of post-tax profit from associates and joint ventures 30.3 29.7 Profit before income tax 148.3 141.7 Income tax expense 25.4 24.1 Profit for the year 122.9 117.6 Investment in joint ventures 59.4 58.8 Current income tax liabilities 7.1 5.8 Current trade and other payables 250.5 251.9 Non-current trade and other payables 79.8 84.4 Net assets 690.5 685.2 Earnings per share basic 27.2 26.0 Earnings per share adjusted 27.0 25.8 90 Annual report 2018 Countryside Properties PLC Financial statements 3.
Accounting policies continued Prior year restatement continued In addition, in our interim results we updated our policy on non-underlying items to include the amortisation of acquisition related intangibles.
This change was made as, in the opinion of the Directors, the new policy allows for a better reflection of the underlying results of the Group.
As a result ofthis, the prior year results have been re-presented to show 1.2m of amortisation within non-underlying items.
Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 31.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described on pages 28 to 31 of the Strategic Report.
Further disclosures regarding borrowings are provided in Note 24.
As described in the Viability Statement, the Directors have assessed the prospects and viability of the Company over a three-year period to September 2021.
The Board has performed a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Company, including those risks that would threaten Countrysides business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
Having considered the Groups cash flow forecasts, the Directors are satisfied the Group has sufficient liquidity and covenant headroom to enable theGroup to conduct its business and meet its liabilities as they fall due for at least the next 12 months.
Accordingly these financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis.
New standards, amendments and interpretations No new standards, amendments or interpretations effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on 1 October 2017 have had a material impact on the financial statements.
The following amendments to standards and interpretations which will be relevant to the preparation of the Groups financial statements have been issued, but are not effective and have not been early adopted for the financial year ended 30 September 2018: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, on Classification and Measurement effective 1 October 2018 addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities.
It replaces the guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification and measurement of financial instruments.
IFRS 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement categories for financial assets: amortised cost, fair value through Other Comprehensive Income and fair value through Profit and Loss P&L.
Given our historic experience of default rates and assessment of expected future losses and based on the profile of our receivables, it is not expected that this change will have a material impact on the reported results ofthe Group.
Items currently classified as available-for-sale financial assets will be classified as held at fair value through profit and loss on transition to IFRS 9.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers effective 1 October 2018 deals with revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entitys contracts with customers.
Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has the ability todirect the use and obtain the benefits from the good or service.
The Group currently recognises revenue either at legal completion or over time, depending on the nature of the activity and in line with IAS 18, IAS 11 and IFRIC 15 which are replaced by IFRS 15, and has concluded that its approach will not be changed by the introduction of the new standard.
It is not expected that this change will have a material impact on the reported results of the Group.
The only impact of this standard is that the Group will recognise revenue on the sale of part exchanged properties which in 2018 would have resulted in c. 12m of additional revenue being recognised.
Previously, such sales were recognised within cost of sales and there will be no change to reported profits.
IFRS 16 Leases effective 1 October 2019 addresses the definition of a lease, recognition and measurement of leases and establishes principles for reporting useful information to users of financial statements about the leasing activities of both lessees and lessors.
A key change arising from IFRS 16 is that most operating leases will be accounted for on balance sheet for lessees.
The standard replaces IAS 17 Leases and related interpretations.
The Group is currently undertaking a detailed exercise to determine the impact of this standard on the Groups results.
The principal impact on theGroup is likely to be the recognition of additional leasing assets and liabilities, although the net impact on net assets and profit is not expected tobe material.
There are no IFRSs or IFRS IC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group for the financial year beginning 1 October 2018.
Countryside Properties PLC Annual report 2018 91 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 30 September 2018 3.
Accounting policies continued Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are entities which the Group has the power to control.
The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to govern the financial and operating policies so as to obtain economic benefits from its activities.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are consolidated in the financial statements using the acquisition method of accounting from the date on which control is obtained up until the date that control ceases.
Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the income statement, the statement of changes in equity and the statement of financial position.
Where the accounting policies of a subsidiary or equity-accounted investee do not conform in all material respects to those of the Group, adjustments are made on consolidation to reflect the accounting policies of the Group.
Intragroup transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated in preparing the financial statements.
Gains arising from transactions with joint arrangements and associate are eliminated as described below.
Associate and joint ventures An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence but does not exercise control or joint control.
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method.
Where the Group collaborates with other entities on a development or contract, a judgement is made of the nature of the relationship and, where there is joint control as described by IFRS 11, the arrangement is classified as a joint arrangement and accounted for using the equity method forjoint ventures or on the basis of the Groups proportional share of the arrangements assets, liabilities, revenues and costs for joint operations.
The Groups joint ventures are disclosed in Note 14.
Under the equity method of accounting, interests in the associate and joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Groups share of the post-acquisition profits or losses and movements in other comprehensive income.
When the Groups share of losses in an associate or joint venture equals or exceeds its interests in the associate or joint venture, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.
Unrealised losses arising on transactions between the Group and its associate and joint ventures are eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
The Group funds its associate and joint ventures through a combination of equity investment and shareholder loans.
The Directors review the recoverability ofinvestments and shareholder loans for impairment annually.
Where an investment is held in an associate or joint venture which has net liabilities, the investment is held at nil and other long-term interests, such as shareholder loans, are reduced by the value equal to the net liabilities, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of its associate or joint ventures.
Purchase of shares by Employee Benefit Trust From time to time, the Employee Benefit Trust EBT purchases shares of the Company in order to hold an appropriate level of shares towards the future settlement of outstanding share-related incentives on behalf of the Group.
The EBT is funded directly by the Group and no cash is retained in the EBT.
The EBT waives its dividend and voting rights in respect of the shares it holds.
The purchase value of EBT shares is charged to retained earnings.
Business combinations All acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.
The cost of an acquisition is the aggregate of the fair values of the assetstransferred, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued at the date of acquisition.
The consideration transferred includes thefairvalue of the asset or liability resulting from a deferred or contingent consideration arrangement, unless that arrangement is dependent oncontinued employment of the beneficiaries.
Costs directly relating to an acquisition are expensed to the income statement.
The identified assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at their fair value at the date of acquisition.
The excess of cost of acquisition over the aggregate fair value of the Groups share of the net identified assets plus identified intangible assets is recorded as goodwill.
Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration on acquisition of a subsidiary over the interest in net fair value of the identifiable net assets and contingent liabilities acquired.
If the total consideration transferred is less than the fair value of the net assets acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
An impairment review is carried out annually or when circumstances arise that may indicate an impairment is likely.
The carrying value of goodwill is compared to its recoverable amount, being the higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal.
Any impairment is charged immediately to the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the cash generating units CGUs, or groups of CGUs, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.

Accounting policies continued Intangible assets continued Brands The Group carries assets on the balance sheet for brands that have been acquired.
Internally generated brands are not recognised.
Cost is determined at acquisition as being directly attributable cost or, where relevant, by using an appropriate valuation method.
Acquired brands are tested for impairment when a triggering event is identified.
Acquired brands are amortised over a period of between five and 20 years.
Customer-related assets The Group carries customer-related intangible assets on the balance sheet resulting from acquisitions.
Internally generated relationships are not recognised.
These assets are recognised at fair value.
The assets are tested for impairment when a triggering event is identified and amortised over aperiod of between two and a half and ten years.
Software Computer software that generates an economic benefit of greater than one year is recognised as an intangible asset and carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Computer software costs that are recognised as assets are amortised on a straight line basis over their economic useful life of four or five years.
These are reviewed for impairment at such time as there is a change in circumstances due to which the carrying value may no longer be recoverable.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any applicable impairment losses.
Depreciation is charged at rates to write off the cost of the asset to its residual value on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.
The applicable annual rates are: Plant and machinery 20 per cent to 25 per cent Fixtures and fittings 10 per cent The Group does not own any land or buildings considered to be non-trade related.
The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: loans and receivables: and available for sale.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired.
Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
Financial assets are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or the Group transfers substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period.
These are classified as non-current assets.
The Groups loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative assets that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories.
They are included in non-current assets unless the investment matures or management intends to dispose of it within 12 months of the end of the reporting period.
Prior to sale in 2018, equity share scheme loans were classified as available-for-sale financial assets and were initially recorded at fair value net of transaction costs.
Fair value was assessed annually with gains and losses being recognised directly in the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income until the loan was repaid.
The loans were discounted at an interest rate equivalent to market rate.
On repayment the accumulated fair value, which had been recognised in the consolidated statement of changes in equity, was recognised in the income statement.
If a loan was determined to be impaired, any impairment loss was recognised immediately in the income statement.
Increases in the fair value of available-for-sale assets are initially deferred and recorded within reserves.
Reductions in the fair value of available-for-sale assets are recorded as a reduction in reserves, to the extent available, with any additional reduction recorded in the income statement.
The net deferral of increases in fair value are disclosed in the available-for-sale reserve.
Inventories Inventories are normally stated at cost or fair value if acquired as part of a business combination and held at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Costs comprise direct materials, applicable direct labour and those overheads incurred to bring the inventories to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value represents estimated selling price less all estimated costs to sell, including sales and marketing costs.
Land options purchased are initially stated at cost.
Option costs are written off on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the option and are also subject to impairment review.
Impairment reviews are performed when circumstances arise which indicate an impairment is likely, such as a refusal of planning permission.
Any impairments are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Upon exercise, the unamortised balance of options is included within the value of inventory.
Land inventory is recognised when the substantial risks and rewards of ownership transfer to the Group after unconditional exchange of contracts.
Where land is purchased with deferred payment terms, a corresponding liability is recognised within trade and other payables.
Pre-contract expenditure is capitalised where it is probable that a contract will be signed or otherwise is recognised as an expense within costs of sales in the income statement.
Provisions for inventories are made, where appropriate, to reduce the value of inventories and work in progress to their net realisable value.
Countryside Properties PLC Annual report 2018 93 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 30 September 2018 3.
Accounting policies continued Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less any provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment is established when the carrying value of the receivable exceeds the present value of the future cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate.
The carrying value of the receivable is reduced and any impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
If collection is expected in one year or less, receivables are classified as current assets.
If not, they are classified as non-current assets.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and other short-term deposits held by the Group with maturities of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts are classified within current liabilities.
Trade payables Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated initially at their fair value and subsequently amortised cost.
Where land is purchased on deferred settlement terms the land and associated liability are discounted to their fair value.
The discount to fair value is amortised over the period of the credit term and charged to finance costs using the effective interest rate method.
Changes in estimates of the final payment due are capitalised into inventory and, in due course, to cost of sales in the income statement.
Trade payables also include liabilities in respect of land overage where the Group is committed to make contractual payments to land vendors related to the performance of the development in the future.
Land overage is estimated based on expected future cash flows in relation to relevant developments and, where payment will take place in more than one year, is discounted.
Deposits received from customers relating to sales of new properties are classified within current trade payables.
Trade payables are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less.
If not, they are classified as non-current liabilities.
Borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded initially at their fair value and bank loans are reported net of direct transaction costs to the extent that borrowings are available for offset.
Such instruments are subsequently carried at their amortised cost and finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption, are amortised over the term of the instrument using the effective interest rate method.
The excess of unamortised borrowing costs is disclosed within prepayments.
Bank loans are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the date of the statement of financial position.
Overdrafts are classified as current liabilities.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal obligation as a result of a past event which it is probable will result in an outflow of economic benefits that can be reliably estimated.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the provision is discounted at the pre-tax discount rate that reflects the risks specific to the liability.
Provisions for onerous leases are recognised when the foreseeable net cash outflows on a lease exceed the benefits derived from the lease which has more than one year before expiring or option to exercise a break.
Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in share premium as a deduction from the proceeds.
Where any Group company holds shares in the Companys equity share capital, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs, is deducted from equity until the shares are cancelled or reissued.
Offsetting financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Revenue Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of applicable value-added tax, Stamp Duty Land Tax, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group.
The Groups two divisions Partnerships and Housebuilding operate a range of legal and contractual structures which are tailored to the land structure and parties to the contract.
Our recognition of revenue reflects the underlying nature of these contracts, as described below in more detail by category.
We generically refer to our arrangements with housing associations and local authorities as partnerships, but this should not be taken to mean that all of these arrangements are accounted for as joint arrangements or take the legal form of partnerships see policy on joint ventures separately below.
Private housing Revenue is recognised in the income statement on legal completion at the fair value of the consideration received.
Part exchange In certain instances, property may be accepted in part consideration for a sale of a residential property.
The fair value is established by independent surveyors, reduced for cost to sell.
Differences between net proceeds received and fair value are recorded as a reduction increase in cost of sales.
Theoriginal sale is recorded in the normal way, with the fair value of the exchanged property replacing cash receipts.
Cash incentives Cash incentives are considered to be a discount from the purchase price offered to the acquirer and are therefore accounted for as a reduction torevenue.
94 Annual report 2018 Countryside Properties PLC Financial statements 3.
Accounting policies continued Revenue continued Land and commercial sales The Group assesses the terms of sale arrangements and, based on this assessment, applies either IAS 18 or IAS 11 as appropriate.
Typically, revenue is recognised when substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the land or commercial property transfer to the buyer, generally when there is an unconditional exchange of contracts.
In some cases, however, revenue is recognised on a stage of completion basis in accordance with the principles of IAS 11 as noted below.
Revenue is measured as the fair value of consideration received or receivable.
Affordable housing and private rental sector contracts Contract revenue and costs are recognised in accordance with IAS 11 Construction Contracts.
Where the outcome of a long-term contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date.
This is normally measured by surveys of work performed to date.
Variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments are included to the extent that it is probable that they will result in revenue and they are capable of being reliably measured.
Where the outcome of a long-term contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs incurred that it is probable will be recoverable.
Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised immediately in the income statement within cost of sales.
Project management services Revenue earned for the provision of project management services, typically to the Groups joint ventures and associate, are recognised on an accruals basis in line with the underlying contract.
Cost of sales For sales of private housing, the Group determines the value of inventory charged to cost of sales based on the total forecast cost of developing a site.
Once the total expected costs of development are established they are allocated to individual plots to achieve a build cost per plot.
These costs are recognised within cost of sales when the related revenue is recognised in accordance with the Groups revenue recognition policy.
To the extent that additional costs or savings are identified as the site progresses, these are recognised over the remaining plots unless they are specific to a particular plot, in which case they are recognised in the income statement at the point of sale.
For land and commercial property sales, cost of sales represents the carrying value of the related inventory on the Groups statement of financial position and this is recognised within cost of sales when revenue is recognised in accordance with the Groups revenue recognition policy.
As outlined above, costs in relation to the sale of affordable housing and private rental sector contracts are recognised in accordance with IAS 11.
Leases Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable and incentives receivable under operating leases are recognised on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Finance costs and finance income Borrowing costs Borrowing costs in relation to the Groups debt facility are recognised on an accruals basis.
Also included in borrowing costs is the amortisation of fees associated with the arrangement of the financing.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
The Group does not capitalise borrowing costs into developments.
Unwind of discounting The finance cost associated with the time value of money on discounted receivables and payables is recognised within finance income and costs as the discount unwinds over the life of the relevant item.
Current and deferred income taxation Income tax comprises current and deferred tax.
Current taxation The current taxation payable is based on taxable profit for the period which differs from accounting profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and those items never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is measured using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and their corresponding tax values used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction which affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated at the substantively enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled based upon tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in comprehensive income, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities andwhen the Group intends to settle the balances on a net basis.
Countryside Properties PLC Annual report 2018 95 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 30 September 2018 3.
Accounting policies continued Segment reporting Segment reporting is presented in the consolidated financial statements in respect of the Groups business segments.
Segmental reporting reflects theGroups management structure and primary basis of internal reporting.
Segmental results include items directly attributable to the segment, as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
The chief operating decision-maker CODM has been identified as the Groups Executive Committee.
The CODM reviews the Groups internal reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources.
The CODM assesses the performance of the operating segments based on adjusted operating profit and tangible net operating asset values TNOAV.
Pension plans The Group operates a defined contribution pension plan.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions to a separate entity.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they fall due.
Share-based payments The Group provides benefits to employees including Directors of the Group in the form of equity-settled share-based awards, whereby employees render services in exchange for rights over shares.
For equity-settled share-based payments, the fair value of the employee services rendered is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares awarded or options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
Allshare options are valued using an option-pricing model Black Scholes or Monte Carlo.
This fair value is charged to the income statement over thevesting period of the share-based awards.
Countryside Properties PLC invoices its subsidiary undertakings an amount equivalent to the fair value of the grant by the Company of options over itsequity instruments to the employees of subsidiaries.
The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised over the vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity.
The Group does not operate any cash-settled share-based payment plans.
Non-underlying items Certain items which do not relate to the Groups underlying performance are presented separately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as non-underlying items where, in the judgement of the Directors, they need to be disclosed separately by virtue of their nature, size or incidence in order to obtain a clear and consistent presentation of the Groups underlying business performance.
As these non-underlying items can vary significantly from year to year they create volatility in reported earnings.
In addition, the Directors believe that in discussing the performance of the Group, the results of joint ventures and associate should be proportionally consolidated, including the Groups share of revenue, operating profit and TNOAV given their importance to the Groups operations.
As such, the Directors believe that the adjusted revenue, adjusted Group operating profit and adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share measures presented provide a clear and consistent presentation of the underlying performance of the Groups ongoing business for shareholders.
Adjusted Group operating profit is not defined by IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable with the adjusted or underlying profit measures of other companies.
Examples of material and non-recurring items which may give rise to disclosure as non-underlying items are: costs incurred directly in relation to business combinations or capital market transactions including advisory costs, one-off integration costs and employment-related deferred consideration costs: adjustments to the statement of financial position that do not relate to trading activity such as the recognition and reversal of non-trade impairments: accelerated write off of unamortised issue costs on the re-financing of borrowings: and the costs of Group restructuring exercises.
In addition, the amortisation of acquisition-related intangible assets is treated as a non-underlying item.
Adjusted Group operating profit is one of the key measures used by the Board to monitor Groups performance.
Dividends Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Dividends payable are recorded in the period in which they are approved or paid, whichever is earliest.
96 Annual report 2018 Countryside Properties PLC Financial statements 4.
Segmental reporting Segmental reporting is presented in respect of the Groups business segments reflecting the Groups management and internal reporting structure and is the basis on which strategic operating decisions are made by the Groups Chief Operating Decision-Maker CODM.
The Groups two business segments are Partnerships and Housebuilding: these are described below and in more detail in the Strategic Report, in particular on pages 10, 20 and 24.
The Partnerships division specialises in medium to large-scale housing regeneration schemes delivering private and affordable homes in partnership withpublic sector land owners and operates primarily in and around London, the West Midlands and the North West of England.
The Housebuilding division develops large-scale sites, providing private and affordable housing on land owned or controlled by the Group, primarily around London and in the South-East of England, operating under both the Countryside and Millgate brands.
Segmental adjusted operating profit and segmental operating profit include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Central head office costs have been allocated between the segments using a percentage of units sold basis.
Items below Group operating profit have not been allocated.
This methodology differs from that applied in previous years, where central head office costs were allocated using a percentage of revenue basis.
The change, which was made from 1 April 2018, was made on the basis that the units sold basis is judged by the Directors to be a better reflection of the degree of support provided from head office to the segments.
The results of prior years have not been re-presented.
Had the 2018 results been presented on the same basis as 2017, the segment result for Housebuilding would have been 1.6m lower, with a corresponding increase in the segment result of Partnerships.
The measurement of Group operating profit is unaffected.

Impairment testing Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.
The recoverable amount has been determined as the value in use of the applicable CGU or group of CGUs, assessed on the basis of current five-year cash flow forecasts.
Forecast cash flows are derived from the most recent Board-approved five-year plan which takes into account current market trends and the Groups growth plans.
Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 1 per cent per annum.
Cash flows generated by the CGUs are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate as described below.
None of the goodwill assets considered at 30 September 2018 was deemed to be impaired.
The key assumptions incorporated into each assets impairment review include the below: 1. those underlying our ca sh flow forecasts, relating to our expectations surrounding economic activity, planned changes to our business model and expected regulatory and tax changes.
2. the most appropriate discount rate for each CGU or group of CGUs, reflecting the estimated risk profile of the CGU or group of CGUs.
The discount rate applied to the Copthorn Holdings and Millgate CGUs was 10.1%.
The discount rate applied to the Westleigh CGU was 16.6%.
Sensitivity analysis has been undertaken on each goodwill impairment review, by changing the discount rates, profit margins, growth rates and other variables applicable to each CGU.
For CGUs reviewed at 30 September 2018, no impairment would occur under any reasonably possible changes in assumptions upon which the recoverable amount was estimated.

A profit of 1.0m was recognised within cost of sales, including a reclassification from reserves as presented below: 2018 Shared Equity Disposal m Cash and deferred consideration 8.0 Less: carrying value of asset on disposal 7.4 Profit on disposal before reclassification of amounts held in reserves 0.6 Reclassification from reserve 0.4 Profit on disposal recognised in income statement 1.0 In previous years and until their derecognition during the year, the available-for-sale financial assets comprised loans advanced to homebuyers to assist in the purchase of their property under shared equity schemes.
The loans were secured by either a first or second legal charge over the property and were either interest free or had interest chargeable from the fifth or tenth year onwards, dependent upon the scheme under which the loans were issued.
The assets were held at fair value, representing the current market value of the properties held discounted to fair value, based on the redemption date of the loan.
These loans were subject to credit risk, where loans might potentially not be repaid if the borrower defaulted on repayment.
An adjustment for credit risk was built into the calculation by using a discount rate equivalent for home loans, which rank behind mortgages.
The estimated value took into consideration movements in house prices, the anticipated timing of the repayment of the asset and associated credit risk.
As the precise valuation and timing of the redemption of these assets was uncertain, the Group applied assumptions based upon extant market conditions and the Groups experience of actual cash flows resulting from these transactions.
These assumptions were reviewed at the end of each financial year as part of the impairment review conducted by the Directors.
The difference between the estimated future value and the initial fair value was credited to finance income over the term of the loan.
The inputs used were by nature estimated and the resultant fair value was classified as Level3 under the fair value hierarchy.
Overage receivable Available-for-sale financial assets at 30 September 2018 relate solely to a deferred land overage receivable.
These reflect sums which the Group is virtually certain toreceive, resulting from agreements where land has been sold to a third party and in which the Group is entitled to a share of surplus profits once development is completed on the land sold.
The carrying value of the receivable will be adjusted to fair value at each reporting date and it is expected that this balance will be recovered in the year to 30 September 2020.
The overage receivable is held at fair value that is, the Directors best estimate of the value that could be achieved in a presumed sale ofthese assets to a third party, after taking into account judgements of the variability of the expected final cash value, the time value of money and thedegree of completion of the developments.
Given that the inputs are estimated and not observed in a market, the fair value is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

As at 30 September 2018, deferred land payments totalled 180.5m, including 52.9m of overage payable 2017: 166.0m, of which 41.3m overage.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade payables approximates to their fair value, as the impact of discounting is not significant.
Land acquired on deferred payment terms is discounted using an interest rate of 3.4 per cent for transactions entered into from 1 April 2017 and 6 per cent for transactions prior to this date.
Other payables include acquisition related deferred consideration along with acquisition-related deferred remuneration.

The different levels have been defined as follows: Level 1: Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices orindirectly that is, derived from prices.
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs.

Financial instruments continued Fair value estimation continued There were no transfers between levels during the year.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market for example, over-the-counter derivatives is determined by using valuation techniques.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates.
If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2.
If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.
Financial risk management The main financial risks associated with the Group have been identified as liquidity risk, interest rate risk, housing market risk and credit risk.
The Directors are responsible for managing these risks and the policies adopted are set out below.
Liquidity risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of equity Company share capital, reserves and retained earnings and debt bank loan facilities.
The Group manages its liquidity risk by monitoring its existing facilities for both financial covenant compliance and funding headroom against forecast requirements based on short-term and long-term cash flow forecasts.

Countryside Properties PLC Annual report 2018 119 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 30 September 2018 30.
Financial risk management continued Interest rate risk Interest rate risk reflects the Groups exposure to fluctuations in interest rates in the market.
This risk arises from bank loans that are drawn under theGroups loan facilities with variable interest rates based upon UK LIBOR.
For the year ended 30 September 2018 it is estimated that an increase by0.5per cent in interest rates would have decreased the Groups profit before tax by 0.3m 2017: 0.4m.
The following table sets out the interest rate risk associated with the Groups financial liabilities at 30 September 2018: Fixed Floating Non-interest Total rate rate bearing m m m m 2018 Liabilities Bank loans, other loans and finance cost 2.2 2.2 Trade and other payables 3.0 254.7 257.7 Amounts due to joint ventures 0.4 0.4 3.0 257.3 260.3 2017 Liabilities Bank loans, other loans and finance cost Trade and other payables restated 223.0 223.0 Amounts due to joint ventures 0.3 0.3 223.3 223.3 With the exception of cash and cash equivalents amounting to 47.2m 2017:77.4m and other taxation and social security 9.5m 2017: 5.4m, thefinancial assets of the Group amounting to 225.3m 2017: 215.7m are all non-interest bearing.
The Group has no exposure to foreign currency risk.
Housing market risk The Group is affected by price fluctuations in the UK housing market.
These are in turn affected by the wider economic conditions such as mortgage availability and associated interest rates, employment and consumer confidence.
Whilst these risks are beyond the Groups ultimate control, risk is spread across business activities undertaken by the Group and the geographic regions in which it operates.
Credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk is limited solely to the United Kingdom for housebuilding activities and by the fact that the Group receives cash at the point of legal completion of its sales.
The Groups remaining credit risk predominantly arises from trade receivables, amounts recoverable from construction contracts and cash and cash equivalents.
Trade receivables on deferred terms arise from land sales.
The amount deferred is secured by a charge over the land until such time payment is received.
Trade and other receivables comprise mainly the amounts receivable from the Homes England in relation to the Help to Buy scheme, housing associations, joint ventures and the associate.
The Directors consider the credit rating of the various debtors is good in respect of the amounts outstanding and therefore credit risk is considered to be low.
Cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments are held with UK clearing banks which are either A or Arated.

Share-based payments continued b Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP Under the LTIP, shares are conditionally awarded to senior managers of the Group.
The core awards are calculated as a percentage of the participants salaries and scaled according to grade.
The awards granted in 2017 and 2018 are assessed against ROCE, TNAV and relative TSR.
Straight line vesting will apply if performance falls between two thresholds.
Performance will be measured at the end of the three-year performance period.
If the required level of performance has been reached, the awards vest and the shares under award will be released.
Dividends do not accrue on the shares that vest.
The weighted average remaining contractual life of LTIP awards outstanding at 30 September 2018 was 1.3 years.
Details of the shares conditionally allocated at 30 September 2018 are set out below.
The conditional shares were valued using the following methods: for the non-market-based elements of the award, a combination of a Black Scholes option-pricing model: and for the relative TSR elements of the award, a Monte Carlo simulation model.
The key assumptions underpinning the Black Scholes option-pricing model and Monte Carlo simulation model are set out in the table below.

This vesting includes two performance conditions determined with reference to the Groups results as at 30 September 2018, being ROCE and TNAV, which each comprise 35 per cent of the total vesting.
Refer to page 70 for further details.
It was determined that ROCE of 37.1 per cent resulted in 35 per cent vesting and TNAV of 641.5m as adjusted for EBT share purchases, as described on page 71 resulted in 22.6 per cent vesting.
The final performance condition, being Relative TSR is measured in February 2019. c Deferred Bonus Plan DBP Under the DBP, certain senior managers and Directors of the Group receive one-third of their annual bonus entitlement as a conditional share award.
The number of shares awarded is calculated by dividing the value of the deferred bonus by the average mid-market share price on the three business days prior to grant.
The shares vest after three years subject to the employee remaining in the employment of the Group.
If an employee leaves during the three-year period, the shares are forfeited except in certain circumstances as set out in the Plan rules.
The fair value of the awards is equal to the share price on the date of grant.
The fair value is expensed to the income statement in a straight line over four years, being the year in which the bonus is earned and the three-year holding period.
