Exceptional items continued 1.4m of costs have been incurred as part of the ongoing sugar reduction and reformulation programme, through which the business committed to ensuring that 90% of Company-owned brands contain less than 5g of total sugars per 100ml by the end of the financial year ended 27 January 2018.
Costs in relation to the sugar reduction and reformulation programme have significantly exceeded the level of expenditure that would ordinarily be incurred in the course of new product development or reformulation.
Costs of this level are not expected to recur in future periods, therefore these are considered to be exceptional.
In September 2016 a Company-wide restructure was announced.
This was largely complete by the end of the financial year to 28 January 2017, during which 2.7m of redundancy costs were incurred, plus a further 0.6m of other costs, being mainly recruitment costs, accrual for unpaid holiday entitlement, business development consultancy fees, legal fees and termination costs for employee vehicles and mobile phone contracts.
During the year ended 27 January 2018 a further 0.3m of costs have been incurred, primarily being an increase in the required redundancy provision and further recruitment costs.
The items discussed below all relate to significant, non-recurring items that took place in the preceding period.
These were not incurred in the course of normal trade and are therefore classified as exceptional items.
In the year ended 28 January 2017, 0.4m of acquisition fees were incurred in relation to an unsuccessful acquisition.
These costs included advisory and legal fees.
0.5m of advisory costs were also incurred as part of a strategic review of the market threats posed by new and emerging digital trading models.
0.6m of redundancy costs were also incurred in relation to a reorganisation of direct sales routes.
The Groups defined benefit pension scheme closed to future accrual in May 2016.
This resulted in a 7.0m curtailment gain, which was recognised as exceptional in the year ended 28 January 2017.
Offsetting the curtailment gain was a further 1.5m of costs incurred in relation to the closure of the scheme, including the cost of 1.3m past service cost for one years additional service negotiated with the active members of the scheme.
