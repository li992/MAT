Investments Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
Other investments comprise UK Government fixed interest securities backing insurance contracts or held as shareholder investments.
All investments are classified as fair value through profit or loss at initial recognition and are stated at quoted bid prices which equates to fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in profit or loss.
Purchases and sales of securities are recognised on the trade date.
Investment contracts investments and cash held for the benefit of policyholders Investment contracts are comprised of unit-linked contracts in ILInt and ILUK.
Investment contracts result in financial liabilities whose fair value is dependent on the fair value of underlying financial assets.
They are designated at inception as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
Valuation techniques are used to establish the fair value at inception and each reporting date.
The Companys main valuation techniques incorporate all factors that market participants would consider and are based on observable market data.
The financial liability is measured both initially and subsequently at fair value.
The fair value of a unit-linked financial liability is determined using the fair value of the financial assets contained within the funds linked to the financial liability.
Dividends Equity dividends are recognised in the accounting period in which the dividends are declared and approved by shareholders.
Liquid resources For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, liquid resources are defined as current asset investments and short term deposits.
Intangible non-current assets Intangible non-current assets, excluding goodwill, are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and comprise intellectual property software rights.
Intellectual property rights are amortised over seven years on a straight line basis as it is considered that the code is replaced every seven years, and therefore has a finite useful life.
Goodwill is held at cost and, in accordance with IFRS, is not amortised but is subject to annual impairment reviews.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost can be measured reliably.
Repairs and maintenance costs are charged to the profit and loss and other comprehensive income statement during the period in which they are incurred.
The major categories of property, plant, equipment and motor vehicles are depreciated as follows: Asset class All UK entities Australian entity Short Leasehold Land and Buildings Straight line over the life of the lease Straight line over 40 years Fixtures & Fittings Straight line over 10 years Reducing balance over 2 to 8 years Equipment Straight line over 3 to 5 years Reducing balance over 3 to 10 years Motor vehicles N A Reducing balance over 2 to 8 years Residual values, method of depreciation and useful lives of the assets are reviewed annually and adjusted if appropriate.
INTEGRAFIN ANNUAL REPORT YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2018 101 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued Impairment of non-financial assets Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use being the present value of the expected future cash flows of the relevant asset.
The Company evaluates impairment losses for potential reversals when events or circumstances warrant such consideration.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, and once an impairment is recognised this cannot be reversed.
For more detailed information in relation to this, please see note 11.
Pensions The Group makes defined contributions to the personal pension schemes of its employees.
These are chargeable to profit or loss in the year in which they become payable.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate in effect at the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated to sterling at the year end closing rate.
Non-monetary assets denominated in a foreign currency that are measured in terms of historical cost are translated using the exchange rate in effect at the date when the fair value was determined.
Foreign exchange rate differences that arise are reported net in profit or loss as foreign exchange gains losses.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to sterling using the year end closing exchange rate.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated to sterling at rates approximating the foreign exchange rates ruling at the relevant month of the transactions.
Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation are recognised directly in the reserves.
Taxation The taxation charge is based on the taxable result for the year.
The taxable result for the year is determined in accordance with enacted legislation and taxation authority practice for calculating the amount of corporation tax payable.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the statement of financial position differs from its tax base.
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the difference can be utilised.
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax assets liabilities are recovered settled.
Segmental reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker.
The chief operating decision-maker is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments and has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company.
For the year ended 30 September 2018, the business of ILUK and ILInt was the direct insurance of investment linked pensions business, written by single premium in the United Kingdom, single premium life assurance linked bonds and linked qualifying investment plans written in the United Kingdom.
Insurance risk is minimal as all contracts have been classed as investment contracts.
ILInt and ILUK policyholder assets and liabilities Investments held for the benefit of policyholders are stated at fair value and reported on a separate line in the statement of financial position.
The assets are classified using the fair value through profit or loss option with any resultant gain or loss recognised through the income statement.
Investments held for the benefit of policyholders also includes cash and cash equivalents held within policyholders portfolios of assets.
102 INTEGRAFIN ANNUAL REPORT YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2018 Investment inflows received from policyholders are invested in funds selected by the policyholders.
The resulting liabilities for linked investment contracts are accounted for under the fair value through profit or loss option, in line with the corresponding assets as permitted by IAS 39.
As all investments held for the benefit of policyholders are matched entirely by corresponding linked liabilities, any gain or loss on assets recognised through the income statement are offset entirely by the gains and losses on linked liabilities.
The net impact on profit is therefore nil.
Client assets and client monies IFAL client assets and client monies are not recognised in the parent and consolidated statements of financial position see Note 22 as they are owned by the clients of IFAL.
Operating lease agreements Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Where an incentive to sign the lease has been taken, the incentive is spread on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Details of the operating lease commitments are set out in Note 28.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, call deposits, money market OEIC funds and other short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates to their fair value.
Financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the assets have expired or have been transferred and the Company has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.
At initial recognition, the Company classifies its financial instruments in the following categories: i Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss A financial asset or liability is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the short-term.
Financial instruments in this category are recognised on the trade settlement date, and subsequently, at fair value.
Transaction costs are expensed in the consolidated profit and loss and other comprehensive income statement.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are presented in the consolidated profit and loss and other comprehensive income statement within administrative expenses for corporate assets and net income attributable to policyholder returns for policyholder assets in the period in which they arise.
Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are classified as current except for the portion expected to be realised or paid beyond twelve months of the balance sheet date, which are classified as long-term.
ii Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
The Companys loans and receivables comprise accrued fees, trade and other receivables, loans and cash and cash equivalents.
These are included in current assets due to their short-term nature, except for loans which are included in non-current assets.
Loans and receivables are initially recognised at the amount expected to be received, less, when material, a discount to reduce the loans and receivables to fair value.
Subsequently, loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any provisions for impairment.
iii Financial liabilities at amortised cost Financial liabilities at amortised cost comprise trade and other payables.
These are initially recognised at the amount required to be paid, less, when material, a discount to reduce the payables to fair value.
Subsequently, trade payables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
They are classified as current liabilities due to their short-term nature.
INTEGRAFIN ANNUAL REPORT YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2018 103 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued Provisions for liabilities Provisions are recognised when the Company has an obligation, legal or constructive, as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Company will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are estimated at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the reporting date, and are discounted to present values where the effect is material.
Trade and other payables Other payables are short-term, not interest-bearing and are stated at their amortised cost which is not materially different to cost and approximates to fair value.
Impairment of financial assets At each reporting date, the Company assesses whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset other than a financial asset classified as fair value through profit or loss is impaired.
A financial asset is only impaired if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that have occurred after the initial recognition of the asset a loss event and that loss event or events has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the receivable that can be reliably estimated.
The criteria used to determine objective evidence of an impairment loss include: i significant financial difficulty of the obligor: ii delinquencies in interest or principal payments: and iii it becomes probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation.
For equity securities, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is also evidence that the assets are impaired.
If such evidence exists, the Company recognises an impairment loss, as follows: i Financial assets carried at amortised cost: The loss is the difference between the amortised cost of the loan or receivable and the present value of the estimated future cash flows, discounted using the instruments original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced by this amount and the amount of the loss is recognised in the profit or loss for the period.
Share-based payments Equity-settled share-based payment awards granted to employees are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The awards are recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, spread over the vesting period of the awards, which accords with the period for which related services are provided.
Shares issued under the scheme may not be sold until the earlier of three years after issue or cessation of employment by the Group.
If the shares are held for five years they may be sold free of income tax or capital gains tax.
There are no other vesting conditions.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements In preparing these Financial Statements, management has made judgements, estimates and assumptions about the future that affect the application of the Groups accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to estimates are recognised prospectively.
104 INTEGRAFIN ANNUAL REPORT YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2018 Impairment of accrued fees pending The Group has recognised an impairment of 32,493 2017: 128,073 for accrued fees owed by customers.
This comprises accrued fees that have not been received after three months, and also all fees due on portfolios that comprise only limited liquidity assets.
Management believes, based on past experience, that these fees are unlikely to be received, and an impairment has therefore been recorded in the statement of profit or loss.
In addition to the above, an amount of 251,279 2017: 192,103 relates to accrued fees that are past due but not impaired.
Management believes that these fees are likely to be received, and an impairment is therefore not required.
Financial instruments i Principal financial instruments The principal financial instruments, from which financial instrument risk arises, are as follows: Trade and other receivables Accrued fees Cash and cash equivalents Investments in quoted debt instruments Listed shares and securities Trade and other payables Loans ii Financial instruments by category As explained in Note 1, financial assets and liabilities have been classified into categories that determine their basis of measurement and, for items measured at fair value, whether changes in fair value are recognised in the profit and loss and other comprehensive income statement.
The following tables show the carrying values of assets and liabilities for each of these categories.
INTEGRAFIN ANNUAL REPORT YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2018 105 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued Financial assets: Fair value through profit or loss Amortised cost 30 Sep 30 Sep 30 Sep 30 Sep 2018 2017 2018 2017 000 000 000 000 Cash and cash equivalents - - 116,849 105,829 Listed shares and securities 48 83 - - Loans and receivables - - 1,189 1,873 Investments in quoted debt instruments 6,171 8,812 - - Accrued income - - 8,857 7,951 Trade and other receivables - - 1,159 1,456 Investments and cash held for the policyholders 14,489,933 11,947,652 - - Total financial assets 14,496,152 11,956,547 128,414 117,109 Financial liabilities: Fair value through profit or loss Amortised cost 2018 2017 2018 2017 000 000 000 000 Trade and other payables - - 3,157 5,572 Accruals - - 6,599 3,795 Liabilities for linked investments contracts 14,489,933 11,947,652 - - Total financial liabilities 14,489,933 11,947,652 9,756 9,367 iii Financial instruments not measured at fair value Financial instruments not measured at fair value include cash and cash equivalents, accrued fees, loans, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables.
Due to their short-term nature and or annual impairment review, the carrying value of these financial instruments approximates their fair value.
iv Financial instruments measured at fair value fair value hierarchy The table below classifies financial assets that are recognised on the statement of financial position at fair value in a hierarchy that is based on significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
The levels of hierarchy are disclosed on the next page.
Investments held for the benefit of policyholders are stated at fair value and reported on a separate line in the statement of financial position.
Assets held at fair value also comprises investments held in gilts, and these are held at fair value through profit and loss.
The following table shows the Groups assets measured at fair value and split into the three levels described below: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets: Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3: inputs for the asset that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
106 INTEGRAFIN ANNUAL REPORT YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2018 v Capital maintenance The regulated companies in IntegraFin Group are subject to capital requirements imposed by the relevant regulators.
As detailed in the CFOR, Group capital requirements for 2018 were 179.7 million 2017: 166.6 million.
The Group has complied with the requirements set by the regulators during the year.
The Groups policy for managing capital is to ensure each regulated entity maintains capital well above the minimum requirement.
includes ILInt estimate based on rules that came in to force in 2018 to enable comparison.

These financial assets are mainly collective investment schemes and listed equity instruments.
Level 2 and Level 3 valuation methodology The Group regularly reviews whether a market is active, based on available market data and the specific circumstances of each market.
Where the Group assesses that a market is not active, then it applies one or more valuation methodologies to the specific financial asset.
These valuation methodologies use quoted market prices where available, and may in certain circumstances require the Group to exercise judgement to determine fair value.
Financial assets included in Level 2 are measured at fair value using observable mid prices traded in markets that have been assessed as not active enough to be included in Level 1.
Otherwise, financial assets are included in Level 3.
These are assets where one or more inputs to the valuation methodology are not based on observable market data.
The key unobservable input is the pre-tax operating margin needed to price asset holdings.
INTEGRAFIN ANNUAL REPORT YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2018 107 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued Level 3 sensitivity to changes in unobservable measurements For financial assets assessed as Level 3, based on its review of the prices used, the Company believes that any change to the unobservable inputs used to measure fair value would not result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement at year end, and therefore would not have a material impact on its reported results.
Changes to valuation methodology There have been no changes in valuation methodology during the year under review.
Transfers between Levels The Companys policy is to assess each financial asset it holds at the current financial year end, based on the last known price and market information, and assign it to a Level.
The Company recognises transfers between Levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period in which the changes have occurred.
Changes occur due to the availability of or lack thereof quoted prices, whether a market is now active or not, and whether there are indications of impairment.
Transfers between Levels between 30 September 2018 and 30 September 2017 are presented in the table below at their valuation at 30 September 2018: Transfers from Transfers to 000 Level 1 Level 2 16,153 Level 2 Level 1 19,172 The reconciliation between opening and closing balances of Level 3 assets are presented in the table below: 000 Opening balance 4,214 Unrealised gains or losses in the year ended 30 September 2018 737 Transfers in to Level 3 at 30 September 2018 valuation 8,644 Transfers out of Level 3 at 30 September 2018 valuation 173 Purchases, sales, issues and settlement 242 Closing balance 12,190 Any resultant gains or losses on financial assets held for the benefit of policyholders are offset by a reciprocal movement in the linked liability.
Risk and risk management This note supplements the details provided in the Risk and Risk Management section of this report on pages 25 to 34.
Risk assessment Risk assessment is the determination of quantitative values and or qualitative judgements of risk related to a concrete situation and a recognised threat.
Quantitative risk assessment requires calculations of two components of risk, the magnitude of the potential impact, and the likelihood that the risk materialises.
There are also qualitative aspects that are more difficult to express quantitatively, but are still taken into account in order to fully evaluate the impact of the risk on the organisation.
1 Market risk Description of risk Market risk is the risk of loss arising either directly or indirectly from fluctuations in the level and in the volatility of market prices of assets, liabilities and other financial instruments.
108 INTEGRAFIN ANNUAL REPORT YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2018 Market risk from reduced income The Companys dividend income from its regulated subsidiary IFAL is exposed to market risk.
IFALs main source of income is derived from annual management fees and transaction fees which are linked to the value of the clients portfolios.
A 1% change in market risk would have an immaterial impact on income.
IFAL mitigates the second order market risk by applying fixed per policy charges in addition to the charges determined based on clients linked portfolio values, offering an element of diversification to its income stream.
Market risk from direct asset holdings The Company has limited exposure to primary market risk as its capital is invested in high quality, highly liquid, short-dated investments.
a Interest rate risk The Companys balance sheet and capital requirements are relatively insensitive to first order impacts from movements in interest rates.
b Currency risk The Company is not directly exposed to significant currency risk.
c Inflation risk The Company has exposure related to expense inflation risk, where actual inflation deviates from expectations.
The Company has no exposures to defined benefit staff pension schemes or client related index linked liabilities.
Expense inflation risk is mitigated through monitoring of expenditure and closely managing expenses in line with the business plan.
2 Credit counterparty default risk Credit risk is the risk that the Company is exposed to a loss if another party fails to meet its financial obligations.
For the Company, the exposure to counterparty default risk arises primarily from loans directly held by the Company.
Counterparty default risk exposure to loans The Company has loans of 1,189k 2017: 1,873k.
Counterparty default risk exposure to Group companies As well as inconvenience and operational issues arising from the failure of the other Group companies, there is also a risk of a loss of assets.
The Company is due 52k 2017: 7k from other Group companies.
Counterparty default risk exposure to other debtors The Company has prepayments of 33k 2017: nil.
The Company has no other debtors arising, due to the nature of its business, and the structure of the Group.
Impact of credit risk on fair value Due to the limited direct exposure that the Company has to credit risk, credit risk does not have a material impact on the fair value movement of financial instruments for the year under review.
The fair value movements on these instruments are predominantly due to changes in market conditions.
3 Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that funds are not accessible such that the Company, although solvent, does not have sufficient liquid financial resources to meet obligations as they fall due, or can secure such resources only at excessive cost.
INTEGRAFIN ANNUAL REPORT YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2018 109 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued As a holding company, the Companys main liquidity risk is related to paying out shareholder dividends and operating expenses it may incur.
Additionally, the Company has made short term commitments, in the form of a capped facility arrangement, to Vertus Capital SPV1 Limited Vertus as one of Vertus sources of funding to assist Vertus in developing its business, which is to provide tailored niche debt facilities to adviser firms to fund acquisitions, management buy-outs and other similar transactions.
There are robust controls in place to mitigate liquidity risk, for example, through regular monitoring of expenditure, closely managing expenses in line with the business plan, and, in the case of the Vertus facility, capping the value of loans.
Maturity schedule The following table shows an analysis of the financial assets and financial liabilities by remaining expected maturities as at 30 September 2017 and 30 September 2018.
In practice the contractual maturities of the underlying assets may be longer than three months, but the majority of assets held within portfolios are highly liquid.
4 Outflow risk Outflows occur when funds are withdrawn from the platform for any reason.
Outflows typically occur where clients circumstances and requirements change.
However, these outflows can also be triggered by operational failure, competitor actions or external events such as regulatory or economic changes.
Outflow risk is mitigated by focussing on providing exceptionally high levels of service.
Outflow rates are closely monitored and unexpected experience is investigated.
Despite the current challenging and uncertain economic and geopolitical environment, outflow rates remain low and stable.
5 Expense risk Expense risk arises where costs increase faster than expected or from one-off expense shocks.
As a significant percentage of the Groups expenses are staff related the key inflationary risk arises from salary inflation.
The Groups expenses are governed at a high level by the Groups Expense Policy.
The monthly management accounts are reviewed against projected future expenses by the Board and by senior management and action is taken where appropriate.
Segmental reporting The revenue and profit before tax are attributable to activities carried out in the UK.
The Group has two classes of business as follows: provision of investment administrations services transaction of ordinary long-term insurance and underwriting life assurance.
INTEGRAFIN ANNUAL REPORT YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2018 111 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued Analysis by class of business is given below: 2018 2017 000 000 Revenue Investment administration services 48,833 44,019 Insurance and life assurance business 42,361 36,223 91,194 80,242 Profit before tax Investment administration services 18,700 17,224 Insurance and life assurance business 27,530 25,367 46,230 42,591 Net assets Investment administration services 57,857 51,176 Insurance and life assurance business 47,086 51,350 104,943 102,526 The figures above comprise the results of the companies that fall directly into each segment, as well as a proportion of the results from the other Group companies that only provide services to the revenue-generating companies.
This therefore has no effect on revenue, but has an effect on the profit before tax and net assets figures.
Management has reviewed the classes of business and has determined that, as the provision of consultancy services does not generate revenue that is external to the Group, this should not be classified as a separate class of business.
The profit before tax and net assets relating to this have therefore been included within the revenue-generating classes of business on a proportionate basis, for both the current year and the comparative period.

The nominal value of each share was also reduced through the bonus share issue process, from 0.05 to 0.01.
The calculation of earnings per share for the current and comparative period presented has been adjusted retrospectively to reflect the new share structure.
Earnings per share is calculated based on the share capital of IntegraFin Holdings plc and the earnings of the consolidated Group.

The comparative figures for 2017 for both net income attributable to policyholder returns and policyholder tax charge, have been restated to deduct 2,298k in order to correct the deferred tax provision included in both numbers.

INTEGRAFIN ANNUAL REPORT YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2018 117 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued Goodwill impairment assessment The Group is required to test, on an annual basis, whether goodwill has suffered any impairment.
The recoverable amount is determined based on value in use calculations.
The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows and the determination of a discount rate in order to calculate the present value of the cash flows.
The goodwill relates to the acquisition of IAD Pty in July 2016.
The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to the two cash generating units that are benefitting from the acquisition as follows: 2018 2017 000 000 Investment administration services 7,314 7,450 Insurance and life assurance business 5,637 5,501 Total 12,951 12,951 Other assumptions are as follows: 2018 2017 Discount rate 4.5% 4.4% Period on which detailed forecasts are based 5 years 5 years The recoverable amounts of the above cash generating units have been determined from value in use calculations based on cash flow projections from formally approved budgets covering a five year period to 30 September 2023.
The results of this showed that no impairment has taken place throughout the historical financial period.
No sensitivity analysis has been performed on the basis that there were no reasonable foreseeable changes in the assumptions which would result in the recoverable amount falling below the carrying amount.
