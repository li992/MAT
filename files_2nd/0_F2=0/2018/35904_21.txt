Leverage is calculated slightly differently to the AIC method of calculating Gearing in that it is expressed as a ratio between the Companys exposure and its net asset value.
It is calculated under the gross and a commitment method.
Under the gross method, exposure represents the Companys position after the deduction of sterling cash balances, without taking into account any hedging and netting arrangements.
Under the Commitment method, exposure is calculated without the calculation of sterling cash balances and after certain hedging and netting positions are offset.
For these purposes the Board has set a maximum leverage of 125% for both methods.
Net Asset Value NAV The value of the Companys assets, principally investments made in other companies and cash being held, less any liabilities.
The NAV is also described as shareholders funds per share.
The NAV is often expressed in pence per share after being divided by the number of shares which have been issued.
The NAV per share is unlikely to be the same as the share price which is the price at which the Companys shares can be bought or sold by an investor.
The share price is determined by the relationship between the demand and supply of the shares.
