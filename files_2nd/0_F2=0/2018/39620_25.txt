com STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS BASIS OF PREPARATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES RSA Insurance Group plc the Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.
The Company through its subsidiaries and associates together the Group or RSA provides personal and commercial insurance products to its global customer base, principally in the UK, Ireland, Middle East together UK & International, Scandinavia and Canada.
1 Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union EU and the Companies Act 2006 where applicable.
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on an historical cost basis.
Where other bases are applied, these are identi ed in the relevant accounting policy.
In line with industry practice, the Groups statement of financial position is not presented using current and non-current classi cations, but broadly in increasing order of liquidity.
The assets and liabilities considered as non-current include: investments in associates, deferred tax assets, property and equipment, intangible assets, goodwill, deferred tax liabilities, outstanding debt including loan capital and elements of financial investments, insurance contract liabilities and reinsurers share of insurance contract liabilities.
The assets and liabilities considered as current include cash and cash equivalents, and insurance and reinsurance debtors.
The remaining balances are of a mixed nature.
The current and non-current portions of such balances are in the notes on pages 111 to 168 or in the Risk and Capital Management note note 5.
Except where otherwise stated, all gures included in the consolidated financial statements are presented in millions of pounds sterling m. Accounting policies that are signi cant to understanding the performance, financial position and cash ows of the Group are set out in note 4 with other policies presented in Appendix A.
The notes are grouped together by their nature.
Estimation techniques and assumptions are presented in the relevant note in order to provide context to the gures presented.
The most signi cant estimates are those used in determining insurance contract liabilities note 37, deferred tax note 29 and fide ned bene t pension scheme liabilities note 38.
There are no signi cant judgements not related to accounting estimates.
2 Adoption of new and revised standards IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts During the year the Group has taken advantage of an election under IFRS 4 that permits an insurer which meets certain conditions to temporarily be exempt from adopting IFRS 9 Financial Instruments that would have otherwise have become effective from 1 January 2018 until 1 January 2021 it is anticipated that this date will be put back a further year until 1 January 2022 to coincide with the new expected implementation date for IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts.
This will enable accounting policy choices to consider the interrelationships of IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts and 9 particularly with regards to asset and liability management.
IFRS 15 Revenue Recognition IFRS 15 Revenue Recognition became effective from 1 January 2018 and does not apply to insurance and financial instrument income.
The Group completed its detailed review of the application of IFRS 15 on its income recognised from the performance of other services for customers as set out in note 11.
Existing policies for the recognition and measurement of such income are already compliant with the requirements of IFRS 15 and therefore no adjustment was necessary when applying the standard.
There are also a small number of other narrow scope amendments arising from annual improvements to standards that are applicable to the Group for the first time in 2018, none of which have had a signi cant impact on the consolidated financial statements.
3 New accounting standards, interpretations and amendments IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts The International Accounting Standards Board IASB issued IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts in May 2017 to replace IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts.
The IASB deferred the implementation date of IFRS 17 by one year on 14 November 2018 to annual reporting periods beginning, at the latest, on or after 1 January 2022.
It is anticipated that the IASB will issue a new Exposure Draft of the standard in the summer of 2019.
Draft legislation has been laid before Parliament to ensure that IFRS as endorsed by the EU at the date of the UK leaving the EU will be adopted for use in the UK as well as providing the Secretary of State with the power to adopt and endorse IFRS for use in the UK.
It is expected that this power will be delegated to a UK IFRS Endorsement Board.
In the event that IFRS 17 has not been endorsed by the EU by the time the UK leaves the EU, including any transitional period or arrangements that may be agreed, then the UK IFRS Endorsement Board will have responsibility for its endorsement.
The Groups programme of implementation activity is progressing in line with plans which include consideration of the impact of the one year deferral.
The activities completed in 2018 include making decisions on accounting policy in key areas supported by financial impact analysis, the design of finance systems and process change and drafting revised pro-forma financial statements.
Detailed build and testing of new systems and processes will take place during 2019 and early 2020 moving into detailed parallel run testing of reporting during the latter part of 2020 and into 2021 to assure reporting compliance by 1 January 2022.
111 BASIS OF PREPARATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 3 New accounting standards, interpretations and amendments continued IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9 Financial Instruments has been issued to replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and primarily changes the classi cation and measurement of financial assets.
As described above the Group has elected to defer applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments until 1 January 2021.
Further information can be found in note 25.
IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 replaces the existing standard IAS 17 Leases with effect from 1 January 2019.
The Group has assessed the estimated impact that initial application of IFRS 16 will have on its consolidated financial statements, as described below.
IFRS 16 introduces a single, on balance sheet lease accounting model for lessees.
A lessee recognises an asset representing its right to use the underlying leased asset and a liability representing its obligation to make lease payments.
There are recognition exemptions for short-term leases and leases of low-value items, which the Group intends to utilise.
The Group will recognise new assets and liabilities mainly relating to: Real estate operating leases see note 42 : and Mainframe and server elements of technology contracts.
The nature of expenses on these areas changes from 1 January 2019 when the Group will recognise a depreciation charge for right-of-use assets and an interest expense on lease liabilities.
Currently, the Group recognises the applicable expenses as they fall due, and assets and liabilities only to the extent that there was a timing difference between the recognition of the expense and its actual payment.
The Group will apply IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019 using the standards second modi ed retrospective approach which means that the lease liability on transition will be matched by an equal and opposite right of use asset resulting in a nil impact on opening equity which will be applied using the exemption not to present the prior reporting period.
This means that, based on the information currently available, the Group estimates that it will recognise additional lease liabilities and right-of-use assets on implementation of c280m.
The impact on the Income Statement in future years is expected to be immaterial.
Other standards The following amended standards and interpretations are not expected to have a signi cant impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements over the following twelve months: Annual improvement to IFRSs 2015-2017 Cycle Amendments to IFRS 3, IFRS 11, IAS 12 and IAS 23: IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration: IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments: Amendments to IAS 19 Employee bene ts on plan amendments, curtailment or settlement.
4 Signi cant accounting policies The signi cant accounting policies used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, as set out below, have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements, unless otherwise stated.
The Group has not made any signi cant changes to its accounting policies during 2018.
Premium income Premium written is recognised in the period in which the Group is legally bound through a contract to provide insurance cover.
It represents the full amount of premiums receivable under the contract, including estimates where the amounts are not known at the date they are written.
These are deferred as a provision for unearned premiums until recognised as revenue principally computed on a monthly or daily pro-rata basis.
Net premiums earned are stated net of amounts passed ceded to reinsurers.
Premiums are shown before deduction of commission and exclude any sales based taxes or duties.

com STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS 4 Signi cant accounting policies continued Gross claims incurred and insurance contract liabilities Gross claims incurred represent the cost of agreeing and settling insurance claims on insurance contracts underwritten by the Group.
Provisions for losses and loss adjustment expenses are recognised at the estimated ultimate cost, net of expected salvage and subrogation recoveries when a claim is incurred.
The provisions for losses and loss adjustment expenses, and related reinsurance recoveries, are discounted where there is a long period from incident to claims settlement or when nominal interest rates are high and where there exists a suitable claims payment pattern from which to calculate the discount.
In fide ning those claims with a long period from incident to claims settlement, an average period of settlement of six years or more has been used as a guide.
The discount rate used is based upon an investment return expected to be earned by financial assets which are appropriate in value and duration to match the provisions for insurance contract liabilities being discounted during the period expected before the final settlement of such claims.
Differences between the estimated cost and subsequent settlement of claims or re-estimated costs are recognised in the consolidated income statement in the year in which they are settled or in which the insurance contract liabilities are re-estimated.
Acquisition costs comprise the direct and indirect costs of obtaining and processing new insurance business.
Levies payable are treated as costs of underwriting business.
These costs are recognised as deferred acquisition costs DAC and are deducted from the provision for unearned premium.
DAC is amortised on the same basis as the related unearned premiums are earned.
At the end of each reporting period tests are performed to ensure the adequacy of the Groups insurance contract liabilities by considering the cash ows associated with the provision for unearned premium net of related DAC.
In performing these tests, best estimates of future contractual cash ows, including loss adjustment and administrative expenses as well as investment income on financial assets backing such liabilities are used.
Any fide ciency is charged to the consolidated income statement immediately by establishing a provision for liability adequacy known as the unexpired risk provision.
The unexpired risk provision is assessed in aggregate for business classes which are managed together and where there are no restraints on the ability to use assets held in relation to such business to meet any of the associated liabilities.
Further information on net claims can be found in note 10, and insurance contract liabilities in note 37.
Reinsurance Written premiums ceded to a reinsurer are recognised in the period in which the reinsurance contract is entered into and include estimates where the amounts are not nalised at the end of the reporting period.
The ceded written premiums are recognised in the consolidated income statement over the period of the reinsurance contract, based on the expected earning pattern in relation to the underlying insurance contract s. Reinsurers share of insurance contract liabilities within the consolidated statement of financial position includes the reinsurers share of provisions for losses and loss adjustment expenses and unearned premiums.
The Group reports third party reinsurance balances on the consolidated balance sheets on a gross basis to present the exposure to credit risk related to third party reinsurance.
The amount recoverable is reduced when there is an event arising after the initial recognition that provides objective evidence that the Group may not receive all amounts due under the reinsurance contract.
Annuities purchased by the Group to provide for payments under structured settlement arrangements are accounted for as reinsurance ceded and a corresponding reinsurers share of insurance contract liabilities in cases where the Group remains liable for the settlement in the event of default by the annuity provider.
Any gain or loss arising on the purchase of an annuity is recognised in the consolidated income statement at the date of purchase.
Further information can be found in note 28.
Financial Instruments Classi cation and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities The Group initially recognises financial instruments at their fair value on the date at which they are purchased.
At initial measurement, the Group classi es its financial assets and financial liabilities in one of the following categories: Designated at fair value through pro t and loss FVTPL : Held for trading: Available for sale AFS : Cash and cash equivalents: L oans and receivables: Financial liabilities: or Derivatives designated as hedging instruments.
Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets and financial liabilities that are not FVTPL are added to their fair value in their initial measurement.
Further information can be found in notes 25, 26 and 27.

com STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS 4 Signi cant accounting policies continued Investment income Dividends on equity investments are recognised as investment income in the consolidated income statement on the date at which the investment is priced ex dividend.
Interest income is recognised in the consolidated income statement using the effective interest rate method.
Unrealised gains and losses on AFS investments are recognised in other comprehensive income, except for impairment losses and foreign exchange gains and losses on monetary items which are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
On derecognition of an investment classi ed as AFS, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Further information can be found in note 9.
Impairment of financial instruments The Group determines, at each reporting date, whether there is evidence that the value of a financial asset or a group of financial assets, other than those measured as FVTPL are impaired.
A financial asset is impaired if there is objective evidence that indicates that an event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset that may have resulted in a loss of value as a result of having a negative effect on the estimated future cash ows generated by that asset which can be estimated reliably.
An impairment loss in respect of debt instruments is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash ows discounted at the original effective interest rate of the instrument and is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Interest on the impaired asset continues to be recognised using the effective interest rate method.
For equity securities whose fair values are readily determined and where there is objective evidence that such an asset is impaired by a signi cant or prolonged decline in the fair value below cost, the net loss previously charged to other comprehensive income is reclassi ed to the consolidated income statement.
If the fair value of a previously impaired debt security increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised, the impairment loss is reversed and the reversal recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Impairment losses on equity investments are not reversed.
Current and deferred tax Current and deferred tax are recognised in the consolidated income statement, except to the extent that the tax arises from a transaction or event recognised either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Any exceptions permitted under IAS12 are disclosed in the notes.
Current taxation is based on pro ts and income for the year as determined in accordance with the relevant tax legislation, together with adjustments for prior years.
Deferred tax is provided in full using the liability method on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and the carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
However, if the deferred tax arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting, nor taxable pro t or loss, it is not accounted for.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the related deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax in respect of the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and principal associated undertakings is recognised as an expense in the year in which the pro ts arise, except where the remittance of earnings can be controlled and it is probable that remittance will not take place in the foreseeable future, in which case the tax charge is recognised on the dividends received.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable pro ts will be available against which unused tax losses and temporary differences can be utilised.
Post-retirement bene ts and obligations The Group operates both fide ned contribution and fide ned bene t schemes.
A fide ned contribution scheme is a pension scheme under which the Group pays xed contributions and has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
Contributions to fide ned contribution pension schemes are charged in the consolidated income statement in the period in which the underlying employment services are provided to the Group.
A fide ned bene t scheme refers to any other pension scheme: speci cally, the Groups fide ned bene t schemes fide ne an amount of pension bene t that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and salary.
The value of the net fide ned bene t liability asset recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position for each individual post-retirement scheme is calculated as the difference between the present value of the fide ned bene t obligations of the scheme and the fair value of the scheme assets out of which the obligations are to be settled.
For those schemes in a net liability fide cit position, the net liability is recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position in provisions.
For those schemes in a net asset surplus position, the asset is recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position in other debtors and other assets only to the extent that the Group can realise an economic bene t, in the form of a refund or a reduction in future contributions, at some point during the life of the scheme or when the scheme liabilities are settled.
115 BASIS OF PREPARATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 4 Signi cant accounting policies continued The amounts charged or credited where relevant in the consolidated income statement relating to post-retirement fide ned bene t schemes are as follows: The current service cost: this is the present value of additional bene ts payable for employees services provided during the reporting period: The past service costs and gains or losses on settlement: these are changes to the obligations already established for past service costs that have arisen from an amendment to the terms of the scheme or a curtailment of the bene ts payable by the scheme.
These are recognised at the earlier of when the terms of the scheme are amended or the curtailment occurs or, where applicable, when the Group recognises related restructuring costs or termination bene ts: Net interest on the net fide ned bene t liability asset: this is determined by applying the discount rate applied to the fide ned bene t obligation for the period to the net fide ned bene t liability asset, and results in a net interest expense income: The administration costs of operating the pension schemes.
Remeasurements of the net fide ned bene t liability asset recognised in other comprehensive income comprises actuarial gains and losses as a result of changes in assumptions and experience adjustments in the calculation of the fide ned bene t obligation, and return on scheme assets excluding interest during the year.
The most signi cant of these is the selection of the discount rate used to calculate the fide ned bene t obligation, details of which are set out in note 38.
Goodwill Goodwill is the difference between the cost of a business acquisition and the net fair value of the identi able assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is initially capitalised in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost and is subsequently recognised at cost less accumulated impairment losses see below.
The cost of the acquisition is the amount of cash paid and the fair value of other purchase consideration.
Customer related intangible assets Customer related intangible assets are valued at cost less accumulated amortisation, and less any accumulated impairment losses.
Customer related intangible assets comprise renewal rights and customer lists.
The useful economic lives are generally between one and ten years and are estimated considering relevant metrics such as customer retention rates, contract length, and forecast period to technological obsolescence.
The asset is amortised on a straight-line basis across this period.
Internally developed computer software The Group capitalises internal and external computer software development costs where the software is separately identi able: the Group has control over the software: and where it can be demonstrated that they provide future economic bene ts for the Group through facilitating revenue or improved processes.
The costs capitalised includes administrative and other general overhead expenditure when they can be directly attributed to the software development and preparing it for use.
The useful economic life of externally acquired and internally generated software is normally estimated to be between three and seven years.
Further information on goodwill and other intangibles can be found in note 22.
Impairment of goodwill, other intangible assets and internally developed computer software Goodwill and intangible assets not yet available to use are subject to an impairment test on an annual basis.
Other intangible assets, which includes internally generated software, are reviewed for indications of impairment on an annual basis and are subject to an impairment test only if there is an indication of impairment.
Goodwill, other intangible assets and internally developed computer software are allocated to cash generating units CGUs for the purpose of impairment testing.
When testing for impairment, the recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value in use calculations.
Further information on how the value in use is calculated can be found in note 22.
Where the carrying amount is more than the recoverable amount, impairment of goodwill or intangible assets is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Impairment losses previously recognised on other intangible assets may be reversed in subsequent periods provided that the revised carrying amount does not exceed the value that would have been determined net of amortisation had no impairment loss been recognised.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.

com STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS 4 Signi cant accounting policies continued Assets and liabilities held for sale Assets and liabilities are classi ed as held for sale if it is considered highly probable that the carrying amount of the assets and directly associated liabilities will be recovered principally through a sale, rather than through continuing operations.
This includes the expectation that the sale will be completed within 12 months of the classi cation date as held for sale, subject to extension in certain circumstances, including where disposals have been committed to subject to regulatory and legal approval.
Assets and liabilities held for sale are each presented as a single line in the statement of financial position, at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Where the asset or liability comprises a separate business operation e. g. a subsidiary, an associate or a branch, the assets including any goodwill allocated to the business and the directly associated liabilities of the business are considered together as one disposal group.
In the period when assets are recognised as held for sale on the face of the consolidated statement of financial position for the first time, the comparative prior period is not re-presented.
Further information can be found in note 6.
Reorganisation costs Reorganisation costs represent external and clearly identi able internal costs that are necessarily incurred and directly attributable to the Groups restructuring programme.
The aim of the restructuring programme is to both reduce operating costs and improve pro tability.
Employee termination costs are only recognised when they are part of a restructuring programme that has been communicated to those affected or when a detailed plan of redundancies is announced.
Provisions for onerous contracts are recognised when action is taken by the Group as part of a restructuring programme that reduces any remaining bene t expected under a contract to below its remaining unavoidable costs.
Further information can be found in note 7.
