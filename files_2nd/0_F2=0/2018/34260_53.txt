For 2016, the items presented in the reconciliation are affected as a result of the overall tax credit for the year and the loss before taxation.
In order to provide a more meaningful analysis of the effective tax rate, the table also presents separate reconciliations for the group excluding the impacts of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and impairment losses and reversals, and for the impacts of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and impairment losses and reversals in isolation.
