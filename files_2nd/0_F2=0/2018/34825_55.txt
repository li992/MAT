Financial Instruments continued Overview continued The Groups Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the Risk Management Framework in relation to the risks by the Group.
The Groups Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by internal audit.
Internal audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of certain risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers and investment securities.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
However due to the nature of the Groups business, trade receivables are not significant in proportion to the total revenue generated, which limits the related credit risk.
The Groups trade receivables are disclosed in Note 17.
The loss allowance as at 31 December 2018 is $1.0m, 2017: $nil, with a loss allowance expense of $nil 2017: $nil.
Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including interest payments and excluding the impact of netting agreements.
The amounts disclosed in the table are contractual undiscounted cash flows, including interest payments calculated using interest rates in force at each reporting date, so will not always reconcile with the amounts disclosed on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.

The restructured debt arrangement consists of a $3,325.0m USDollar, a 607.6m Euro term loan and a $300.0m revolving credit facility RCF.
The financing arrangements including associated derivatives in place as at 31 December 2017 for the Group were settled.
There are no covenants attached to the Groups borrowings, other preparing the principal borrowers Crown UK HoldCo Limited financial statements and the calculation of the first lien net leverage ratio and total net leverage ratio.
A margin, determined by the first lien net leverage ratio at a given date is added to the US Base rate or an additional margin of 1% for the US and Euro term loans respectively.
A margin, determined by the first lien net leverage ratio at a given date determines the interest charged on the RCF.
The margins currently applicable to the Group are 2.5% on the US Term loan and 2.25% on the Euro term loan.
The RCF is currently undrawn and therefore no interest is charged on this facility.

Financial Instruments continued Cash Flow Hedges The following table indicates the periods in which the discounted cash flows associated with derivatives that are cash flow hedges are expected to occur.
31 December 2018 Carrying Expected 6 months More than amount cash flows or less 612 months 12 years 25 years 5 years $m $m $m $m $m $m $m Interest rate swaps 0.2 0.4 0.4 31 December 2017 Carrying Expected 6 months More than amount cash flows or less 612 months 12 years 25 years 5 years $m $m $m $m $m $m $m Interest rate swaps 0.1 0.3 0.1 0.2 The interest rate swaps attached to the Groups borrowings at 31 December 2017 were settled on 28 February 2018 as part of the restructure of the Groups borrowing facilities.
At this date the cash-flow hedges were recycled from the hedging reserve resulting in a gain of $0.1m recognised in Other Comprehensive Income.
The interest rate swaps in place at 31 December 2018 are in relation to the hedging of the joint operation DCIP borrowings.
Market Risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
Foreign Currency Risk Operating across ten territories increase the Groups exposure to currency risk.
Wherever possible, overseas operations will fund their day-to-day working capital requirements in local currency with cash generated from operations, naturally hedging the currency risk exposure to the Group.
Management will continually monitor the level of currency risk exposure, and consider hedging where appropriate.
Currently the Group considers the currency risk on consolidation of the assets and liabilities of its foreign entities to be of low materiality, no hedging has been undertaken.
Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk arises from the Groups borrowing facilities in which a variable rate of interest is charged.
The Group has historically managed this risk by securing fixed interest rates on a portion of its term loans.
Whilst fixed-rate interest-bearing debt is not exposed to cash flow interest rate risk, there is no opportunity for the Group to enjoy a reduction in borrowing costs in markets where rates are falling.
In addition, the fair value risk inherent in fixed-rate borrowing means that the Group is exposed to unplanned costs should debt be restructured or repaid early as part of the liquidity management process.
Exposure to interest rate risk is monitored through several measures including sensitivity and scenario testing and a cost benefit analysis of entering into interest rate swaps to mitigate this risk.
The Group believes it is more cost effective for the US Term loan to remain unhedged.
The Group however uses interest rate swaps agreed with other parties to a hedge a portion of the interest charged on the Euro term loan.
Interest rate swaps are measured at fair value, which have been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
At 31 December 2018 the Group had two 2017: three interest rate swaps.
The interest rate swaps were comprised of one EUR denominated swap which was entered into under the previous financing arrangements, which hedged Nil% 2017: 83.0% of the Euro denominated unsecured loan.
A USD denominated swap which was in place hedged 97.3% of the $33.6m USD denominated DCIP secured loan.

Financial Instruments continued Interest Rate Risk continued At the reporting date the interest rate profile of the Groups interest-bearing financial instruments was: Carrying amount 31 December 31 December 2018 2017 $m $m Fixed rate instruments Financial assets interest rate swap 0.2 0.1 Financial liabilities secured bank loans hedged portion 32.8 169.6 Loan note 3.0 Finance lease liabilities 100.5 21.5 136.1 191.0 Variable rate instruments Financial liabilities secured bank loans unhedged portion 0.8 Financial liabilities unsecured bank loans unhedged portion 3,912.5 275.0 $32.8m 2017: $169.6m of the variable rate financial liability is hedged via the interest rate swaps with the balance attracting a variable interest rate.
Fair Value Sensitivity Analysis for Fixed Rate Instruments The Group accounts for fixed-rate derivative financial instruments interest rate swaps at fair value.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit or Loss except where derivatives qualify forhedge accounting when recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
A change of 100 basis points in interest rates would have increased equity by $0.6m 2017: $2.0m or decreased equity by $0.6m 2017: $2.0m for each swap and would have increased or decreased profit or loss by $nil.
Cash Flow Sensitivity Analysis for Variable Rate Instruments A change of 100 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased decreased equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown below.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2018.

Short-term debtors, creditors and cash and cash equivalents have been excluded from the following disclosures on the basis that their carrying amount is a reasonable approximation to fair value.

The carrying amount of unsecured bank loans is stated net of debt issuance costs and the fair value is stated gross of debt issuance costs and is calculated using the market interest rates.
The fair value of investments has been calculated by reference to quoted market values.
The Group holds one unquoted equity investment and have concluded that the cost of this investment represents its fair value at 31 December 2018.
