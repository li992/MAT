Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Section 1: Basis of preparation This section lays out the Groups accounting policies that relate to the financial statements as a whole.
Where an accounting policy is specific to a particular note to the financial statements, the policy is described in the note to which it relates and has been clearly identified in a box.
The financial statements consolidate those of The Unite Group plc, the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and include the Groups interests in jointly controlled entities.
The parent company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not as a group.
Both the parent company financial statements and the Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRS and approved by the Directors.
On publishing the parent company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, the Company is taking advantage of the exemption in s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and related notes.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
The Company is a public company limited by shares and is registered in England, United Kingdom, where it is also domiciled.
Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development and position are set out in the Strategic report on pages 1 to 51.
In addition, section 4 of these Notes to the financial statements includes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: details of its borrowings and interest rate swaps: and in note 5.3 its exposure to credit risk.
The Board has considered the risks that could arise as a result of potential outcomes of Brexit and have identified people risk, procurement risks and demand risks.
These risks have been factored into our forecasts and projections.
The Group has prepared cash flow projections 18 months forward to June 2020 and the Group has sufficient headroom to meet all its commitments.
The Group issued 275 million of unsecured investment grade 10-year bonds in October 2018 and this together with existing facilities will be sufficient to fund the Groups commitments over the next 18 months.
The Group maintains positive relationships with its lending banks and has historically secured new facilities before maturity dates and remained within its covenant levels.
The Group is in full compliance with its covenants at 31 December 2018 and expects to remain so.
Our debt facilities include loan-to-value, interest cover and asset class ratios, all of which have a high level of headroom.
In order to manage future financial commitments, the Group operates a formal approval process, through its Major Investment Approvals committee, to ensure appropriate review is undertaken before any transactions are agreed.
The Directors consider that the Group has adequate capital resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Measurement convention The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for investment property, investment property under development, investments in subsidiaries and interest rate swaps all of which are stated at their fair value.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has an existing right that gives it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the subsidiary, has exposure or right to variable returns from its involvement in the subsidiary and has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions, such as property disposals and management fees, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Groups retained interest in the entity.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains except where the loss provides evidence of a reduction in the net realisable value of current assets or an impairment in the value of fixed assets.
Impact of accounting standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective At the balance sheet date there are a number of new standards and amendments to existing standards in issue but not yet effective.
The Group has not early adopted the new or amended standards in preparing these consolidated financial statements.
114 THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2018 Strategic report p0151 Corporate governance p5299 Financial statements p100155 Other information p156160 Section 1: Basis of preparation continued IFRS 16 Leases effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 General impact of application of IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 provides a comprehensive model for the identification of lease arrangements and their treatment in the financial statements for both lessors and lessees.
IFRS 16 will supersede the current lease guidance including IAS 17 Leases and the related interpretations when it becomes effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
The date of intial application of IFRS 16 for the Group will be 1 January 2019.
On transition, the Group has chosen to adopt the cumulative catch-up approach.
In preparation for the first-time adoption of IFRS 16, the Group has carried out an implementation project.
IFRS 16 will have a material impact on the sale and leaseback portfolio which is comprised of 3,150 beds across 10 properties.
These properties were sold by the Group between 2004 and 2009 to institutional investors and simultaneously leased back by the Group.
We do not expect IFRS 16 to have a material impact on other leases rental of office space, vehicles, equipment.
In contrast to lessee accounting, IFRS 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements from IAS 17.
Impact of the new definition of a lease IFRS 16 sets out a new definition of a llease, however our assessment has shown that this does not impact the Group.
Impact on Lessee Accounting Operating leases IFRS 16 will change how the Group accounts for leases previously classified as operating leases under IAS 17, which were off-balance sheet.
On initial application of IFRS 16, for all sale and leaseback leases, the Group will: Recognise sale and leaseback right-of-use assets in the consolidated balance sheet, initially measured at fair value using a discounted cash flow model: Recognise lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet, initially measured at the present value of the future minimum lease payments: Reclassify leasehold improvements which were previously treated at items of PPE and depreciated on a straight line basis to sale and leaseback right of use assets.
Subsequent treatment will be as follows: Hold the sale and leaseback right of use asset as investment property at fair value and revalue at the end of each financial reporting period, with any change in value going to the consolidated income statement as revaluation gain loss on investment property IFRS only : The lease liability will be unwound each year, with the discount unwind going through the consolidated income statement IFRS & EPRA : Separate the total amount of cash paid into a principal portion presented within financing activities and interest presented within operating activities in the consolidated cash flow statement.
On initial application of IFRS 16, for all other leases, the Group will: Recognise right-of-use assets in the consolidated balance sheet, initially measured at the present value of the future minimum lease payments: Recognise lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet, initially measured at the present value of the future minimum lease payments.
Subsequent treatment will be as follows: Recognise deprecation of right-of-use assets in the consolidated income statement IFRS & EPRA : The lease liability will be unwound each year, with the discount unwind going through the consolidated income statement IFRS & EPRA : Separate the total amount of cash paid into a principal portion presented within financing activities and interest presented within operating activities in the consolidated cash flow statement.
For short term leases lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets, the Group will opt to recognise a lease expense on a straight-line basis as permitted by IFRS 16.
THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2018 115 Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Section 1: Basis of preparation continued As at 31 December 2018, the Group has non-cancellable operating lease commitments of 215m, being the sum of undiscounted future minimum lease payments.
Our assessment indicates that on transition on 1 January 2019, the Group will recognise a right of use asset of 130 135 million and a lease liability of 120 125 million.
Impact on Lessor Accounting IFRS 16 does not change substantially how a lessor accounts for leases.
Under IFRS 16, a lessor continues to classify leases as either finance leases or operating leases and account for those two types of leases differently.
Other standards The following amended standards and interpretations are not expected to have a significant impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements: IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts IFRS 9 amendments Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation IAS 28 amendments Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures IFRS Standards annual improvements IAS 19 amendments Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement IFRS 10 and IAS 28 amendments Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture.
Accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Groups accounting policies.
It also requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis with revisions recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement of complexity are set out below and are explained in more detail in the related notes to the financial statements.
The areas involving the most sensitive estimates and assumptions that are significant to the financial statements are set out below and in more detail in the related notes: valuation of investment property and investment property under development note 3.1.
The accounting policy descriptions set out the areas where judgement needs exercising, the most significant of which is as follows: classification of joint venture vehicles note 3.4.
116 THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2018 Strategic report p0151 Corporate governance p5299 Financial statements p100155 Other information p156160 Section 2: Results for the year This section focuses on the results and performance of the Group and provides a reconciliation between the primary statements and EPRA performance measures.
On the following pages you will find disclosures explaining the Groups results for the year, segmental information, taxation, earnings and net asset value per share.
The Group uses EPRA earnings and NAV movement as key comparable indicators across other real estate companies in Europe.

The reportable segments for the years ended 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017 are Operations and Property.
The Group undertakes its Operations and Property activities directly and through joint ventures with third parties.
The joint ventures are an integral part of each segment and are included in the information used by the Board to monitor the business.
The Groups properties are located exclusively in the United Kingdom.
The Group therefore has one geographical segment.
2.2 Earnings EPRA earnings amends IFRS measures by removing principally the unrealised investment property valuation gains and losses such that users of the financials are able to see the extent to which dividend payments dividend per share are underpinned by earnings arising from purely operational activity.
The reconciliation between Profit attributable to owners of the parent company and EPRA earnings is available in note 2.2 a.
The Operations segment manages rental properties, owned directly by the Group or by joint ventures.
Its revenues are derived from rental income and asset management fees earned from joint ventures.
The way in which the Operations segment adds value to the business is set out in the Operations review on pages 32 to 35.
The Operations segment is the main contributor to EPRA earnings and EPRA EPS and these are therefore the key indicators which are used by the Board to monitor the Operations business.
The Board does not manage or monitor the Operations segment through the balance sheet and therefore no segmental information for assets and liabilities is provided for the Operations segment.

More detail is provided in note 3.4. c Earnings per share The Basic EPS calculation is based on the earnings attributable to the equity shareholders of The Unite Group plc and the weighted average number of shares which have been in issue during the year.
Basic EPS is adjusted in line with EPRA guidelines in order to allow users to compare the business performance of the Group with other listed real estate companies in a consistent manner and to reflect how the business is managed and measured on a day to day basis.
The calculations of basic and EPRA EPS for the year ended 31 December 2018 and 2017 are as follows: 2018 2017 Note m m Earnings Basic 235.7 221.6 Diluted 235.7 223.0 EPRA 2.2a 88.4 70.5 Weighted average number of shares thousands Basic 259,466 232,503 Dilutive potential ordinary shares share options 828 5,627 Diluted 260,294 238,130 Earnings per share pence Basic 90.8p 95.3p Diluted 90.6p 93.6p EPRA EPS 34.1p 30.3p Movements in the weighted average number of shares have resulted from the issue of shares arising from the employee share-based payment schemes and the equity raise.

In 2017, there were no options excluded from the potential dilutive shares.

The Group also manages NAV using EPRA NNNAV, which adjusts EPRA NAV to include the fair value of swaps and debt.
Under EPRA best practice guidelines this is considered to give stakeholders the most relevant comparable information on the current fair value of all the assets and liabilities in the Group.

Revenue and costs The Group earns revenue from the following activities: 2018 2017 Note m m Rental income Operations segment 2.2a 112.7 99.7 Management fees Operations segment 15.8 16.5 USAF performance fee Unallocated 3.4 128.5 119.6 Impact of minority interest on management fees 0.2 0.3 Total revenue 128.3 119.3 The cost of sales included in the consolidated income statement includes property operating expenses of 28.7 million 2017: 28.5 million and operating lease rentals of 11.5 million 2017: 12.6 million.
Accounting policies The Group recognises revenue from the following major sources: Rental income Management and performance fees.
Revenue is measured based on the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in a contract with a customer and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties.
The Group recognises revenue when it transfers control of its service to a customer.
There has been no impact to the revenue balances on transition to IFRS 15.
Rental income Rental income comprises direct lets to students and leases to Universities and commercial tenants.
This revenue is recognised in the income statement over the length of the tenancy period as the Group provides the services to its customers.
Included in the rental contract is the use of broadband facilities and room cleaning services.
The Group does not offer these services as stand-alone products.
Under IFRS 15 the Group does not consider these services to be individually material and has, consequently, bundled these obligations as a single contract.
The transaction prices for rental income are explicitly stated in each contract.
A contract liability can result from payments received in advance, until the date at which control is transferred to the customer and at that point the revenue begins to be recognised over the tenancy period.
Lease incentives are sometimes recognised on commercial units: these are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income and spread over the term of the lease.
Management and performance fees The Group acts as asset and property manager for the joint ventures and receives management fees in relation to these services.
Revenue from these fees is recognised over time as the joint venture simultaneously receives and consumes benefits as the Group performs its management obligations.
Detailed calculations in order to determine the transaction prices for these revenue streams are held within the joint venture agreements.
In addition, the Group is entitled to performance fees from USAF and LSAV if the joint ventures outperform certain benchmarks.
The Group receives either cash or an enhanced equity interest in the joint ventures as consideration for the performance fee.
The Group recognises the performance fee at a point in time in the year to which the fee relates.
The Group initially assesses the probability of a fee being earned and its transaction price at half year and adjusts for any potential risks to receiving this income at year end.
As per IFRS 15, the estimated amount of variable consideration is included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of revenue recognised will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved.
As the performance fee is variable and dependent on meeting specific performance targets it is not reasonably possible to determine the future contractual income relating to this revenue.
The Group receives acquisition fees from its joint venture partners: this revenue is linked to the acquisition of land or property and is therefore recognised at the point in time that the control of the asset is transferred to the joint venture.
The transaction price for this revenue stream is again stipulated in the joint venture agreement as a percentage of the value of the acquisition.

The Group pays UK corporation tax on the profits from its residual business, including profits arising on construction operations and management fees received from joint ventures, together with UK income tax on rental income that arises from investments held by offshore subsidiaries in which the Group holds a minority interest.
Accounting policies The tax charge for the year is recognised in the income statement and the statement of comprehensive income, according to the accounting treatment of the related transaction.
The tax charge comprises both current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
The current tax charge is based on tax rates that are enacted or substantively enacted at the year end.
Deferred tax arises due to certain temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and those for taxation purposes.
Temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are not provided for to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities.
As a REIT, rental profits and gains on disposal of investment properties are exempt from corporation tax.
As a result, no deferred tax provision has been recognised at the balance sheet date in respect of property assets revaluation and capital allowances.
At the balance sheet date, the Groups investments in unit trusts were not exempt from tax as a REIT and, where they remain within the charge to tax, a deferred tax liability has been recognised as appropriate.
The Group will be able to utilise its tax adjusted losses against gains arising on the disposal of its investments in unit trusts.
As the deferred tax liability on non-property business investments exceeds the asset relating to the losses, the deferred tax asset in respect of the tax adjusted losses has been recognised in full.
However, the Finance Act 2019 substantively enacted on 8 January 2019 contains provisions that exempt gains arising in accounting periods beginning on or after 6 April 2019 on the disposal by a REIT of shares and other similar interests in entities that derive at least 75% of their value from land situated in the UK.
These provisions will exempt the Groups holdings in unit trusts from the charge to tax.
This is considered in more detail at 2.5 d. a Tax income statement The total taxation charge credit in the income statement is analysed as follows: 2018 2017 m m Corporation tax on residual business income arising in UK companies 3.7 1.7 Income tax on UK rental income arising in non-UK companies 0.4 Current tax charge 4.1 1.7 Origination and reversal of temporary differences 4.4 4.5 Effect of change in tax rate 0.6 Deferred tax charge 4.4 3.9 Total tax charge in income statement 8.5 5.6 The movement in deferred tax provided is shown in more detail in note 2.5 d. THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2018 125 Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Section 2: Results for the year continued 2.5 Tax continued a Tax income statement continued In the income statement, a tax charge of 8.5 million arises on a profit before tax of 245.8 million.
The taxation charge that would arise at the standard rate of UK corporation tax is reconciled to the actual tax charge as follows: 2018 2017 m m Profit before tax 245.8 229.4 Income tax using the UK corporation tax rate of 19% 2017: 19.25% 46.7 44.2 Property rental business profits exempt from tax in the REIT Group 13.5 11.2 Property revaluations not subject to tax 24.9 25.0 Effect of indexation on investments 1.1 Effect of statutory tax reliefs 0.2 0.6 Effect of tax deduction transferred to equity on share schemes 0.3 0.5 Rate difference on deferred tax 0.5 Prior year adjustments 0.1 0.7 Total tax charge credit in income statement 8.5 5.6 As a UK REIT, the Group is exempt from UK corporation tax on the profits from its property rental business.
Accordingly, the element of the Groups profit before tax relating to its property rental business has been separately identified in the reconciliation above.
Although the Group does not pay UK corporation tax on the profits from its property rental business, it is required to distribute 90% of the profits from its property rental business after accounting for tax adjustments as a Property Income Distribution PID.
PIDs are charged to tax in the same way as property income in the hands of the recipient.
For the year ended 31 December 2018, the required PID is expected to be 58.2 million of which 55.9 million has been distributed at the year end, with the remainder to be distributed in May 2019. b Tax other comprehensive income Within other comprehensive income a tax charge totalling nil 2017: nil has been recognised representing deferred tax.
c Tax statement of changes in equity Within the statement of changes in equity a tax credit totalling 0.1 million 2017: 0.7 million credit has been recognised representing deferred tax.

The UK corporation tax rate will reduce from 19% to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020.
This will reduce the Groups future current tax charge accordingly.
The deferred tax liability at 31 December 2018 has been calculated based on the rate at which it is expected to reverse.
As a REIT, disposals of investment property are exempt from tax and as a result no deferred tax liability has been recognised in relation to these assets.
At the balance sheet date, the Groups investments in property unit trusts being primarily its interests in joint ventures were not exempt from tax as a REIT.
Where they remain within the charge to tax, a deferred tax liability has been recognised on the excess of the market value of these assets over their historic tax base cost.
At 31 December 2018, the deferred tax liability in relation to these investments was 24.4 million.
The unit trusts in which the Group invests derive their value from UK land.
On 8 January, the Finance Act 2019 was substantively enacted, which contains provisions that will exempt capital gains on such units from the charge to UK tax to the extent they derive their value from UK property.
As these provisions had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, the Group is recognising a deferred tax liability in respect of its investments.
However, the Group will reverse this deferred tax liability during 2019, resulting in a credit to the income statement.
The deferred tax asset in respect of losses will also be reversed, to the extent that it has been recognised against the liability on investments.
The expected impact of the reversal of these deferred tax items is shown in the table below.
Impact of Finance Act 2019 Charged Charged Deferred tax At 31 credited in credited in asset liability December 2018 income equity after release m m m m Investments 24.4 24.4 Property, plant and machinery 0.7 0.7 Share schemes 0.6 0.6 Tax value of carried forward losses recognised 11.2 9.9 1.3 Net tax assets liabilities 11.9 14.5 2.6 Deferred tax is an accounting adjustment intended to reflect tax that the Group may have to pay in the future if certain events occur, and is distinct from the Groups current tax charge the latter being the tax actually payable to HM Revenue & Customs for the year.
Accordingly, a reversal of the deferred tax provision is an accounting only adjustment, and does not result in the Group receiving a tax credit or refund.
Company Deferred tax has not been recognised on temporary differences of 191.0 million 2017: 165.9 million in respect of revaluation of subsidiaries and investment in joint ventures as it is considered unlikely that these investments will be divested.

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2018 127 Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Section 3: Asset management The Group holds its property portfolio directly and through its joint ventures.
The performance of the property portfolio, whether wholly owned or in joint ventures, is the key factor that drives net asset value NAV, one of the Groups key performance indicators.
The following pages provide disclosures about the Groups investments in property assets and joint ventures and their performance over the year.
3.1 Wholly owned property assets The Groups wholly owned property portfolio is held in two groups on the balance sheet at the carrying values detailed below.
In the Groups EPRA NAV, all these groups are shown at market value.
i Investment property fixed assets These are assets that the Group intends to hold for a long period to earn rental income or capital appreciation.
The assets are held at fair value in the balance sheet with changes in fair value taken to the income statement.
ii Investment property under development fixed assets These are assets which are currently in the course of construction and which will be transferred to Investment property on completion.
Accounting policies Properties held under operating leases are not included in assets, but the future payments due in respect of these properties are disclosed in note 4.6a.
Investment property and investment property under development are held at fair value.
Inventories are shown at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
All costs directly associated with the purchase and construction of a property, and all subsequent qualifying expenditure is capitalised.
The recognition of acquisitions and disposals of investment and other property occurs on unconditional exchange of contracts.
In accordance with IFRS 15, revenue from the disposal of investment and other property is recognised at a point in time.
Borrowing costs are capitalised if they are directly attributable to the acquisition and construction of a property asset.
Capitalisation of borrowing costs commences when the activities to prepare the asset are in progress and expenditures and borrowing costs are being incurred.
Capitalisation of borrowing costs continues until the assets are substantially ready for their intended use but stops if development activities are suspended.
If the resulting carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognised.
The capitalisation rate is arrived at by reference to the actual rate payable on borrowings for development purposes or, with regard to that part of the development cost financed out of general borrowings, to the average rate.
During the year the average capitalisation rate used was 5.4% 2017: 6.1%.
The external valuation of property assets involves significant judgement and changes to the core assumptions: market conditions, rental income, occupancy and property management costs, could have a significant impact on the carrying value of these assets.
See below for more details of the valuation process.
Valuation process The valuations of the properties are performed twice a year on the basis of valuation reports prepared by external, independent valuers, having an appropriate recognised professional qualification.
The fair values are based on market values as defined in the RICS Appraisal and Valuation Manual, issued by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
CB Richard Ellis Ltd, Jones Lang LaSalle Ltd and Messrs Knight Frank, Chartered Surveyors were the valuers in the years ended 31 December 2018 and 2017.
The valuations are based on: Information provided by the Group such as current rents, occupancy, operating costs, terms and conditions of leases and nomination agreements, capital expenditure, etc.
This information is derived from the Groups financial systems and is subject to the Groups overall control environment Assumptions and valuation models used by the valuers the assumptions are typically market related, such as yield and discount rates.
These are based on their professional judgement and market observation.
The information provided to the valuers and the assumptions and the valuation models used by the valuers are reviewed by the Property Board and the CFO.
This includes a review of the fair value movements over the year.

Where the asset is leased to a University, the valuations also reflect the length of the lease, the allocation of maintenance and insurance responsibilities between the Group and the lessee, and the markets general perception of the lessees creditworthiness.
The resulting valuations are cross-checked against the initial yields and the capital value per bed derived from actual market transactions.
For development properties, the fair value is usually calculated by estimating the fair value of the completed property using the discounted cash flow method less estimated costs to completion.

3.3 Other non-current assets Accounting policies Property, plant and equipment Other than land and buildings, property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses see below.
Land and buildings are stated at fair value on the same basis as investment properties.
Property, plant and equipment mainly comprise leasehold improvements at the Groups head office and London office as well as computer hardware and software at these sites.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Leasehold improvements Shorter life of lease and economic life Other assets 420 years Intangible assets Intangible assets predominantly comprise internally developed computer software which allows customers to book online and processes transactions within the sales cycle.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the income statement as an expense incurred, 2018: nil, 2017: nil.
The assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over four to seven years, being the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets, from the date they are available for use.

132 THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2018 Strategic report p0151 Corporate governance p5299 Financial statements p100155 Other information p156160 Section 3: Asset management continued 3.4 Investments in joint ventures Group Accounting policies Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
The consolidated financial statements include joint ventures initially at cost subsequently, increased or decreased by the Groups share of total gains and losses of joint ventures on an equity basis.
Interest free joint venture investment loans are initially recorded at fair value the difference between the nominal amount and fair value being treated as an investment in the joint venture.
The implied discount is amortised over the contracted life of the investment loan.
The Directors consider that the agreements integral to its joint ventures result in the Group having joint control: a significant degree of judgement is exercised in this assessment due to the complexity of the contractual arrangements.
USAF and LSAV are jointly owned entities that are accounted for as joint ventures.
Due to the complexity of the contractual arrangements and Unites role as manager of the joint venture vehicles, the assessment of joint control following changes to accounting standards IFRS10 involves judgements around a number of significant factors.
These factors include how Unite as fund manager has the ability to direct relevant activities such as acquisitions, disposals, capital expenditure for refurbishments and funding whether through debt or equity.
This assessment for USAF is complex because of the number of unitholders and how their rights are represented through an Advisory Committee.
For some of the activities it is not clear who has definitive control of the activities: in some scenarios the Group can control, in others the Advisory Committee.
However, for the activities which are considered to have the greatest impact on the returns of USAF, acquisitions and equity financing, it has been determined that the Group and the Advisory Committee has joint power in directing these activities and that on balance, it is appropriate to account for USAF as a joint venture.
The assessment for LSAV is more straightforward because the Group and GIC each own 50% of the joint venture and there is therefore much clearer evidence that control over the key activities is shared by the two parties.
The Group has two joint ventures: Groups share of assets results Legal entity in which Joint venture 2018 2017 Objective Partner Group has interest The UNITE UK Student 26.9% 26.2% Invest and operate Consortium of investors UNITE UK Student Accommodation Fund USAF student accommodation Accommodation Fund, throughout the UK a Jersey Unit Trust London Student Accommodation 50% 50% Operate student GIC Real Estate Pte, Ltd LSAV Unit Trust, a Jersey Venture LSAV accommodation Real estate investment Unit Trust and LSAV in London vehicle of the Government Holdings Ltd, of Singapore incorporated in Jersey Pa rt of the Groups interest is held through a subsidiary, USAF Feeder Guernsey Limited, in which there is an external investor.
A minority interest therefore occurs on consolidation of the Groups results representing the external investors share of profits and assets relating to its investment in USAF.
The ordinary shareholders of The Unite Group plc are beneficially interested in 25.3 % 2017: 24.6% of USAF.
The increase in ownership of USAF in 2018 was due to the settlement of the 2017 promote fee in units 4.0 million and an additional acquisition of units in the year 8.5 million.

These were primarily provided on the setting up of the joint venture to provide capital to acquire investment properties.
As a result of being provided interest free, the loans were discounted on recognition to reflect the fair value, the unwinding of the discount is reflected in the Groups finance income.
c Transactions with joint ventures The Group acts as asset and property manager for the joint ventures and receives management fees in relation to these services.
The Group has recognised the following fees in its results for the year.

Changes in fair value are recognised in Other comprehensive income and presented in the revaluation reserve in equity.
Carrying value of investment in subsidiaries The movements in the Companys interest in unlisted subsidiaries and joint ventures during the year are as follows: Investment in subsidiaries 2018 2017 m m At 1 January 926.6 725.4 Revaluation 262.8 201.2 At 31 December 1,189.4 926.6 The carrying value of investment in subsidiaries has been calculated using the equity attributable to the owners of the parent company from the consolidated balance sheet adjusted for the fair value of fixed rate loans.
This includes investment property, investment property under development and swaps at a fair value calculated by a third party expert.
All investment properties and investment properties under development are classified as Level 3 in the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy and have been discussed on page 131.
The fixed rate loans range between Level 1 and Level 2 in the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy and have been discussed further on page 139.
In addition to the equity investment in subsidiaries and joint ventures, the Company has provided a loan with interest chargeable at 6.125% to LDC Holdings plc.
The carrying value of the loan to LDC Holdings plc was 90.0 million 2017: 90.0 million.

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2018 137 Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Section 4: Funding The Group finances its development and investment activities through a mixture of retained earnings, borrowings and equity.
The Group continuously monitors its financing arrangements to manage its gearing.
Interest rate swaps are used to manage the Groups risk to fluctuations in interest rate movements.
The following pages provide disclosures about the Groups funding position, including borrowings, gearing and hedging instruments: its exposure to market risks: and its capital management policies.
The Merger reserve arose on the acquisition of the Unilodge portfolio in June 2001.
4.1 Borrowings Accounting policies In the current year, the Group has applied IFRS 9 Financial Instruments as revised in July 2014 and the related consequential amendments to other IFRS Standards that are effective for an annual period that begins on or after 1 January 2018.
The transition provisions of IFRS 9 allow an entity not to restate comparatives.
Additionally, the Group adopted consequential amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures that were applied to the disclosures for 2018 and to the comparative period.
IFRS 9 introduced new requirements for: 1 The classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities 2 Impairment of financial assets, and 3 General hedge accounting.
The Group has applied IFRS 9 in accordance with the transition provisions set out in IFRS 9. a Classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities The date of initial application i. e. the date on which the Group has assessed its existing financial assets and financial liabilities in terms of the requirements of IFRS 9 is 1 January 2018.
Accordingly, the Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 9 to instruments that continue to be recognised as at 1 January 2018 and has not applied the requirements to instruments that have already been derecognised as at 1 January 2018.
Unite reviewed and assessed the Groups existing financial assets and liabilities as at 1 January 2018 based on the facts and circumstances that existed at that date.
There was no impact on the classification and measurement of those assets and liabilities.
b Impairment of financial assets In relation to the impairment of financial assets, IFRS 9 requires an expected credit loss model as opposed to an incurred credit loss model under IAS 39.
The expected credit loss model requires the Group to account for expected credit losses and changes in those expected credit losses at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the financial assets.
In other words, it is no longer necessary for a credit event to have occurred before credit losses are recognised.
In particular, IFRS 9 requires the Group to measure the loss allowance for a financial instrument at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses ECL if the credit risk on that financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition, or if the financial instrument is a purchased or originated credit impaired financial asset.
However, if the credit risk on a financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition except for a purchased or originated credit impaired financial asset, the Group is required to measure the loss allowance for that financial instrument at an amount equal to 12 months ECL.
The impact of this assessment is disclosed within note 5.2 of the financial statements.
c General hedge accounting The Group has applied the IFRS 9 hedge accounting requirements prospectively from the date of initial application on 1 January 2018.
The Groups qualifying hedging relationships in place as at 1 January 2018 also qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with IFRS 9 and were therefore regarded as continuing hedging relationships.
However under IFRS 9 unlike under IAS 39, hedge accounting may not be voluntarily discontinued if the criteria for discontinuation are not met.
Under IFRS 9 the hedging reserve now includes balances arising from hedging relationships for which hedge accounting is no longer applied note 4.5a.
Interest bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.

A further overdraft facility of 10.0 million 2017: 10.0 million is also available.
Properties with a carrying value of 638.1 million 2017: 609.1 million have been pledged as security against the Groups drawn down borrowings.
The carrying value of borrowings is considered to be approximate to fair value, except for the Groups fixed rate loans as analysed below: 2018 2017 Carrying value Fair value Carrying value Fair value m m m m Level 1 IFRS fair value hierarchy 365.0 373.5 90.0 96.1 Level 2 IFRS fair value hierarchy 237.8 251.2 239.1 263.8 Other loans 10.2 10.2 183.7 183.7 Total borrowings 592.6 614.5 512.8 543.6 The fair value of loans classified as Level 1 in the IFRS fair value hierarchy is determined using quoted prices in active markets for identical liabilities.
The fair value of loans classified as Level 2 in the IFRS fair value hierarchy has been calculated by a third party expert discounting estimated future cash flows on the basis of market expectation of future interest rates.
The fair value represents the net present value of the difference between the contracted rate and the valuation rate when applied to the projected balances for the period from the reported date to the contracted expiry date.
Loans are valued using the mid-point of the yield curve prevailing on the reporting date.
The valuations do not include accrued interest from the previous settlement date to the reporting date nor a credit valuation adjustment.

In accordance with the Groups treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue interest rate swaps for trading purposes and only holds swaps which are considered to be commercially effective.
Accounting policies Interest rate swaps are recognised initially and subsequently at fair value, with mark to market movements recognised in the income statement unless cash flow hedge accounting is applied.
The Group designates certain interest rate derivatives as hedging instruments.
The interest rate swap is designated as the hedging instrument in a hedge of the variability in cash flows attributable to the interest risk of borrowings.
At inception the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with the risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
Furthermore, at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument is effective.
The effective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swap is recognised in Other comprehensive income and presented under the heading of Hedging reserve in equity, limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item from inception of the hedge.
Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The Group only applies hedge accounting when the hedge is expected to be highly effective.
Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss, in the same line as the recognised hedged item.
If the Group expects that some or all of the loss accumulated in the hedging reserve will not be recovered in the future, that amount is immediately reclassified to profit or loss.
The Group discontinues hedge accounting only when the hedging relationship or a part thereof ceases to meet the qualifying criteria.
This includes instances when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised.
The discontinuation is accounted for prospectively.
Any gain or loss recognised in Other comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedging reserve at that time remains in equity and is reclassified to profit or loss when the forecast transaction occurs.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in the hedging reserve is reclassified immediately to profit or loss.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
The following table shows the fair value of interest rate swaps: 2018 2017 m m Current Non-current 0.1 0.8 Fair value of interest rate swaps 0.1 0.8 The fair values of interest rate swaps have been calculated by a third party expert, discounting estimated future cash flows on the basis of market expectations of future interest rates, representing Level 2 in the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy.

The overall average cost of investment debt on an EPRA basis is 3.8% 2017: 4.1%.
4.4 Gearing The Groups adjusted gearing ratio is a key indicator that the Group uses to manage its indebtedness.
EPRA net asset value NAV and adjusted net debt are used to calculate adjusted gearing.
Adjusted net debt excludes mark to market of interest rate swaps as shown below.

The Groups treasury policy focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
Details on credit risk can be found in note 5.3. a Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk because entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates.
The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, and by the use of interest rate swap contracts and forward interest rate contracts.
Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with interest rate views and defined risk appetite: ensuring the most cost-effective hedging strategies are applied.
The Groups exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section of this note.
The Group holds its debt finance under both floating and fixed rate arrangements.
The majority of floating debt is hedged through the use of interest rate swap agreements.
The Groups policy guideline has been to hedge 75%-95% of the Groups exposure for terms of approximately 210 years.
At 31 December 2018, after taking account of interest rate swaps, 100% 2017: 64% of the Groups borrowing was held at fixed rates.
Excluding the nil million 2017: 4.7 million of swaps the fixed investment borrowing is at an average rate of 4.4% 2017: 5.2% for an average period of 6.4 years 2017: 4.5 years, including all debt with current or forward starting swaps the average rate is 4.4% 2017: 4.0%.
Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the fair value of issued fixed rate debt held and the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate debt held.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.
As the critical terms of the interest rate swap contracts and their corresponding hedged items are the same, the Group performs a qualitative assessment of effectiveness and it is expected that the value of the interest rate swap contracts and the value of the corresponding hedged items will systematically change in opposite direction in response to movements in the underlying interest rates.
The main source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedge relationships is the effect of the counterparty and the Groups own credit risk on the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts, which is not reflected in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the change in interest rates.
No other sources of ineffectiveness emerged from these hedging relationships.
The Group holds interest rate swaps at 31 December 2018 against nil million 2017: 4.7 million of the Groups borrowings.
The maturity of these swaps and the applicable interest rates are shown below, in line with disclosure under IAS 7:24B b.
The following tables detail various information regarding interest rate swap contracts outstanding at the end of the reporting period and their related hedged items.
Under IFRS 9 part of the hedging reserve now relates to balances arising from hedge relationships for which hedge accounting is no longer applied.

The floating rate on the interest rate swaps is 3-month LIBOR.
The Group will settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis.
All interest rate swap contracts exchanging floating rate interest amounts for fixed rate interest amounts are designated as cash flow hedges to reduce the Groups cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on borrowings.
The interest rate swaps and the interest payments on the loan occur simultaneously and the amount accumulated in equity is reclassified to profit or loss over the period that the floating rate interest payments on debt affect profit or loss.
The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and non-derivative instruments as at 31 December 2018.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the reporting date was outstanding for the whole year.
A 1% increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 1% higher and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit for the year ended 31 December 2018 would decrease by 1.1 million 2017: decrease by 0.8 million.
This is mainly attributable to the Groups exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings.
The Groups sensitivity to interest rates has increased during the current year mainly due to the increase in variable rate debt drawn.
b Credit risk on financial instruments In order to minimise credit risk, the Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral, where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.
The Group only transacts with entities that are rated the equivalent of investment grade and investments in these instruments, where the counterparties have minimum Acredit rating, are considered to have low credit risk for the purpose of impairment assessment.
The credit rating information is supplied by independent rating agencies where available and, if not available, the Group uses other publicly available financial information including CDS price and its own trading records to rate its major customers.
The Groups exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties in line with board policy.
Before accepting any new customer, the treasury team uses external credit ratings to assess the potential customers credit quality and defines credit limits by customer.
Monitoring procedures are also in place to ensure that follow-up action is taken when ratings deteriorate.
The Group does not hold any credit enhancements to cover its credit risks associated with its financial assets, The Group considers the following as constituting an event of default for internal credit risk management purposes as historical experience indicates that financial assets that meet either of the following criteria are generally not recoverable: when there is a breach of financial covenants by the debtor: or information developed internally or obtained from external sources indicates that the debtor is unlikely to pay its creditors, including the Group, in full without taking into accountant collaterial held by the Group.
Irrespective of the above analysis, the Group considers that default has occurred with a financial asset is more than 90 days past due unless the Group has reasonable and supportable information to demonstrate that a more lagging default criterion is more appropriate.
The tables below detail the credit quality of the Groups financial assets, contract assets and financial guarantee contracts, as well as the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk by credit risk rating grades.

m m m Bank deposits Aperforming 1-3 months 33.0 33.0 c Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has established an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short-, mediumand long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Details of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk are set out below.
For development activities, the Group has a policy of raising substantially the full amount of equity required for each development before drawing debt against the development.
The funding requirements of developments are therefore secured at the outset of works.

Capital is managed so as to continue as a going concern and to promote the long-term success of the business and to maintain sustainable returns for shareholders and joint venture partners.
The Group uses a number of key metrics to manage its capital structure: adjusted net debt note 4.4 adjusted gearing note 4.4 LTV note 2.3a weighted average cost of investment debt note 4.5aii.
In order to manage levels of adjusted gearing over the medium term, the Group seeks to deliver NAV growth and to recycle capital invested in lower performing assets into new assets and property developments.
49.5 million of property assets were sold in 2018 and we plan to sell 100150 million of property during 2019.
The Group targets a yield on cost of approximately 8%.
The Group does not commit to developing new sites until sufficient equity and funding to fulfil the full cost of the development is secure.
The Board monitors the ability of the Group to pay dividends out of available cash and distributable profits.
The Operations segment generated cash of 81.2 million 2017: 63.2 million during the year, thereby covering the combined paid interim dividend and proposed final dividend of 75.7 million, 1.1 times 2017: 54.8 million, 1.2 times.
4.8 Equity Accounting policies Ordinary shares are classified as equity.

Careful management of working capital is vital to ensure that the Group can meet its trading and financing obligations within its ordinary operating cycle.
On the following pages you will find disclosures around the Groups cash position and how cash is generated from the Groups trading activities, and disclosures around trade receivables and payables.
Accounting policies Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
5.1 Cash and cash equivalents The Groups cash position at 31 December 2018 was 123.6 million 2017: 51.2 million.
The Groups cash balances include 2.4 million 2017: 3.1 million whose use at the balance sheet date is restricted by funding agreements to pay operating costs and loan interest relating to specific properties.
The Group generates cash from its operating activities as follows: Group Company Note 2018 2017 2018 2017 m m m m m Profit loss for the year 237.3 223.8 252.1 197.9 Adjustments for: Depreciation and amortisation 3.3 7.3 7.0 Fair value of share-based payments 6.1 1.1 1.5 Dividends received Change in value of investment property 3.1 105.8 103.1 Change in value of investments 3.5 262.8 201.2 Net finance costs 4.3 13.5 28.7 7.3 0.5 Loss profit on disposal of investment property 6.8 0.6 Share of joint venture profit 3.4b 95.8 103.1 Trading with joint venture adjustment 6.4 7.2 Tax charge credit 2.5a 8.5 5.6 Cash flows from operating activities before changes in working capital 79.2 67.0 3.4 2.8 Decrease in trade and other receivables 4.5 13.2 Increase in inventories 5.5 2.3 Decrease Increase in trade and other payables 5.8 6.9 2.9 2.5 Cash flows from operating activities 63.5 58.4 0.5 0.3 In 2018, 4.0 million of the brought forward trade and other receivables was settled in units in USAF rather than cash 2017: 8.1 million.

THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2018 147 Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Section 5: Working capital continued 5.2 Trade and other receivables Accounting policies On the basis that trade receivables meet the business model and cash flow characteristics tests, they can be recognised at amortised cost, which is consistent with the previous measurement under IAS 39.
A credit risk assessment based on historic data and specific review of individual debtors was carried out for all trade receivables at the point of recognition and an appropriate expected credit loss has been recognised in line with the requirements of IFRS 9.
This change in approach did not have a material impact on the carrying value of trade receivables.
Trade and other receivables can be analysed as follows: all trade and other receivables are current.
Group Company 2018 2017 2018 2017 m m m m Trade receivables 22.8 19.4 Amounts due from Group undertakings 1,095.4 912.1 Amounts owed by joint ventures 36.7 41.8 Prepayments and accrued income 14.9 11.0 0.2 USAF performance fee 4.0 Other receivables 13.7 6.7 0.1 Trade and other receivables 88.1 82.9 1,095.7 912.1 The USAF performance fee will be settled in units in USAF.
The Group offers tenancy contracts to commercial Universities and retail unit tenants and individual tenants based on the academic year.
The Group monitors and manages the recoverability of its receivables based on the academic year to which the amounts relate.
Rental income is payable immediately, therefore all receivables relating to tenants are past the payment due date.

This loss has been estimated using the Groups history of loss for similar assets and takes into account current and forecast conditions.
The impact of credit losses is not considered significant in respect of the financial statements.
5.3 Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
It arises principally from the Groups cash balances, the Groups receivables from customers and joint ventures and loans provided to the Groups joint ventures.
At the year end, the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk was as follows: 2018 2017 Note m m Cash 5.1 123.6 51.2 Trade receivables 5.2 22.8 19.4 Amounts due from joint ventures excluding loans that are capital in nature 5.2 36.7 41.8 183.1 112.4 a Cash The Group operates investment guidelines with respect to surplus cash.
Counterparty limits for cash deposits are largely based upon long-term ratings published by credit rating agencies and credit default swap rates.
b Trade receivables The Groups customers can be split into two groups i students individuals and ii commercial organisations including Universities.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced by the characteristics of each customer.
The Group holds tenant deposits of 0.9 million 2017: 9.0 million as collateral against individual customers.
c Joint ventures Amounts receivable from joint ventures fall into two categories working capital balances and investment loans.
The Group has strong working relationships with its joint venture partners and therefore views this as a low credit risk balance.
THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2018 149 Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Section 5: Working capital continued 5.4 Trade and other payables Accounting policies Trade payables are initially recognised at the value of the invoice received from a supplier fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
The carrying value of trade payables is considered approximate to fair value.
Trade and other payables due within one year can be analysed as follows: Group Company 2018 2017 2018 2017 m m m m Trade payables 26.6 19.7 Retentions on construction contracts for properties 9.1 7.8 Amounts due to Group undertakings 2.6 2.5 Other payables and accrued expenses 46.1 67.1 5.3 3.2 Deferred income 59.7 57.5 Trade and other payables 141.5 152.1 7.9 5.7 Other payable and accrued expenses include 0.9 million 2017: 9.0 million in relation to customer deposits.
These will be returned at the end of the tenancy subject to the condition of the accommodation and payment of any outstanding amounts.
