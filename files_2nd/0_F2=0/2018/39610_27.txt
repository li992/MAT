NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2018 Except where indicated, values in these notes are in 000.
Rotork pie is a company domiciled in England.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2018 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The accounting policies contained below in note 1 and the disclosures in notes 2 to 30 all relate to the Group financial statements.
The Company balance sheet, accounting policies and applicable notes can be found following note 30.
Accounting policies The accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of Rotork pie have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRSs as adopted by the EU, IFRIC Interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention subject to the items referred to in the derivative financial instruments accounting policy below.
New accounting standards and interpretations i. IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014 and amended in April 2016, and establishes a five-step model to account for revenue arising from contracts with customers.
Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer.
The Group has adopted IFRS 15 from 1 January 2018, using the modified retrospective method retrospectively with the cumulative effect at the date of initial application.
During 2017, the Group performed a detailed analysis of significant revenue streams, communicated to key stakeholders within the business the key aspects of the accounting change and had specific targeted training for key finance employees.
In early 2018, further work targeted service revenue to assess the impact of the change over the transition date.
The adoption of IFRS 15 had no material impact on the recognition and measurement of the Group's revenue and no adjustments to equity have been made.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments In July 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments that replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and all previous versions of IFRS 9.
IFRS 9 brings together all three aspects of the accounting for financial instruments project: classification and measurement, impairment and hedge accounting.
IFRS 9 introduced a new model for classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, a single, forwardlooking 'expected loss' model for measuring impairment of financial assets including trade receivables and a new approach to hedge accounting that is more closely aligned with an entity's risk management activities.
The Group has adopted IFRS 9 from 1 January 2018 and there has been no material impact on the Group's results or financial position.
Other amendments A number of amended standards became applicable for the current reporting period.
The application of these amendments has not had any material impact on the disclosures, net assets or results of the Group.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted Certain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for 31 December 2018 reporting periods and have not been early adopted by the Group.
An assessment of the impact of these new standards and interpretations is set out below.
i. IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016 and introduces a comprehensive model for the identification of lease arrangements and accounting treatments for both lessors and lessees.
IFRS 16 will supersede the current lease guidance including IAS 17 Leases and the related interpretations when it becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
IFRS 16 distinguishes leases and service contracts on the basis of whether an identified asset is controlled by a customer.
Distinctions of operating leases off balance sheet and finance leases on balance sheet are removed for lessee accounting, and are replaced by a model where a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability have to be recognised for all leases by lessees i. e. all on balance sheet except for short-term leases and leases of low value assets.
The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost subject to certain exceptions less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability.
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date.
Subsequently, the lease liability is adjusted for interest and lease payments, as well as the impact of lease modifications, amongst others.
Furthermore, the classification of cash flows will also be affected as operating lease payments under IAS 17 are presented as operating cash flows: whereas under the IFRS 16 model, the lease payments will be split into a principal and an interest portion which will be presented as financing and operating cash flows respectively.
Extensive disclosures are required by IFRS 16.
96 ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2018 As at 31 December 2018, the Group had non-cancellable operating lease commitments of 17,789,000.
Of these commitments, approximately 4,800,000 relate to short-term leases and low value leases which will both be recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in the income statement, consistent with current accounting.
For the remaining lease commitments the Group expects to recognise right-of-use assets of approximately 12,000,000 and lease liabilities of approximately 12,100,000 on 1 January 2019.
The Group expects that the impact on profit after tax will not be material as a result of adopting the new rules.
Operating cash flows will increase and financing cash flows decrease by approximately 4,000,000 as repayment of the principal portion of the lease liabilities will be classified as cash flows from financing activities.
The Board has decided to apply the modified retrospective method when the standard is first adopted in its financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019.
Therefore, there will be no impact on any comparative accounting period, with any leases recognised on balance sheet on the adoption date of 1 January 2019. ii.
Other There are no other standards that are not yet effective and that would be expected to have a material impact on the entity in the current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions.
Adjustments to profit Adjustments to profit are items of income and expense which, because of the nature, size and or infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation.
These specific items are presented on the face of the income statement to provide greater clarity and a better understanding of the impact of these items on the Group's financial performance.
In doing so, it also facilitates greater comparison of the Group's underlying results with prior periods and assessment of trends in financial performance.
This split is consistent with how underlying business performance is measured internally.
"Adjustments to profit items may include but are not restricted to: costs of significant business restructuring, significant impairments of Cl intangible or tangible assets, adjustments to the fair value of acquisition related items such as contingent consideration, acquired intangible asset amortisation and other items due to their significance, size or nature, and the related taxation. ""'"
"z z m Going concern "" After carrying out a detailed review of the viability of the business, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future."
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
In forming this view, the directors have considered trading and cash flow forecasts, financial commitments, the significant order book with customers spread across different geographic areas and industries and the net cash position.
Consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the year to 31 December 2018.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date control ceases.
Intra-Group balances and any unrealised gains or losses or income and expenses arising from intra-Group transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
For the purposes of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company is expressed in sterling, which is the functional currency of the company, and the presentational currency for the consolidated financial statements.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated to sterling at foreign exchange rates at the dates the values were determined.
Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated into 8 ::: sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are translated to sterling at rates approximating those ruling at the date of the transactions.
Differences on exchange arising from the retranslation of the opening z - net investment in subsidiaries, and from the translation of the results of those subsidiaries at average rate, are reported as an item of z other comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reserve.
"0 ""' ::: 0 z ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2018 97 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2018 1."
Accounting policies continued Any differences that have arisen since 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are presented as a separate component of equity.
Translation differences that arose before the date of transition to IFRS in respect of all foreign entities are not presented as a separate component.
Revenue Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer.
The Group recognises revenue when it transfers control of a product or service to a customer and is shown net of value-added tax, returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group.
Revenue from the sale of actuators, gearboxes and flow control products is recognised in the income statement when control of the goods has transferred, being when the goods have been shipped to the customer in accordance with the contracted shipping terms.
The Group provides service and support through preventative maintenance contracts, on-site and workshop service, retrofit solutions and the client support programme.
Revenue in respect of workshop service and retrofit solutions is recognised on completion of the work and after all performance obligations have been completed.
Revenue in respect of preventative maintenance contracts and the client support programme is recognised as the services are performed in line with the contractual terms.
The directors have assessed that these contracts are satisfied over time given that the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group.
No revenue is recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration due, associated completion costs, the possible return of goods or continuing management involvement with the goods.
The Group has applied the practical expedient in IFRS 15.121 and therefore not disclosed the information in IFRS 15.120 regarding unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligations on contracts with a duration of one year or less Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as: the fair value of the consideration transferred: plus the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree: plus the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree: less the net recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The fair value of the assets and liabilities assumed are provisional for a 12 month period.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity.
Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
Goodwill is stated at cost or deemed cost less any impairment losses.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment annually.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group's cash generating units CG Us expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying value of an asset or its CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Intangible assets i Research and development Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the income statement in the period in which it is incurred.
Development costs incurred after the point at which the commercial and technical feasibility of the product have been proven, and the decision to complete the development has been taken and resources made available, are capitalised.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Development expenditure has an estimated useful life of up to five years and is written off on a straight-line basis.
ii Other intangible assets Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group as part of a business combination are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
The useful life of each of these assets is assessed based on discussions with the management of the acquired business and takes account of the differing natures of each of the intangibles acquired.
The assessed useful lives of intangibles acquired are as follows: Brands 4 to 10 years Customer relationships 2 to 8 years Other - product design patents 4 to 8 years Other - order backlog 3 months to 1 year Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets.
98 ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2018 Property, plant and equipment Freehold land is not depreciated.
Long leasehold buildings are amortised over 50 years or the expected useful life of the building where less than 50 years.
Other assets are depreciated in equal annual instalments by reference to their estimated useful lives and residual values at the following annual rates: Freehold buildings 2% to 4% Short leasehold buildings period of lease Plant and equipment 10% to 33% Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation.
leases Where fixed assets are financed by leasing agreements, which give rights approximating to ownership, the assets are treated as if they had been purchased and the capital element of the leasing commitments are shown as obligations under finance leases.
Assets acquired under finance leases are initially recognised at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The rentals payable are apportioned between interest, which is charged to the income statement, and liability, which reduces the outstanding obligation so as to give a constant rate of charge on the outstanding lease obligations.
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease in arriving at the operating profit.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the Group becomes party to the related contracts and are measured initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Cl Taxation Income tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
"Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the ""' z extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity."
"Current tax is the expected tax payable z m on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax "" payable in respect of previous years."
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes and the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profits.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Inventory and work in progress Inventory and work in progress is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is calculated either on a 'first in, first out' or an average cost basis.
In respect of work in progress and finished goods, cost includes all production overheads and the attributable proportion of indirect overhead expenses which are required to bring inventories to their present location and condition.
The net realisable value in respect of old and slow moving inventory is assessed by reference to historic usage patterns and forecast future usage.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and short term with an original maturity less than three months deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand form part of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows.
Equity Equity comprises issued equity capital, share premium, reserves and retained earnings.
When issued equity capital is repurchased, the amount paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a change in equity.
8 ::: Repurchased shares are debited directly to equity and shown as a deduction from retained earnings.
"z - Provisions z i Warranties 0 ""' A provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products or services are sold."
The provision is based on historical warranty ::: cost data, known issues and management expectations of future costs.
0 z ii Contingent consideration The terms of an acquisition may provide that the value of the purchase consideration, which may be payable in cash at a future date, depends on uncertain future events.
The amounts recognised in the financial statements represent a fair value estimate at the balance sheet date of the amounts expected to be paid.
ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2018 99 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2018 1.
Accounting policies continued Employee benefits i Pension plans Where the Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme, contributions are made in accordance with the schedule of contributions agreed with the Trustees.
In respect of all actuarial gains and losses that arise in calculating the Group's obligation in respect of the plans, these are recognised in equity.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the consolidated balance sheet represents the deficit in the Group's defined benefit pension schemes.
Interest on pension scheme liabilities has been recognised within financing expenses.
The Group also operates defined contribution pension schemes.
The costs for these schemes are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
ii Share-based payment transactions The Rotork Sharesave Plan offers certain employees the opportunity to purchase shares in Rotork pie at a discounted price compared with the market price at the time of grant.
Details of the scheme are given in note 25.
The fair value of the right option is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period between grant and maturity.
The right option reaches maturity when the employee becomes unconditionally entitled.
The fair value of the grant is measured using a Black-Scholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the rights were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is due only to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
The Rotork Long Term Incentive Plan grants shares to executive directors and senior managers.
These awards may vest after a period of three years dependent upon both market and non-market performance conditions being met.
Details of the grants are given in note 25.
The fair value of the award is measured at grant date, using a Monte Carlo simulation model which takes into account the market based performance criteria, and spread over the vesting period.
The fair value of the award is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity for the share settled award.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to exclude options that do not vest as a result of non-market performance conditions not being met.
The Overseas profit linked share plan OPLSS and the share incentive plan SIP are discretionary profit linked share schemes based on the prior year profit of the participating Rotork companies.
The value of the award to each employee is based on salary and the length of service, the value of the awards can be up to 3,600.
Shares awarded under these schemes are issued by the trustee at the cost of purchase.
The costs of providing these plans are recognised in the income statement over the period to which the employee has earned the award.
iii Long term service leave The Group's net obligation in respect of long term service leave is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
iv Other employee benefits The Group offers a number of discretionary bonus schemes to employees around the world.
The costs of these schemes are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses forward exchange contracts and swaps to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risk arising from operational and financing activities.
These are the only derivative financia l instruments used by the Group.
In accordance with its Treasury Policy, the Group does not hold or issue contracts for trading purposes.
Forward exchange contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
At inception of designated hedging relationships, the Group documents the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge.
The Group also documents the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, including whether the changes in cash flows of the hedged item and hedging instrument are expected to offset each other.
Forward exchange contracts are recognised initially at fair value.
Where a forward exchange contract is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised liability, a firm commitment or a highly probable forecasted transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the forward contract is recognised directly in equity.
Any effective cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement at the same time as the hedged transaction.
The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised in the income statement immediately.
When a hedging instrument or hedge relationship is terminated but the hedged transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss held in equity is recognised in the income statement immediately.
Dividends Interim dividends are recorded in the financial statements when they are paid.
Final dividends are recorded in the financial statements in the period in which they are approved by the Company's shareholders.
100 ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2018 Critical accounting estimates and judgements Estimates and judgements are regularly evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future.
The resulting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the actual results.
The estimates and assumptions that have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the next financial year are listed below.
i Critical accounting judgements There are no critical accounting judgements requiring evaluation.
ii Key sources of estimation uncertainty Retirement benefits The Group's financial statements include costs in relation to, and provisions for, retirement benefit obligations.
Management is required to estimate the future rates of inflation, salary increases, discount rates and longevity of members, each of which may have a material impact on the defined benefit obligations that are recorded.
Sensitivities to changes in key estimates affecting the pension schemes' liabilities are shown in note 24.
Alternative performance measures The Group uses adjusted figures as key performance measures in addition to those reported under adopted IFRS, as management believe these measures facilitate greater comparison of the Group's underlying results with prior periods and assessment of trends in financial performance.
The key alternative performance measures that the Group use include adjusted profit measures and organic constant currency OCC.
Explanations of how they are calculated and how they are reconciled to IFRS statutory results are set out below.
"Adjusted operating profit ""' z Adjusted operating profit is the Group's operating profit excluding the amortisation of acquired intangible assets and other adjustments z m that are considered to be significant and where treatment as an adjusted item provides stakeholders with additional useful information "" to assess the trading performance of the Group on a consistent basis."
Further details on these adjustments are given in note 4. b.
Adjusted profit before tax The adjustments in calculating adjusted profit before tax are consistent with those in calculating adjusted operating profit above.
"2018 2017 Profit before tax 120,748 80,586 Adjustments: 20,284 Amortisation of acquired intangible assets 27,183 Curtailment gain from the closure of defined benefit pension schemes to future accrual 8,575 Guaranteed Minimum Pension equalisation expense 920 10,000 Release of contingent consideration Impairment of goodwill 21,594 4,052 Consultancy costs associated with the Growth Acceleration Programme 1,630 Loss on disposal of businesses 658 Redundancy and executive change costs 2,896 1,980 Other restructuring costs 2,862 1,803 143,845 Adjusted profit before tax 124,776 8 :::: z - z 0 ""' :::: 0 z ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2018 101 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2018 2."
Alternative performance measures continued c. Adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share Adjusted basic earnings per share is calculated using the adjusted net profit attributable to the ordinary shareholders and dividing it by the weighted average ordinary shares in issue see note 18.
Adjusted net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders is calculated as follows: 2018 2017 Net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders 91,744 55,613 Adjustments: Amortisation of acquired intangible assets 20,284 27,183 8,575 Curtailment gain from the closure of defined benefit pension schemes to future accrual Guaranteed Minimum Pension equalisation expense 920 Release of contingent consideration 10,000 Impairment of goodwill 21,594 Consultancy costs associated with the Growth Acceleration Programme 4,052 1,630 Loss on disposal of businesses 658 2,896 Redundancy and executive change costs 1,980 Other restructuring costs 2,862 1,803 Tax effect on adjusted items 5,025 7,879 Adjusted net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders 109,816 91,924 Diluted earnings per share is calculated by using the adjusted net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders and dividing it by the weighted average ordinary shares in issue adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares see note 18. d. Adjusted dividend cover Dividend cover is calculated as earnings per share divided by dividends per share.
Adjusted dividend cover is calculated as adjusted earnings per share as defined in note 2c above divided by dividends per share.
e. Return on capital employed The return on capital employed ratio is used by management to help ensure that capital is used efficiently.
2018 2017 Adjusted operating profit 146,015 130,162 Total equity 513,628 457,200 Cash and cash equivalents 104,489 63,192 Interest bearing loans and borrowings 60,881 75,807 Pension deficit net of deferred tax 22,001 38,924 492,021 Capital employed 508,739 Average capital employed 500,380 522,141 Return on capital employed 29.2% 24.9% Average capital employed is defined as the average of the capital employed at the start and end of the relevant year.
f. Working capital as a percentage of revenue Working capital as a percentage of revenue is monitored as control of working capital is key to achieving our cash generation targets.
It is calculated as inventory plus trade receivables, less trade payables, divided by revenue.
102 ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2018 g. Organic constant currency DCC OCC results remove the results of businesses acquired or disposed of during the period that are not consistently presented in both periods' results.
The 2018 results are restated at 2017 exchange rates.
For businesses acquired, the full results are removed from the year of acquisition.
In the following year, the results for the number of months equivalent to the pre-acquisition period in the prior year are removed.
For disposals and closure of businesses, the results are removed from the current and prior periods.

Operating segments The Group has chosen to organise the management and financial structure by the grouping of related products.
The four identifiable operating segments for which the financial and operating performance is reviewed monthly by the chief operating decision maker are as follows: Controls - the design, manufacture and sale of electric actuators Fluid Systems - the design, manufacture and sale of pneumatic and hydraulic actuators Gears - the design, manufacture and sale of gearboxes, adaption and ancillaries for the valve industry Instruments - the manufacture of high precision pneumatic controls and power transmission products for a w ide range of industries Unallocated expenses comprise corporate expenses.
Transfer prices between business segments are set on an arm's length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
Geographic analysis Rotork has a worldw ide presence in all four operating segments through its subsidiary selling offices and through an agency network.

Other adjustments The other adjustments are adjustments that management consider to be significant and where separate disclosure enables stakeholders to assess the underlying trading performance of the Group on a consistent basis.
The other adjustments to profit included in statutory profit are as follows: 2018 2017 Curtailment gain from the closure of defined benefit pension schemes to future accrual 8,575 Guaranteed Minimum Pension GMP equalisation expense 920 Release of contingent consideration 10,000 21,594 Goodwill impairment 7,655 11,594 Consultancy costs associated with the Growth Acceleration Programme 4,052 1,630 Loss on disposal of businesses 658 Redundancy and executive change costs 2,896 1,980 Other restructuring costs 2,862 1,803 10,468 5,413 2,813 17,007 After the completion of consultation processes with members of the UK and US defined benefit pension schemes both schemes were closed to future accrual on 31 March 2018 and 31 December 2018, respectively.
The closure to future accrual of the two schemes resulted in a one off, non-cash curtailment gain which reduced the defined benefit obligation by 8,575,000 2017: nil.
In October 2018 the High Court judgement in the case of Lloyds Banking Group clarified that pension benefits under the UK scheme need to be equalised for the effects of unequal GMPs.
An allowance of 920,000 2017: nil has been included as a past service cost within the UK scheme's 2018 defined benefit pension expense for all such arrears.
Consultancy costs of 4,052,000 2017: 1,630,000 were incurred on developing the Growth Acceleration Programme.

The effective tax rate for the year is 24.0% 2017: 31.0%.
The adjusted effective tax rate is 23.7% 2017: 26.3% and is lower than the effective tax rate for the year principally because of the geographic mix of those countries where certain of the adjusting items were incurred.
"0 "" :::: The adjusted effective tax rate has fallen from 26.3% in 2017 to 23.7% in 2018, principally because of the reduction in the US corporate z - tax rate from 35% to 21%, which came into effect on 1 January 2018."
In 2017 this resulted in a one-off charge to tax of 1,162,000 on z the revaluation of the US net deferred tax asset, and in 2018 this has resulted in a reduction in the US tax charge because of the lower 0 rate of tax.
"The Group expects its adjusted effective tax rate to continue to fall in line with the current trend in corporate tax rates where ""' :::: Rotork operates."
However the adjusted effective tax rate will still be higher than the standard UK rate due to higher rates of tax in China, 6 the US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and India.
z There is an unrecognised deferred tax liability for temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries.
Rotork pie controls the dividend policies of its subsidiaries and the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences.
The value of temporary differences associated with unremitted earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax has not been recognised is 321,281,000 2017: 305,277,000 ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2018 109 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2018 10.

Where the acquired entity's growth into new markets is through the Group's existing sales network and or where manufacturing of certain products is transferred to other businesses within a division, the lowest level of CGU is considered to be at a divisional sub-group level.
During the year, following the merger of businesses, the Mastergear Italy CGU was consolidated with the Gears Italy CGU and the Dallas CGU was consolidated with the Rotork Controls Inc CGU.
In each case this is the lowest level at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
The disposal relates to the goodwill attributable to the Hiller nuclear business which was sold during the year.
In 2017 an impairment of 21,594,000 was charged, including 19,754,000 relating to the Bifold CGU.
The key assumptions used in the annual impairment review wh ich are common to all CGUs are set out below: i Discount rates The discount rates for the significant CG Us presented above are pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU for which the future cash flows have not been adjusted.
Discount rates are based on estimations that market participants operating in similar sectors to Rotork would make, using the Group's economic profile as a starting point.
For each CGU we adjusted the risk premium on a weighted average basis to reflect the region in which the CGU carries out the majority of its business, applied a premium based on the size of the CGU and applied a market participant tax rate in the region the CGU operates.
In calculating the discount rates, consideration was given to exclude risks that were not relevant or which had already been reflected in the cash flows.
ii Growth rates Val ue in use calculations are used to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill allocated to each of the CG Us.
These calculations use cash flow projections from management forecasts which are based on the budget and the three year plan.
The three year plan is a bottom up process which takes place as part of the annual budget process.
Once the budget for the next financial year is finalised, years two and three of the three year plan are prepared by each reporting entity's management reflecting their view of the local market, known projects and experience of past performance.
The Group annual budget and the three year plan are reviewed and approved by the Board each year.
The compound annual revenue growth forecast for the Group during years one to three, used within the impairment models, is 7.5%.
In the period after the three year plan growth rates are forecast at 5.0% 2017: 5.0% per annum for the next two years and at 2.0% 2017: 2.0% for the long-term growth rate.
The 5.0% rate reflects a realistic market forecast for the flow control market up until 2023.
The continued need for our customers to improve their infrastructure by automating valves gives confidence that the growth rate of our market will exceed the long-term growth rate of 2.0% used in the impairment calculations.
11 Q ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2018 Sensitivity analysis The Group has conducted an analysis of the sensitivity of the impairment test to changes in the key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for each of the CG Us to w hich goodwill is allocated.
For all CGUs the sensitivity analysis shows that if pre-tax discount rates are raised by 1%: short term growth rates are lowered by 10% in years one to three: or long term growth rates are lowered by 1 % then no impairment would arise.
Each of these sensitivities are considered to be a reasonably possible change.
Bifold is the CGU which has a recoverable amount closest to its carrying value after applying the sensitivities above.
The sensitivity results for Bifold are summarised below.
"V, Short term Long term.... Discount rate growth rate growth rate ""' Base case 1% -10% -1% G ri Recoverable amount less carrying value headroom 24,073 12,461 1,801 15,082.. 0.... ""' 11."
The amortisation charge is recognised within administrative expenses in the income statement.
The impairment charge relates to the cost of ending development and sales of products for the containment area of nuclear power plants.

ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2018 117 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2018 24.
Pension schemes i Defined benefit pension schemes The Group operates two defined benefit pension arrangements - the Rotork Pension and Life Assurance Scheme UK Scheme and the Rotork Controls Inc. Pension Plan US Pension Plan.
On retirement, leaving service or death, the Schemes provide benefits based on final salary and length of service.
The UK Scheme is subject to the Statutory Funding Objective under the Pensions Act 2004.
A valuation of the Scheme is carried out at least once every three years to determine whether the Statutory Funding Objective is met.
As part of the process the Company must agree with the trustees of the Scheme the contributions to be paid to address any shortfall against the Statutory Funding Objective and contributions to pay for future accrual of benefits.
The UK Scheme is managed by a Trustee, with directors appointed in part by the Group and part from elections by members of the Scheme.
The Trustee has responsibility for obtaining valuations of the fund, administering benefit payments and investing the Scheme's assets.
The Trustee delegates some of these functions to its professional advisers where appropriate.
The UK Scheme which was closed to new entrants in 2003 was closed to future accrual from 1 April 2018.
The US Pension Plan is subject to the ERISA funding requirements.
A valuation of the Plan is carried out annually to ensure the Funding Objective is met under ERISA by contributing at least the Minimum Required Contribution.
As part of this process the Company must contribute to the Plan enough contributions to ensure at least the Minimum Contribution is deposited in the Trust to pay for the accrual of benefits.
The US Pension Plan which was closed to new entrants in 2009 was closed to future accrual on 31 December 2018.
The two defined benefit pension arrangements expose the Group to a number of risks: Investment risk - the Schemes hold investments in asset classes, such as equities, which have volatile market values and while these assets are expected to provide real returns over the long-term the short term volatility can cause additional funding to be required if a deficit emerges.
The Schemes have a relatively balanced investment in equities, debt instruments and property.
Due to the long-term nature of the plan liabilities, the Trustees of the pension funds consider it appropriate that a reasonable portion of the plan assets should be invested in equities and in property to leverage the return generated by the funds.
Interest rate risk - the Schemes' liabilities are assessed using market yields on high quality corporate bonds to discount the liabilities.
As the Schemes hold assets such as equities the value of the assets and liabilities may not move in the same way.
A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the Schemes' liabilities but this will be partially offset by an increase in the return of the Schemes' debt investments.
Inflation risk - a significant proportion of the benefits under the Schemes are linked to inflation.
Although the Schemes' assets are expected to provide a good hedge against inflation over the long term, movements over the short term could lead to deficits emerging.
Mortality risk - in the event that members live longer than assumed a deficit will emerge in the Schemes.
Upon the closure to future accrual of the UK and US defined benefit pension scheme the members were invited to join the defined contribution scheme.
The total gain of 8,575,000 from the two curtailments is disclosed in other income in the income statement.
The High Court judgement in the case of Lloyds Banking Group on 26 October 2018 clarified that pension benefits under the UK Scheme need to be equalised for the effects of unequal GMPs.
The impact of GMP equalisation is 920,000 and is shown as a past service cost in the income statement.

Pension schemes continued The split of the Schemes' quoted assets were as follows: 2018 2017 Fair value Fair value Equities 30,581 34,537 Targeted return 45,243 48,463 17,326 Property 16,527 Corporate bonds 41,740 42,977 LOI absolute return bonds 29,892 32,169 Cash 635 US deposit administration contract 14,946 13,537 Total 179,728 188,844 Actual return on the Schemes' assets 6,485 9,931 The UK Scheme has a strategic asset allocation which was agreed after considering its liability profile, funding position, expected return of the various asset classes and the need for diversification.
The level of interest rate and inflation hedging is being gradually increased by the use of LDI funds.
Currently the Scheme has hedged around 24% of its liabilities, as measured on a low risk gilts basis, and this will automatically increase by 3% each year.
A series of triggers have also been agreed so that, if when gilt yields rise, the pace of hedging will be accelerated.
The demographic assumptions are the same as used for the 2017 year end, except for mortality.
The mortality assumptions used for the UK Scheme are the S2NXA year of birth tables 2017: S2NXA with future changes in mortality based on the CMl 2017 projections 2017: CMl 2016 projections with a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25% per annum 2017: 1.25%.
By way of example the respective mortality tables indicate the following life expectancy: 2018 2017 Life expectancy at age 65 Life expectancy at age 65 Current age Male Female Male Female 65 22.1 24.1 22.2 24.2 45 23.5 25.6 23.6 25.7 Sensitivity analysis on the Schemes' liabilities Adjustments to assumptions Approximate effect on liabilities Discount rate Plus 0.5% p. a.
13,700 Life expectancy Decrease mortality rates by a factor of 10% 7,200 6,400 Increase mortality rates by a factor of 10% The above sensitivities are approximate and only show the likely effect of an assumption being adjusted whilst all other assumptions remain the same.
For the life expectancy sensitivity we have increased decreased the mortality rates by a factor of 10%.
Broadly speaking this decreases increases the assumed life expectancy by slightly less than one year.
The sensitivity analysis shown above was determined using the same method as per the calculation of liabilities for the balance sheet disclosures, but using assumptions adjusted as detailed above.
Effect of the Schemes on the Group's future cash flows The Group is required to agree a Schedule of Contributions with the Trustees of the UK Scheme following a valuation which must be carried out at least once every three years.
Following the valuation of the UK Scheme as at 31 March 2016, the Group is continuing to pay deficit contributions of 5,500,000 a year.
The next valuation w ill be carried out on 31 March 2019.
The Group estimates that cash contributions to the Group's defined benefit pension schemes during 2019 will be nil for regular payments 2018: 1,687,000 and 5,500,000 of additional payments in relation to past service 2018: 5,500,000.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 22 years.
ii Other pension plans The Group makes a contribution to a number of defined contribution plans around the world to provide benefits for employees upon retirement.
Total expense relating to these plans in the year was 6,455,000 2017: 5,105,000.
Share-based payments The Group awards shares under the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, the Save As You Earn scheme Sharesave plan, the Overseas profit linked share plan OPLSS and the share incentive plan S IP.
The equity settled share-based payment expense included in the income statement for each of the plans can be analysed as follows: 2018 2017 Sharesave plan a 637 566 Long Term Incentive Plan b 1,385 789 OPLSS SIP profit linked share scheme c 2,652 2,035 Total expense recognised as employee costs note 6 4,674 3,390 Volatility assumptions for equity-based payments The expected volatility of all equity compensation benefits is based on the historic volatility calculated based on the weighted average remaining life of each benefit, adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility due to publicly available information.
a Sharesave plan UK employees are invited to join the Sharesave plan when an offer is made each year.
All the offers to date were made at a 20% discount to market price at the time.
There are no performance criteria for the Sharesave plan.
Employees are given the option of joining either the 3 year or the 5 year scheme.

Vesting of awards under the ROIC condition will be determined by calculating the growth in ROIC, on a cumulative basis, over the performance period.
For the 2017 and 2018 awards, the awards will vest by comparing the average ROIC over the performance period against a set of pre-defined targets.

Financial instruments Financial risk and treasury policies The Treasury department maintains liquidity, identifies and manages foreign exchange risk, manages relations with the Group's bankers and provides a treasury service to the Group's businesses.
Treasury dealings such as investments, borrowings and foreign exchange are conducted only to support underlying business transactions.
The Group has clearly defined policies for the management of credit, foreign exchange and interest rate risk.
The Group Treasury department is not a profit centre and, therefore, does not undertake speculative foreign exchange dealings for which there is no underlying exposure.
Exposures resulting from sales and purchases in foreign currency are matched where possible and the net exposure may be hedged.
a Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group's receivables from customers and cash on deposit with financial institutions.
Management has a credit policy in place and exposure to credit risk is both monitored on an ongoing basis and reduced through the use of credit insurance covering over 80% of trade receivables at any time.
Credit evaluations are carried out on all customers requiring credit above a certain threshold, with varying approval levels set around this depending on the value of the sale.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Goods are sold subject to retention of title clauses, so that in the event of non-payment the Group may have a secured claim.
The Group maintains an allowance for impairment in respect of non-insured receivables where recoverability is considered doubtful.
The Group Treasury Committee meets regularly and reviews the credit risk associated with institutions that hold a material cash balance.
As we ll as credit ratings, counterparties and instruments are assessed for credit default swap pricing and liquidity of funds.
"Cl Exposure to credit risk ""' z The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure."
"The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting z m date was: "" Carrying amount 2018 2017 Trade receivables 145,509 145,529 Other receivables 23,513 19,344 Cash and cash equivalents 104,489 63,192 273,511 228,065 Other receivables consist principally of tax receivables and prepayments."
These items do not give rise to significant credit risk.
"The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date by currency was: Carrying amount 2018 2017 Sterling 18,964 19,646 US dollar 36,617 39,841 Euro 54,236 54,476 Other 35,692 31,566 145,509 145,529 Provisions against trade receivables The aging of trade receivables and the associated provision for impairment at the reporting date was: Gross Provision Provision Gross 2018 2018 2017 2017 0 "" ::::...

The Group's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation.
ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2018 123 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2018 26.
Financial instruments continued The Group is highly cash generative, and uses monthly cash flow forecasts to monitor cash requirements and to optimise its return on investments.
Typically the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on hand to meet foreseeable operational expenses: it also maintains a 7m overdraft facility 2017: 7m on which interest wou ld be payable at base rate plus 1.5% and a Sm overdraft facility 2017: Sm on which interest would be payable at base rate plus 1.1%.
During 2018 the Group repaid a further 15,000,000 of its 90,000,000 term facility and renegotiated to extend the remaining facility to August 2020.
The Group has a 60,000,000 Revolving Credit Facility which matures in August 2020.
At year end 60,000,000 of the committed facilities were drawn, resulting in 60,000,000 being available.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including interest payments and excluding the impact of netting agreements: Analysis of contractual cash flow maturities Carrying Contractual Less than More than 2-5 years 31 December 2018 amount cash flows 12 months 1-2 years 5 years Bank loans and overdrafts 60,840 61,245 30,284 30,049 912 Finance lease liabilities 2 2 2 Trade and other payables 87,482 87,482 87,482 Contingent consideration 299 299 299 Foreign exchange contracts 1,407 1,407 1,407 Non-redeemable preference shares 40 40 40 150,070 150,475 119,474 30,049 912 40 Analysis of contractual cash flow maturities Carrying Contractual Less than More than 31 December 2017 amount cash flows 12 months 1-2 years 2-5 years 5 years Bank loans and overdrafts 75,762 76,064 30,151 44,948 965 Finance lease liabilities 5 5 3 2 Trade and other payables 91,348 91,348 91,348 Contingent consideration 397 397 397 Forward exchange contracts 1,766 1,766 1,521 245 Non-redeemable preference shares 40 40 40 169,318 169,620 123,420 45,195 965 40 Where a counterparty experiences credit stress then the foreign exchange contracts may be settled on a net basis but standard practice is to settle on a gross basis and the undiscounted gross outflow in respect of these contracts is 182,855,000 20 17: 190,786,000 and the gross inflow is 180,480,000 2017 189,127,000. c Market risk Market risk arises from changes in market prices, such as currency rates and interest rates, and may affect the Group's results.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk within suitable parameters.
i Currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than the business unit's functional currency.
The currencies primarily giving rise to this risk are the US dollar and related currencies and the euro.
The Group hedges up to 75% of forecast US dollar or euro foreign currency exposures using forward exchange contracts.
In respect of other non-sterling monetary assets and liabilities the exposures may also be hedged up to 75% where this is deemed appropriate.
As part of the Group's cash management some of the overseas subsidiaries have loan and deposit balances where their intra-group counterparty is in the UK.
The balances are typically in local currency for the subsidiary so the UK holds a foreign currency current asset or liability which is usually hedged through the use of foreign exchange swaps.
At the balance sheet date only the 'forward' part of the swap remains and this is designated as a cash flow hedge to match the currency exposure of the intercompany loan asset.
The Group classifies its forward exchange contracts that hedge both the forecast sale and purchase transactions and the intercompany loan and deposit balances as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The net fair value of foreign exchange contracts used as hedges at 31 December 2018 was a 2,375,000 liability 2017: 1,702,000 asset comprising an asset of nil 2017: 3,468,000 and a liability of 2,374,000 2017: 1,766,000.
Forward exchange contracts in place at 31 December 2018 mature in 2019.
Changes in the fair value of foreign exchange contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, and for which no hedge accounting is applied, are recognised in the income statement.
Sensitivity ana lysis It is estimated that, with all other variables held equal in particular other exchange rates, a general change of one cent in the value of euro against sterling would have had an impact on the Group's operating profit for the year ended 31 December 2018 of 400,000 2017: 300,000 and a change of one cent in the value of US dollar against sterling would have had an impact on the Group's operating profit for the year ended 31 December 2018 of 600,000 2017: 400,000.
The method of estimation, which has been applied consistently, involves assessing the transaction impact of US dollar and euro cash flows and the translation impact of US dollar and euro profits.
124 ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2018 The following significant exchange rates applied during the year: Average rate Closi ng rate 2018 2017 2018 2017 US dollar 1.34 1.29 1.28 1.35 Euro 1.13 1.14 1.11 1.13 ii Interest rate risk The Group does not undertake any hedging activity in this area.
All cash deposits are made at prevailing interest rates and the majority is available with same day notice, though deposits are sometimes made with a maturity of no more than three months.
The main element of interest rate risk concerns sterling, US dollar, euro and renminbi deposits, all of which are on a floating rate basis.
The interest rate profile of the Group's financial liabilities at 31 December was as follows: 2018 2017 Fixed rate financial liabilities 42 1,061 Floating rate financial liabilities 60,839 74,746 60,881 75,807 The fixed and floating rate financial liabilities comprise finance leases, preference shares and bank loans.
The floating rate obligations bear interest at rates determined by reference to the relevant LIBOR or equivalent rate.
The weighted average interest rate of the fixed rate financial liabilities is 9.47% 2017: 2.38%.
"The weighted average period for which Cl interest rates on the fixed rate financial liabilities are fixed is 0.5 years. ""'"
"z The maturity profile of the Group's financial liabilities at 31 December was as follows: z m "" 2018 2017 30,010 In one year or less 29,928 In more than one year but not more than two years 30,030 44,928 In more than two years but not more than five years 209 911 In more than five years 632 40 Total 60,881 75,807 d Capital risk management The primary objective of the Group's capital management is to ensure it maintains sufficient capital in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value."
The Group has an asset-light business model and uses cash generated from operations to either invest organically or by acquisition.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic and market conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders or issue new shares.
