No changes have been made to asset lives during the year.
As in previous years, fully depreciated assets have been retained in the Companys fixed asset register.
In order to provide greater understanding of the Companys annual depreciation charge, assets which have become fully depreciated in the year have been removed from both cost and accumulated depreciation.
Included in the table above is a cost of 839m 2017: 839m relating to non-depreciable land and 15m 2017: 2m of assets under construction.
The cost of assets held under finance leases at 4 February 2018 is 334m 2017: 354m, with related accumulated depreciation of 162m 2017: 158m.
The cost of financing asset developments prior to them being ready for use has been included in the cost of the project.
The cumulative amount of interest capitalised in the total cost above amounts to 73m 2017: 73m.
Interest is capitalised at the effective interest rate of 5% 2017: 5% incurred on borrowings.
The Company considers that each store is a separate cash generating unit CGU and therefore considers every store for an indication of impairment annually.
The Company calculates each stores recoverable amount and compares this amount to its book value.
The recoverable amount is determined as the higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal.
If the recoverable amount is less than the book value, an impairment charge is recognised.
The methodology applied by the Company is the same methodology as applied by the Group, see note 3.3 for further details.
Having applied the methodology and assumptions, the Company has recognised a net impairment reversal of 17m 62m impairment reversal of set by 45m impairment charge during the year in respect of property, plant and equipment 2017: net impairment charge of 29m: 88m impairment charge offset by 59m impairment reversal.
This movement reflects fluctuations from store level trading performance and local market conditions.
At 4 February 2018, the key assumption to which the value in use calculation is most sensitive to is the discount rate.
Specific sensitivity analysis with regard to this assumption shows that an increase of 1% in the discount rate would result in an additional impairment charge of 23m.
