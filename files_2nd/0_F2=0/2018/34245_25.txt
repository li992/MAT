Items 4 to 11: Re-appointment of directors The UK Corporate Governance Code the Code requires FTSE 350 companies to put all directors forward for re-appointment by shareholders on an annual basis.
The purpose of this requirement is to increase accountability to shareholders.
Accordingly, all the directors of the Company will retire at the Annual General Meeting and offer themselves for re-appointment.
The Companys Articles of Association require that any director appointed by the Board shall hold office only until the first annual general meeting for which notice is first given after their appointment.
Accordingly, Katherine Innes Ker will offer herself for re-appointment on this basis.
The Code contains provisions dealing with the re-appointment of non-executive directors.
In relation to the re-appointment of Chris Browne, Ralph Findlay, Nigel Keen, Mike Stansfield and Katherine Innes Ker as non-executive directors, the Chairman has confirmed following the formal performance evaluation conducted during early 2019 that they continue to be effective in and demonstrate commitment to their roles, including commitment of time for Board and committee meetings.
In reaching its recommendations, the Board also considered the individual skills and experience brought by each director, their relevance to the Company and its particular circumstances, and the overall skill set of the Board.
Chris Browne provides a strong commercial and operational background in a consumer facing industry.
Ralph Findlay adds strong commercial, financial and general management expertise, again from a consumer facing industry.
Nigel Keen brings an in-depth construction and property background and experience of managing property strategy and portfolios, once again from a consumer facing industry.
Mike Stansfield brings considerable housing developer experience.
Katherine Innes Ker was newly appointed in October 2018 and brings a broad range of business knowledge and skills to the Board, Ian Tyler, non-executive Chairman, has considerable construction industry knowledge and international business experience.
The Board believes that the directors combined experience and contribution is a great asset to the Board and the Company and continues to be important to the Companys long-term sustainable success.
The Board, therefore, strongly supports and recommends the re-appointment of the directors to shareholders.
Biographical details of all the directors can be found on pages 62 to 63 of the 2018 Annual Report and Accounts.
Items 12 and 13: appointment of auditors and auditors remuneration The auditors of a company must be appointed at each general meeting at which accounts are presented.
Resolution 12 proposes the re-appointment of the Companys existing auditors,  LLP, as the Companys auditors, for a further year.
 LLP were first appointed at the 2015 AGM.
Resolution 13 gives authority to the directors to determine the auditors remuneration.
Item 14: Authority to allot shares The authority given to your directors at last years Annual General Meeting under section 551 of the 2006 Act to allot shares expires on the date of the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Accordingly, this resolution seeks to grant a new authority under section 551 to authorise the directors to allot shares in the Company or grant rights to subscribe for, or convert any security into, shares in the Company up to an aggregate nominal amount of 22,444,280 and also gives the Board authority to allot, in addition to these shares, further of the Companys shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of 44,888,560 in connection with a pre-emptive offer to existing members by way of a rights issue with exclusions to deal with fractional entitlements to shares and overseas shareholders to whom the rights issue cannot be made due to legal and practical problems.
This is in accordance with the latest institutional guidelines published by the Investment Association.
This authority will expire at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting or, if earlier, 15 months from the date of the resolution.
The directors intend to seek renewal of this authority at subsequent Annual General Meetings.
The amount of 22,444,280 represents less than 33.3% of the Companys total ordinary share capital in issue as at 22 March 2019 being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this Notice.
The amount of 44,888,560 represents less than 66.6% of the Companys total ordinary share capital in issue as at 22 March 2019 being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this Notice.
The Company did not hold any shares in treasury as at 22 March 2019.
| 158 Supplementary information Explanatory notes to the notice of meeting continued The Board has no present intention to exercise this authority other than in connection with employee share schemes.
It wishes to obtain the necessary authority from shareholders so that allotments can be made should it be desirable and should suitable market conditions arise at short notice and without the need to convene a general meeting of the Company which would be both costly and time consuming.
If the Board takes advantage of the additional authority to issue shares or grant rights to subscribe for, or convert any security into, shares in the Company representing more than 33.3% of the Companys total ordinary share capital in issue or for a rights issue where the monetary proceeds exceed 33.3% of the Companys pre-issue market capitalisation, all members of the Board wishing to remain in office will stand for re-election at the next Annual General Meeting following the decision to make the relevant share issue.
Item 15: Notice of general meetings This resolution is required as a result of the implementation in 2009 of the Shareholder Rights Directive.
The regulation implementing this Directive increased the notice period for general meetings under the 2006 Act to 21 days.
The Company will be able to continue to call general meetings other than an Annual General Meeting on 14 clear days notice as long as shareholders have approved the calling of meetings on 14 days notice.
The approval will be effective until the Companys next Annual General Meeting, where it is intended that a similar resolution will be proposed.
The Company will also need to meet the requirements for electronic voting under the Directive before it can call a general meeting on 14 days notice.
It is confirmed that the ability to call a general meeting on 14 clear days notice would only be utilised in limited circumstances and where the shorter notice period will be to the advantage of shareholders as a whole.
Item 16: Disapplication of pre-emption rights Resolution 16 seeks authority for the directors to issue equity securities as defined in the 2006 Act in the Company for cash as if the pre-emption provisions of section 561 of the 2006 Act did not apply.
Other than in connection with a rights issue or any other pre-emptive offers concerning equity securities, the authority contained in this resolution will be limited to the issue of equity securities for cash up to an aggregate nominal value of 3,370,012 which represents approximately 5% of the Companys total ordinary share capital in issue as at 22 March 2019 being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this Notice.
In accordance with the Pre-emption Groups Statement of Principles, the directors confirm their intention that no more than 7.5% of the issued share capital excluding treasury shares will be issued for cash on a non pre-emptive basis during any rolling threeyear period.
This resolution seeks a disapplication of the pre-emption rights on a rights issue so as to allow the directors to make exclusions or such other arrangements as may be appropriate to resolve legal or practical problems which, for example, might arise with overseas members.
There are presently no plans to allot ordinary shares wholly for cash other than in connection with employee share schemes.
Shares allotted under an employee share scheme are not subject to statutory pre-emption rights.
The authority sought by resolution 16 will last until the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting or, if earlier, 15 months from the date of the resolution.
The directors intend to seek renewal of this power at subsequent Annual General Meetings.
Item 17: Authority to purchase own shares This resolution renews the authority granted at last years Annual General Meeting to enable the Company to make market purchases of up to 13,480,048 of its own shares, representing approximately 10% of the Companys total ordinary share capital in issue as at 22 March 2019 being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this Notice.
Before exercising such authority, the directors would ensure that the Company was complying with the current relevant UK Listing Authority rules and Investment Association guidelines.
No purchases would be made unless the directors believe that the effect would be to increase the earnings per share of the remaining shareholders and the directors consider the purchases to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its shareholders as a whole.
Any shares so purchased would be cancelled.
The directors have no present intention of exercising the authority to purchase the Companys ordinary shares but would like to have the flexibility of considering such purchases in the future.
Any purchases of ordinary shares would be by means of market purchases through the London Stock Exchange.
The maximum price exclusive of expenses which may be paid for each ordinary share shall be the higher of: a an amount equal to 105% of the average of the middle market quotations for an ordinary share as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List for the five business days immediately preceding the day on which the Company agrees to buy the ordinary shares: and b an amount equal to the higher of the price of the last independent trade of an ordinary share and the highest current independent bid for an ordinary share as derived from the London Stock Exchange Trading System SETS.
The minimum price exclusive of expenses would be 50 pence, being the nominal value of each ordinary share.
The authority will only be valid until the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting in 2020.
As at 22 March 2019 there were options over 481,831 ordinary shares in the capital of the Company which represent 0.36% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital at that date.
If the authority to purchase the Companys ordinary shares was exercised in full, these options would represent 0.40% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital.
The directors consider that all the resolutions to be put to the meeting promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its shareholders as a whole.
Your Board will be voting in favour of them and unanimously recommends that you do so as well.
