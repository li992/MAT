Investments in subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates Accounting policy Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are all entities, including structured entities, which the Group controls.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
The assessment of power is based on the Groups practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the entity unilaterally for the Groups own benefit and is subject to reassessment if and when one or more of the elements of control change.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which the Group effectively obtains control.
They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases, and where any interest in the subsidiary remains, this is remeasured to its fair value and the change in carrying amount is recognised in the income statement.
Associates and joint arrangements Joint arrangements are where two or more parties either have rights to the assets, and obligations of the joint arrangement joint operations, or have rights to the net assets of the joint arrangement joint venture.
The Group evaluates the contractual terms of joint arrangements to determine whether a joint arrangement is a joint operation or a joint venture.
As at 31 December 2017, the Group did not have any contractual interest in joint operations.
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant inuence.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost.
The Groups investment in associates and joint ventures includes goodwill identied on acquisition net of any accumulated impairment loss.
The Groups share of its associates and joint ventures post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the income statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in reserves.
The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment.
When the Groups share of losses in an associate or a joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.
Unrealised gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the associates and joint ventures.
At each balance sheet date the Group assesses whether there is any objective evidence of impairment in the investment in associates and joint ventures.
Such evidence includes a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the Groups investment in an associate or joint venture below its cost, among other factors.
Signi cant accounting estimates and judgements The Group applies judgement in determining if it has control, joint control or significant inuence over subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates respectively.
These judgements are based upon identifying the relevant activities of counterparties, being those activities that signicantly affect the entities returns, and further making a decision of if the Group has control over those entities, joint control, or has significant inuence being the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions but not control them.
These judgements are at times determined by equity holdings, and the voting rights associated with those holdings.
However, further considerations including but not limited to board seats, advisory committee members and specialist knowledge of some decision-makers are also taken into account.
Impairment testing of investments in associates and joint arrangements is based on estimates including forecasting the expected cash ows from the investments and the discount rate used in calculation of the present values of those cash ows.
The estimation of future cash ows and the level to which they are discounted is inherently uncertain and requires significant judgement.

Investments in subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates continued Accounting policy continued Business combinations The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, together with the fair value of any contingent consideration payable.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identiable net assets and contingent liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill see Note 17 for details on goodwill recognised by the Group.
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets and contingent liabilities of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Where the fair values of the identiable net assets and contingent liabilities acquired have been determined provisionally, or where contingent or deferred consideration is payable, adjustments arising from their subsequent nalisation are not reected in the income statement if i they arise within 12 months of the acquisition date or relate to acquisitions completed before 1 January 2014 and ii the adjustments arise from better information about conditions existing at the acquisition date measurement period adjustments.
Such adjustments are applied as at the date of acquisition and, if applicable, prior year amounts are restated.
All changes that are not measurement period adjustments are reported in income other than changes in contingent consideration not classied as financial instruments, which are accounted for in accordance with the appropriate accounting policy, and changes in contingent consideration classied as equity, which is not remeasured.
Changes in ownership interest in a subsidiary, which do not result in a loss of control, are treated as transactions between equity holders and are reported in equity.
Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the previously held equity interest is remeasured at the acquisition date fair value with the resulting gain or loss recognised in the income statement.
In the Companys financial statements, investment in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are held at cost less impairment and dividends from pre-acquisition profits received prior to 1 January 2009, if any.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated in the Group accounts.

The Group does not have any material non-controlling interests in any of its subsidiaries except the 25.7 per cent non-controlling interests amounting to $108 million 31 December 2017: $105 million in Standard Chartered Bank Kenya Limited.
This contributes 3.2 per cent of the Groups Operating profit and 0.4 per cent of the Groups assets.
While the Groups subsidiaries are subject to local statutory capital and liquidity requirements in relation to foreign exchange remittance, these restrictions arise in the normal course of business and do not signicantly restrict the Groups ability to access or use assets and settle liabilities of the Group.
The Group does not have significant restrictions on its ability to access or use its assets and settle its liabilities other than those resulting from the regulatory framework within which the banking subsidiaries operate.
These frameworks require banking operations to keep certain levels of regulatory capital, liquid assets, exposure limits and comply with other required ratios.
These restrictions are summarised below: 321 Notes to the FINANCIAL STATEMENTS financial statements 32.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates continued Regulatory and liquidity requirements The Groups subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital, leverage ratios, liquidity and exposure ratios which therefore restrict the ability of these subsidiaries to distribute cash or other assets to the parent company.
The subsidiaries are also required to maintain balances with central banks and other regulatory authorities in the countries in which they operate.
At 31 December 2018, the total cash and balances with central banks was $58 billion 31 December 2017: $59 billion of which $8 billion 31 December 2017: $10 billion is restricted.
Statutory requirements The Groups subsidiaries are subject to statutory requirements not to make distributions of capital and unrealised profits to the parent company, generally to maintain solvency.
These requirements restrict the ability of subsidiaries to remit dividends to the Group.
Certain subsidiaries are also subject to local exchange control regulations which provide for restrictions on exporting capital from the country other than through normal dividends.
Contractual requirements The encumbered assets in the balance sheet of the Groups subsidiaries are not available for transfer around the Group.
Encumbered assets are disclosed in Risk review and Capital review page 187.

This resulted in an incremental impairment of $140 million, representing the difference between the carrying amount of the liquidation portfolio on a hold to collect basis and the amount expected to be realised upon liquidation.
This is consistent with the Groups restructuring actions.
Accordingly, in 2016 the Group has recorded its $62 million share of this incremental impairment as restructuring and this was normalised from the underlying results of the Group.
In 2017 a gain of $59 million has been recognised in restructuring as a result of recoveries on these non-performing loans.
Current assets primarily represent cash and short-term receivable balances.
Non-current assets are primarily loans to customers.
Current liabilities are primarily customer deposits based on contractual maturities, while non-current liabilities are longer-term payables such as subordinated debt.
