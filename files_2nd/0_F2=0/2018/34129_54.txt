NON-CURRENT ASSETS continued a Investment property, investment property under construction and interests in leasehold property continued During the year the Group sold land at its Richmond store to an adjoining landowner for 650,000.
The valuation of the store was not impacted by this disposal, hence the full proceeds have been recorded as profit on part disposal of investment property.
This has been eliminated from the Groups adjusted profit for the year.
Additions to the interests in leasehold properties in the prior year relate to the lease at Twickenham 2, acquired from Lock and Leave in April 2016.
The income from self storage accommodation earned by the Group from its investment property is disclosed in note 3.
Direct operating expenses, which are all applied to generating rental income, arising on the investment property in the year are disclosed in the Portfolio Summary on page 20.
Included within additions is 0.4 million of capitalised interest 2017: 0.1 million, calculated at the Groups average borrowing cost for the year of 2.9%.
55 of the Groups investment properties are pledged as security for loans, with a total external value of 1,076.2 million.

The carrying value remains unchanged from the prior year as there is considered to be no impairment in the value of the asset.
The asset has an indefinite life and is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment.
This was shown as goodwill in the prior year, but this has been restated to treat it as an intangible asset in both years, as this more fairly reflects the nature of the asset.
