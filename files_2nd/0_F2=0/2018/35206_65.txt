Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures continued The sensitivities above represent the Directors view of reasonably possible changes in each risk variable, not worst case scenarios or stress tests.
The outputs from the sensitivity analysis are estimates of the impact of the effect of changes in market risks assuming that the specified changes occur at the year end and are applied to the risk exposures at that date.
Accordingly, they show the impact on profitability and the balance sheet from such movements.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimates due to commercial actions taken to mitigate any potential losses from such rate movements, to the interaction of more than one sensitivity occurring and to further developments in global financial markets.
As such, this table should not be considered as a projection of likely future gains and losses.
