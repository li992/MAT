Retirement benefit obligations Apart from contributions to legally required social security state schemes, the Group operates a number of pension schemes around the world covering many of its employees.
The principal pension scheme in the Group is the Rentokil Initial 2015 Pension Scheme RIPS in the UK which has a defined contribution section, and a number of defined benefit sections which are now closed to new entrants and future accrual of benefits.
On 4 December 2018 the Group signed an agreement with Pension Insurance Corporation plc PIC to take over the payment of the liabilities in the scheme via a buy-in, which is anticipated to convert to a full buy-out before the end of 2020.
This is discussed in further detail below.
A number of much smaller defined benefit and defined contribution schemes operate elsewhere which are also funded through payments to trustee-administered funds or insurance companies.
Defined benefit schemes are reappraised annually by independent actuaries based upon actuarial assumptions.
Significant judgement is required in determining these actuarial assumptions.
Defined benefit pension plans A defined benefit pension plan is a plan that estimates the amount of future pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
The asset or liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date.
The Group determines the net interest on the net defined benefit asset for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined benefit asset.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that have a credit rating of at least AA, are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
The Group will recognise a pension surplus as an asset where there is an unconditional right to a refund or where the Group has a right to reduce future pension contributions, taking into account the adverse effect of any minimum funding requirements.
Current and past service costs, to the extent they have vested, and curtailments are recognised as charges or credits against operating profit in the income statement.
In 2018 the settlement of the Rentokil Initial 2015 Pension Scheme was recognised separately on the income statement due to materiality.
Interest costs on the net defined benefit are recognised in finance costs.
Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments, return on plan assets and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Defined contribution pension plans A defined contribution plan is apension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into aseparate entity.
The Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
GMP equalisation On 26 October 2018 a High Court case in the UK confirmed that Guaranteed Minimum Pensions GMP need to be equalised between male and female pension scheme members.
The Court did not specify the method to use to equalise GMP but did set out a number of possible approaches.
Prior to this date the Group had excluded GMP equalisation from the valuation of scheme liabilities, but in the year an allowance has been made resulting in a past service cost of 12.0m.
Rentokil Initial 2015 Pension Scheme RIPS The assets of the RIPS are legally separated from the Group.
The Trustee of the pension fund is Rentokil Initial Pension Trustee Limited.
The board comprises five company-nominated directors and three member-nominated directors.
The Trustee is required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants and is responsible for setting certain policies e. g. investment, contribution and indexation policies of the RIPS.
On 4 December 2018 the Trustee entered into a binding agreement with Pension Insurance Corporation PIC to insure the liabilities of the scheme, known as a buy-in.
PIC has 162,800 insured pension scheme members, 27.9bn of financial investments and an Insurer Financial Strength rating of A with Fitch.
The Group is committed to convert to a full buy-out within two years and therefore, while the legal form of the transaction at the balance sheet date is a buy-in, it has been accounted for as a full buy-out with the loss on settlement of 305.5m and past service cost of 36.1m being recognised in the income statement.
The Group achieved buy-in within the value of the assets held by the scheme and was not required to make any further contributions.
While there are still some adjustments expected to the final price it is anticipated that there will be surplus assets when the scheme finally winds up in 2020.
These assets are recognised as a retirement benefit asset.
This asset has been recognised at managements estimate of the value of surplus that will be returned from the scheme to the Group.
Rentokil Initial plc Annual Report 2018 126 Notes to the Financial Statements The defined benefit schemes are reappraised semi-annually by independent actuaries based upon actuarial assumptions in accordance with IAS 19R requirements including schemes which are insured under a buy-in contract.
The assumptions used for the RIPS scheme are shown below: 31 December 31 December 2018 2017 Weighted average % Discount rate 2.8% 2.5% Future salary increases n a n a Future pension increases 3.4% 3.4% RPI inflation 3.5% 3.5% CPI inflation 2.4% 2.4% The defined benefit obligation includes benefits for current employees, former employees and current pensioners.
Approximately 39% of the liabilities are attributable to current and former employees and 61% to current pensioners.
There have been no significant changes to the membership of the scheme over the year.
The scheme duration is an indicator of the weighted-average time until benefit payments are made.
For the RIPS as a whole, the duration is around 16 years.
The assets in the scheme consist of cash held in liquidity funds, and the fair value of the insurance policy.
The fair value of the insurance policy asset is deemed to be equal to the present value of the related obligations that it covers at the balance sheet date.
Risks As discussed above the trustee purchased an insurance policy that covers all retirement benefit obligations within the scheme, thereby removing exposure to the significant risks within the scheme including changes in bond yields, inflation and longevity.
The schemes insurer PIC is now responsible for ensuring that there are sufficient assets to meet all future pension obligations, and is subject to EU solvency regulations.
There is no volatility associated with the insurance policy asset as under IAS 19 its value is deemed to match the scheme liabilities.
Asset volatility is limited only to the assets remaining in the scheme following this transaction which are expected to be returned to the Company on wind-up of the scheme.
The surplus recognised 20.5m is managements estimate of the asset that will return to the Company on wind-up subject to tax at 35%.
It is subject to certain estimates and assumptions made at the balance sheet date which could lead to the overall surplus available being up to 40m.
Mortality assumptions The mortality assumptions are based on the recent actual mortality experience of scheme members, and allow for expected future improvements in mortality rates.
The mortality tables used are: 98% of the SAPS S2 All base tables for male pensioners: 107% of the SAPS S2 All base tables for female pensioners: 108% of the SAPS S2 All base tables for male and female non-pensioners: and 96% of the SAPS S2 All base tables for male and female dependent pensioners.
Future improvements are made in line with CMI 2017 Core Projections with a long-term rate of future improvement of 1.75% p. a.
Sensitivity of significant assumptions The purchase of an insurance policy to cover all future benefits means that the sensitivity of the balance sheet and income statement to key assumptions is removed.
