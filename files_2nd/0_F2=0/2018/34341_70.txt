Assumptions used in these models were as follows: 2018 2017 LTIP LTIP Average share price volatility FMCG comparator group % 18 19 Average correlation FMCG comparator group % 31 31 Fair values determined from the Black-Scholes and Monte-Carlo models use assumptions revised at the end of each reporting period for cashsettled share-based payment arrangements.
The expected British American Tobacco p. l. c. share price volatility was determined taking account of the return index the share price index plus the dividend reinvested over a five-year period.
The FMCG share price volatility and correlation was also determined over the same periods.
The average expected term to exercise used in the models has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of nontransferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural conditions, forfeiture and historical experience.
The risk-free rate has been determined from market yield curves for government gilts with outstanding terms equal to the average expected term to exercise for each relevant grant.
The expected dividend yield was determined by calculating the yield from the last two declared dividends divided by the grant share price.
In addition to these valuation assumptions, LTIP awards contain earnings per share performance conditions.
As these are non-market performance conditions they are not included in the determination of fair value of share options at the grant date, however they are used to estimate the number of awards expected to vest.
This pay-out calculation is based on expectations published in analysts forecasts.
