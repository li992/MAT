GENERAL INFORMATION, BASIS OF PREPARATION AND CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS General information The financial statements of IG Group Holdings plc and its subsidiaries together the Group for the year ended 31 May 2018 wereauthorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 24 July 2018 and the statement of financial position was signed on the Boards behalf by Paul Mainwaring.
IG Group Holdings plc is a public limited company, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange andincorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.
The Companys registered address is 25 Dowgate Hill, London, UnitedKingdom, EC4R 2YA.
The Groups financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU and with the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets and liabilities including derivatives instruments at fair value through profit or loss.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed below.
Basis of preparation The accounting policies which have been applied in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 May 2018 are disclosed in note 29.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements requires the Group to make estimates and judgements that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the year-end, and the amounts reported for revenue and expenses during the year.
The nature of estimates means that actual outcomes could differ from those estimates.
In the Directors opinion, the accounting estimates or judgements that have the most significant impact on the presentation or measurement of items recorded in the financial statements are the following: a Impairment assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets estimate An impairment assessment was performed as at 31 May 2018 to determine whether the carrying amounts for the DailyFX intangible asset, and for goodwill balances, are appropriate.
This involved estimating pre-tax future cash flows attributable to the asset and discounting them back to their present values using a discount rate to determine the value in use of the asset.
The determination of pre-tax cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies upon assumptions.
The key assumptions relevant to the Groups impairment assessment of the DailyFX intangible asset include the number of first trades generated by the asset, the attrition rate of customers and the net trading income generated by each active client.
The outcome of the Groups DailyFX impairment assessment is insensitive to reasonable changes in each of these assumptions.
More information on the key assumptions relevant to, and a sensitivity analysis of, the Groups impairment assessment of goodwill is disclosed in note 13. b Tax provisions estimate The calculation of the Groups income tax provision involves a degree of estimation and judgement as the tax treatment of some transactions and the application of tax legislation cannot be finally determined until formal resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority.
The Group recognises tax liabilities for open tax matters based on judgements of the overall likelihood of success and estimates of the additional taxes that will be due.
Tax payable may ultimately be materially more or less than the amount already accounted for.
More information on the Groups sensitivity to tax judgements is disclosed in note 8. c DailyFX asset acquisition judgement Determining whether the purchase of DailyFX during the year ended 31 May 2017 was a business combination or an asset purchase was a matter of critical accounting judgement which remains relevant for the year ended 31 May 2018 given the size of the asset on the Groups statement of financial position at 25.3 million.
The purchase included the website together with its historical content and lead list.
In order to enable lead capturing and to re-establish the DailyFX Plus facility, which captures details on new subscribers, the infrastructure necessary for operating and integrating the website needed to be rebuilt.
A number of the DailyFX staff were offered and subsequently accepted roles with IG.
Therefore, whilst inputs had been acquired, the processes that IG would ultimately benefit from had to be recreated and rebuilt or separately acquired.
Accordingly, the Group accounted for the transaction as an asset purchase as not all the requirements for a business combination were met.
d Accounting for cryptocurrencies judgement The Group recognised 27.2 million of cryptocurrency assets on its statement of financial position as at 31 May 2018 31 May 2017: 11.9 million.
During the year the Group changed the accounting policy it applies to these assets, which is considered to be a critical accounting judgement, as the change reclassified these assets from trade receivables into other assets which is considered to be a more appropriate presentation.
There was no impact on the income statement as a result of this change in judgement.
More information on the Groups cryptocurrency assets is disclosed in note 15.

NET TRADING REVENUE Net trading revenue represents trading revenue after deducting introducing partner commissions.
Net trading revenue by operating segment The Executive Directors are the Groups chief operating decision-makers CODM.
Management has determined the operating segments based on the information reviewed by the Executive Directors for the purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance.
The Executive Directors continue to consider the business performance principally from a product perspective, split into OTC leveraged derivatives, exchange traded derivatives and share dealing and investments.
Segment net trading revenue is stated after deducting introducing partner commissions, as this is consistent with the management information received by the Executive Directors.
The income from OTC leveraged derivatives is split by geographical location as the United Kingdom UK, Europe, Middle East and Africa EMEA and Asia Pacific APAC.
EMEA comprises the Groups activities in Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates and South Africa.
APAC comprises the Groups activities in Australia, Singapore and Japan.
Net trading revenue from OTC leveraged derivatives is reported geographically, reflecting the location of the office that manages the underlying client relationship and represents an allocation of the net trading revenue that the Group generates from clients trading activity.
The income from exchange traded derivatives derives wholly from the United States.
The income from share dealing derives from the UK, EMEA and APAC, whilst the income from investments derives wholly from the UK.
In the year ended 31 May 2018, 3.0 million of share dealing and investments income was generated in the UK FY17: 2.0 million, 0.8 million was generated in APAC FY17: 0.2 million and 0.2 million was generated in EMEA FY17: 0.2 million.
The Group manages market risk and a number of other activities on a Group-wide portfolio basis, and accordingly a large proportion of costs are incurred centrally.
These central costs are not allocated to individual segments for decision-making purposes for the CODM and accordingly these costs have not been allocated to segments.
The segmental analysis shown below therefore does not include a measure of profitability, nor a segmented statement of financial position, as this would not reflect the information which is received by the CODM on a regular basis.

TAXATION CONTINUED Reconciliation of the total tax charge The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK changed from 20% to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017.
Accordingly, the rate of corporation tax for the year ended 31 May 2018 is 19.0% year ended 31 May 2017: 19.83%.
Taxation outside the UK is calculated atthe rates prevailing in the relevant jurisdictions.
The tax expense in the income statement for the year can be reconciled as set outbelow: Year ended Year ended 31 May 2018 31 May 2017 m m Profit before taxation 280.8 213.7 Profit multiplied by the UK standard rate of corporation tax of 19.0% FY17: 19.83% 53.4 42.4 Higher taxes on overseas earnings 0.4 0.5 Adjustment in respect of prior years 0.4 2.0 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 1.8 0.4 Patent box deduction 3.5 Temporary differences not yet recognised in respect of share schemes 1.0 Impact of change in tax rates on deferred tax balances 1.9 0.4 Recognition of deferred tax assets 1.8 Deferred tax not recognised on current year tax losses 0.4 Total tax expense reported in the income statement 54.4 44.5 The effective tax rate for the year is 19.4% FY17: 20.8%.
Deferred income tax assets The deferred income tax assets included in the statement of financial position are as follows: 31 May 2018 31 May 2017 m m Tax losses available for offset against future tax 2.8 4.4 Temporary differences arising on share-based payments 2.2 1.6 Temporary differences arising on fixed assets 1.6 0.8 Other temporary differences 2.5 2.3 9.1 9.1 The Finance Act 2015 passed into legislation in July 2015 and changed the main rate of UK corporation tax from 20% to 19% effective from 1 April 2017.
The Finance Act 2016 passed into legislation in September 2016 and further reduced the main rate of UK corporation tax to 17% effective from 1 April 2020.
The impact of these changes on deferred tax has been assessed and deferred tax assets and liabilities have been assessed at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or liabilitysettled.
The Group has an unrecognised deferred tax asset of 4.5 million in respect of prior years losses of the US businesses, the recoverability of which is dependent on sufficient taxable profits in those entities.
The deferred tax asset reflects the extent to which it is considered probable that future taxable profits can be offset against the tax losses carried forward.
The Group also has an unrecognised deferred tax asset of 11.6 million in respect of UK capital losses, the recoverability of which is dependent on sufficient capital gains arising in the future.
Share-based payment awards have been charged to the income statement but are not allowable as a tax deduction until the awardsvest.
The excess of tax relief in future years over the amount charged to the income statement is recognised as a credit directly to equity.
The movement in the deferred income tax assets included in the statement of financial position is as follows: 31 May 2018 31 May 2017 m m At the beginning of the year 9.1 7.2 Income statement charge credit 0.4 1.2 Tax credit directly to equity 0.4 0.4 Impact of movement in foreign exchange rates 0.3 At the end of the year 9.1 9.1 IG GROUP HOLDINGS PLC | ANNUAL REPORT 2018 109 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 8.
TAXATION CONTINUED Factors affecting the tax charge in future years Factors that may affect the Groups future tax charge include the geographic location of the Groups earnings, the tax rates in those locations, changes in tax legislation, the use of brought-forward tax losses and the resolution of open tax issues.
The calculation of the Groups total tax charge involves a degree of estimation and judgement with respect to the recognition of deferred tax assets, which are dependent on the Groups estimation of future profitable income and of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority.
There are two historic UK tax schemes that are still under discussion with HMRC.
The Group has made tax payments relating to these schemes and, if resolved in the Groups favour, may result in a material cash inflow to the Group and a reduction in the future tax charge as a result of a prior year adjustment.
The Group determines its tax liability by taking into account its tax risks and it makes provision for those matters where it is probable that a tax liability will arise.
EARNINGS PER ORDINARY SHARE Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding shares held as own shares in Employee Benefit Trusts.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated using the same profit figure as that used in basic earnings per share and by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares assuming the vesting of all outstanding share scheme awards and that vesting is satisfied by the issue of new ordinary shares.
The following reflects the income and share data used in the earnings per share computation: Year ended Year ended 31 May 2018 31 May 2017 m m Earnings attributable to owners of the parent 226.4 169.2 Weighted average number of shares: Basic 366,780,442 366,441,640 Dilutive effect of share-based payments 3,162,903 2,442,663 Diluted 369,943,345 368,884,303 Year ended Year ended 31 May 2018 31 May 2017 Basic earnings per share 61.7p 46.2p Diluted earnings per share 61.2p 45.9p 10.

GOODWILL Goodwill has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to cash-generating units CGUs as follows.

Australia from the acquisition of the non-controlling interest in IG Australia Pty Limited in the year ended 31 May 2006.
US from the acquisition of Nadex formerly HedgeStreet Exchange on 6 December 2007.
South Africa from the acquisition of Ideal CFDs on 1 September 2010.
Impairment testing The Groups goodwill balance has been subject to an impairment review and there has not been any impairment recognised for the years ended 31 May 2018 or 31 May 2017.
For the purposes of the Groups impairment testing of goodwill, the carrying amount of each CGU is compared to the recoverable amount of the relevant CGU and any deficits are considered impairments.
The carrying amount of a CGU includes only those assets that can be attributed directly, or allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis.
The estimated recoverable amount for each CGU is based upon the value in use VIU of each CGU.
For all CGUs, the estimate of the recoverable amount was higher than the carrying value.
Key assumptions used in the calculation of the recoverable amount of the CGUs The key assumptions for the VIU calculations are those regarding expected future cash flows, regional growth rates and discount rates.
Future cash flow projections are based on the most recent financial budgets considered by the Board which are used to project cash flows for each CGU over the next four years.
After this period, a terminal growth rate of 2.5% has been applied to the cash flow to derive a terminal value for the CGUs.
The resultant cash flows have been discounted at a pre-tax discount rate of 10% for the UK and South Africa, 12% for Australia and 18% for the US.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions These calculations have been subject to a sensitivity analysis reflecting reasonable changes in key assumptions.
All VIU calculations are insensitive to reasonable changes in the discount rate.
In addition, the recoverable amount of all CGUs remained higher than the carrying value, with terminal growth rates reduced to zero.
At this level the recoverable amount for all CGUs exceeded the carrying values by a significant amount.
TRADE RECEIVABLES 31 May 2018 31 May 2017 m m Amounts due from brokers 332.3 301.1 Own funds in client money 50.0 43.4 Amounts due from clients 0.5 1.1 382.8 345.6 Amounts due from brokers represent balances with brokers where the combination of cash held on account and the valuation of financial derivative open positions results in an amount due to the Group.
In addition to the 332.3 million 31 May 2017: 301.1 million the Group had 90.5 million 31 May 2017: 63.2 million of UK government securities held as collateral at brokers which are classified as financial investments in the Groups statement of financial position.
Own funds in client money represents the Groups own cash held in segregated client funds, in accordance with the UKs Financial Conduct Authority FCA CASS rules and similar rules of other regulators in whose jurisdiction the Group operates and includes 11.9 million 31 May 2017: 12.7 million to be transferred to the Group on the following business day.
Amounts due from clients arise when a clients total funds deposited with the Group are insufficient to cover any trading losses incurred or when a client utilises a trading credit limit and is stated net of an allowance for impairment.

EMPLOYEE SHARE PLANS The Company operates three employee share plans: a Sustained Performance Plan SPP, a Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP and a Share Incentive Plan SIP, all of which are equity-settled.
The expense recognised in the income statement in respect of share-based payments including associated social security costs was 8.8 million FY17: 7.5 million.
Sustained Performance Plan SPP The SPP award was introduced in the year ended 31 May 2014 for the Groups Executive Directors and other selected senior employees.
The Remuneration Committee approves any awards made under the plan and is responsible for setting the policy for the operation of the plan, agreeing performance targets and participation.
The legal grant of awards under the SPP occurs post the relevant performance period.
At the outset of the financial year the Remuneration Committee approves, and communicates to the participants, performance conditions and a pre-defined maximum monetary award in terms of multiple of salary.
The grant of awards, in the form of equity settled par value options, is based upon three performance conditions: Total Shareholder Return TSR, diluted earnings per share EPS and operational non-financial performance NFP.
Awards subsequently vest in tranches over the long term, so the participant retains an ongoing substantial stake in the share price performance of the Company.
The following table shows the number of options in the SPP plan for the year ended 31 May 2018: Dividend Awarded Lapsed Exercised equivalent Performance Expected At the start during during during awarded At the end period Share price full vesting of the year the year the year the year during the year of the year Award date year ended at award date Number Number Number Number Number Number 4 Aug 2014 31 May 2014 609.90p 1 Aug 2025 223,691 68,484 6,619 161,826 6 Aug 2015 31 May 2015 742.55p 1 Aug 2025 234,564 72,150 6,973 169,387 2 Aug 2016 31 May 2016 868.65p 1 Aug 2025 637,375 212,555 20,538 445,358 1 Aug 2017 31 May 2017 626.50p 1 Aug 2025 417,029 40,820 63,803 15,091 327,497 Total 1,095,630 417,029 40,820 416,992 49,221 1,104,068 Of the above SPP exercised during the year ended 31 May 2018, the average share price at exercise was 626.5p.
The exercise price of all SPP awards is 0.005p.
Further information on the Companys SPP awards is given in the Directors Remuneration Report.
The awards for the year ended 31 May 2018 SPP will be granted post year-end following the approval of actual performance against targets set by the Remuneration Committee.
A ten-day share price averaging period, that commences after the Companys closed period, is utilised to convert notional salary awarded into a number of options refer to the Directors Remuneration Report for performance conditions.
The table below details the number of option awards expected to be awarded for the year ended 31 May 2018: Awards expected for the year ending Closing share price at Expected full 31 May 2018 Expected award date 31 May 2018 vesting date Number 7 Aug 2018 864.50p 1 Aug 2025 919,006 Total 919,006 Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP award has been made available to senior management who are not invited to participate in the SPP.
LTIP awards allow the award of nominal cost options, which vest when specific performance targets are achieved, conditional upon continued employment at the vesting date.
For each award a minimum performance target has to be achieved before any shares vest and the awards vest fully once the maximum performance target is achieved.
The awarded LTIP options vest after three years with a predefined number of shares allocated pro-rata based on achieving the specific performance targets.

Share Incentive Plan SIP SIP awards are made available to all UK, Australian and USA employees.
The Executive Directors have responsibility for setting the terms of the award which are then approved by the Remuneration Committee.
The UK and Australian awards invite all employees to subscribe for or purchase up to 1,800 A$3,000 FY17: 1,800 A$3,000 of partnership shares, with the Company typically matching on a two-for-one FY17: two-for-one basis.
All matching shares vest after three years as long as the employee remains employed with the Group for the term of the award.
Shares awarded under the scheme are held in trust in accordance with local tax authority rules.
Employees are entitled to receive dividends on the partnership and matching shares held in trust for as long as they remain employees.
The USA award invites employees to invest a maximum of 5% of their salary bi-annually to the award.
The award runs for a six month period and, at the end of this period, the employees are invited to purchase shares in IG Group Holdings plc at a discount of 15% to the scheme price, being the lower of the opening share price and the closing share price for the period.
Fair value of equity-settled awards The fair value of the equity-settled share-based payments to employees is determined at the date at which a shared understanding of the terms and conditions of the arrangement is reached between the Company and the participants.
The weighted average fair value of the equity-settled awards granted or deemed as such under IFRS2 during the year was 8.1 million FY17: 9.8 million.
For SIP awards, the fair value is determined to be the share price at the grant date, without making an adjustment for expected dividends, as awardees are entitled to dividends over the vesting period.
IG GROUP HOLDINGS PLC | ANNUAL REPORT 2018 117 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 22.
EMPLOYEE SHARE PLANS CONTINUED For LTIP awards the fair value at grant date is determined by taking the share price at grant date.
An adjustment for the present value of future dividends is not required as dividend equivalents are awarded on options granted under the LTIP.
For potential SPP awards made under the Total Shareholder Return TSR criteria, fair value is calculated using an option pricing model prepared by advisers.
For the SPP awards made under the earnings per share and non-financial operational measures the fair value is determined by taking the share price at deemed grant date less the present value of future dividends for the duration of the performance period.
Dividend equivalents accrue under the SPP on awarded but unvested options post the performance period.
Post vesting minimum holding period dividend equivalents cease to accrue on unexercised options.

The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the period end bid price.
Level 2 assets are valued using techniques where a price is derived based significantly on observable market data, for example, where an active market for an identical financial instrument to the product used by the Group to hedge its market risk does not exist.
This category includes the Groups open non-exchange-traded hedging positions, this comprised of shares, foreign currency and foreign currency options.
The fair values used in the valuation of these products are sometimes brokered values and may occur after the close of a market but before the measurement date.
The effects of discounting are generally insignificant for these Level 2 financial instruments.
Level 3 assets are valued using techniques that incorporate information other than observable market data that is significant to the overall valuation.
There have been no changes in the valuation techniques for any of the Groups financial instruments held at fair value in the year FY17: none.
There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements, and no transfers into or out of Level 3 fair value measurements for years ended 31 May 2018 and 31 May 2017.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT Financial risks arising from financial instruments are analysed into market, credit, concentration and liquidity risks.
Details of how risks are managed are discussed in the risk management section on page 34.
Market risk Market risk for accounting standards disclosure requirements is analysed into these categories: Market price risk non-trading interest rate and price risk Foreign currency risk Where applicable, the quantified maximum exposures for the Group from each risk category are disclosed below: Non-trading interest rate risk The Group has interest rate risk relating to financial instruments on its statement of financial position not held at fair value through profit or loss.
These exposures are not hedged.
The interest rate risk profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities at each year-end was as follows: Within 1 year Between 2 and 5 years Total 31 May 2018 31 May 2017 31 May 2018 31 May 2017 31 May 2018 31 May 2017 m m m m m m Fixed rate: Financial investments 62.0 92.0 111.6 52.4 173.6 144.4 Floating rate: Cash and cash equivalents 289.7 230.9 289.7 230.9 Trade receivables due from brokers 332.3 301.1 332.3 301.1 Trade payables client funds held on balance sheet 126.2 117.1 126.2 117.1 557.8 506.9 111.6 52.4 669.4 559.3 There are no financial assets and liabilities which are held for a period over five years.
Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis non-traded interest fixed rate Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
The level of future fixed interest receivable would be similar to that received in the year and is considered immaterial to the Groups profit for the year.
Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis non-traded interest floating rate Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is re-priced at intervals of less than one year.
Trade receivables and payables include client and broker balances upon which interest is paid or received based upon market rates.
Interest rate sensitivity has been performed on floating rate financial instruments by considering a 0.5% interest rate increase decrease on the financial assets and liabilities held at the statement of financial position date.
The impact of such a movement on the Groups profit for the year is below.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Price risk The Group is exposed to investment securities price risk because financial investments held by the Group and classified on theGroups statement of financial position as available-for-sale are based on closing market prices published by the UK Debt Management Office.
The table below summarises the impact of increases decreases in the value of financial investments on the Groups post-tax gain or loss on equity.
The analysis is based on the assumption that the value of financial investments has increased decreased by 1% with all other variables held constant: Year ended Year ended 31 May 2018 31 May 2017 m m Impact on available-for-sale reserve equity - 1.4 - 1.4 The financial impact of such a movement in fair value is considered to be immaterial to the Groups available for sale reserve.
Foreign currency risk The Group faces foreign currency exposures on financial assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than its reporting currency.
This exposure is hedged in the normal course of business.
The table below illustrates the sensitivity of net trading revenue with regard to currency movements on financial assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than its functional currency which are not held at fair value through profit and loss as at the year-end.
Based on a 5% weakening in the following exchange rates, the effect on net trading revenue would be as follows: Year ended 31 May 2018 South African US dollar Euro Yen rand Swiss franc Other m m m m m m Impact: 12.2 3.3 1.0 0.7 1.5 4.2 Year ended 31 May 2017 South African US dollar Euro Yen rand Swiss franc Other m m m m m m Impact: 4.3 5.7 0.4 0.3 0.6 0.3 The table below illustrates the sensitivity of the Groups net assets with regard to currency movements on financial assets and liabilities included in the balance sheets of non-GBP functional currency entities which are denominated in the functional currency of that entity and which are not held at fair value through profit and loss at the year-end.
Based on a 5% weakening in the following exchange rates, the effect on the Groups net assets would be as follows: Year ended 31 May 2018 South African US dollar Euro Yen rand Swiss franc Other m m m m m m Impact: 3.6 0.2 0.3 0.7 1.1 0.9 Year ended 31 May 2017 South African US dollar Euro Yen rand Swiss franc Other m m m m m m Impact: 3.0 1.5 1.0 0.3 0.5 0.7 Since the impact of foreign exchange rate movements is hedged, the Group would experience an opposite foreign exchange gain for the losses above as a hedging gain, and vice versa.

IG GROUP HOLDINGS PLC | ANNUAL REPORT 2018 125 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 29.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the Financial Statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the Groups Annual Report for the year ended 31 May 2017, except for the change in accounting policy related to cryptocurrency assets explained below.
New accounting standards and interpretations standards and amendments adopted during the year There were no new standards, amendments or interpretations, applicable to the Group which are effective for the first time for FY18.
Standards not yet adopted: IFRS 9 Financial instruments IFRS 9 was endorsed by the EU during 2016 and is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
The Group does not intend to adopt the standard early.
Therefore, it will first be applicable to the Groups accounting period ending 31 May 2019.
Background IFRS 9 represents a significant change to the way in which financial instruments are accounted for.
It states that the classification and measurement of financial assets is dependent on the contractual cash flows of the asset and the business model within which the asset is held.
The new accounting standard will also impact embedded derivatives, hedge accounting and impairment models as well as including significant additional disclosure requirements.
Group impact As at 31 May 2018, the Group had financial assets of 846.1 million 31 May 2017: 720.9 million and financial liabilities of 126.7million 31 May 2017: 117.3 million.
IFRS 9 is not expected to materially impact the financial statements, however it will impact the Groups classifications of financial instruments and the relevant disclosures.
It is not expected that the Group will be materially impacted by any other elements of IFRS 9 such as embedded derivatives or hedge accounting as these are not used by the Group.
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers IFRS 15 was endorsed by the EU during 2016 and is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
Background This standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue from contracts with customers.
The standard is based around a five-step model which is applicable to any contract to determine when, and how much, revenue should be recognised.
Group impact IG Group has four revenue generation models: OTC Leveraged Derivatives, Exchange Traded Derivatives, Share Dealing and Investments.
It is not expected that IFRS 15 will have a material impact on the Financial Statements of the Group.
IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 was endorsed by the EU in November 2017 and is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
Therefore, it will first be applicable to the Groups accounting period ending 31 May 2020.
Background For lessors, the changes introduced by IFRS 16 are not significant, however there is a fundamental change in terms of the accounting by the lessee, including for subleases.
For lessees, the off balance sheet operating lease accounting treatment is no longer available, with the exception of short-term leases less than 12 months or low value leases.
126 IG GROUP HOLDINGS PLC | ANNUAL REPORT 2018 Company Overview Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Shareholder and Co. Info 29.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED In terms of the transition to IFRS 16, the Group can choose to apply one of two transition methods: The full retrospective transition method, whereby IFRS 16 is applied to all its contracts as if it had always been applied: or The modified retrospective approach which includes optional practical expedients.
It is expected that the Group will choose to adopt the modified retrospective approach in order to benefit from the practical expedients which are offered.
Group impact As at 31 May 2018, IG Group had future minimum rental obligations under lease contracts of 25.4 million 31 May 2017: 31.8million, all of which related to leased office spaces.
It is expected that a substantial portion, if not all, of these lease agreements willbe impacted by IFRS 16.
It is not yet practicable to provide a reliable estimate of the financial impact of the Groups consolidated results, as this will be dependent on the method of transition, as well as the leases which are held at transition date.
However, it is expected that there will be a material impact to the statements of financial position as the leases will be recognised as assets with a corresponding lease liability recognised for future lease payables.
It is not yet practicable to provide an estimate of the impact on the income statement.
Going concern The Directors have prepared the Financial Statements on a going concern basis, which requires the Directors to have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Further detail is contained in the Going Concern statement and Viability statement included in the Strategic report on page 39.
Basis of consolidation a Subsidiaries The Group Financial Statements consolidate the financial statements of IG Group Holdings plc and the entities it controls its subsidiaries made up to the reporting date, as listed on page 136.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.
Control comprises the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee so as to obtain benefit from its activities and is achieved through direct or indirect ownership of voting rights: currently exercisable or convertible potential voting rights: or by way of contractual agreement.
The results, cash flows and final positions of the subsidiaries used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company and are based on consistent accounting policies.
All inter-company balances and transactions between Group entities, including unrealised profits arising from them, are eliminated on consolidation.
On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
The cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of consideration paid including an estimate of any contingent ordeferred consideration.
Contingent or deferred consideration is re-measured at each statement of financial position date, with periodic changes to the estimated liability recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired discount on acquisition is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by other members of the Group.
b Non-controlling interests Where the Group and a non-controlling shareholder enter into a forward contract under which the Group is required to purchase the non-controlling interest for its fair value formulae based valuation, at the forward date, the Group continues to recognise thenon-controlling interest at the proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets, until expiry of the arrangement.
Theforward liability is also recognised for managements best estimate of the present value of the redemption amount with a corresponding entry in equity.
The accretion of the discount on the liability is recognised as a finance charge in the consolidated income statement.
The liability is re-measured to the final redemption amount with any periodic changes to the estimated liability recognised in the consolidated income statement.
On expiry of the forward, the liability is eliminated as paid and any difference in the value of the non-controlling interest to the exercise price deducted from equity.
IG GROUP HOLDINGS PLC | ANNUAL REPORT 2018 127 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 29.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED On an  basis non-controlling interests are measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest proportionate share of the acquirees net assets.
The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests as transactions with equity owners of the Group.
For purchases from non-controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of the non-controlling interest is recorded in equity.
Losses applicable to the non-controlling shareholder in a consolidated subsidiarys equity may exceed the non-controlling interest inthe subsidiarys equity.
The excess and any further losses applicable to the non-controlling shareholder are allocated against themajority interest, except to the extent that the non-controlling shareholder has a binding obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses.
If the subsidiary subsequently reports profits, such profits are allocated to the majority interests until the non-controlling shareholders share of losses previously absorbed by the majority has been recovered.
Noncontrolling interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that is not held by the Group and is presented within equity in the consolidated statement of financial position, separately from parent shareholders equity.
Segmental information The Groups segmental information is disclosed in a manner consistent with the basis of internal reports regarding components ofthe Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM, who for the Group are the Executive Directors, in order to assess the performance and to allocate resources to those operating segments.
The Group has therefore determined its operating segments based on the management information received on a regular basis by the Executive Directors of the IG Group Holdings plc Board as they are considered to be the CODM.
Operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds required by IFRS 8 are aggregated.
Foreign currencies The functional currency of each company in the Group is that of the country of incorporation as disclosed in note 30 as this isconsistent with the primary economic environment in which the entity operates.
The exception to this is entities located in theUnited Arab Emirates, IG Limited and IG Services Limited, which have a functional currency of USD.
The Groups most significant functional currency is Sterling.
Transactions in other currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency by applyingspot exchange rates prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each statement of financial position date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are revalued at the functional currency rate of exchange prevailing on thesame date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated atthe rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Gains and losses arising on revaluation are taken to the income statement.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated into Sterling at exchange rates prevailing on the statement of financial position date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and taken directly to a translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Revenue recognition Trading revenue includes revenue arising from each of the Groups four revenue generation models: OTC Leveraged Derivatives, Exchange Traded Derivatives, Share Dealing and Investments.
OTC Leveraged Derivatives Revenue from the OTC Leveraged Derivatives business represents: i fees paid by clients for spread, commission and funding charges in respect of the opening, holding and closing of financial spread bets, contracts for difference or options contracts, together with gains and losses for the Group arising on client trading activity: less ii fees paid by the Group in spread, commissions and funding charges arising in respect of hedging the risk associated with the client trading activity and the Groups currency exposures, together with gains and losses incurred by the Group arising on hedging activity.
Open client and hedging positions are fair valued on a daily basis and gains and losses arising on this valuation are recognised in revenue as well as gains and losses realised on positions that have closed.
The policies and methodologies associated with the determination of fair value are disclosed in note 25, Financial Instruments.
Exchange Traded Derivatives Revenue from Exchange Traded Derivatives represents fees paid by members of the Groups regulated futures and options exchange, with members of the exchange charged a fee per transaction undertaken, together with gains and losses incurred by the Group arising on its market-making activity on the exchange.
Share Dealing Revenue from Share Dealing represents commission earned from the share dealing service after deducting contracting and trade settlement fees payable to third party brokers.
Revenue is recognised in full on the date of trade being placed.
Investments Revenue from Investments represents management fees, which are earned as a percentage of assets under management.
These are recognised over the period in which the service is provided.
Revenue is recognised when it is probable that economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is shown net of sales taxes excluding any inter-company transactions.
Trading revenue is reported before introducing partner commission, along with betting duties and financial transaction taxes paid, which are disclosed as an expense in arriving at net operating income.
Net trading revenue, disclosed on the face of the consolidated income statement and in the notes to the Financial Statements, represents trading revenue after taking account of introducing partner commission as this is consistent with the management information received by the CODM.
Income earned from clients for market data such as chart fees and income received from charging clients for funding using debit and credit cards are netted within operating costs as the amounts involved are not considered material.
Finance income and costs on segregated client funds Interest income or expense on segregated client funds is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
The credit interest rate is the rate client money banks are willing to pay on client money.
Interest income and interest expense on segregated client funds are disclosed within operating profit, as this is consistent with the nature of the Groups operations.
Dividends Dividend distributions to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
IG GROUP HOLDINGS PLC | ANNUAL REPORT 2018 129 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 29.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Employee benefits a Pension obligations The Group operates defined contribution schemes.
Contributions are charged to the income statement as and when they become payable according to the rules of the schemes.
Once the contributions have been paid, the Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions.
b Bonus schemes The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses based on formulae that take into consideration specific financial and non-financial measures.
c Termination benefits Termination benefits are payable when an employment contract is terminated by the Group.
The Group recognises termination benefits when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits.
Operating leases Leases are classified as operating leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset.
Lease payments under an operating lease are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern of the users benefit.
Taxation The income tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and movements in deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates in the respective jurisdictions that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the statement of financial position date.
Deferred tax is accounted for on all temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of taxable profit.
In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available, against which deductible temporary differences may be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or negative goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each statement of financial position date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Cost comprises the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset and includes costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, based upon estimated useful lives.
Estimated residual value and useful lives are reviewed on an annual basis and residual values are based on prices prevailing at the statement of financial position date.
Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives as follows: Leasehold improvements over the lease term of up to 15 years Office equipment, fixtures and fittings over 5 years Computer and other equipment over 2, 3 or 5 years The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable, and are written down immediately to their recoverable amount.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset.
The gain or loss arising on derecognition of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is included in the income statement in the period of derecognition.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition fair value of consideration paid over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a business at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and is allocated to cash-generating units for purposes of impairment testing.
Cash-generating units represent the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method.
Any excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognised in the statement of financial position as goodwill and is not amortised.
To the extent that the net fair value of the acquired entitys identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is greater than the cost of the investment, a gain is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Any goodwill asset arising on the acquisition of equity accounted entities is included within the cost of those entities.
After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related cash-generating units monitored by management.
Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a cash-generating unit is taken into account when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the unit, or of an operation within it.
Intangible assets Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are carried initially at cost.
An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination, such as a trade name or customer relationship, is recognised at fair value outside goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.
Expenditure on internally developed intangible assets, excluding development costs, is taken to the income statement in the year in which it is incurred.
Development expenditure is recognised as an intangible asset only after all the following criteria are met: The projects technical feasibility and commercial viability can be demonstrated: The availability of adequate technical and financial resources and an intention to complete the project have been confirmed: and Probable future economic benefit has been established.
IG GROUP HOLDINGS PLC | ANNUAL REPORT 2018 131 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 29.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets with a finite life are amortised over their expected useful lives, as follows: Development costs straight-line basis over 3 years Software and licences straight-line basis over the contract term of up to 5 years Trade names straight-line basis over 2 years Client lists and customer relationships straight-line basis over 3 years Domain names and generic top-level domains straight-line basis over 10 years The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
In addition, the carrying value of capitalised development expenditure is reviewed before being brought into use.
Impairment of non-financial assets When impairment testing is required, the Directors review the carrying amounts of the Groups property, plant and equipment andintangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists or at least annually for goodwill, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less selling costs and value-in-use.
In assessing value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present values using a pre-tax discount rate.
This rate reflects current market assessments of the time value of money as well as the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised as an expense immediately.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount.
That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, although impairment losses relating to goodwill may not be reversed.
Financial instruments Classification, recognition and measurement The Group determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition in accordance with the categories outlined below and re-evaluates this designation at each financial year-end.
When financial instruments are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, being the transaction price plus, in the case of financial assets and financial liabilities not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
Financial instruments are disclosed in note 25 to the Financial Statements.
a Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets classified as held for trading, or designated as such on inception, are included in this category and relate to the financial derivative open positions included in trade receivables due from brokers as shown in the statement of financial position and related notes.
Financial instruments are classified as held for trading if they are expected to settle in the short term.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, in order to hedge derivative exposures arising from open client positions, which are also classified as held for trading.
All financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value, with gains or losses recognised in revenue in the consolidated income statement.
Determination of fair value Financial instruments arising from open client positions and the Groups hedging positions are stated at fair value and disclosed according to the valuation hierarchy required by IFRS 7.
Fair values are predominantly determined by reference to third-party market values bid prices for long positions and offer prices for short positions as detailed below: Level 1: Valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical financial instruments.
Level 2: Valued using techniques where a price is derived based significantly on observable market data.
For example, where an active market for an identical financial instrument to the product offered by the Group to its clients or used by the Group to hedge its market risk does not exist.
Level 3: Valued using techniques that incorporate information other than observable market data that is significant to the overall valuation.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED b Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, which are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period.
These are classified as non-current assets.
The Groups loans and receivables comprise trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
c Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any other categories.
They are included in non-current assets unless the investment matures or management intend to dispose of it within 12 months of the end of the reporting period.
The Groups available-for-sale assets comprise of financial investments.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities A financial asset or liability is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expired.
a Financial assets A financial asset is derecognised where the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired: the Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material delay to a third party under a pass-through arrangement: or the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and either a has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or b has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
Where the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset and has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the asset, the asset is recognised to the extent of the Groups continuing involvement in the asset.
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to repay.
b Financial liabilities A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss.
Offsetting financial instruments Assets or liabilities resulting from profit or losses on open positions are carried at fair value.
Amounts due from or to clients and brokers are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the Group or the counterparty.
Trade receivables represent balances with counterparties and clients where the combination of cash held on account and the valuation of financial derivative open positions result in an amount due to the Group.
A provision for impairment is established where there is objective evidence of non-collectability.
Reference is made to an aged profile of debt and the provision is subject to management review.
Trade payables represent balances with counterparties and clients where the combination of cash held on account and the valuation of financial derivative open positions results in an amount payable by the Group.
Other assets Other assets represent cryptocurrencies controlled by the Group.
The Group offers various  products that can be traded on its platform.
The Group would normally hedge its clients trading positions with its brokers.
However, as the Group is unable to hedge all of its exposure to cryptocurrencies with brokers it purchases and sells cryptocurrency assets to hedge the clients positions.
At present there is a lack of guidance available on how cryptocurrency assets should be accounted for and subsequently disclosed in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU.
The Group holds cryptocurrency assets for trading in the ordinary course of its business, effectively acting as a commodity broker-dealer in respect of the underlying cryptocurrency asset because the salient features of these assets are, in economic terms, consistent with certain commodities under IAS 2.3 b.
This represents a change in accounting policy from the prior period, where cryptocurrency assets were disclosed within trade receivables.
The assets will continue to be measured at fair value less costs to sell with changes in valuation being recorded in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Cryptocurrency assets are categorised as non-financial assets.
Cryptocurrency assets continue to be held at fair value through profit and loss therefore this accounting policy change is a change in classification only.
The result of the change is a reduction in trade receivables of 27.2 million 31 May 2017: 11.9 million with the balance disclosed as Other assets on a separate line in the consolidated statement of financial position.
There is no further impact to the Groups financial statements for the years ended 31 May 2018 and 31 May 2017.
IG GROUP HOLDINGS PLC | ANNUAL REPORT 2018 133 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 29.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Prepayments and other receivables Prepayments and other receivables are assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as fair value through profit or loss.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money is significant.
Gains and losses are recognised in income when the receivables are derecognised or impaired, and when economic benefit is consumed.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits which may be accessed without penalty.
Cash equivalents comprise short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
For the purposes of the consolidated cash flow statement, net cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
The Group holds money on behalf of clients in accordance with the client money rules of the UK Financial Conduct Authority FCA and other regulatory bodies.
Such monies are classified as either cash and cash equivalents or segregated client funds in accordance with the relevant regulatory requirements.
Segregated client funds comprise individual client funds held in segregated client money accounts.
Segregated client money accounts hold statutory trust status, restricting the Groups ability to control the monies and accordingly such amounts are not held on the Groups statement of financial position.
The amount of segregated client funds held at year-end was 1,386.9 million 31 May 2017: 1,215.3 million and the amount of segregated client assets was 945.0 million 31 May 2017: 499.8 million.
These amounts are held off-balance sheet.
The return received on managing segregated client funds is included within net operating income.

Financial investments Financial investments are held as available-for-sale and are non-derivative financial assets that are not classified as held for trading, designated at fair value through profit or loss, or loans and receivables.
Financial investments are recognised on a trade date basis.
They are initially recognised at fair value plus directly related transactions costs.
They are subsequently carried at fair value.
Fair value is the quoted market price of the specific investments held.
Financial investments available-for-sale are carried at fair value.
Unrealised gains or losses are reported in equity in the available-forsale reserve and in other comprehensive income, until such investments are sold, collected or otherwise disposed of, or until any such investment is determined to be impaired.
On disposal of an investment, the accumulated unrealised gain or loss included in equity is recycled to the income statement for the period and reported in other income.
Gains and losses on disposal are determined using the average cost method.
Interest on financial investments is included in finance income using the effective interest rate EIR method.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability.
When calculating the effective interest rate, the Group estimates cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument for example, prepayment, call and similar options but shall not consider future credit losses.
The calculation includes all fees and points paid or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate see IAS 18 Revenue, transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts.
At the year-end date the Group considers whether there is objective evidence that a financial investment is impaired.
In case of such evidence, it is considered impaired if its cost exceeds the recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount for a quoted financial investment is determined by reference to the market price.
A quoted financial investment is considered impaired if objective evidence indicates that the decline in market price has reached such a level that recovery of the cost value cannot be reasonably expected within the foreseeable future.
If a financial investment is determined to be impaired, the cumulative unrealised loss previously recognised in equity is recycled to profit for the period.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Other payables Non-trading financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method if the time value of money is significant.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events: it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation: and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at their issue proceeds less transaction costs incurred.
Subsequently, taking into consideration the term of the borrowings, an assessment is made whether to state at amortised cost, with any difference between net proceeds and the redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.
All borrowing costs are expensed as they are incurred.
Share capital a Classification of shares as debt or equity When shares are issued, any component that creates a financial liability of the Group is presented as a liability in the statement of financial position: measured initially at fair value net of transaction costs and thereafter at amortised cost until extinguished on conversion or redemption.
The corresponding dividends relating to the liability component are charged as interest expense in the income statement.
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded as the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
b Own shares held in Employee Benefit Trusts Shares held in Employee Benefit Trusts for the purposes of employee share schemes are classified as a deduction from shareholders equity and are recognised at cost.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from the sale and the original cost being taken to reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
c Share-based payments The Company operates three employee share plans: a Share Incentive Plan, a Sustained Performance Plan and a Long-Term Incentive Plan.
Previously, the Company operated a Value Sharing Plan, which was equity-settled.

For non-market based vesting conditions, at each statement of financial position date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and managements best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions determining the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous statement of financial position date is recognised in the income statement as part of operating expenses, with a corresponding credit to equity.
