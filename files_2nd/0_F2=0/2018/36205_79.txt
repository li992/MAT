These arrangements have been developed in accordance with local practices in the countries concerned.
Pension benefits can be provided by state schemes: by defined contribution schemes, whereby retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee: or by defined benefit schemes, whereby retirement benefits are based on employee pensionable remuneration and length of service.
Pension costs of defined benefit schemes for accounting purposes have been calculated using the projected unit method.
In certain countries pension benefits are provided on an unfunded basis, some administered by trustee companies.
Formal, independent, actuarial valuations of the Groups main plans are undertaken regularly, normally at least every three years.
Actuarial movements in the year are recognised through the statement of comprehensive income.
Discount rates are derived from AA rated corporate bond yields except in countries where there is no deep market in corporate bonds where government bond yields are used.
Discount rates are selected to reflect the term of the expected benefit payments.
Projected inflation rate and pension increases are long-term predictions based on the yield gap between long-term index-linked and fixed interest Gilts.
In the UK, mortality rates are determined by adjusting the SAPS S2 standard mortality tables to reflect recent scheme experience.
These rates are then projected to reflect improvements in life expectancy in line with the CMI 2017 projections with a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25% per year for both males and females.
In the US, mortality rates are calculated using the RP2014 white collar table adjusted to reflect recent experience.
These rates are projected using MP-2017 to allow for future improvements in life expectancy.

Pensions and other post-employment benefits continued The average life expectancy assumed now for an individual at the age of 60 and projected to apply in 2038 for an individual then at the age of 60 is as follows: UK US Male Female Male Female Years Years Years Years Current 27.5 29.1 27.0 28.7 Projected for 2038 29.0 30.6 28.7 30.3 The assets of funded schemes are generally held in separately administered trusts, either as specific assets or as a proportion of a general fund, or are insurance contracts.
Assets are invested in different classes in order to maintain a balance between risk and return.
Investments are diversified to limit the financial effect of the failure of any individual investment.
The physical asset allocation strategy for three of the four UK plans remains unchanged, with 55% in return-seeking assets and 45% in liability-matching assets.
The remaining plan has materially fide-risked given its relative higher maturity as well as improved funding position.
The asset allocation of the US plans is currently set at 55% return-seeking assets and 45% liability-matching assets.
The pension plans are exposed to risk that arises because the estimated market value of the plans assets might decline, the investment returns might reduce, or the estimated value of the plans liabilities might increase.
In line with the agreed mix of return-seeking assets to generate future returns and liability-matching assets to better match future pension obligations, the Group has defined an overall long-term investment strategy for the plans, with investments across a broad range of assets.
The main market risks within the asset and hedging portfolio are against credit risk, interest rates, long-term inflation, equities, property, currency and bank counterparty risk.
The plan liabilities are a series of future cash flows with relatively long duration.
On an IAS 19 basis, these cash flows are sensitive to changes in the expected long-term inflation rate and the discount rate AA corporate bond yield curve where an increase in long-term inflation corresponds with an increase in the liabilities, and an increase in the discount rate corresponds with a decrease in the liabilities.
The interest rate risk and credit rate risk in the US are partially hedged.
The targets are based on an accounting measure of the plan liabilities.
For the UK plans, there is an interest rate and inflation hedging strategy in place.
The targets are based on an economic measure of the plan liabilities.
Furthermore, the plans also currently hedge a portion of their equity exposure with a staggered maturity profile.
In the UK, the defined benefit pension schemes operated for the benefit of former Glaxo Wellcome employees and former SmithKline Beecham employees remain separate.
These schemes were closed to new entrants in 2001 and subsequent UK employees are entitled to join a defined contribution scheme.
In addition, the Group operates a number of post-retirement healthcare schemes, the principal one of which is in the US.
The analysis provided reflects the assumption changes which have the most material impact on the results of the Group.

As a result, the net surplus in the UK defined benefit pension schemes is recognised in full.

In 2018, GSK reached a revised agreement with the trustees of the UK pension schemes to make additional contributions to eliminate the pension deficits identified within the schemes at the 31 December 2017 actuarial funding valuation.
Based on these funding agreements, the additional contributions to eliminate the pension deficit are expected to be 75 million in 2019.
Further payments have been agreed for the years 2020 to 2022 and these are included within Note 41, Commitments on page 197.
This funding commitment supersedes the previous agreement made in 2016.
The contributions were based on a government bond yield curve approach to selecting the discount rate: the rate chosen included an allowance for expected investment returns which reflected the asset mix of the schemes.
Employer contributions for 2019, including special funding contributions, are estimated to be approximately 420 million in respect of defined benefit pension schemes and 100 million in respect of post-retirement benefits.
