Exceptional items continued Other property losses Property impairment relates to the situation in which, owing to poor trading performance, pubs are unlikely to generate sufficient cash in the future to justify their current book value.
In the year, an exceptional charge of 3,588,000 2017: 1,703,000 was incurred in respect of the impairment of assets as required under IAS 36.
The onerous lease provision relates to pubs for which future trading profits, or income from subleases, are not expected to cover the rent.
The provision takes several factors into account, including the expected future profitability of the pub and also the amount estimated as payable on surrender of the lease, where this is a likely outcome.
In the year, 1,442,000 2017: 380,000 was charged net in respect of onerous leases outside of the disposal programme.

This comprises a pre-exceptional current tax rate of 22.1% 2017: 23.9% and a pre-exceptional deferred tax credit of 0.1% 2017: 1.2% charge.

Assumptions are used about sales, costs and profit, using a pre-tax discount rate for future years of 7% 2017: 8%.
If the value, based on the higher of future anticipated cash flows and fair value, is lower than the book value, the difference is written off as property impairment.
As a result of this exercise, a net impairment loss of 3,588,000 2017: 7,607,000 was charged to property losses in the income statement, as described in note 4.
Management believes that a reasonable change in any of the key assumptions, for example the discount rate applied to each pub, could cause the carrying value of the pub to exceed its recoverable amount, but that the change would be immaterial.

The effective weighted average interest rate of the swap agreements used during the year is 1.68% 2017: 1.79%, fixed for a weighted average period of 3.7 years 2017: 3.7 years.
In addition, the company has entered into forward-starting interest-rate swaps as detailed in the table below.
The amounts drawn under this agreement can be varied, depending on the requirements of the business.
It is expected that the draw-down required by the company will not drop below 695m for the duration of the interest-rate swaps detailed above.
Capital risk management The companys capital structure comprises shareholders equity and loans.
The objective of capital management is to ensure that the company is able to continue as a going concern and provide shareholders with returns on their investment, while managing risk.
The company does not have a specific measure for managing capital structure: instead, the company plans its capital requirements and manages its loans, dividends and share buybacks accordingly.
The company measures loans using a ratio of net debt to EBITDA which was 3.39 times 2017: 3.39 times at the year end.
Section 2, on page 37, discusses the financial risks associated with financial instruments, including credit risk and liquidity risk.
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities IFRS 7 requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level, using the following fair value measurement hierarchy: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 Inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 which are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly level 2 Inputs for the asset or liability which are not based on observable market data level 3 The fair value of the interest-rate swaps is considered to be level 2.
All other financial assets and liabilities are measured in the balance sheet at amortised cost, and their valuation is also considered to be level 2.
