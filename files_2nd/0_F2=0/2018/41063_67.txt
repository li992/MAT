Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 18 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 53 weeks ended 4 February 2018 7 Financial risk and hedging continued 7.2 Financial risk management continued Interest rate risk The Group seeks to protect itself against adverse movements in interest rates by maintaining at least 60% of its total borrowings at fixed interest rates.
As at the balance sheet date, 100% 2017: 100% of the Groups borrowings are at fixed rate.
Whilst still applying the policy described above, from time-to-time the Group enters into fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps to achieve the appropriate proportion of fixed versus floating rate borrowings.
Credit risk As a retailer, the majority of the Groups revenue is received in cash at the point of sale and therefore credit risk is not considered significant to the Group.
Some credit risk does arise from cash and cash equivalents, deposits with banking groups and exposures from other sources of income such as commercial income, third party wholesale customers and tenants of investment properties.
The Group has established appropriate credit verification procedures in respect of financial institutions.
Limits on the total exposure to any counterparty or Group of connected counterparties are established within Treasury Policy, taking into account credit ratings.
Compliance with limits is regularly monitored.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
Commodity price risk The Group manages the risks associated with the purchase of electricity, gas and diesel consumed by its activities excluding fuel purchased for resale to customers by entering into hedging contracts to fix prices for expected consumption.
The Group has adopted a capital at risk model for hedging its fuel and power consumption.
The Treasury Committee reviews the Groups exposure to commodity prices and ensures it remains within policy limits.
A change of -10% in the market value of the commodity price at the balance sheet date would affect other comprehensive income by 13m 2017: 18m.
