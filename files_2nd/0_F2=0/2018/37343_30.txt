Financial statements Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2018 Section 1 General This section contains a description of the Groups significant accounting policies that relate to the financial statements as a whole.
A description of accounting policies specific to individual areas e. g. investment properties is included within the relevant note to the financial statements.
This section also includes a summary of new accounting standards, amendments and interpretations that have not yet been adopted, and their expected impact on the reported results of the Group.
Basis of preparation and consolidation Basis of preparation These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU IFRS, IFRIC Interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared in Pounds Sterling rounded to the nearest one million, which is the presentation currency of the Group Land Securities Group PLC and all its subsidiary undertakings, and under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of investment property, available for sale investments, derivative financial instruments and pension assets.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
Further details on the Groups significant accounting judgements and estimates are included in note 2.
Land Securities Group PLC the Company has not presented its own statement of comprehensive income and separate income statement, as permitted by Section 408 of Companies Act 2006.
The merger reserve arose on 6 September 2002 when the Company acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Land Securities PLC.
The merger reserve represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the nominal value of the shares issued by the Company to acquire Land Securities PLC.
The merger reserve does not represent a realised or distributable profit.
Other reserves includes the Capital redemption reserve, which represents the nominal value of cancelled shares, the Share-based payment reserve and Own shares held by theGroup.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2018 incorporate the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings.
Subsidiary undertakings are those entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists where an entity is exposed to variable returns and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
The results of subsidiaries and joint ventures acquired or disposed of during the year are included from the effective date of acquisition or to the effective date of disposal.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries and joint ventures which differ from Group accounting policies are adjusted on consolidation.
Where instruments in a subsidiary held by third parties are redeemable at the option of the holder, these interests are classified as a financial liability, called the redemption liability.
The liability is carried at fair value: the value is reassessed at the balance sheet date and movements are recognised in the income statement.
Joint arrangements are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
Interests in joint arrangements are accounted for as either a joint venture or a joint operation.
A joint arrangement is accounted for as a joint venture when the Group, along with the other parties that have joint control of the arrangement, have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.
Interests in joint ventures are equity accounted.
The equity method requires the Groups share of the joint ventures post-tax profit or loss for the year to be presented separately in the income statement and the Groups share of the joint ventures net assets to be presented separately in the balance sheet.
A joint arrangement is accounted for as a joint operation when the Group, along with the parties that have joint control of the arrangement, have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement.
Joint operations are accounted for by including the Groups share of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses on a line-by-line basis.
Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the joint venture concerned.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Landsec Annual Report 2018 127 Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2018 continued 2.
Significant accounting judgements and estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Groups accounting policies.
The areas where the Group considers the judgements to be most significant involve assumptions or estimates in respect of future events, where actual results may differ from these estimates.
Judgements Accounting for property acquisitions and disposals note 14.
Compliance with the Real Estate Investment Trust REIT taxation regime and the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities note 12.
Estimates Valuation of investment and trading properties note 14.
Changes in accounting policies and standards The accounting policies used in these financial statements are consistent with those applied in the last annual financial statements, as amended where relevant to reflect the adoption of new standards, amendments and interpretations which became effective in the year.
These amendments have not had an impact on the financial position or performance of the Group, but have resulted in additional disclosures.
Additional disclosures included in the financial statements as a result of adopting the Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows, relating to changes in liabilities resulting from financing activities are included in note 21.
Change in accounting policy As part of the Groups review of the impact of adopting IFRS 9 on the bond exchange fide-recognition adjustment see note 21 for further details on the bond exchange fide-recognition adjustment, the Group has taken the opportunity to revisit its accounting policy on determining whether an existing liability has been extinguished when carrying out a debt refinancing transaction.
Under the Groups current accounting policy, the result of the quantitative 10% test, as described in IAS 39, is the key criterion considered to determine whether an existing liability has been extinguished.
Under the revised policy, greater weight will be given to qualitative factors when assessing the appropriate treatment.
With effect from 1 April 2018, the Groups revised policy is: When debt refinancing exercises are carried out, existing liabilities will be treated as having been extinguished when the new liability is substantially different from the existing liability.
In making this assessment, the Group will consider the transaction as a whole, taking into account both qualitative and quantitative characteristics.
This change in accounting policy will result in the debt refinancing exercise completed on 3 November 2004 being treated as an extinguishment of the original debt, and therefore the bond exchange fide-recognition adjustment will no longer be held on the Groups balance sheet.
The revised accounting policy will provide more relevant and reliable information by more accurately reflecting the Groups current net asset position and the carrying value of its borrowings.
The Group currently reports this revised position using alternative performance measures which adjust net assets see note 5 and net debt see note 20.
Under the revised accounting policy, the Group will report fewer alternative performance measures.
The change in accounting policy will be applied retrospectively and comparatives restated accordingly.
Had this policy been applied at 31 March 2018, net assets would have been 106m lower at 10,386m, and the loss attributable to shareholders would have been 208m smaller at 44m.
Net assets per share would have been 14p lower at 1,404p, and the loss per share would have been 27.1p smaller at 5.8p.
The change in accounting policy will have no impact on adjusted net assets per share and adjusted earnings per share as these measures already exclude the bond exchange fide-recognition adjustment and the related amortisation charge respectively.
Amendments to IFRS A number of new standards and amendments to standards have been issued but are not yet effective for the Group.
The most significant of these, and their potential impact on the Groups accounting, are set out below: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments effective from 1 April 2018 the standard applies to classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, impairment provisioning and hedge accounting.
The Group has completed its impact assessment and does not expect IFRS 9 to have a material impact on its reported results.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers effective 1 April 2018 the standard will be applicable to service charge income, other property related income, trading property sales proceeds and proceeds from the sale of investment properties, but not rental income arising from the Groups leases with tenants.
Based on the transactions impacting the current financial year and future known transactions, the Group does not expect the adoption of IFRS 15 to have a material impact on the Groups reported results.
However, service charge income and expense will be presented on a net basis for those properties where the property management activities are performed by a third party, which the Group considers to be the principal delivering the service.
The impact on presentation for the year ended 31 March 2018 is expected to be a 21m reduction in both service charge income and expense.
IFRS 16 Leases effective from 1 April 2019 the Group continues to assess the impact of IFRS 16 Leases, effective from 1 April 2019.
Based on the initial impact assessment, the Group expects to report separately service charge income for leases where a single payment is received to cover both rent and service charge.
The total payment received is currently reported as rental income, but upon adoption of the standard, the service charge component will be separated and reported as service charge income in the notes to the financial statements.
There will be no net impact on profit attributable to shareholders.
128 Landsec Annual Report 2018 Financial statements Section 2 Performance This section focuses on the performance of the Group for the year, including segmental information, earnings per share and net assets per share, together with further details on specific components of the income statement and dividends paid.
Our property portfolio is a combination of properties that are wholly owned by the Group, part owned through joint arrangements and properties owned by the Group but where a third party holds a non-controlling interest.
Internally, management review the results of the Group on a basis that adjusts for these different forms of ownership to present a proportionate share.
The Combined Portfolio, with assets totalling 14.1bn, is an example of this approach, reflecting the economic interest we have in our properties regardless of our ownership structure.
We consider this presentation provides a better explanation to stakeholders of the activities and performance of the Group, as it aggregates the results of all of the Groups property interests which under IFRS are required to be presented across a number of line items in the statutory financial statements.
The same principle is applied to many of the other measures we discuss and, accordingly, a number of our financial measures include the results of our joint ventures and subsidiaries on a proportionate basis.
Measures that are described as being presented on a proportionate basis include the Groups share of joint ventures on a line-by-line basis, and are adjusted to exclude the non-owned elements of our subsidiaries.
This is in contrast to the Groups statutory financial statements, where the Groups interest in joint ventures is presented as one line on the income statement and balance sheet, and all subsidiaries are consolidated at 100% with any non-owned element being adjusted as a non-controlling interest or redemption liability, as appropriate.
Our joint operations are presented on a proportionate basis in all financial measures.
Our income statement has two key components: the income we generate from leasing our investment properties net of associated costs including interest expense, which we refer to as revenue profit, and items not directly related to the underlying rental business, principally valuation changes, profits or losses on the disposal of properties, refinancing activity and exceptional items, which we refer to as Capital and other items.
Our income statement is presented ina columnar format, split into those items that relate to revenue profit and Capital and other items.
The total column represents the Groups results presented in accordance with IFRS: the other columns provide additional information.
We believe revenue profit better represents the results of the Groups operational performance to stakeholders as it focuses on the rental income performance of the business and excludes Capital and other items which can vary significantly from year to year.
A full definition of revenue profit is given in the glossary.
The components of revenue profit are presented on a proportionate basis in note 4.
Segmental information The Groups operations are organised into two operating segments, being the London Portfolio and the Retail Portfolio.
The London Portfolio includes all our London offices and central London shops and the Retail Portfolio includes all our shopping centres and shops excluding central London shops, hotel and leisure assets and retail parks.
All of the Groups operations are in the UK.
Management has determined the Groups operating segments based on the information reviewed by Senior Management to make strategic decisions.
During the year, the chief operating decision maker was the Executive Committee ExecCom, which comprised the Executive Directors, the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, the Group HR Director and the Corporate Affairs and Sustainability Director.
The information presented to ExecCom includes reports from all functions of the business as well as strategy, financial planning, succession planning, organisational development and Group-wide policies.
The Groups primary measure of underlying profit before tax is revenue profit.
However, segment profit is the lowest level to which the profit arising from the ongoing operations of the Group is analysed between the two segments.
The Group manages its financing structure, with the exception of joint ventures, on a pooled basis and, as such, debt facilities and finance expenses other than those relating to joint ventures are not specific to a particular segment.
Unallocated income and expenses Group services are items incurred centrally which are neither directly attributable nor can be reasonably allocated to individual segments.
All items in the segmental information note are presented on a proportionate basis.
A reconciliation from the Group income statement to the information presented in the segmental information note is included in table 70.

Previously included within Exceptional items.
The cost of redeeming medium term notes, and the associated amortisation of the bond exchange fide-recognition adjustment have been reclassified to Net finance expense within Capital and other items in the current year as a result of the increased frequency of these types of transactions.
The comparative disclosures have been restated accordingly.
There is no impact on EPRA, Adjusted or IFRS earnings per share as a result of this change.
130 Landsec Annual Report 2018 Financial statements 5.
Performance measures Three of the Groups key financial performance measures are adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted diluted net assets per share and total business return.
In the tables below we present earnings per share and net assets per share calculated in accordance with IFRS, together with our own adjusted measures and certain measures required by EPRA.
We also present the calculation of total business return.
Adjusted earnings, which is a tax adjusted measure of revenue profit, is the basis for the calculation of adjusted earnings per share.
We believe adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share better represent the results of the Groups operational performance to stakeholders as they focus on the rental income performance of the business and exclude Capital and other items which can vary significantly from year to year.
Adjusted net assets excludes the fair value of interest-rate swaps used for hedging purposes and the bond exchange fide-recognition adjustment.
We believe this better reflects the underlying net assets attributable to shareholders as it more accurately reflects the future cash flows associated with our debt instruments.
Total business return is calculated as the cash dividends paid in the year plus the change in adjusted diluted net assets per share, divided by the opening adjusted diluted net assets per share.
We consider this to be a useful measure for shareholders as it gives an indication of the total return on investment over the year.
EPRA measures for both earnings per share and net assets per share have been included to assist comparison between European property companies.

The difference in the adjustment for EPRA earnings and adjusted earnings relates to the amortisation of the bond exchange fide-recognition adjustment, which is included in EPRA earnings, but excluded from Adjusted earnings.
Net finance expense now includes the cost of redeeming MTNs and, for Adjusted earnings, the associated bond exchange fide-recognition adjustment.
These items were previously reported as exceptional items.
The difference in the adjustment for EPRA earnings and Adjusted earnings in 2017 relates to the head office relocation costs, which are included in EPRA earnings, but excluded from Adjusted earnings.

Revenue Accounting policy The Group recognises revenue on an accruals basis, when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured and it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group.
Rental income, including fixed rental uplifts, is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives being offered to occupiers to enter into a lease, such as an initial rent-free period or a cash contribution to fit-out or similar costs, are an integral part of the net consideration for the use of the property and are therefore recognised on the same straight-line basis.
Contingent rents, being lease payments that are not fixed at the inception of a lease, for example turnover rents, are recorded as income in the periods in which they are earned.
Service charge income and management fees are recorded as income in the period in which they are earned.
When property is let under a finance lease, the Group recognises a receivable equal to the net investment in the lease at inception of the lease.
Rentals received are accounted for as repayments of principal and finance income as appropriate.
Finance income is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining net investment in the finance lease and is recognised within revenue.
Proceeds received on the sale of trading properties are recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership transfer to the buyer.
This generally occurs on unconditional exchange or on completion, particularly if completion is expected to occur significantly after exchange or if the Group has significant outstanding obligations between exchange and completion.
Revenue on long-term development contracts is recognised over the life of the contract according to the stage of the contract reached, by reference to the value of work completed using the costs incurred to date.
An appropriate estimate of the profit will be recognised as the Group satisfies its performance obligations in accordance with the contract.
All revenue is classified within the Revenue profit column of the income statement, with the exception of proceeds on the sale of trading properties, income arising from long-term development contracts and the non-owned element of the Groups subsidiaries which are presented in the Capital and other items column.

Costs Accounting policy The carrying amounts of the Groups non-financial assets, other than investment properties, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
The value in use is determined as the net present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset, discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount after the reversal does not exceed the amount that would have been determined, net of applicable depreciation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
All costs are classified within the Revenue profit column of the income statement, with the exception of the cost of sale of trading properties, costs arising on long-term development contracts, amortisation of intangible assets arising on business combinations, head office relocation costs, and the non-owned element of the Groups subsidiaries which are presented in the Capital and other items column.

The movement in impairment of trading properties in the year ended 31 March 2017 relates to the reversal of previous impairment charges related to residential land, where the valuers assessment of net realisable value increased over the year.
The net credit of 1m in respect of the head office relocation in the prior year comprises the 2m release of an onerous lease provision following the assignment of the lease on the Groups previous head office at lower net cost than originally anticipated, partly offset by relocation costs incurred in the year.

The Board has recommended a final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2018 of 14.65p per ordinary share 2017: 11.7p to be paid as a PID.
This final dividend will result in a further estimated distribution of 108m 2017: 92m.
Subject to shareholders approval at the Annual General Meeting, the final dividend will be paid on 27 July 2018 to shareholders registered at the close of business on 22 June 2018.
The total dividend paid and recommended in respect of the year ended 31 March 2018 is therefore 44.2p per ordinary share 2017: 38.55p.
The first quarterly dividend for the year ending 31 March 2019 will be 11.3p.
It will be paid on 5 October 2018, to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 7September 2018.
A Dividend Reinvestment Plan DRIP has been available in respect of all dividends paid during the year.
Income tax Accounting policy Income tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the tax payable on the taxable income for the year and any adjustment in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided in full using the balance sheet liability method on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the asset is realised or the liability is settled.
No provision is made for temporary differences i arising on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities, other than on a business combination, that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit and ii relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Significant accounting judgement The Group is a Real Estate Investment Trust REIT.
As a result, the Group does not pay UK corporation tax on its profits and gains from the qualifying rental business in the UK.
Non-qualifying profits and gains of the Group continue to be subject to corporation tax as normal.
In order to maintain group REIT status, certain ongoing criteria must be met.
The main criteria are as follows: at the start of each accounting period, the assets of the tax exempt business must be at least 75% of the total value of the Groups assets: at least 75% of the Groups total profits must arise from the tax exempt business: and at least 90% of the notional taxable profit of the property rental business must be distributed.
The Directors intend that the Group should continue as a REIT for the foreseeable future, with the result that deferred tax is no longer recognised on temporary differences relating to the property rental business.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities require management judgement in determining the amounts, if any, to be recognised.
In particular, judgement is required when assessing the extent to which deferred tax assets should be recognised, taking into account the expected timing and level of future taxable income.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised when management believe they will be recovered against future taxable profits.

It includes details of investment properties, investments in joint ventures and trading properties.
In the Groups IFRS balance sheet, wholly owned properties are presented as either Investment properties or Trading properties.
The Group applies equity accounting to its investments in joint ventures, which requires the Groups share of properties held by joint ventures to be presented within Investments in joint ventures.
Internally, management review the results of the Group on a basis that adjusts for these forms of ownership to present a proportionate share.
The Combined Portfolio, with assets totalling 14.1bn, is an example of this proportionate share, reflecting the economic interest we have in our properties regardless of our ownership structure.
We consider this presentation to better explain to stakeholders the activities and performance of the Group, as it aggregates the results of all of the Groups property interests which under IFRS are required to be presented across a number of line items in the statutory financial statements.
The Groups investment properties are carried at fair value and trading properties are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Both of these values are determined by the Groups external valuers.
The combined value of the Groups total investment property portfolio including the Groups share of investment properties held through joint ventures is shown as a reconciliation in note 14.
Accounting policy Investment properties Investment properties are properties, either owned or leased by the Group, that are held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation, or both.
Investment properties are measured initially at cost including related transaction costs, and subsequently at fair value.
Fair value is based on market value, as determined by a professional external valuer at each reporting date.
The difference between the fair value of an investment property at the reporting date and its carrying amount prior to re-measurement is included in the income statement as a valuation surplus or deficit.
Investment properties are presented on the balance sheet within non-current assets.
Some of the Groups investment properties are owned through long-leasehold arrangements, as opposed to the Group owning the freehold.
Where the Group is a lessee and the lease transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to the Group, the lease is accounted for as a finance lease.
Finance leases are capitalised within investment properties at the commencement of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the property and the present value of the minimum lease payments, and a corresponding liability is recorded within borrowings.
Each lease payment is allocated between repayment of the liability and a finance charge to achieve a constant rate on the outstanding liability.
The investment properties held under finance leases are subsequently carried at their fair value.
Landsec Annual Report 2018 139 Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2018 continued Trading properties Trading properties are those properties held for sale, or those being developed with a view to sell.
Trading properties are recorded at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The net realisable value of a trading property is determined by a professional external valuer at each reporting date.
If the net realisable value of a trading property is lower than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded in the income statement.
If, in subsequent periods, the net realisable value of a trading property that was previously impaired increases above its carrying value, the impairment is reversed to align the carrying value of the property with the net realisable value.
Trading properties are presented on the balance sheet within current assets.
Acquisition of properties Properties are treated as acquired when the Group assumes the significant risks and returns of ownership.
Capital expenditure and capitalisation of borrowing costs Capital expenditure on properties consists of costs of a capital nature, including costs associated with developments and refurbishments.
Where a property is being developed or undergoing major refurbishment, interest costs associated with direct expenditure on the property are capitalised.
The interest capitalised is calculated using the Groups weighted average cost of borrowings.
Interest is capitalised from the commencement of the development work until the date of practical completion.
Certain internal staff and associated costs directly attributable to the management of major schemes are also capitalised.
Transfers between investment properties and trading properties When the Group begins to redevelop an existing investment property for continued future use as an investment property, the property continues to be held as an investment property.
When the Group begins to redevelop an existing investment property with a view to sell, the property is transferred to trading properties and held as a current asset.
The property is re-measured to fair value as at the date of the transfer with any gain or loss being taken to the income statement.
The re-measured amount becomes the deemed cost at which the property is then carried in trading properties.
Disposal of properties Properties are treated as disposed when the significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the buyer.
Typically, this will either occur on unconditional exchange or on completion.
Where completion is expected to occur significantly after exchange, or where the Group continues to have significant outstanding obligations after exchange, the risks and rewards will not usually transfer to the buyer until completion.
The profit on disposal is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset at the beginning of the accounting period plus capital expenditure to the date of disposal.
The profit on disposal of investment properties is presented separately on the face of the income statement.
Proceeds received on the sale of trading properties are recognised within Revenue, and the carrying value at the date of disposal is recognised within Costs.
Significant accounting estimates Valuation of the Groups properties The valuation of the Groups property portfolio is inherently subjective due to, among other factors, the individual nature of each property, its location and the expected future rental revenues from that particular property.
As a result, the valuations the Group places on its property portfolio are subject to a degree of uncertainty and are made on the basis of assumptions which may not prove to be accurate, particularly in periods of volatility or low transaction flow in the property market.
The investment property valuation contains a number of assumptions upon which the Groups valuer has based its valuation of the Groups properties.
The assumptions on which the property valuation reports have been based include, but are not limited to, matters such as the tenure and tenancy details for the properties, ground conditions at the properties, the structural condition of the properties, prevailing market yields and comparable market transactions.
These assumptions are market standard and accord with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS Valuation Professional Standards UK 2014 revised April 2015.
The estimation of the net realisable value of the Groups trading properties, in particular the development land and infrastructure programmes, is inherently subjective due to a number of factors, including their complexity, unusually large size, the substantial expenditure required and long timescales to completion.
In addition, as a result of these timescales to completion, the plans associated with these programmes could be subject to significant variation.
As a result, and similar to the valuation of investment properties, the net realisable values of the Groups trading properties are subject to a degree of uncertainty and are determined on the basis of assumptions which may not prove to be accurate.
If the assumptions upon which the external valuer has based its valuations prove to be inaccurate, this may have an impact on the value of the Groups investment and trading properties, which could in turn have an effect on the Groups financial position and results.
Significant accounting judgements Acquisition and disposal of properties Property transactions can be complex in nature and material to the financial statements.
To determine when an acquisition or disposal should be recognised, management consider whether the Group holds the risks and rewards of ownership, and the point at which this is obtained or relinquished.
Consideration is given to the terms of the acquisition or disposal contracts and any conditions that must be satisfied before the contract is fulfilled.
In the case of an acquisition, management must also consider whether the transaction represents an asset acquisition or business combination.

The net book value of leasehold properties where head leases have been capitalised is 2,096m 2017: 1,169m.
Investment properties include capitalised interest of 209m 2017: 206m.
The average rate of interest capitalisation for the year is 4.0% 2017: 4.7%.
The historical cost of investment properties is 7,081m 2017: 6,713m.
Valuation process The fair value of investment properties at 31 March 2018 was determined by the Groups external valuer, CBRE.
The valuations are in accordance with RICS standards and were arrived at by reference to market evidence of transactions for similar properties.
The valuations performed by the valuer are reviewed internally by Senior Management and relevant people within the London and Retail business units.
This process includes discussions of the assumptions used by the valuer, as well as a review of the resulting valuations.
Discussions of the valuation process and results are held between Senior Management, the Audit Committee and the valuer on a half-yearly basis.
The valuers opinion of fair value was primarily derived using comparable recent market transactions on arms length terms and using appropriate valuation techniques.
The fair value of investment properties is determined using the income capitalisation approach.
Under this approach, forecast net cash flows, based upon current market derived estimated rental values market rents together with estimated costs, are discounted at market derived capitalisation rates to produce the valuers opinion of fair value.
The average discount rate, which, if applied to all cash flows would produce the fair value, is described as the equivalent yield.
Properties in the development programme are typically valued using a residual valuation method.
Under this methodology, the valuer assesses the completed development value using income and yield assumptions.
Deductions are then made for estimated costs to complete, including finance and developers profit, to arrive at the valuation.
As the development approaches completion, the valuer may consider the income capitalisation approach to be more appropriate.
Landsec Annual Report 2018 141 Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2018 continued 14.
Investment properties continued The Group considers all of its investment properties to fall within Level 3, as defined by IFRS 13 and as explained in note 25 iii.
Accordingly, there have been no transfers of properties within the fair value hierarchy in the financial year.
Costs include future estimated costs associated with refurbishment or development excluding finance costs, together with an estimate of cash incentives to be paid to tenants.
The Other category contains a range of low value properties of a diverse nature.
As a result it is not meaningful to present assumptions used in valuing these properties.

Joint arrangements Accounting policy Joint arrangements are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
The treatment as either a joint venture or a joint operation will depend on whether the Group has rights to the net assets, or a direct interest in the assets and liabilities of the arrangement.
A joint arrangement is accounted for as a joint venture when the Group, along with the other parties that have joint control of the arrangement, has rights to the net assets of the arrangement.
Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
The Groups share of jointly controlled assets, related liabilities, income and expenses are combined with the equivalent items in the financial statements on a line-by-line basis.

Net investment in finance leases Accounting policy Where the Groups leases transfer the significant risks and rewards of owning the asset to the tenant, the lease is accounted for as a finance lease.
Atthe outset of the lease the fair value of the asset is fide-recognised from investment property and recognised as a finance lease receivable.
Lease income is recognised over the period of the lease, reflecting a constant rate of return.
The difference between the gross receivable and the present value of the receivable is recognised as finance income within Revenue over the lease term.

Intangible assets Accounting policy Intangible assets comprise goodwill and other intangible assets arising on business combinations and software used internally within the business.
Intangible assets arising on business combinations are initially recognised at fair value.
Goodwill is not amortised, but is tested at least annually for impairment.
Other intangible assets arising on business combinations are amortised to the income statement over their expected useful lives.
Software assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives, normally three to five years.

The fair value at the date of acquisition was 30m and the asset is being amortised over a period of 20 years.
On recognition of the intangible asset, the Group recognised a deferred tax liability of 6m, and corresponding goodwill of the same amount.
The deferred tax liability is being released to the income statement as the intangible asset is amortised, and the corresponding element of the goodwill is being tested for impairment.
Section 4 Capital structure and financing This section focuses on the Groups financing structure, including borrowings and financial risk management.
The total capital of the Group consists of shareholders equity and net debt.
The Groups strategy is to maintain an appropriate net debt to total equityratio gearing and loan-to-value ratio LTV to ensure that asset level performance is translated into enhanced returns for shareholders whilstmaintaining an appropriate risk reward balance to accommodate changing financial and operating market cycles.
The table in note 20 details anumber of the Groups key metrics in relation to managing its capital structure.
A key element of the Groups capital structure is that the majority of our borrowings are secured against a large pool of our assets the Security Group.
This enables us to raise long-term debt in the bond market, as well as shorter-term flexible bank facilities, both at competitive rates.
In general, we follow a secured debt strategy as we believe this gives the Group better access to borrowings at a lower cost.
In addition, the Group holds a number of assets outside the Security Group structure in the Non-restricted Group.
These assets include a number of joint venture interests.
By having both the Security Group and the Non-restricted Group, and considerable flexibility to move assets between the two, we are able to raise the most appropriate finance for each specific asset or joint venture.
Under IFRS, a large part of our net debt is carried at below its final redemption amount and is increased over its life to its nominal value.
We view ourcapital structure as if the debt were carried at its full redemption amount.
From 1 April 2018, the Group has changed its accounting policy for debt refinancing transactions such that the bond exchange fide-recognition adjustment will no longer be held on the balance sheet.
See note 21 for an explanation of the bond exchange fide-recognition adjustment and note 3 for further details on the change in accounting policy.

Borrowings Accounting policy Borrowings, other than bank overdrafts, are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption value being recognised inthe income statement over the period of the borrowings, using the effective interest method.
Where existing borrowings are exchanged for new borrowings and the terms of the existing and new borrowings are not substantially different, the newborrowings are recognised initially at the carrying amount of the existing borrowings.
The difference between the amount initially recognised andthe redemption value of the new borrowings is recognised in the income statement over the period of the new borrowings, using the effective interest method.

The Security Group includes investment properties, development properties and the Groups investment in the X-Leisure fund, Westgate Oxford Alliance Limited Partnership, Nova, Victoria, St. Davids Limited Partnership and Southside Limited Partnership, in total valued at 13.7bn at 31 March 2018 31 March 2017: 12.9bn.
The secured debt structure has a tiered operating covenant regime which gives the Group substantial flexibility when the loan-to-value and interest cover in the Security Group are less than 65% and more than 1.45 respectively.
If these limits are exceeded, the operating environment becomes more restrictive with provisions to encourage a reduction in gearing.
The interest rate of each MTN is fixed until the expected maturity, being two years before the legal maturity date of the MTN, whereupon the interest rate for the last two years may either become floating on a LIBOR basis plus an increased margin relative to that at the time of issue, or subject to a fixed coupon uplift, depending on the terms and conditions of the specific notes.
The effective interest rate is based on the coupon paid and includes the amortisation of issue costs.
The MTNs are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and their fair values are based on their respective market prices.
During the year, the Group conducted tender exercises and purchased 1,256m of MTNs for a total premium of 385m, with associated costs of 5m.
The 150m increase in committed facilities is the result of an increase in the syndicated debt facility arranged on 29 March 2018.
All syndicated and bilateral facilities are committed and secured on the assets of the Security Group.
During the year ended 31 March 2018, the amounts drawn under the Groups facilities increased by 173m.
The terms of the Security Group funding arrangements require undrawn facilities to be reserved where syndicated and bilateral facilities mature within one year, or where commercial paper has been issued.
Accordingly, the Groups available undrawn facilities at 31 March 2018 were 990m 31 March 2017: 1,499m, compared with undrawn facilities of 1,862m 31 March 2017: 1,885m.
Queen Annes Gate Bond In two tranches, on 25 April 2017 and 9 May 2017, the Group repurchased and redeemed the 273m QAG Bond in its entirety for a total premium to nominal value of 61m, with associated costs of 1m.
Fair values The fair values of any floating rate financial liabilities are assumed to be equal to their nominal value.
The fair values of the MTNs and the QAG Bond fall within Level 1, the syndicated and bilateral facilities, commercial paper, interest-rate swaps and foreign exchange swaps fall within Level 2, and the amounts payable under finance leases fall within Level 3, as defined by IFRS 13.
The fair value of the amounts payable under finance leases is determined using a discount rate of 2.6% 31 March 2017: 4.2%.
Bond exchange fide-recognition On 3 November 2004, a debt refinancing was completed resulting in the Group exchanging all of its outstanding bond and debenture debt for new MTNs with higher nominal values.
The new MTNs did not meet the IAS 39 conditions to be considered substantially different from the debt that they replaced.
Consequently, the book value of the new debt is reduced to the book value of the original debt by the bond exchange fide-recognition adjustment which is then amortised to zero over the life of the new MTNs.
The amortisation is included in finance expense in the income statement, aspart of the Capital and other items column.
See note 3 for further details.
Monies held in restricted accounts and deposits Accounting policy Monies held in restricted accounts and deposits represent cash held by the Group in accounts with conditions that restrict the use of these monies by the Group and, as such, does not meet the definition of cash and cash equivalents.
Holding cash in restricted accounts does not prevent the Group from optimising returns by putting these monies on short-term deposit.

Derivative financial instruments Accounting policy The Group uses interest-rate and foreign exchange swaps to manage its market risk.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes.
All derivatives are recognised on the balance sheet at fair value.
The fair value of interest-rate and foreign exchange swaps is based on counterparty or market quotes.
Those quotes are tested for reasonableness by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms and maturity of each contract and using market rates for similar instruments at the measurement date.
The gain or loss on derivatives are recognised immediately in the income statement, within net finance expense.
The fair values of the financial instruments have been determined by reference to relevant market prices, where available.
The fair values of the Groups outstanding interest-rate swaps have been estimated by calculating the present value of future cash flows, using appropriate market discount rates.
These valuation techniques fall within Level 2, as defined by IFRS 13.

Financial risk management Introduction A review of the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing and monitoring risk is set out in Managing risk and Our principal risks and uncertainties pages 52 to 57.
This note provides further detail on financial risk management and includes quantitative information on specific financial risks.
The Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks: market risks principally interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management strategy seeks to minimise the potential adverse effects of these on the Groups financial performance and includes the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Financial risk management is carried out by the Groups treasury function under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
The following table summarises the Groups financial assets and liabilities into the categories required by IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures: 2018 2017 m m Loans and receivables 743 672 Cash and cash equivalents 62 30 Available for sale financial instruments 12 13 Financial liabilities at amortised cost 3,775 3,118 Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss 38 43 2,996 2,446 Financial risk factors i Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, finance lease receivables and amounts due from joint ventures.
Further details concerning the credit risk of counterparties is provided in the note that specifically relates to each type of asset.
Bank and financial institutions The principal credit risks of the Group arise from financial derivative instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions.
In line with the policy approved by the Board of Directors, where the Group manages the deposit, only independently rated banks and financial institutions with a minimum rating of Aare accepted.
For UK banks and financial institutions with which the Group has a committed lending relationship, the minimum rating is lowered to BBB.
The Groups treasury function currently performs a weekly review of the credit ratings of all financial institution counterparties.
Furthermore, the treasury function ensures that funds deposited with a single financial institution remain within the Groups policy limits.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are presented in the balance sheet net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
Impairment is made where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables concerned.
The balance is low relative tothe scale of the balance sheet and, owing to the long-term nature and diversity of the Groups tenancy arrangements, the credit risk of trade receivables is considered to be low.
Furthermore, a credit report is obtained from an independent rating agency prior to the inception of a lease with anew counterparty.
This report is used to determine the size of the deposit that is required, if any, from the tenant at inception.
In general these deposits represent between three and six months rent.
Finance lease receivables This balance relates to amounts receivable from tenants in respect of tenant finance leases.
This is not considered a significant credit risk as the tenants are generally of good financial standing.
ii Liquidity risk The Group actively maintains a mixture of notes with final maturities between 2022 and 2059, commercial paper and medium-term committed bank facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for its operations and its committed capital expenditure programme.
Management monitors the Groups available funds as follows: 2018 2017 m m Cash and cash equivalents 62 30 Available facilities 990 1,499 Cash and available undrawn facilities 1,052 1,529 As a proportion of drawn debt 28.3% 47.2% The Groups core financing structure is in the Security Group, although the Non-restricted Group may also secure independent funding.
Landsec Annual Report 2018 157 Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2018 continued 25.
Financial risk management continued Security Group The Groups principal financing arrangements utilise the credit support of a ring-fenced group of assets the Security Group that comprises the majority of the Groups investment property portfolio and certain investments in joint ventures.
These arrangements operate in tiers determined by LTV and interest cover ratio ICR.
This structure is most flexible at lower tiers with a lower LTV and a higher ICR and allows property acquisitions, disposals and developments to occur with relative freedom.
In higher tiers, the requirements become more prescriptive.
No financial covenant default is triggered until the applicable LTV exceeds 100% or the ICR is less than 1.0x.
As at 31 March 2018, the reported LTV for the Security Group was 27.2% 2017: 28.3%, meaning that the Group was operating in Tier 1 and benefited from maximum operational flexibility.
Management monitors the key covenants attached to the Security Group on a monthly basis, including LTV, ICR, sector and regional concentration and disposals.
Non-restricted Group The Non-restricted Group obtains funding when required from a combination of inter-company loans from the Security Group, equity and external bank debt.
Bespoke credit facilities are established with banks when required for the Non-restricted Group and joint ventures, usually on a limitedrecourse basis.
The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the expected maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.

Interest rates The Group uses derivative products to manage its interest rate exposure, and has a hedging policy that generally requires at least 70% of its existing debt plus increases in debt associated with net committed capital expenditure to be at fixed interest rates for the coming five years.
Due to a combination of factors, principally the high level of certainty required under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, hedging instruments used in this context do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Specific interest-rate hedges are also used from time to time to fix the interest rate exposure on our debt.
Where specific hedges are used to fix the interest exposure on debt, these may qualify for hedge accounting.
At 31 March 2018, the Group including joint ventures had pay-fixed interest-rate swaps in place with a nominal value of 400m 2017: 70m, and forward-starting pay-fixed interest-rate swaps of nil 2017: 400m and its net debt was 83.3% fixed 2017: 88.9%.
Based on the Groups debt balances at 31 March 2018, a 1% increase in interest rates would increase the annual net finance expense in the income statement and reduce equity by 6m 2017: 2m.
The sensitivity has been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the variable rate borrowings, net of interest-rate swaps and cash and cash equivalents.
Foreign exchange Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the Groups functional currency.
As it is solely UK based, the Groups foreign exchange risk is low.
The vast majority of the Groups foreign currency transactions relate to foreign currency borrowing under the Groups commercial paper programme.
It is the Groups policy to hedge 100% of this exposure.
At 31 March 2018, the Group had issued 947m 2017: 307m, $55m 2017: $118m and CHF nil 2017: CHF35m of commercial paper, fully hedged through foreign exchange swaps.
A 10% weakening of strengthening of Sterling would therefore have nil 2017: nil impact in the income statement and equity arising from foreign currency borrowings.
Where additional foreign exchange risk is identified not linked to commercial paper borrowing, it is the Groups policy to assess the likelihood of the risk crystallising and if deemed appropriate use derivatives to hedge some or all of the risk.
At 31 March 2018, the Group had 50m 2017: nil of foreign currency exposure, relating to a forward foreign currency contract entered into in order to economically hedge forecast foreign currency purchases.
A 10% weakening strengthening of Sterling would have a 5m 4m 2017: nil impact on the income statement and equity.

The fair value of the redemption liability is determined as the present value of the amount the Group would be required to pay to settle the liability an exit price.
The fair value is calculated by reference to the net assets of the underlying subsidiary.
The valuation is not based on observable market data and therefore the redemption liability is considered to fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
The fair value of the other investments is calculated by reference to the net assets of the underlying entity.
The valuation is not based on observable market data and therefore the other investments are considered to fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
160 Landsec Annual Report 2018 Financial statements Section 5 Working capital This section focuses on our working capital balances, including trade and other receivables, trade and other payables, and provisions.
Trade and other receivables Accounting policy Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value, subsequently at amortised cost and, where relevant, adjusted for the time value of money.
A provision for impairment is made where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables concerned.
If collection is expected in more than one year, the balance is presented within non-current assets.

Net pension surplus Accounting policy Contributions to defined contribution schemes are charged to the income statement as incurred.
The pension obligations arising under the Groups defined benefit pension scheme are measured at discounted present value.
The scheme assets are measured at fair value, except annuities which are valued to match the liability or benefit value.
The operating and financing costs of the scheme arerecognised separately in the income statement.
Service costs are spread using the projected unit credit method.
Net financing costs are recognised in the period in which they arise, calculated with reference to the discount rate, and are included in finance income or expense on a net basis.
Re-measurement gains and losses arising from either experience differing from previous actuarial assumptions, or changes to those assumptions, arerecognised immediately in Other comprehensive income.
Defined contribution schemes The charge to operating profit for the year in respect of the defined contribution scheme was 3m 2017: 3m.
Defined benefit scheme The Pension & Assurance Scheme of the Land Securities Group of Companies the Scheme is a registered defined benefit final salary scheme subject to the UK regulatory framework for pensions, including the Scheme Specific Funding requirements.
The Scheme is operated under trust and as such, the Trustees of the Scheme are responsible for operating the Scheme and they have a statutory responsibility to act in accordance with the Schemes Trust Deed and Rules, in the best interest of the beneficiaries of the Scheme and UK legislation including trust law.
The Trustees and the Group have the joint power to set the contributions that are paid to the Scheme.
In setting contributions to the Scheme, the Trustees and the Group are guided by the advice of a qualified independent actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit credit method.
As the Scheme is closed to new members, the current service cost is expected to increase as a percentage of salary of the Scheme members, under the projected unit credit method, as members approach retirement.
A full actuarial valuation of the Scheme was undertaken on 30 June 2015 by the independent actuaries, Hymans Robertson LLP.
This valuation was updated to 31 March 2018 using, where required, assumptions prescribed by IAS 19, Employee Benefits.
The next full actuarial valuation will be performed as at 30 June 2018.
As a result of the 30 June 2015 valuation, the employer contribution rate increased from 1 April 2016 to 43.1% from 36.1% of pensionable salary to cover the costs of accruing benefits.
It was agreed that no further deficit contributions were required from the Group.
Employee contributions are paid by salary sacrifice, and therefore appear as Group contributions.
In the year ended 31 March 2018, employee contributions were 8.0% 2017: 8.0% of monthly pensionable salary.
The Group expects to make total employee and employer contributions of around 1m 2017: 1m to the Scheme in the year to 31 March 2019.
All death-in-service and incapacity benefits arising during employment are wholly insured.
No post-retirement benefits other than pensions are made available to employees of the Group.

During the prior year, the Scheme sold some corporate bonds and gilts to purchase a buy-in policy with Just Retirement for 111m.
This insurance contract is valued as an asset using the same IAS19 assumptions.
Insurance contracts are annuities which are unquoted assets.
All other Scheme assets have quoted prices in active markets.
The Scheme assets do not include any directly owned financial instruments issued by the Group.
Indirectly owned financial instruments had a fair value of nil 2017: nil.
The defined benefit scheme liabilities are split 11% 2017: 11% in respect of active scheme participants, 25% 2017: 25% in respect of deferred scheme participants, and 64% 2017: 64% in respect of retirees.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit scheme liabilities at 31 March 2018 is 17.4 years 2017: 17.3 years.
The assumptions agreed with the Trustees of the Scheme for the triennial valuation at 30 June 2015 have been restated to the assumptions described by IAS 19, Employee Benefits.
The major assumptions used in the valuation were in nominal terms : 2018 2017 % % Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.40 3.40 Rate of increase in pensions with no cap 3.35 3.40 Rate of increase in pensions with 5% cap 3.25 3.30 Discount rate 2.65 2.55 Inflation Retail Price Index 3.35 3.40 Consumer Price Index 2.55 2.60 The mortality assumptions used in this valuation were: 2018 2017 years years Life expectancy at age 60 for current pensioners Men 31.0 30.8 Women 31.3 31.2 Life expectancy at age 60 for future pensioners current age 40 Men 34.0 33.8 Women 33.8 33.7 The sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the Scheme liabilities are set out below.
These were calculated using approximate methods taking into account the duration of the Scheme liabilities.
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities Discount rate Decrease by 0.5% Increase by 21m Rate of mortality Increase by 1 year Increase by 9m Rate of inflation Increase by 0.5% Increase by 17m As the above table demonstrates, changes in assumptions can have a significant impact on the Scheme liabilities.
The assumptions agreed with the Trustees of the Scheme for the triennial valuation and subsequent interim updates differ from those prescribed by IAS 19, Employee Benefits.
Using the assumptions agreed with the Trustees would result in a balance sheet deficit for the Scheme of 8m at 31 March 2018, as opposed to a surplus of 12m.
In order to reduce risk within the Scheme, 47% 2017: 48% of the Scheme assets are invested in annuities that match the liabilities of some pensioners.
The assets that the Scheme holds are designed to match a significant proportion of the Scheme liabilities and the Scheme has hedged over 72% 2017: 72% of the interest rate risk and 79% 2017: 72% of the inflation risk when measured on a gilts flat discount rate to which it is exposed.
The Company did not operate any defined contribution schemes or defined benefit schemes during the financial year ended 31 March 2018 or in the previous financial year.

Share-based payments Accounting policy The cost of granting shares, options over shares and other share-based remuneration to employees and Executive Directors is recognised through the income statement.
All awards are equity settled and therefore the fair value is measured at the grant date.
Where the awards have non-market related performance criteria, the Group uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model to establish the relevant fair values.
Where the awards have Total Shareholder Return TSR market related performance criteria, the Group has used the Monte Carlo simulation valuation model to establish the relevant fair values.
The resulting values are amortised through the income statement over the vesting period of the awards.
For awards with non-market related criteria, the charge is reversed if it appears probable that the performance or service criteria will not be met.
The following table analyses the total cost recognised in the income statement for the year between each plan, together with number of options outstanding.

The plans have been split into two categories: Executive plans and other plans.
For further details on the Executive plans, see the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 86 to 111.
Executive plans: Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP is open to Executive Directors and Senior Management, with awards made at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
In addition, other than for Executive Directors, an award of matching shares can be made where the individual acquires shares in Land Securities Group PLC and pledges to hold them for a period of three years.
Awards of LTIP shares and matching shares are subject to the same performance criteria and normally vest after three years.
Awards may be satisfied by the issue of new shares, the transfer of treasury shares, other shares or nil cost options.
The awards will be issued at nil consideration, subject to performance and vesting conditions being met.
The weighted average share price at the date of vesting during the year was 974p 2017: 1,006p.
The estimated fair value of awards granted during the year under the scheme was 3m 2017: 4m.
Deferred bonus share plan The Executive Directors annual bonus is structured in two distinct parts made up of an initial payment and deferred shares.
The shares are deferred for one or two years and are not subject to additional performance criteria.
Awards are satisfied by the transfer of existing shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust EBT at nil consideration, or by nil cost options.
The weighted average share price at the date of vesting during the year was 941p 2017: 887p.
The estimated fair value of awards granted during the year under the scheme was 0.5m 2017: 0.8m.
Other plans: Executive share option scheme ESOS The 2005 ESOS is open to managers not eligible to participate in the LTIP.
Awards are discretionary and are granted over ordinary shares of the Company at the middle market price on the three dealing days immediately preceding the date of grant.
Awards normally vest after three years and are not subject to performance conditions.
Awards are satisfied by the transfer of shares from the EBT and lapse ten years after the date of grant.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for awards exercised during the year was 1,051p 2017: 1,053p.
The estimated fair value of awards granted during the year under the scheme was 0.3m 2017: 0.3m.
Savings related share option plan Under the savings related share option plan, Executive Directors and other eligible employees are invited to make regular monthly contributions into aSharesave plan operated by Equiniti.
On completion of the threeor five-year contract period, ordinary shares in the Company may be purchased ataprice based upon the market price at date of invitation less 20% discount.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for awards exercised during the year was 1,032p 2017: 1,046p.

The expected life used in themodel has been determined based upon managements best estimate for the effects of non-transferability, vesting exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Risk-free rate is the yield at the date of the grant of an award on a gilt-edged stock with a redemption date equal to the anticipated vesting of that award.
Fair value inputs for awards with market performance conditions Fair values are calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation option pricing model for awards with market performance conditions.
Awards made under the 2005 LTIP which were granted after 31 March 2009 include a TSR condition, which is a market-based condition.

Ordinary share capital Accounting policy Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
External costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds.
The consideration paid by any Group entity to acquire the Companys equity share capital, including any directly attributable incremental costs, is deducted from equity until the shares are cancelled, reissued or sold.
Where own shares are sold or reissued, the net consideration received is included in equity.
Shares acquired by the Employee Benefit Trust EBT are presented on the Group balance sheet as own shares.
Purchases of treasury shares are deducted from retained earnings.

Capital distribution On 27 September 2017, the Groups shareholders approved a return of capital to shareholders of 475m through the issue of new B shares, which the Group then redeemed in order to return 60p per ordinary share to shareholders, reducing the Groups share premium account.
The capital distribution was paid on 13 October 2017.
Following the redemption of the B shares, there was a share consolidation in the ratio of 15 ordinary shares for every 16 existing shares.
The share consolidation did not result in a change in the carrying value of the Groups share capital, but reduced the number of ordinary shares in issue by 50,085,104 of which 655,946 were held in Treasury.
Contingencies The Group has contingent liabilities in respect of legal claims, guarantees, and warranties arising in the ordinary course of business.
It is not anticipated that any material liabilities will arise from the contingent liabilities.
