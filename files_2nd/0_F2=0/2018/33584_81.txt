Financial statements FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNRECOGNISED ITEMS AND UNCERTAIN EVENTS This section includes disclosure of items and transactions that are not reflected in the Groups results because they are uncertain or have been incurred after the end of the year.
These disclosures are considered relevant to an understanding of the Groups financial position and the effect of expected or possible future events.
EVENTS OCCURRING AFTER END OF YEAR On 20 February 2019, the Group gave notice to terminate a long-term power supply contract in Copper.
The termination could potentially result in a one-off cost of approximately $175 million and is expected to enable improved cost performance in the medium and long term.
The termination is a non-adjusting event that has no impact on the Consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018.
With the exception of the proposed final dividend for 2018, there have been no other reportable events since 31 December 2018.

Capital commitments for subsidiaries and joint operations relating to the acquisition of property, plant and equipment are $2,997 million 2017: $1,444million, ofwhich 49% 2017: 50% relate to expenditure to be incurred within the next year.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Overview The Group is subject to various claims which arise in the ordinary course of business.
Additionally, the Group has provided indemnities against certain liabilities as part of agreements for the sale or other disposal of business operations.
Having taken appropriate legal advice, the Group believes that a material liability arising from the indemnities provided is remote.
The Group is required to provide guarantees in several jurisdictions in respect of environmental restoration and decommissioning obligations.
The Group has provided for the estimated cost of these activities.
Accounting judgement A provision is recognised where, based on the Groups legal views and, in some cases, independent advice, it is considered probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle a present obligation that can be measured reliably.
