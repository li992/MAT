The Company has not provided for deferred tax on capital gains or losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments as it isexempt from tax on these items because of its status as an investment trust, which it intends to maintain for the foreseeable future.
d Factors that may affect future tax charges The Company has not recognised a deferred tax asset totalling 8,263,000 2017: 7,201,000 based on a prospective corporation tax rate of 17.0% 2017: 17.0%.
The deferred tax asset arises as a result of having unutilised management expenses and unutilised non-trade loan relationship deficits.
These expenses will only be utilised, to any material extent, if the Company has profits chargeable to corporation tax in the future because changes are made either to the tax treatment of the capital gains made by investment trusts orto the Companys investment profile which require them to be used.
