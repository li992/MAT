Notes to the Company Financial Statements 1.
Significant Accounting Policies Basis of preparation The separate Financial Statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006.
The Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under FRS 100 Financial Reporting Standard 100 issued by the Financial Reporting Council.
Accordingly, the Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 101 Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework as issued by the Financial Reporting Council FRC incorporating the Amendments to FRS 101 issued by the FRC in July 2015 and July 2016.
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to share-based payments, financial instruments, capital management, presentation of comparative information in respect of certain assets, presentation of a cash-flow statement and certain related party transactions.
Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Financial Statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the remeasurement of certain financial instruments to fair value.
The principal accounting policies adopted are the same as those set out in Note 3 Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements except as noted below.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the preparation of the Companys Financial Statements in accordance with FRS 101, management are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the Financial Statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses for the periods presented.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
A key area of estimation uncertainty that has the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Financial Statements are the assumptions when determining the impairment of investment carrying values.
Refer to Note 4 Investment in Subsidiaries for details.
Foreign currencies The functional currency of the Company is Sterling, being the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
The Company has adopted US dollars as the presentation currency for its Financial Statements, in line with the presentation currency for the Consolidated Financial Statements.
For the purpose of presenting individual company financial statements, assets and liabilities of the Company are translated into US dollars at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity, the cumulative translation reserve.
Investments Investments in Group undertakings are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable.
If any such indication of impairment exists, the Company makes an estimate of the recoverable amount.
If the recoverable amount of the investment is less than the carrying amount of the investment, the investment is considered to be impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
Any impairment loss is offset against the merger reserve in the first instance.
If the merger reserve is not sufficient to cover an impairment loss the excess impairment is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
Merger reserve The merger reserve represents the fair value in excess of the par value of shares issued as part of a share exchange upon incorporation.
Currency translation reserve The currency translation reserve is the exchange differences arising on the translation of the assets and liabilities of the Company into US dollars at the prevailing balance sheet rate and income and expense items being translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
Other reserves Other reserves relates to movements on equity-settled share-based payments.
Share-based payments The Company has implemented the generally accepted accounting principle for accounting for share-based payments with subsidiary undertakings under FRS 101, whereby the Company has granted rights to its shares to employees of its subsidiary undertakings under an equity-settled arrangement and the subsidiaries have not reimbursed the Company for these rights.
Under this arrangement, the Company treats the share-based payment recognised in the subsidiarys financial statements as a cost of investment in the subsidiary and credits equity with an equal amount.

Result for the Period As permitted by s408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company has elected not to present its own Profit and Loss Account or Statement of Other Comprehensive Income for the current or prior year.
The loss attributable to the Company is disclosed in the footnote to the Companys Balance Sheet.
The auditors remuneration for audit and other services is disclosed in Note 6 Auditor Remuneration to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Staff Costs The average monthly number of employees including Executive Directors was: 2018 2017 Number Number General and administrative 2 2 2 2 Their aggregate remuneration comprised: 2018 2017 $m $m a Wages and salaries 3.7 13.4 Social security costs 0.2 0.3 Pension related costs 0.2 0.2 Total 4.1 13.9 a Included within wages and salaries are share-based payment charges of $1.8 million in 2018 2017: $12.0 million.
The remuneration of the Directors is set out on pages 106 to 111 within the Remuneration Committee report.

The Company performed an assessment of the recoverable amount of the investments in subsidiaries at 31 December 2018 triggered by a decrease in the share price in October 2018 and the continued valuation of shares at the depressed value.
The recoverable amount was determined with reference to IAS 36 methodology by assessing the value in use of the investments based on discounted cash flows.
This resulted in an impairment of $1.616 billion.
The impact on the retained earnings is offset by a transfer of the same amount from the merger reserve.
In undertaking the impairment review, the Company has considered both external and internal sources of information, and any observable indications that may suggest that the carrying value of shares in subsidiary undertakings may be impaired.
Future cash flows are determined using Board approved forecasts and strategic plans.
These forecasts and strategic plans are based on specific assumptions during the five-year planning period with respect to revenue, results of operations, working capital, capital investments and other general assumptions for the projected period.
The forecast assumptions, that derive the future cash flows, are based on the historical results of the Group combined with external market information and defined strategic initiatives.
The recoverable amount has been estimated by the application of an appropriate discount rate to these future cash flows.
Determining the estimated recoverable amount is judgmental in nature and requires the use of certain estimated inputs that represent key sources of estimation uncertainty.
It is reasonably possible that the estimations and assumptions used in determining the impairment as at 31 December 2018, including discount rate assumptions, may result, within the next financial year, in a material further impairment to the carrying amount of the investment value.
If the discount rate were to increase by 0.5% the impairment would increase by $240 million.
