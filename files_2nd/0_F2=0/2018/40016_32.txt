AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES ADSS AND AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS ADRS In the US, the Companys ordinary shares are traded in the form ofADSs, evidenced by ADRs, on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol SNN.
Each American Depositary Share represents two ordinary shares.
Deutsche Bank is the authorised depositary bank for the Companys ADR programme.
This relationship is governed under a Depositary Agreement that contains a clause which the Company has been advised by different Depositary Banks was previously considered as standard.
This clause supports what we understand to be the normal practice under the US voting system, whereby votes which have not been instructed are then deemed to have given a discretionary proxy auto-proxy.
Whilst the wording of ourDepositary Agreement does grant auto-proxy rights, the Company can confirm that we do not believe that it is appropriate, within a UK context, to utilise this clause.
The Company has therefore always instructed our Depositary Bank to not exercise this right and to only vote those ADRs which have been specifically instructed.
The Company will look to remove this clause when updating the Depositary Agreement clause during the course of 2019.
It is also the Companys practice to always notify our ADR holders of upcoming Annual General Meetings and General Meetings and the availability of relevant documentation on the Company website as well as providing instructions on how to submit votes, where applicable.
This is in accordance with US regulations, which require NYSE ADR listed issuers to solicit ADR votes regardless of the wording in their Depositary Agreement.

Following the capital restructuring and dividend reduction in 2000, the Group adopted a policy of increasing its dividend cover the ratio of EPSA, as set out in the Selected financial data, toordinary dividends declared for the year.
This was intended to increase the financing capability of the Group for acquisitions and other investments.
From 2000 to 2004, the dividend increased in line with inflation and, in 2004, dividend cover stood at 4.1 times.
Having achieved this level of dividend cover the Board changed its policy, from that of increasing dividends in line with inflation, to that of increasing dividends for 2005 and after by 10%.
Following the redenomination of the Companys share capital into US Dollars, the Board reaffirmed its policy of increasing the dividend by 10% ayear in US Dollar terms.
On 2 August 2012, the Board announced its intention to pursue a progressive dividend policy, with the aim of increasing the US Dollar value of ordinary dividends over time broadly based on the Groups underlying growth in earnings, while taking into account capital requirements and cash flows.
At the time of the full year results, the Board reviews the appropriate level of total annual dividend each year.
The Board intendsthat the interim dividend will be set by a formula and will be equivalent to 40% of the total dividend for the previous year.
Dividends will continue to be declared in US Dollars with an equivalent amount in Sterling payable to those shareholders whose registered address is inthe UK, or who have validly elected to receive Sterling dividends.
An interim dividend in respect of each fiscal year is normally declared in July or August and paid in October or November.
A final dividend will be recommended by the Board of Directors and paid subject to approval by shareholders at the Companys Annual General Meeting.
Future dividends of Smith & Nephew will be dependent upon: future earnings: the future financial condition of the Group: the Boards dividend policy: and the additional factors that might affect the business of the Group set out in Special note regarding forward-looking statements and Risk Factors.
From 6 April 2018 dividends below 2,000 per tax year became tax free and dividends above 2,000 per tax year became subject to personal income tax at the rate of 7.5% for basic rate taxpayers, 32.5% for higher rate taxpayers and 38.1% for additional rate taxpayers.
If you need to pay tax, how you pay depends on the amount of dividend income you receive in a year.
If your dividend income is up to 10,000 you can request HMRC to change your tax code so that the tax will be taken from your wages or pension or you can complete a self-assessment tax return.
If your dividend income is over 10,000 in the tax year, you will need to complete a self-assessment tax return.
This will apply to both cash and dividend reinvestment plan DRiP dividends, although dividends paid on shares held within pensions and ISAs will be unaffected, remaining tax free.
Between 6 April 2016 and 6 April 2018 dividends below 5,000 per tax year were tax free and dividends above 5,000 per tax year were subject topersonal income tax at the rates referred to above.
Dividends shown in the table above, prior to 6 April 2016, include the associated UK tax credit of 10%, but exclude the deduction of withholding taxes.
Since the second interim dividend for 2005, all dividends have been declared in US cents per ordinary share.
In respect of the proposed final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2018 of 22.0 US cents per ordinary share, the record date will be 5 April2019 and the payment date will be 8 May 2019.
The Sterling equivalent per ordinary share will be set following the record date.
Shareholders may elect to receive their dividend in either Sterling or US Dollars and the last day for election will be 17 April 2019.
The ordinary shares will trade ex-dividend on boththe London and New York Stock Exchanges from 4 April 2019.
The proposed final dividend of 22.0 US cents per ordinary share, which together with the interim dividend of 14.0 US cents, makes a total for 2018 of 36.0 US cents.

The ordinary shares were listed on the New York Stock Exchange on 16 November 1999, trading in the form of ADSs evidenced by ADRs.
Each ADS represents two ordinary shares from 14 October 2014, before which time one ADS represented five ordinary shares.
The ADS facility is sponsored by Deutsche Bank acting as depositary.
All the ordinary shares, including those held by Directors and Executive Officers, rank pari passu with each other.
On 23 January 2006, the ordinary 2 shares of 12 9p were redenominated as ordinary shares of US 20 cents following approval by shareholders at the Extraordinary General Meeting in December 2005.
The new US Dollar ordinary shares carry the same rights as the previous ordinary shares.
The share price continues to be quoted in Sterling.
In 2006, the Company issued 50,000 of shares in Sterling in order to comply with English law.
These were issued as deferred shares, which are not listed on any stock exchange.
They have extremely limited rights and therefore effectively have no value.
These shares are held by theCompany Secretary, although the Board reserves the right to transfer them to a member of the Board should it so wish.
Shareholdings As at 15 February 2019, to the knowledge of the Group, there were 14,301 registered holders of ordinary shares, of whom 95 had registered addresses in the US and held a total of 185,400 ordinary shares 0.02% of the total issued.
Because certain ordinary shares are registered in thenames of nominees, the number of shareholders with registered addresses in the USA is not representative of the number of beneficial ownersof ordinary shares resident in the US.
As at 15 February 2019, 41,419,215 ADSs equivalent to 82,838,430 ordinary shares or approximately 9.5% of the total ordinary shares in issue, wereoutstanding and were held by 85 registered ADS holders.

Exchange controls and other limitations affecting security holders There are no UK governmental laws, decrees or regulations that restrict the export or import of capital or that affect the payment of dividends, interest or other payments to non-resident holders of Smith & Nephews securities, except for certain restrictions imposed from time to time by HerMajestys Treasury of the United Kingdom pursuant to legislation, such as the United Nations Act 1946 and the Emergency Laws Act 1964, against the Government or residents of certain countries.
There are no limitations, either under the laws of the UK or under the Articles of Association of Smith & Nephew, restricting the right of non-UK residents to hold or to exercise voting rights in respect of ordinary shares, except that where any overseas shareholder has not provided to the Company a UK address for the service of notices, the Company is under no obligation to send any notice or other document to an overseas address.
It is, however, the current practice of the Company to send every notice or other document to all shareholders regardless of the country recorded in the register of members, with the exception of details of the Companys dividend reinvestment plan, which are not sent to shareholders with recorded addresses in the US and Canada.

The Group does not have a legal entity based in Iran, but in 2018 it exported certain medical devices to Iran, via sales by non-US entities, to a privately owned Iranian distributor for sale in Iran.
Sales by the distributor were made to hospitals that we understand are owned or controlled by the Government of Iran.
The Groups direct and indirect sales of US origin medical devices into Iran are permitted pursuant to section 560.530 a 3 i of the Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations, and its indirect sales of non-US origin medical devices into Iran are made in accordance with applicable law.
The Group also provides training to its distributor s and surgeons in Iran as necessary and ordinarily incident to the safe and effective use of the medical devices, which is also permitted by applicable law.
In 2018, S&Ns gross revenues from sales to Iran were approximately US$3.4m and net losses were approximately US$1.1m.
The Group is reporting the entire gross revenues and net profits for the activities described above, which figures include sales of US origin medical devices.
Although the Group is not required to disclose the sales of US origin medical devices because such sales to Iran are licensed under USlaw, the Group is including sales of these devices in its total gross revenue and net profit figures as it does not separately break out revenues and profits by country of origin.
