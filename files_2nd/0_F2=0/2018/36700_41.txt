Bank facility On 24 August 2011, the Company entered into a 40,000,000 multicurrency revolving credit standby facility on an unsecured basis.
In December 2015, the facility was extended by a further three and a half years to 30 June 2019.
In addition, the facility was increased to 80,000,000.
Under the facility agreement, the Company is liable to pay interest on any drawn amount at LIBOR plus a margin of 2.25% to 2.50%, dependent on the loan to value ratio.
A commitment fee of 0.9% p. a. is liable on any undrawn commitment.
The facility was undrawn as at the end of the year.
In March 2019, the facility was extended until 30 June 2022 with the option of adding a further 80 million via an accordion facility, subject to the banks agreement at the time.
Financial risk The following disclosures relating to the risks faced by the Company are provided in accordance with sections 11 and 12 of FRS 102.
The reference to investments in this note is in relation to the Companys direct investments in Asper RPP I LP, Asper RPP II LP, Hg 6E LP and the underlying investments in HGT LP, HGT 6 LP, HGT 7 LP, HGT 8 LP, HgCapital Mercury D LP, HGT Mercury 2 LP, HGT Saturn LP and HGT Transition Capital LP as described in note 3 on page 78.
Financial instruments and risk profile The Companys investment objective is to achieve longterm capital appreciation by indirectly investing in unquoted companies.
It does this through its investments in fund partnerships, mostly in the UK and Europe.
Additionally, the Company holds UK Government securities, cash, liquidity funds and items such as debtors and creditors arising directly from its operations.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction of the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for distribution by way of dividends.
Valuation risk, market risk comprising currency risk and interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk, and the Directors approach to the management of them, are described below.
The Board and Hg coordinate the Companys risk management.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks, and the methods used to manage the risks, that are set out 90 90 below, have not changed from the previous accounting period.
Valuation risk The Companys exposure to valuation risk arises mainly from movements in the value of the underlying investments held through fund partnerships, the majority of which are unquoted.
A breakdown of the Companys portfolio is given on page 39 and a breakdown of the most significant underlying investments is given on page 48.
In accordance with the Companys accounting policies, the investments in fund limited partnerships are valued by reference to their underlying unquoted investments, which are valued by the Directors following the IPEV Valuation Guidelines.
The Company does not hedge against movements in the value of these investments, apart from foreign exchange movements as explained below, though the borrowing arranged to fund these investments is normally denominated in the currency in which the business is operating and valued see page 93.
The Company has exposure to interest rate movements, through bank deposits and liquidity funds.
In the opinion of the Directors, the diversified nature of the Companys investments significantly reduces the risks of investing in unquoted companies.
FRS 102 requires the Company to classify fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
The fair value hierarchy has the following levels: Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1.
Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices level 2.
Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs level 3.
The level in the fair value hierarchy, within which the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety, is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
For this purpose, the significance of an input is assessed against the fair value measurement in its entirety.
If a fair value measurement uses observable inputs that require significant adjustment based on unobservable inputs, that is a level 3 measurement.
Assessing the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgement, considering factors specific to the asset or liability.
The determination of what constitutes an observable input requires significant judgement by the Board.
The Board considers observable data relating to investments actively traded in organised financial markets, in which case fair value is generally determined by reference to stock exchange quoted market bid prices at the close of business on the balance sheet date, without adjustment for transaction costs necessary to realise the asset.

The Company does not adjust the quoted bid price of these investments.
Financial instruments that trade in markets that are not considered to be active, but are valued based on quoted market prices, dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources supported by observable inputs, are classified within level 2.
As level 2 investments include positions that are not traded in active markets and or are subject to transfer restrictions, valuations may be adjusted to reflect illiquidity and or nontransferability, which are generally based on available market information.
HgCapital Trust plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2018 Financial statements Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 19.
Financial risk continued Investments classified within level 3 have significant unobservable inputs.
Level 3 instruments include private equity and corporate debt securities.
As observable prices are not available for these securities, the Board has used valuation techniques to derive the fair value.
In respect of unquoted instruments, or where the market for a financial instrument is not active, fair value is established by using recognised valuation methodologies, in accordance with IPEV Valuation Guidelines.
Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arms length transaction.
There were no transfers of assets from level 1 to level 2 or 3, level 2 to level 1 or 3 and level 3 to level 1 or 2.
The following table presents the movement in level 3 investments for the year ended 31 December 2018 by class of financial instrument.
Total Investments in limited partnerships 2018 000 Unquoted investments: Opening balance 490,976 Purchases 187,338 Realisations at 31 December 2017 valuation 179,458 Unrealised appreciation of fixed asset investments 70,208 Movement in carried interest provision 40,599 Closing unrealised valuation of level 3 investments 609,663 Equity price risk Equity price risk is the risk of a fall in the fair value of the Companys ownership interests comprising equities and 92 92 shareholder loans held by the Company indirectly through its direct investments in fund limited partnerships.
The Board revalues each investment twice each year.
The Board manages the risks inherent in the Companys investment activities by ensuring full and timely access to relevant information from Hg.
The Board meets regularly and at each meeting reviews the trading performance of the principal underlying investments.
If there appears to the Board to be a fair value movement in value between regular valuations, it can revalue the investment.
The Board also monitors Hgs compliance with the Companys investment objective and investment policy.
Hgs best estimate of the effect on the net assets and total return due to a reasonably possible change in the value of all unquoted securities, with all other variables held constant, is as follows: NAV per ordinary Change share % 000 Pence Sensitivity to equity price risk: Unquoted investments 10% 64,919 173.9 Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss in the event that any of the Companys market counterparties fail to fulfil their contractual obligations to the Company.
The Companys financial assets excluding fixed asset investments that are subject to credit risk, were neither impaired nor overdue at the yearend.
The Companys cash balances were held with the Royal Bank of Scotland International and amounts not required for daytoday use were invested in liquidity funds managed by Royal London Asset Management which are rated AAA by Fitch.
Foreign exchange forward contracts and options are held with counterparties which have credit ratings which the Board considers to be adequate.
The Board regularly monitors the credit quality and financial position of these market counterparties.
The credit quality of the above mentioned financial assets was deemed satisfactory.
Market risk The fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate due to changes in market prices of comparable businesses.
This market risk may comprise: currency risk see below, interest rate risk and or equity price risk see above.
The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks.
Hg assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision, and monitors the overall level of market risk across all of the Companys investments on an ongoing basis.
Financial risk continued Currency risk and sensitivity The Company is exposed to currency risk as a result of investing in fund partnerships which invest in companies that operate and are therefore valued in currencies other than sterling.
The value of these assets in sterling, being the Companys functional currency, can be significantly influenced by movements in foreign exchange rates.
Borrowing raised to fund each acquisition in such companies is normally denominated in the currency in which the business is operating and valued, thus limiting the Companys exposure to the value of its investments, rather than the gross enterprise value.
From time to time, the Company is partially hedged against movements in the value of foreign currency against sterling where a movement in exchange rate could affect the value of an investment, as explained below.
Hg monitors the Companys exposure to foreign currencies and reports to the Board on a regular basis.
The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the revenue and capital return for the year in relation to the Companys yearend financial exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates against sterling.
The rates represent the range of movements against sterling over the current year for the currencies listed.
In the opinion of the Directors, the sensitivity analysis below may not be representative of the year as a whole, since the level of exposure changes as the Companys holdings changes through the purchase and realisation of investments to meet the Companys objectives.
Revenue return Capital return NAV per NAV per ordinary ordinary share share 000 Pence 000 Pence Highest value against sterling during the year: Danish krone 8.2009 5 230 0.6 Euro 1.0996 121 0.3 2,429 6.5 93 93 New Zealand dollar 1.8199 104 0.3 Norwegian krone 10.5910 5,924 15.9 Swedish krona 11.0099 Swiss franc 1.2398 US dollar 1.2525 51 0.1 1,893 5.1 Potential gain if sterling depreciates 177 0.4 10,580 28.4 Lowest value against sterling during the year: Danish krone 8.6312 14 613 1.6 Euro 1.1589 355 1.0 7,141 19.1 New Zealand dollar 2.0370 161 0.4 Norwegian krone 11.1601 1,692 4.5 Swedish krona 12.1385 Swiss franc 1.3817 US dollar 1.4330 334 0.9 12,469 33.4 Value at risk if sterling appreciates 703 1.9 22,076 59.0 At 31 December 2018, the following rates were applied to convert foreign denominated assets into sterling: Danish krone 8.3140 : euro 1.1141 : New Zealand dollar 1.8993 : Norwegian krone 11.0284 : Swedish krona 11.2916 : Swiss franc 1.2555 : and US dollar 1.2736.
Hedging At times, the Company uses derivative financial instruments such as forward foreign currency contracts and option contracts to manage the currency risks associated with its underlying investment activities.
The contracts entered into by the Company are denominated in the foreign currency of the geographic areas in which the Company has significant exposure against its reporting currency.
The contracts are used for hedging and the fair values thereof are recorded in the balance sheet as investments held at fair value.
Unrealised gains and losses are taken to capital reserves.
At the balance sheet date, there were no outstanding derivative financial instruments 2017: nil.
The Company does not trade in derivatives but may hold them from time to time to hedge specific exposures with maturities designed to match the exposures they are hedging.
It is the intention to hold both the financial investments giving rise to the exposure and the derivatives hedging them until maturity and therefore no net gain or loss is expected to be realised.
Financial risk continued Derivatives are held at fair value, which represents the replacement cost of the instruments at the balance sheet date.
Movements in the fair value of derivatives are included in the income statement.
The Company does not adopt hedge accounting in the financial statements.
Interest rate risk and sensitivity The Company has exposure to interest rate movements as this may affect the fair value of funds awaiting investment, interest receivable on liquid assets and managed liquidity funds, and interest payable on borrowings.
The Company has little immediate direct exposure to interest rates on its fixed assets, as the majority of the underlying investments are fixed rate loans or equity shares that do not pay interest.
Therefore, and given that the Company has no borrowings and maintains low cash levels, the Companys revenue return is not materially affected by changes in interest rates.
However, funds awaiting investment have been invested in managed liquidity funds and, as stated above, their valuation is affected by movements in interest rates.
The sensitivity of the capital return of the Company to movements in interest rates has been based on the UK base rate.
With all other variables constant, a 0.25% decrease in the UK base rate should increase the capital return in a full year by about 400,000, with a corresponding decrease if the UK base rate were to increase by 0.25%.
In the opinion of the Directors, the above sensitivity analyses may not be representative of the year as a whole, since the level of exposure changes as investments are made and realised throughout the year.
Liquidity risk Investments in unquoted companies, which form the majority of the Companys investments, may not be as readily realisable as investments in quoted companies, which might result in the Company having difficulty in meeting its obligations.
Liquidity risk is currently not significant as 19% of the Companys net assets at the yearend are liquid resources and, in addition, the Company has an 80 million multicurrency undrawn bank facility available.
The Board gives guidance to Hg as to the maximum amount of the Companys resources that should be invested in any one company.
For further details refer to the Companys Investment Policy on page 14.
The fixed and floating rate assets consisted of cash and liquidity funds, of which the underlying investments are a combination of fixed and floating rate.
The noninterestbearing assets represent the investments held in fund limited partnerships, net of the provision for carried interest.
