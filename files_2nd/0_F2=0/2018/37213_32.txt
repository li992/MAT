1.1 Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union effective for accounting periods commencing on or before 1 January 2018 and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Company has adopted IFRS 9, Financial instruments with effect from 1 January 2018.
Under IFRS 9 the Companys classification of financial assets and liabilities is unchanged from those under its previous accounting policies, which are either fair value through profit or loss or amortised cost.

Apart from the adoption of IFRS 9, the accounting policies followed in the Company financial statements are the same as those in the consolidated accounts.
Values are expressed to the nearest 0.1m.

Investment expenses and charges are recognised on an accruals basis.
1.3 Taxation Taxation is based on profits for the year as determined in accordance with the relevant tax legislation, together with adjustments to provisions for prior periods.
Deferred taxation is provided on temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be sufficient taxable profits to utilise carried forward tax losses against which the reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis.
