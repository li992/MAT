At this date, the size of the facility with The Royal Bank of Scotland plc and Lloyds Bank plc was 100m equivalent which, using exchange rates as at 14 November 2014, was redominated to $100m and 46m.
On 21 October 2016, the Company, exercised its right via the accordian facility to increase the option size by 50m equivalent which, using exchange rates as at 21 October 2016, was redominated to $39m and 21m.
The total size of the facility is therefore 150m equivalent redominated to $139m and 67m.
Each individual drawdown bears interest at a variable rate agreed for the period of the drawdown and a commitment fee of 0.94% per annum is payable in respect of the amounts available for drawdown in each denomination.
The Company paid to The Royal Bank of Scotland plc an upfront fee of 900,000 in respect of the 100m facility and 318,000 in respect of the 50m facility both representing 0.90% of the total facility.
These fees are being amortised over the life of the loan.
At 31 May 2018 and 31 May 2017 the loan facility remained fully undrawn.
On 1 June 2018 the Company has agreed a new 175m multi-currency revolving credit facility agreement, arranged by Lloyds Bank plc and NatWest Markets plc.
This will replace the 150m loan facility agreement which was due to expire in November 2018.

Taxation continued Factors That May Affect Future Tax Charges The Company is an investment trust and therefore is not subject to tax on capital gains.
Deferred tax is not provided on capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments because the Company meets and intends to meet for the foreseeable future the conditions for approval as an investment trust company.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of excess management expenses and expenses in excess of taxable income as they will only be recoverable to the extent that there is sufficient future taxable revenue.
As at 31 May 2018, excess management expenses are estimated to be in excess of 165m 31 May 2017: 135m.

Payments under the ALN are made quarterly in arrears and are linked to the ALN share c75% of the net cash flow from a reference portfolio which is comprised of interests held by PIP in over 300 of its oldest private equity funds, substantially 2006 and earlier vintages.
PIP retains the net cash flow relating to the remaining c25% of the reference portfolio.
The ALN is held at fair value through profit or loss and therefore movements in fair value are reflected in the Income Statement.
The Directors do not believe there to be a material own credit risk, due to the fact that repayments are only due when net cash flow is received from the reference portfolio.
Fair value is calculated as the sum of the ALN share of fair value of the reference portfolio plus the ALN share of undistributed net cash flow which is equivalent to the amount which would be required to be repaid had the ALN matured on 31 May 2018.
Therefore no fair value movement has occurred during the year as a result of changes to credit risk.
A pro rata share of the Companys Total Ongoing Charges is allocated to the ALN, reducing each quarterly payment the Expense Charge and deducted from Other Expenses in the Income Statement.
The ALNs share of net cash flow is calculated after withholding taxation suffered.
These amounts are deducted from Taxation in the Income Statement.
During the year, the Company made repayments totaling 77.1m, representing the ALN share of net cash flow for the nine month period to 28 February 2018.
The fair value of the ALN at 31 May 2018 was 131.6m, of which 16.5m represents the net cash flow for the three months to 31 May 2018, due for repayment on 31 August 2018.
This amount has therefore been transferred to amounts due within one year see Note 12.

Further detail of the available finance cover is provided in Note 19.
Analysis of Financial Assets and Liabilities The primary investment objective of the Company is to seek to maximise long-term capital growth for its shareholders by investing in funds specialising in unquoted investments, acquiring unquoted portfolios and participating directly in private placements.
Investments are not restricted to a single market but are made when the opportunity arises and on an international basis.
The Companys financial instruments comprise securities and other investments, cash balances and debtors and creditors that arise from its operations, for example sales and purchases awaiting settlement and debtors for accrued income.
The principal risks the Company faces in its portfolio management activities are: Liquidity marketability risk: Interest rate risk: Market price risk: and Foreign currency risk.
The Company has little exposure to credit risk.
The Manager monitors the financial risks affecting the Company on a daily basis and the Directors regularly receive financial information, which is used to identify and monitor risk.
In accordance with FRS 102 an analysis of financial assets and liabilities, which identifies the risk to the Company of holding such items, is given below.
Pantheon International Plc 106 Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 19.
Analysis of Financial Assets and Liabilities continued Liquidity Risk Due to the nature of the Companys investment policy, the largest proportion of the portfolio is invested in unquoted securities, many of which are less readily marketable than, for example, blue-chip UK equities.
The Directors believe that the Company, as a closed-end fund with no fixed wind-up date, is ideally suited to making long-term investments in instruments with limited marketability.
The investments in unquoted securities are monitored by the Board on a regular basis.
There are times when opportunities for the Company to acquire secondary unquoted portfolios of interests or co-investments may be limited due to the cyclical nature of their occurrence.
As a result, at times of low investment opportunity, some funds may be held on deposit or invested in gilts and other fixed interest government bonds.
It is the nature of investment in private equity that a commitment see Note 18 for outstanding commitments as at 31 May 2018 to invest will be made and that calls for payments will then be received from the unlisted investee entity.
These payments are usually on an ad-hoc basis and may be called at any instance over a number of years.
The Companys ability to meet these commitments is dependent upon it receiving cash distributions from its private equity investments and, to the extent these are insufficient, on the availability of financing facilities.
In order to cover any shortfalls, the Company entered into a multi-currency revolving credit facility with The Royal Bank of Scotland plc and Lloyds Bank plc and comprising facilities of $139m and 67m of which at 31 May 2018 the sterling equivalent of nil 31 May 2017: nil was drawn down see Note 6 for further information.
On 1 June 2018, the Company agreed a new 175m multi-currency revolving credit facility agreement, arranged by Lloyds Bank plc and NatWest Markets plc.
The principal covenant that applies to the loan facility is that gross borrowings do not exceed 30% of adjusted gross asset value.
Total available financing as at 31 May 2018 stood at 308.6m 31 May 2017: 332.8m, comprising 145.8m excluding the short term ALN creditor 31 May 2017: 167.3m in cash balances and 162.8m 31 May 2017: 165.5m sterling equivalent in undrawn bank facilities.
The available financing along with the private equity portfolio exceeded the outstanding commitments by 3.6 times 31 May 2017: 3.5 times.
Interest Rate Risk The Company may use gearing to achieve its investment objectives and manage cash flows and uses a multi-currency revolving credit facility for this purpose.
Interest on the revolving credit facility is payable at variable rates determined subject to drawdown.
Variable rates are defined as LIBOR or EURIBOR 2.35%, dependent on the currency drawn.
The interest rate is then fixed for the duration that the loan is drawn down.
At 31 May 2018 there was the sterling equivalent of nil funds drawn down on the loan facilities 31 May 2017: nil.
A commitment fee of 0.94% per annum is payable in respect of the amounts available for drawdown in each facility.

Analysis of Financial Assets and Liabilities continued Non-interest rate exposure The remainder of the Companys portfolio and current assets are not subject to interest rate risks.
Financial assets for 2018 and 2017 consisted of investments, cash and debtors excluding prepayments.
As at 31 May 2018, the interest rate risk and maturity profile of the Companys financial assets was as follows: Fixed interest No maturity Matures Matures average Total date within 1 year after 1 year interest rate 31 May 2018 000 000 000 000 % Fair value no interest rate risk financial assets Sterling 58,993 58,993 US dollar 1,109,499 1,109,499 Euro 241,035 241,035 Other 29,347 29,347 1,438,874 1,438,874 The interest rate and maturity profile of the Companys financial assets as at 31 May 2017 was as follows: Fixed interest No maturity Matures Matures average Total date within 1 year after 1 year interest rate 31 MAY 2017 000 000 000 000 % Fair value no interest rate risk financial assets Sterling 63,196 63,196 US dollar 1,081,502 1,081,502 Euro 218,090 218,090 Other 29,620 29,620 1,392,408 1,392,408 Financial Liabilities At 31 May 2018 the Company had drawn the sterling equivalent of nil 31 May 2017: nil of its four-year committed revolving dollar and euro credit facilities, expiring November 2018, of $139m and 67m respectively with The Royal Bank of Scotland plc and Lloyds TSB Bank plc.
Interest is incurred at a variable rate as agreed at the time of drawdown and is payable at the maturity date of each advance.
At the year end, interest of nil 31 May 2017: nil was accruing.
At 31 May 2018 and 31 May 2017, other than the ALN, all financial liabilities were due within one year and comprised short-term creditors.
The ALN is repayable by no later than 31 August 2027.
Pantheon International Plc 108 Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 19.
Analysis of Financial Assets and Liabilities continued Market Price Risk The method of valuation of the fixed asset investments is described in Note 1 D on page 92.
The nature of the Companys fixed asset investments, with a high proportion of the portfolio invested in unquoted securities, means that the investments are valued by the Directors after due consideration of the most recent available information from the underlying investments.
PIPs portfolio is well diversified by the sectors in which the underlying companies operate.
This sectoral diversification helps to mitigate the effects of cyclical trends within particular industry segments.
If the investment portfolio fell by 20% from the 31 May 2018 valuation, with all other variables held constant, there would have been a reduction of 254,958,000 31 May 2017 based on a fall of 20%: 244,828,000 in the return before taxation.
An increase of 20% would have increased the return before taxation by an equal and opposite amount.
Foreign Currency Risk Since it is the Companys policy to invest in a diverse portfolio of investments based in a number of countries, the Company is exposed to the risk of movement in a number of foreign exchange rates.
A geographical analysis of the portfolio and hence its exposure to currency risk is given on page 6 and in Note 9b.
Although it is permitted to do so, the Company did not hedge the portfolio against the movement in exchange rates during the financial period.
The investment approach and the Managers consideration of the associated risk are discussed in further detail in the Strategic Report on pages 20 to 22 and the Managers Review on pages 24 to 57.
The Company settles its transactions from its bank accounts at an agreed rate of exchange at the date on which the bargain was made.
As at 31 May 2018, realised exchange gains of 353,000 31 May 2017: realised exchange losses of 159,000 and realised losses relating to currency of 2,282,000 31 May 2017: realised gains of 2,548,000 have been taken to the capital reserve.
The Companys exposure to foreign currency excluding private equity investments is shown below.
In relation to this exposure, if the sterling dollar and sterling euro exchange rate had reduced by 10% from that obtained at 31 May 2018, it would have the effect, with all other variables held constant, of increasing equity shareholders funds by 13,592,000 31 May 2017: 10,787,000.
If there had been an increase in the sterling dollar and sterling euro exchange rate of 10% it would have the effect of decreasing equity shareholders funds by 12,686,000 31 May 2017: 16,440,000.
The calculations are based on the financial assets and liabilities and the exchange rate as at 31 May 2018 of 1.33035 31 May 2017: 1.26735 sterling dollar and 1.13945 31 May 2017: 1.13135 sterling euro.
The Companys investment currency exposure is disclosed in Note 9b.

Analysis of Financial Assets and Liabilities continued Fair Value of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities The financial assets of the Company are held at fair value.
Financial liabilities, other than the ALN, are held at amortised cost, which is not materially different from fair value.
For details of the ALN, see Note 13.
Managing Capital The Companys equity comprises ordinary shares as described in Note 14.
Capital is managed so as to maximise the return to shareholders while maintaining a capital base that allows the Company to operate effectively in the marketplace and sustain future development of the business.
As at 31 May 2018 and 31 May 2017 the Company had bank debt facilities to increase the Companys liquidity.
Details of available borrowings at the year end can be found earlier in this Note.
The Companys assets and borrowing levels are reviewed regularly by the Board with reference to the loan covenants.
The Companys capital requirement is reviewed regularly by the Board.
Transactions with the Manager and Related Parties The amounts paid to the Manager, together with the details of the Investment Management Agreement, are disclosed in Note 3.
The existence of an independent Board of Directors demonstrates that the Company is free to pursue its own financial and operating policies and therefore, under the AIC SORP, the Manager is not considered to be a related party.
The Companys related parties are its Directors.
Fees paid to the Companys Board are disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 76 to 79.
The Companys National Insurance contribution in relation to Directors remuneration is disclosed in Note 4.
There are no other identifiable related parties at the year end.
Post balance sheet events On 4 June 2018, the Company announced it had agreed a new 175m multi-currency revolving credit facility agreement dated 1 June 2018 Loan Facility, arranged by Lloyds Bank plc and NatWest Markets plc.
This replaces the 150m loan facility agreement which was due to expire in November 2018, as per Note 6.
The new 175m four-year Loan Facility has been redenominated using current exchange rates to $163.0m and 59.8m.
The terms of the new facility are materially the same as those of the existing facility but will expire in June 2022 with an option to extend, by agreement, the maturity date by another year.
PIPs mature portfolio, which at the year end was reported to have an average fund vintage maturity of 5.7 years, is in a cash-generative phase.
The Company expects to continue to finance its new investments and meet its unfunded commitments, amounting to 440m as at 31 May 2018, principally from internally generated cash resources.
As at 31 May 2018, PIP had available cash balances of 145.8m excluding the short term ALN creditor.
Therefore, based on current exchange rates, PIPs total liquid financial resources, taking into account the terms of the new Loan Facility and 31 May 2018 available cash balances, are equivalent to 320.8m.
The new Loan Facility provides a margin of additional assurance that the Company has the ability to finance its unfunded commitments in the future.
