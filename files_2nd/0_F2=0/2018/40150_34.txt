Each cash generating unit is an operational division.
The UK Bus regional operations and UKBus London cash generating units operate coach and bus services in the United Kingdom.
The North America cash generating unit operates coach and bus services in the US and Canada.
No goodwill has been allocated to the Groups UK rail operations.
The cash generating units are as follows: UKBus UK Bus regional operations London North America 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 m m m m m m Carrying amount of goodwill 47.5 47.5 3.6 3.6 91.0 97.1 Basis on which recoverable amount has been determined Value in use Value in use Value in use Value in use Value in use Value in use Period covered by approved management plans used in value in use calculation 5 years 5 years 5 years 5 years 4 years 5 years Pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections 8.7% 8.6% 8.7% 8.6% 9.4% 10.1% Growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond period of management plan 2.4% 2.1% 2.4% 2.1% 3.9% 3.7% Difference between above growth rate and long-term average growth rate for market in which unit operates Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil The calculation of value in use for each cash generating unit shown above is most sensitive to the assumptions on discount rates and growth rates and in the case of UKBus London, the number of new contracts won and the commercial terms of such contracts.
The assumptions used are considered to be consistent with past experience and external sources of information and to be realistically achievable in light of economic and industry measures and forecasts.
The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group are set out in section 1.4.
The cost base of the UK Bus regional operations and North American operations can be flexed in response to changes in revenue and there is scope to reduce capital expenditure in the medium-term if other cash flows deteriorate.
Risks to the cash flow forecasts remain, however, and are described in section 1.4.
The cost base of UK Bus London is less flexible because the business is contractually committed to operate the majority of its services.
The discount rates have been determined with reference to the estimated post-tax Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC of the Group.
The pre-tax discount rate for each CGU has been determined by adjusting the Groups WACC for the risk profile and effects of tax on each of the relevant CGUs.
NorthAmerica impairment is identified in note 1 as a key source of estimation uncertainty.
The financial performance of the North America Division has been less favourable than was assumed in estimating its value in use as at 29 April 2017.
On the other hand, the Division has growth plans in place that are reflected in its forecast cash flows from 29 April 2018 and since 29 April 2017, the pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections has been reduced to reflect that the corporate tax rate in the US has been decreased.
The value in use as at 28 April 2018 has been estimated to exceed the carrying value of the Divisions non-current assets.
However, there are alternative but still reasonably possible assumptions that when applied result in a value in use estimate below carrying value.
The most critical estimates relate to the forecast growth in the Divisions earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation over the next few years, the discount rate and the rate of long-term growth in the Divisions net cash flows.
The carrying value of non-current assets as at 28 April 2018 was 363.6m US$501.7m and the estimated value in use was 499.4m US$689.0m but alternative assumptions could result in a material impairment loss and it is possible that such a loss could arise within the next year.
As at 28 April 2018, the value in use of the North America Division exceeds its carrying amount by 135.8m.
Our sensitivity analysis indicates that this headroom would be eliminated if the assumed long-term growth rate fell by more than 290 basis points, or if the discount rate were to increase by more than 220 basis points.
The Directors believe that there is no impairment to any of the CGUs.
