Annual Report 2018 Great Portland Estates 169 24 Employee benefits continued Virtually all equity and debt instruments have quoted prices in active markets.
The fair value of the Plan assets at the balance sheet date is analysed as follows: 2018 2017 m m Cash 0.5 0.1 Equities 13.7 14.1 Bonds 20.8 19.9 35.0 34.1 Other than market and demographic risks, which are common to all retirement benefit schemes, there are no specific risks in the relevant benefit schemes which the Group considers to be significant or unusual.
Detail on two of the more specific risks is detailed below: Changes in bond yields Falling bond yields tend to increase the funding and accounting liabilities.
However, the investment in corporate and government bonds offers a degree of matching, i. e. the movement in assets arising from changes in bond yields partially matches the movement in the funding or accounting liabilities.
In this way, the exposure to movements in bond yields is reduced.
Life expectancy The majority of the obligations are to provide a pension for the life of the member on retirement, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.
The inflation-linked nature of the majority of benefit payments increases the sensitivity of the liabilities to changes in life expectancy.
The effect on the defined benefit obligation of changing the key assumptions, calculated using approximate methods based on historical trends, is set out below: 2018 2017 m m Discount rate -0.25% 36.3 42.0 Discount rate 0.25% 32.9 37.9 RPI inflation -0.25% 33.7 38.9 RPI inflation 0.25% 35.3 40.9 Post-retirement mortality assumption -1 year 36.0 41.5 The Group expects to contribute 0.8 million to the Plan in the year ending 31 March 2019.
The expected total benefit payments for the year ending 31 March 2019 is 0.6 million, with 4.5 million expected to be paid over the next five years.
A revised funding plan has been agreed committing the Group to cash combinations of 347,000 p. a. over five years as well as a contribution rate of 46.8% p. a. of member pensionable salaries to eliminate any funding shortfalls and the ongoing benefit accrual.
