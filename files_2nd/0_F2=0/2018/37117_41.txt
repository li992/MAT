Acquisitions Business Combinations The Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when control is transferred to the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect the returns through its power over the entity.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.
The consideration transferred in the acquisition is generally measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired.
Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment.
The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships.
Such amounts are generally recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition.
If an obligation to pay contingent consideration that meets the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity, then it is not remeasured and the settlement is accounted for within equity.
Otherwise, subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The valuation techniques used for measuring the fair value of material assets acquired are as follows: Property, plant and equipment Depreciated replacement cost reflecting adjustments for physical deterioration as well as functional and economic obsolescence.
Intangible assets The relief from royalty method considers the discounted estimated royalty payments that are expected to be avoided as a result of the intangible assets being owned.
Inventories The fair value is determined based on the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and sale, and a reasonable profit margin based on the effort required to sell the inventories.
