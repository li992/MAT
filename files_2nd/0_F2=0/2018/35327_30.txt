Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 0107 0847 4892 93172 167 Share-based payment transactions Directors of the Company receive an element of remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services as consideration for equity instruments.
The awards vest when certain performance and or service conditions are met: see the Directors Remuneration Report for the individual vesting conditions for the various schemes.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award.
Fair value is determined by an external value using an appropriate pricing model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company market conditions.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired, managements best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions and the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest or, in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described above.
The movement in the cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry into equity.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, the cost based on the original award terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period.
In addition, an expense is recognised over the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modification, based on the difference between the fair value of the original award and the fair value of the modified award, both as measured on the date of the modification.
No reduction is recognised if this difference is negative.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised in the income statement for the award is expensed immediately.
Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation or settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the profit and loss account.
The Company recharges the cost of equity-settled transactions to the respective employing entity, with a corresponding increase in equity and investment in subsidiary undertakings booked with Dominos Pizza Group plc.
Other financial assets The Market Access Fee is classified as a non-current other financial asset and is measured at fair value.
Changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss.
Provisions for liabilities A provision is recognised where the Company has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Reversionary share plan Certain of the Groups historical share-based compensation arrangements dating from 2003-2010 involve a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of their employment tax treatment.
HMRC issued protective assessments in respect of potential employment tax relating to these historical schemes and as a result of further advice received in January 2018 a provision has been recorded in the prior year for the 53 weeks ended 31 December 2017.
For details see note 2 of the Group accounts.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the Company becomes party to the related contracts and are measured initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance revenue and finance cost.
Adoption of new standards and revised standards The impact of the adoption of IFRS 15 and IFRS 9 on the Group accounts has been set out in note 2 aa and 2 z of the Group accounts.
The adoption of these standards had no material impact on the financial statements of the Company.
