The STraTegic reporT governance Financial STaTemenTS addiTional inFormaTion Weve recognised a deferred tax asset at 31 March 2018 of 92m in respect of EE Limiteds historical tax losses.
We expect to be able to utilise these against future taxable profits in EE Limited.
If EE Limiteds business had been subject to a major change in the nature or conduct of trade on or before 5 February 2018, these losses would have been forfeited and a current tax liability of 382m would have been created.
We do not consider it probable that major change arose.
Deferred tax balances for which there is a right of offset within the same jurisdiction are presented net on the face of the group balance sheet as permitted by IAS 12, with the exception of deferred tax related to our pension schemes which is disclosed within deferred tax assets.
What factors affect our future tax charges?
The rate of UK corporation tax will change from 19% to 17% on 1 April 2020.
As deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the rates that are expected to apply in the periods of the reversal, deferred tax balances at 31 March 2018 have been calculated at the rate at which the relevant balance is expected to be recovered or settled.
The impact of the reduction in rate was recognised as a deferred tax credit specific item of 63m in the 2016 17 income statement and as a deferred tax expense in reserves.
What are our unrecognised tax losses and other temporary differences?
At 31 March 2018 we had operating losses and other temporary differences carried forward in respect of which no deferred tax assets were recognised amounting to 4.1bn 2016 17: 4.4bn.
Our other temporary differences have no expiry date restrictions.
The expiry date of operating losses carried forward is dependent upon the tax law of the various territories in which the losses arose.
A summary of expiry dates for losses in respect of which restrictions apply is set out below: At 31 March 2018 m Expiry Restricted losses Europe 14 20192027 Americas 204 2019-2037 Other 2 20192027 Total restricted losses 220 Unrestricted operating losses 3,784 No expiry Other temporary differences 77 No expiry Total 4,081 At 31 March 2018 we had UK capital losses carried forward in respect of which no deferred tax assets were recognised amounting to 16.9bn 2016 17: 17.0bn.
These losses have no expiry date, but we consider the future utilisation of these losses to be remote.
At 31 March 2018 the undistributed earnings of non-UK subsidiaries were 2.4bn 2016 17: 3.5bn.
No deferred tax liabilities have been recognised in respect of these unremitted earnings because the group is in a position to control the timing of any dividends from subsidiaries and hence any tax consequences that may arise.
Under current tax rules, tax of 23.0m 2016 17: 26.2m would arise if these earnings were to be repatriated to the UK.
On 29 March 2017, the UK Government notified the EU of its intention to withdraw membership from the EU.
Depending on the outcome of negotiations we could cease to benefit from the EU Parent Subsidiary directive on dividends paid by our EU subsidiaries.
In this event, additional tax of up to 23.9m could arise if the undistributed earnings of EU subsidiaries of 940m were to be repatriated to the UK.
Dividends What dividends have been paid and proposed for the year?
No dividend was paid to the parent company, BT Group Investments Limited, during 2017 18 2016 17: 2,350m, 2015 16: 1,450m.
Subsequent to 31 March 2018 the directors have declared a final dividend of 2,500m payable in 2018 19 2016 17: nil, 2015 16: 2,350m.
