Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information | 175 KPIs and reconciliations Combined operating ratio reconciliation The following tables reconcile the Groups acquisition costs and other expenses to the combined costs and operating expenses used to calculate the combined operating ratio and its two component measures: expense ratio and loss ratio.
The combined operating ratio is the primary indicator used to measure overall performance of the Underwriting business and shows the amount of each premium spent on either indemnity costs the loss ratio or underwriting operating expenses the expense ratio.
The combined operating ratio is therefore a measure of underwriting profitability.
During the year, there were changes in the commercial terms of certain reinsurance contracts that altered the earning of certain reinsurance commissions without changing the underlying results or net impact in profit or loss.
As a result, the Group amended the calculation of the expense ratio to reflect the reinsurers share of attributable underwriting expenses recovered through commission, direct cost contributions or other profit share arrangements.
The change had no impact on the previously disclosed ratios.
