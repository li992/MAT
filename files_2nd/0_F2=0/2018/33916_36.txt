AVEVA Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 142 Notes to the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements 1 Basis of preparation The pro forma financial information of the AVEVA enlarged group which follows is unaudited and does not constitute financial statements within the meaning of Section 434 of the Companies Act 2006.
The unaudited pro forma financial information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only, and because of its nature addresses a hypothetical situation.
It therefore does not represent the enlarged Groups actual results, and does not purport to represent what the combined results would have been.
The information is presented in Pounds Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand 000 except when otherwise indicated.
2 Adjustments and assumptions The unaudited pro forma combined income statements for the years ended 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2018 have been prepared on the following basis: The financial information is the combination of the consolidated financial statements of AVEVA Group plc and the Schneider Electric software business for the years to 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2018.
No pro forma adjustments have been made to reflect synergies or cost savings that may be expected to occur as a result of the acquisition, nor have any adjustments been made to reflect the stand alone costs expected.
There has been no trading between the two groups for either of the years presented.

Of this, 24,954,000 was incurred by AVEVA Group and 4,576,000 by the Schneider Electric software business.
The restructuring costs related to severance payments within the Schneider Electric software business in a number of global office locations prior to the combination.
In addition, a divestment made by the Schneider Electric software business in China resulted in an exceptional write off of 858,000, offset by an exceptional gain of 1,866,000 made by selling the property relating to the same write off.
The movement in the sales tax provision related to the partial release of the provision following a reassessment of the liability.
The impairment of capitalised R&D related to a development project that was ceased, prior to completion, following a divestment of a Schneider Electric Software joint venture operation with Schneider Electric.
Also included are the previously capitalised development costs related to a project.
Further to a commercial review of the project and the financial prospects for the developed technology, it was concluded that the carrying value of the development costs should be fully impaired.
