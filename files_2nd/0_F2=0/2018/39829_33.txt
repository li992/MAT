15 Earnings per share a Basic and diluted earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding treasury shares and those held in the Severn Trent Employee Share Ownership Trust, which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing and discontinued operations are calculated on the basis of profit from continuing and discontinued operations attributable to the equity holders of the company.
The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data: i Earnings for the purpose of basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 2018 2017 restated m m Profit for the period attributable to owners of the company 253.7 342.8 Adjusted for profit from discontinued operations attributable to owners of the company see note 39 13.2 21.3 Profit for the period from continuing operations attributable to owners of the company 240.5 321.5 ii Number of shares 2018 2017 m m Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of basic earnings per share 235.3 235.0 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares: share options and LTIPs 0.8 1.0 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of diluted earnings per share 236.1 236.0 160 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Company financial statements Other information 15 Earnings per share continued b Underlying earnings per share 2018 2017 restated pence pence Underlying basic earnings per share 121.0 115.7 Underlying diluted earnings per share 120.6 115.2 Underlying earnings per share figures are presented for continuing operations.
These exclude the effects of deferred tax, exceptional tax, losses on financial instruments, current tax related to losses on financial instruments, exceptional items and current tax related to exceptional items.
The directors consider that the adjusted figures provide a useful additional indicator of performance.
The denominators used in the calculations of adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share are the same as those used in the unadjusted figures set out above.
The adjustments to earnings that are made in calculating underlying earnings per share are as follows: 2018 2017 restated m m Earnings for the purpose of basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 240.5 321.5 Adjustments for: exceptional items before tax 12.6 16.6 current tax related to exceptional items 0.7 0.1 net losses on financial instruments 6.7 1.8 current tax on net losses on financial instruments 3.3 4.9 exceptional current tax 16.4 deferred tax 29.0 13.4 Earnings for the purpose of underlying basic and diluted earnings per share 284.8 271.9 16 Goodwill 2018 2017 m m Cost At 1 April 81.0 18.2 Acquisition of subsidiary 66.0 Disposal of subsidiaries 14.4 5.4 Exchange adjustments 0.6 2.2 Additional consideration in respect of acquisition 0.2 Adjustment to provisional fair values on acquisition note 38 4.0 At 31 March 62.2 81.0 Goodwill is allocated to the groups cash-generating units CGUs identified according to country of operation and business segment.
A summary of the goodwill allocation by CGU is presented below.
2018 2017 m m Dee Valley Water 62.2 66.0 Operating Services US 15.0 62.2 81.0 Dee Valley Water also has an intangible asset with indefinite useful life amounting to 4.3 million 2017: nil.
The group has reviewed the carrying value of goodwill for impairment in accordance with the policy stated in note 2 k. The carrying value of the Dee Valley Water CGU was determined on the basis of value in use in the current and prior years.
The Operating Services US CGU was sold on 30 June 2017.
The value in use calculation for the Dee Valley Water CGU is based on the most recent financial projections available for the business, which cover the remainder of the current AMP period to 2020 and the following AMP period, which runs to 31 March 2025.
As a regulated water company, Dee Valley Waters revenues and costs are significantly influenced by the regulatory settlement for each AMP period so management considers it appropriate for the detailed projections to be coterminous with the AMP period.
Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 161 Group financial statements Notes to the group financial statements continued For the year ended 31 March 2018 16 Goodwill continued The net cash flows for the current AMP period are based on existing operations and Dee Valley Waters business plan, adjusted for the synergies arising from the acquisition by Severn Trent, to the extent that they will be realised in Dee Valley Water.
The net cash flows in the following AMP period have been reduced to reflect the lower weighted average cost of capital proposed by Ofwat in its PR19 methodology.
The key assumptions underlying these projections are: Key assumption % Discount rate 6.3 RPI inflation 3.0 CPI inflation 2.0 Growth rate in the period beyond the detailed projections 2.5 The discount rate was an estimate for the weighted average cost of capital at the year end date based on the market rate for the cost of debt and the cost of equity included in the Dee Valley Water Final Determination for AMP6 adjusted to take account of risks already reflected in the cash flows for AMP7 and beyond.
This post-tax rate was converted to the equivalent pre-tax rate discount rate above.
Inflation has been included in the detailed projections at 3% and 2% for RPI and CPI respectively based on the Bank of Englands target rate for CPI.
Cash flows beyond the end of the seven year period are extrapolated using an assumption of zero real growth and an estimate of 2.5% for long-term inflation combination of CPI and RPI.
The value in use for the CGU exceeded its carrying value by 15.6 million.
The value in use is most sensitive to the assumption relating to the growth rate outside the five year period.
If the growth rate assumption were reduced to 2.2% this would cause the CGUs carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount under the revised assumption.

The Severn Trent Pension Scheme and the Severn Trent Mirror Image Pension Scheme closed to future accrual on 31 March 2015, while the Dee Valley Water Limited Section of the Water Companies Pension Scheme, which is a sectionalised scheme, currently remains open to accrual.
The defined benefit pension schemes cover increases in accrued benefits arising from inflation and pension increases.
Their assets are held in separate funds administered by trustees.
The trustees are required to act in the best interests of the schemes beneficiaries.
A formal actuarial valuation of each scheme is carried out on behalf of the trustees at triennial intervals by an independent professionally qualified actuary.
Under the defined benefit pension schemes, members are entitled to retirement benefits calculated by reference to their pensionable service and pensionable salary history, with inflationary pension increases applying in line with the scheme rules.
The UK defined benefit pension schemes and the dates of their last completed formal actuarial valuations as at the accounting date are as follows: Date of last formal actuarial valuation Severn Trent Pension Scheme STPS 31 March 2016 Severn Trent Mirror Image Pension Scheme STMIPS 31 March 2016 Water Companies Pension Scheme Dee Valley Water Limited Section DVWS 31 March 2017 The STPS is by far the largest of the groups UK defined benefit schemes, comprising over 90% of the groups overall defined benefit obligations.

Provision for such benefits amounting to 8.7 million 2017: 10.5 million is included as an unfunded scheme within the retirement benefit obligation.
The group has assessed that is has an unconditional right to a refund of any surplus assets in each of the Schemes following settlement of all obligations to scheme members and therefore the surplus in DVWS has been recognised in full.

Actuarial gains and losses have been reported in the statement of comprehensive income.
iv Actuarial risk factors The Schemes typically expose the group to actuarial risks such as investment risk, inflation risk and longevity risk.
Investment risk The groups contributions to the Schemes are based on actuarial calculations which make assumptions about the returns expected from the Schemes investments.
If the investments underperform these assumptions in the long term then the group may need to make additional contributions to the Schemes in order to fund the payment of accrued benefits.
Each plans investment strategy seeks to balance the level of investment return sought with the aim of reducing volatility and risk.
In undertaking this approach, reference is made to both the maturity of liabilities and the funding level of that plan.
A number of further strategies are employed to manage underlying risks, including liability matching asset strategies, diversification of asset portfolios and interest rate hedging.
Currently the plan has a balanced approach to investment in equity securities, debt instruments and real estates.
Due to the long term nature of the plan liabilities, the Trustees consider it appropriate to invest a portion of the plan assets in equity securities and in real estate to leverage the return generated by the fund.
Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 171 Group financial statements Notes to the group financial statements continued For the year ended 31 March 2018 28 Retirement benefit schemes continued a Defined benefit pension schemes continued iv Actuarial risk factors continued Inflation risk The benefits payable to members of the Schemes are linked to inflation measured by the RPI or CPI, subject to caps.
The groups contributions to the Schemes are based on assumptions about the future level of inflation.
If inflation is higher than the levels assumed in the actuarial calculations then the group may need to make additional contributions to the Schemes in order to fund thepayment of accrued benefits.
The Schemes use Liability Driven Investment LDI within the asset portfolios to hedge against the value of liabilities changing as a result of movements in long-term interest rate and inflation expectations.
This structure allows the Schemes to both hedge against these risks and retain capital investment in assets that are expected to generate higher returns.
Longevity risk The groups contributions to the Schemes are based on assumptions about the life expectancy of Scheme members after retirement.
If Scheme members live longer than assumed in the actuarial calculations then the group may need to make additional contributions to the Schemes in order to fund the payment of accrued benefits.
v Actuarial assumptions The major financial assumptions used in the accounting valuation of the obligations for the STPS, which represents by far the largest defined benefit obligation for the group, were as follows: 2018 2017 % % Price inflation RPI 3.1 3.1 Price inflation CPI 2.1 2.1 Discount rate 2.7 2.7 Pension increases in payment 3.1 3.1 Pension increases in deferment 3.1 3.1 The assumption for price inflation is derived from the difference between the yields on longer term fixed rate gilts and on index-linked gilts.
In setting our discount rate, we construct a yield curve.
Short-dated yields are taken from market rates for AA corporate bonds.
Longdated yields for the curve are based on the average yield available on all long-dated AA corporate bonds.
We project the expected cash flows of the schemes and adopt a single equivalent cash flow weighted discount rate based on this constructed yield curve.
The mortality assumptions are based on those used in the latest triennial funding valuations.
The mortality assumptions adopted at the year end for accounting purposes and the life expectancies at age 65 implied by the assumptions are as follows for the STPS: 2018 2017 Men Women Men Women Mortality table used S2NMA S2NFA S2NMA S2NFA Mortality table compared with standard table 95% 99% 95% 99% Mortality projections CMI 2017 CMI 2017 CMI 2016 CMI 2016 Future improvement per annum 1.0% 1.0% 1.0% 1.0% Remaining life expectancy for members currently aged 65 years 22.4 24.1 22.5 24.1 Remaining life expectancy at age 65 for members currently aged 45 years 23.4 25.3 23.6 25.3 The calculation of the scheme obligations is sensitive to the actuarial assumptions and in particular to the assumptions relating to discount rate, price inflation capped, where relevant and mortality.
The following table summarises the estimated impact on the groups obligations from changes to key actuarial assumptions whilst holding all other assumptions constant.
172 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Company financial statements Other information 28 Retirement benefit schemes continued a Defined benefit pension schemes continued v Actuarial assumptions continued Assumption Change in assumption Impact on disclosed obligations 1 Discount rate Increase decrease by 0.1% p. a.
Decrease increase by 48 million 2 Price inflation Increase decrease by 0.1% p. a.
Increase decrease by 43 million 3 Mortality Increase in life expectancy by 1 year Increase by 107 million 1 A change in discount rate is likely to occur as a result of changes in bond yield and as such would be expected to be offset to a significant degree by a change in the value of the bond assets held by the plans.
2 The projected impact resulting from a change in RPI reflects the underlying effect on pensions in payment, pensions in deferment and resultant increases in salary assumptions.
3 The change in assumption is based on triennial valuations and reflect the fact that life expectancy rates are expected to increase.
In reality, interrelationships exist between the assumptions, particularly between the discount rate and price inflation.
The above analysis does not take into account the effect of these interrelationships.
Also, in practice any movement in obligations arising from assumption changes are likely to be accompanied by movements in asset values and so the impact on the accounting deficit may belower than the impact on the obligations shown above.
In presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the balance sheet.
vi Effect on future cash flows Contribution rates are set in consultation with the trustees for each scheme and each participating employer.
The average duration of the benefit obligation at the end of the year is 17 years for STPS and STMIPS 2017: 20 years and 16 years for DVWS 2017: 17 years.
The most recent completed formal triennial actuarial valuations and funding agreements were carried out as at 31 March 2016 for the STPS and STMIPS schemes and 31 March 2017 for DVWS.
As a result of the STPS and STMIPS actuarial valuations, deficit reduction contributions of 25 million were paid in the year ended 31 March 2017 and 10 million for each of the subsequent financial years ending 31 March 2019 were agreed.
Payments of 8 million per annum through an asset-backed funding arrangement will continue to 31 March 2032.
Further inflation-linked payments of 15 million per annum are being made through an additional asset-backed funding arrangement, with payments having started in the financial year ended 31 March 2018 and continuing to 31 March 2031.
These contributions will cease earlier should a subsequent valuation of the STPS show that these contributions are no longer needed.
b Defined contribution pension schemes The group also operates the Severn Trent Group Personal Pension, a defined contribution scheme, for certain of its UK employees.
Dee Valley Water operates two defined contribution pension schemes, neither of which were material in either the current or prior year.
The total cost charged to operating costs of 20.3 million 2017 restated: 20.9 million represents contributions payable to these schemes by the group at rates specified in the rules of the scheme.
As at 31 March 2018, no contributions 2017: 2.2 million inrespect of the current reporting period were owed to the schemes.

The hedging reserve arises from gains or losses on interest rate swaps taken directly to equity under the hedge accounting provisions of IAS 39 and the transition rules of IFRS 1.
33 Capital management The groups principal objectives in managing capital are: to access a broad range of sources of finance to obtain both the quantum required and lowest cost compatible with the need forcontinued availability: to manage exposure to movements in interest rates to provide an appropriate degree of certainty as to its cost of funds: to minimise exposure to counterparty credit risk: to provide the group with an appropriate degree of certainty as to its foreign exchange exposure: to maintain an investment grade credit rating: and to maintain a flexible and sustainable balance sheet structure.
The group seeks to achieve a balance of long-term funding or commitment of funds across a range of funding sources at the best possible economic cost.
The group monitors future funding requirements and credit market conditions to ensure continued availability of funds.
The group has continued to maintain exposure to low floating interest rates, which comprises 26% of our gross debt portfolio at the balance sheet date, with a further 26% of index-linked debt and 48% of fixed rate debt.
The groups dividend policy is a key tool in achieving its capital management objectives.
This policy is reviewed and updated in line with Severn Trent Waters five year price control cycle and takes into account, inter alia, the planned investment programme, the appropriate gearing level achieving a balance between an efficient cost of capital and retaining an investment grade credit rating and delivering an attractive and sustainable return to shareholders.
The board has decided to set the 2017 18 dividend at 86.55 pence, an increase of 6.2% compared to the total dividend for 2016 17 of 81.50 pence.
Our policy is to grow the dividend annually at no less than RPI plus 4% until March 2020.

The techniques are classified under the hierarchy defined in IFRS 13 which categorises valuation techniques into Levels 1 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
The groups valuation techniques include Levels 2 and 3 given the wide range of financial instruments below: 2018 2017 m m Valuation techniques and key inputs Cross currency swaps Discounted cash flow Assets 24.5 43.4 Future cash flows are estimated based on forward interest rates from observable yield curves at the year end and contract interest rates discounted at a rate that reflects the credit risk of counterparties.
Thecurrency cash flows are translated at spot rate.
Interest rate swaps Discounted cash flow Assets 11.4 23.6 Future cash flows are estimated based on forward interest rates from Liabilities 112.4 183.9 observable yield curves at the year end and contract interest rates discounted at a rate that reflects the credit risk of counterparties.

Inflation swaps Discounted cash flow Liabilities 2.8 Future cash flows on the RPI leg of the instruments are estimated based onobservable forward inflation indices.
Future cash flows on the CPI leg of the instruments are estimated based onthe future expected differential between RPI and CPI.
Both legs are discounted using observable swap rates at the year end, atarate that reflects the credit risk of counterparties.
This is considered tobe a Level 3 valuation technique.
176 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Company financial statements Other information 34 Fair values of financial instruments continued b Comparison of fair values of financial instruments with their carrying amounts The directors consider that the carrying amounts of cash and short term deposits, bank overdrafts, loans receivable from joint ventures, trade receivables and trade payables approximate their fair values.
Fixed rate sterling and currency bonds are valued using market prices, which is a Level 2 valuation technique.
Index-linked bonds are rarely traded and therefore quoted prices are not considered to be a reliable indicator of fair value.
Therefore, these bonds are valued using discounted cash flow models with discount rates derived from observed market prices forasample of bonds, which is a Level 2 valuation technique.
Fair values of the other debt instruments are also calculated using discounted cash flow models, which is a Level 2 valuation technique.
35 Risks arising from financial instruments The groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including interest rate risk, exchange rate risk and other price risk : credit risk: liquidity risk: and inflation risk.
The groups overall risk management programme addresses the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce potential adverse effects on the groups financial performance or position.
Financial risks are managed by a central treasury department Group Treasury under policies approved by the board of directors.
The board has established a Treasury Committee to monitor treasury activities and to facilitate timely responses to changes in market conditions when necessary.
Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close cooperation with the groups operating units.
The board defines written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas such as exchange rate risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments.
The groups policy is that derivative financial instruments are not held for trading but may be used to mitigate the groups exposure tofinancial risk.
The types of derivative instruments held and the related risks are described below.
Interest rate swaps are held to manage the groups exposure to changes in market interest rates.
Further details are set out in sectiona i and note 36 b i.
Cross currency swaps are held to mitigate the groups exposure to exchange rate movements on amounts borrowed in foreign currencies.
Further details are set out in section a ii and 36 a i.

Further details are provided in note 36 b ii below.
Severn Trent Water, the groups most significant business unit, operates under a regulatory environment where its prices are linked to inflation measured by RPI.
In order to mitigate the risks to cash flow and earnings arising from fluctuations in RPI, the group holds debt instruments where the principal repayable and interest cost is linked to RPI.
a Market risk The group is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, exchange rates.
The nature of these risks and the steps that the group has taken to manage them are described below.
i Interest rate risk The groups income and its operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
The groups interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the group to the risk of adverse cash flow impacts from increases in interest rates.
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the group to the risk of interest costs above the market rate when interest rates decrease.
The groups policy is to maintain 40% to 70% of its interest bearing liabilities in fixed rate instruments during AMP6.
In measuring this metric, management makes adjustments to the carrying value of debt to better reflect the amount that interest is calculated on.
Details of the adjustments made are set out below: 2018 2017 m m Net debt note 40 5,356.6 5,082.4 Cash and cash equivalents 51.1 44.6 Loan receivable from joint venture 135.6 108.6 Cross currency swaps included in net debt at fair value 24.5 43.4 Fair value hedge accounting adjustments 30.4 31.5 Exchange on currency debt not hedge accounted 8.5 21.2 Interest-bearing financial liabilities 5,528.9 5,226.3 The group manages its cash flow interest rate risk by borrowing at fixed or index-linked rates or by using interest rate swaps.
Under these swaps the group receives variable rate interest and pays fixed rate interest calculated by reference to the agreed notional principal amounts.
In practice the swaps are settled by transferring the net amount.
These swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from variable rates to fixed rates.
The group has entered into a series of these interest rate swaps to hedge future interest payments beyond 2030.
The following tables show analyses of the groups interest bearing financial liabilities by type of interest.
Debt which is hedged by interest rate swaps or cross currency swaps is included in the category after taking account of the impact of the swap.
Debt raised in foreign currencies has been included at the notional sterling value of the payable leg of the corresponding cross currency swap since this is the amount that is exposed to changes in interest rates.
Valuation adjustments that do not impact the amount on which interest is calculated, such as fair value hedge accounting adjustments, are excluded from this analysis.
The net principal amount of unhedged swaps is shown as an adjustment to floating rate and fixed rate debt to demonstrate the impact of the swaps on the amount of liabilities bearing fixed interest.

Substantially all of the groups profits and net assets arise from Severn Trent Water, which has very limited and indirect exposure to changes in exchange rates, and therefore the sensitivity of the groups results to changes in exchange rates isnot material.
Certain of the groups subsidiaries enter into transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the operation.
Exchange risks relating to such operations are not material but are managed centrally by Group Treasury through forward exchange contracts to buy or sell currency.
These contracts led to a charge of nil 2017: charge of 0.1 million in the income statement.
In order to meet its objective of accessing a broad range of sources of finance, the group has raised debt denominated in currencies other than sterling.
In order to mitigate the groups exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, cross currency swaps were entered into at the time that the debt was drawn down to swap the proceeds into sterling debt bearing interest based on LIBOR.

The notional value and fair value of these swaps isshown in note 36 a.
The group also has cross currency swaps with a sterling value of 98.3 million 2017: 98.3 million which are not accounted for as fair value hedges.
Economically these swaps act to mitigate the exchange rate risk of debt within the group which is denominated in foreign currency, but they do not achieve hedge accounting under the strict criteria of IAS 39.
This has led to a charge of 17.7 million 2017: credit of 13.1 million in the income statement which is partly offset by the exchange gain of 12.7 million 2017: exchange loss of15.4 million on the underlying debt.
The groups gross and net currency exposures arising from currency borrowings are summarised in the tables below.
These show, inthe relevant currency, the amount borrowed and the notional principal of the related swap or forward contract.

It has policies in place to ensure that sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history, other than in Severn Trent Water Limited and Dee Valley Water Limited, whose operating licences oblige them to supply domestic customers even in cases where bills are not paid.
Amounts provided against accounts receivable and movements on the provision during the year are disclosed in note 21.
Cash deposits and derivative contracts are only placed with high credit quality financial institutions, which have been approved by the board.
Group Treasury monitors the credit quality of the approved financial institutions and the list of financial institutions that may be used is approved annually by the board.
The group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.

Group Treasury manages liquidity and flexibility in funding by monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and the maturity profile of financial assets and liabilities, and by keeping committed credit lines available.
At the balance sheet date the group had committed undrawn borrowing facilities expiring as follows: 2018 2017 m m 2 5 years 710.0 1,000.0 ii Cash flows from non-derivative financial instruments The following tables show the estimated cash flows that will arise from the groups non-derivative net financial liabilities.
The information presented is based on the earliest date on which the group can be required to pay and represents the undiscounted cash flows including principal and interest.
Interest and inflation assumptions are based on prevailing market conditions at the year end date.
The principal is revalued at fixed intervals and is linked to movements in the RPI.
Interest payments are made biannually based on the revalued principal.
The principal repayment equals the revalued amount at maturity.
The payments included in the table above are estimates based on the forward inflation rates published by the Bank of England at the balance sheet date.
iii Cash flows from derivative financial instruments The following tables show the estimated cash flows that will arise from the groups derivative financial instruments.
The tables are based on the undiscounted net cash inflows outflows on the derivative financial instruments that settle on a net basis and the undiscounted gross inflows outflows on those derivatives that require gross settlement.
When the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to the projected interest and foreign currency rates derived from the forward curves existing at the balance sheet date.

Its operating profits and cash flows are therefore exposed to changes in RPI.
In order to mitigate and partially offset this risk, Severn Trent Water has raised debt which pays interest at a fixed coupon based on a principal amount that is adjusted for the change in RPI during the life of the debt instrument index-linked debt.
The amount of index-linked debt at the balance sheet date is shown in section a i Interest rate risk, and the estimated future cash flows relating to this debt are shown insection c ii Cash flows from non-derivative financial instruments.
Ofwat has announced its plans to move towards an economic regulatory model linked to inflation measured on the CPIH index over aperiod of time.
In anticipation of this the group has entered into CPI RPI swaps with a notional value of 150 million at 31 March 2018 in order to mitigate the risk of divergence between inflation measured by CPIH and that measured by RPI.
Inflation rate sensitivity analysis The finance cost of the groups index-linked debt instruments varies with changes in RPI rather than interest rates.
The sensitivity at 31 March of the groups profit and equity to changes in RPI is set out in the following table.
This analysis relates to financial instruments only and excludes any RPI impact on Severn Trent Waters revenues and Regulatory Capital Value, or accounting fordefined benefit pension schemes.

Hedge accounting is adopted for such instruments where the criteria set out in IAS 39 are met.
a Fair value hedges i Cross currency swaps The group raises debt denominated in currencies other than sterling.
Cross currency swaps are entered into at the time that the debt is drawn down to swap the proceeds into sterling debt bearing interest based on LIBOR in order to mitigate the groups exposure to exchange rate fluctuations.
Where the terms of the receivable leg of the swap closely match the terms of the underlying debt, the swaps are expected to be effective hedges.
At the year end the amounts of cross currency swaps designated as fair value hedges were as follows: Notional principal amount Fair value 2018 2017 2018 2017 m m m m Euro 11.4 11.4 10.4 10.4 Yen 8.5 8.5 8.3 9.4 19.9 19.9 18.7 19.8 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 183 Group financial statements Notes to the group financial statements continued For the year ended 31 March 2018 36 Hedge accounting continued b Cash flow hedges i Interest rate swaps The group has entered into interest rate swaps under which it has agreed to exchange the difference between fixed and floating interest rate amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on future cash flow exposures arising from issued variable rate debt.
Where the hedge is expected to be highlyeffective these interest rate swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
Details of interest rate swaps that have been accounted for as cash flow hedges are summarised below: Average contract fixed interest rate Notional principal amount Fair value 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 Period to maturity % % m m m m 5 10 years 2.63 1.70 135.2 50.0 8.6 1.1 10 20 years 1.83 2.14 298.0 384.4 5.0 19.6 2.08 2.09 433.2 434.4 13.6 20.7 ii Energy swaps The group has entered into a series of energy swaps under which it has agreed to exchange the difference between fixed and market prices of electricity at six-monthly intervals up to March 2020.

Matching shares may be awarded at a maximum ratio of one matching share for every deferred share and are subject to a three year vesting period.
No matching shares have been awarded in the current year.
Matching shares are subject to total shareholder return over three years measured relative to the companies ranked 51 150 by market capitalisation in the FTSE Index excluding investment trusts.
The number of shares subject to an award will increase to reflect dividends paid through the performance period on the basis of such notional dividends being reinvested at the then prevailing share price.
Awards will normally vest as soon as the Remuneration Committee determines that the performance conditions have been met provided that the participant remains in employment at the end of the performance period.

186 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Company financial statements Other information 38 Acquisitions On 15 February 2017, Severn Trent Water Limited acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Dee Valley Group Limited comprising all subsidiaries including the regulated water company Dee Valley Water Limited.
This acquisition was made through a scheme of arrangement including cash consideration of 79.0 million and the issue of loan notes with a value of 5.2 million.
The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method.
Goodwill of 66.0 million was capitalised attributable to the anticipated future synergies and outperformance arising as a result of the acquisition.
The goodwill valuation was based on managements best estimates of the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired.
Given the proximity to the year end, full detailed fair value exercises were not able to be completed before the approval of the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017.
The fair value exercises were completed in the current year and resulted in the revisions to the provisional fair values as set out in the following table.
m Goodwill recognised at 1 April 2017 based on provisional fair values 66.0 Additional consideration in respect of acquisition 0.2 Adjustments to provisional fair values for: Recognition of Dee Valley Water Limiteds Instrument of Appointment 4.3 Revisions to estimated fair value of property, plant and equipment 0.8 Deferred tax on changes in fair value 1.1 Goodwill recognised at 31 March 2018 based on final fair values 62.2 Details of the adjustments made to the provisional fair values are set out below.
Dee Valley Water Limited holds an Instrument of Appointment as a water undertaker under the Water Act 1989 issued by the Secretary of State for Wales the Licence.
The Licence has no fixed term and requires 25 years notice of termination.
Under the Licence, Dee Valley Water Limited has an exclusive right to supply water to household and non-household customers within a geographic area defined in the Licence.
On 23 March 2018 Ofwat announced that it had agreed to vary the terms of the Licence with effect from 1 July 2018 to amend the geographic area to include those parts of Wales previously served by Severn Trent Water and to exclude certain parts of England previously served by Dee Valley Water.
Water undertakers are subject to a framework of economic regulation operated by the Water Services Regulation Authority Ofwat.
Under this framework, water undertakers are permitted to set wholesale tariffs that would enable an efficient company to earn a post-tax return on a notional amount known as the Regulatory Capital Value RCV.
They are also allowed to earn a net margin on their retail costs.
Ofwat sets the post-tax return at a rate that it considers to be the weighted average cost of capital for companies operating in the sector based on an assumed gearing level.
Therefore the Licence, together with the net operating assets, enables Dee Valley Water Limited to earn post-tax returns with a net present value equivalent to the RCV plus a net return on retail activities.
To determine the fair value of the licence we have taken the RCV at 31 March 2017 from Ofwats Final Price Control Determination published in December 2014 adjusted to current prices at the acquisition date, added an allowance for the value of the Retail business and compared this with the fair value of the operating assets acquired.
This resulted in a valuation of 4.3 million for the Licence.
The goodwill acquired represents future outperformance of the regulatory settlement and synergies arising from the combination of the groups regulated water businesses.
See note 16 for the reconciliation of goodwill recognised for the group.
39 Discontinued operations Operating Services US and Italy The disposal of the groups US business Operating Services, US, which formed part of the Business Services segment, to US investors PPC Enterprises LLC and Alston Capital Partners LLC was completed on 30 June 2017.
The group disposed of the Operating Services business in Italy, which formed part of the Business Services segment, on 23 February 2017 to Acea S. P. A.
The classification of these businesses as discontinued operations requires judgements as to whether they represent a separate major line of business or geographical area.
The Operating Services Italy business was sold on 23 February 2017.
At that point the process to dispose of the Operating Services US business was underway, as part of a single coordinated plan to exit the overseas Operating Services businesses.
However, at that point the disposal of the Operating Services US business was not considered to be highly probable because the sale process was not sufficiently advanced.
On its own, Operating Services Italy was not considered to be a major line of business or geographical area and so it was not classified as a discontinued operation in the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017.
Following the disposal of Operating Services US on 30 June 2017, the group had completed its plan to exit the overseas Operating Services business.
It reassessed the classification of these businesses and reclassified them as discontinued operations.
Prior period figures in the consolidated income statement and related notes have been restated to present separately amounts relating to discontinued operations.
Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 187 Group financial statements Notes to the group financial statements continued For the year ended 31 March 2018 39 Discontinued operations continued Water Plus joint venture On 1 March 2016 the group announced its intention, subject to approval from the Competition and Markets Authority CMA, to enter into a joint venture with United Utilities PLC to compete in the non-household water and waste water retail markets in England and Scotland.
On 3 May 2016 the CMA announced approval of the joint venture.
On this date the group determined that completion of the proposed transaction became highly probable and the non-household retail business was classified as a disposal group and a discontinued operation with effect from this date.
On 31 May 2016 the group transferred Severn Trent Waters non-household retail business to Severn Trent Select Limited and on 1 June it exchanged the entire share capital of Severn Trent Select Limited for 50% ofthe share capital of Water Plus Limited.
