FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVES Financial instruments overview For financial assets and liabilities which are traded on an active market, such as listed investments or listed debt instruments, fair value is determined by reference to market value.
For non-traded financial assets and liabilities, fair value is calculated using discounted cash flows, considered to be reasonable and consistent with those that would be used by a market participant, and based on observable market data where available for example forward exchange rate, interest rate or commodity price curve, unless carrying value is considered to approximate fair value.
Where discounted cash flow models based on managements assumptions are used, the resulting fair value measurements are considered to be at level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, as defined in IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement, as they depend to a significant extent on unobservable valuation inputs.
All derivatives that have been designated into hedge relationships have been separately disclosed.

The Groups cash and cash equivalents at 31 December 2018 include $4,407 million held in high grade money market funds.
These funds are selected to ensure compliance with the minimum credit rating requirements and counterparty exposure limits set out in the Groups Treasury policy.
Following the adoption of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments from 1 January 2018 these balances have been reclassified as at fair value through profit and loss as they are redeemed through the sale of units in the funds rather than solely through the recovery of principal and interest.
The amount held in similar money market funds at 31 December 2017 and classified as loans and receivables in the analysis above was $4,988 million.
There is no impact on the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents as a result of this reclassification.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVES continued Fair value hierarchy An analysis of financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value is set out below: 2018 2017 US$ million Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Financial assets At fair value through profit and loss Provisionally priced trade receivables 726 726 558 558 Other receivables 270 270 238 238 Derivatives hedging net debt 7 7 30 30 Other derivatives 9 113 122 53 53 Cash and cash equivalents 4,407 4,407 Designated into hedges Derivatives hedging net debt 212 212 307 307 At fair value through other comprehensive income Financial asset investments 10 28 38 69 46 115 4,426 1,058 298 5,782 69 948 284 1,301 Financial liabilities At fair value through profit and loss Provisionally priced trade payables 751 751 594 594 Other payables 158 158 112 112 Derivatives hedging net debt 554 554 628 628 Other derivatives 8 60 68 2 117 119 Designated into hedges Derivatives hedging net debt 109 109 58 58 Debit valuation adjustment to derivative liabilities 15 15 9 9 8 1,459 158 1,625 2 1,388 112 1,502 Net assets liabilities carried at fair value 4,418 401 140 4,157 67 440 172 201 Fair value hierarchy Valuation technique Level 1 Valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical financial instruments.
This category includes cash and cash equivalents held in money market funds, listed equity shares and quoted futures.
Level 2 Instruments in this category are valued using valuation techniques where all of the inputs that have a significant effect onthe valuation are directly or indirectly based on observable market data.
This category includes provisionally priced trade receivables and payables and over-the-counter derivatives.
Level 3 Instruments in this category have been valued using a valuation technique where at least one input which could have a significant effect on the instruments valuation is not based on observable market data.
Where inputs can be observed from market data without undue cost and effort, the observed input is used.
Otherwise, management determines a reasonable estimate for the input.
This category includes contingent consideration, receivables relating to disposals and unlisted equity investments.
The movements in the fair value of the level 3 financial assets and liabilities are shown as follows: Assets Liabilities US$ million 2018 2017 2018 2017 At 1 January 284 270 112 125 Net loss profit recorded in the income statement 38 2 11 17 Net loss profit recorded in the statement of comprehensive income 32 34 Additions 155 19 70 Settlements and disposals 37 59 4 Currency movements 34 18 9 4 At 31 December 298 284 158 112 For the level 3 financial assets and liabilities, changing certain estimated inputs to reasonably possible alternative assumptions does not change the fair value significantly.
Further information on financial instruments Borrowings designated in fair value hedges represent listed debt which is held at amortised cost, adjusted for the fair value of the hedged interest rate risk.
Thefair value of these borrowings is $8,519 million 2017: $11,900 million, which is measured using quoted indicative broker prices and consequently categorised as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
The carrying value of the remaining borrowings at amortised cost of $372 million 2017: $475 million, principally comprising bank borrowings, is considered to approximate the fair value.
Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities The Group offsets financial assets and liabilities and presents them on a net basis in the Consolidated balance sheet only where there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts, and the Group intends to either settle the recognised amounts on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
At 31 December 2018, certain over-the-counter derivatives entered into by the Group and recognised at fair value through profit and loss are both subject toenforceable ISDA master netting arrangements and intended to be settled on a net basis.
In accordance with the requirements of IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation, the positions of these derivatives have been offset: those in a liability position totalling $57 million 2017: $62 million asset position were offset against those in a net asset position totalling $122 million 2017: $165 million liability position.
The net asset position of $65 million 2017:$103million net liability is presented within derivative assets 2017: within derivative liabilities in the Consolidated balance sheet.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVES continued Derivatives overview The Group utilises derivative instruments to manage certain market risk exposures, however it may choose not to designate certain derivatives as hedges for accounting purposes.
Such derivatives are classified as Held for trading and fair value movements are recorded in the Consolidated income statement.
The use of derivative instruments is subject to limits and the positions are regularly monitored and reported to senior management.
Fair value hedges The majority of interest rate swaps taken out to swap the Groups fixed rate borrowings to floating rate, in accordance with the Groups policy have been designated as fair value hedges.
The carrying value of the hedged debt is adjusted at each balance sheet date to reflect the impact on its fair value of changes in market interest rates.
At 31 December 2018 this adjustment was to increase the carrying value of borrowings by $30 million 2017: $154 million increase.
Changes in the fair value of the hedged debt are offset against fair value changes in the interest rate swap and recognised in the Consolidated income statement as financing remeasurements.
Recognised in the Consolidated income statement is a gain on fair value hedged items of $124million 2017:$203million, offset by a loss on fair value hedging instruments of $118million 2017:$213 million.
Held for trading The Group may choose not to designate certain derivatives as hedges.
This may occur where the Group is economically hedged but IFRS 9 hedge accounting cannot be achieved or where gains and losses on both the derivative and hedged item naturally offset in the Consolidated income statement, as is the case for certain cross currency swaps of non-US dollar debt.
Fair value changes on these derivatives are recognised in the Consolidated income statement as remeasurements or within underlying earnings in accordance with the policy set out in note 8.
Further information on derivatives Fair value of derivative positions The fair value of the Groups open derivative positions at 31 December excluding normal purchase and sale contracts held off balance sheet, recorded within Derivative financial assets and Derivative financial liabilities, is as follows: Current Non-current 2018 2017 2018 2017 US$ million Asset Liability Asset Liability Asset Liability Asset Liability Derivatives hedging net debt Fair value hedge Interest rate swaps 7 21 205 109 286 58 Held for trading Forward foreign currency contracts 3 7 7 10 Cross currency swaps 33 209 4 514 23 409 Debit valuation adjustment to derivative liabilities 15 9 10 40 28 219 209 608 309 458 Other derivatives 122 63 53 117 5 2 Total derivatives 132 103 81 336 209 613 309 460 Other derivatives primarily relate to forward foreign currency contracts hedging capital expenditure, forward commodity contracts and other commodity contracts that are accounted for as Held fortrading.
These marked to market valuations are not predictive of the future value of the hedged position, nor of the future impact on the profit of the Group.
The valuations represent the cost of closing all hedge contracts at 31 December, at market prices and rates available at the time.
Accounting judgement Fair value of financial instruments Certain of the Groups financial instruments, principally derivatives, are required to be measured on the balance sheet at fair value.
Where a quoted market price for an identical instrument is not available, a valuation model is used to estimate the fair value based on the net present value of the expected cash flows under the contract.
Valuation assumptions are usually based on observable market data for example forward foreign exchange rate, interest rate or commodity price curves where available.
