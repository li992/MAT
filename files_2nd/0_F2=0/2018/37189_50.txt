Disclosures regarding financial instruments measured at fair value The Companys financial instruments within the scope of FRS 102 that are held at fair value comprise its investment portfolio and derivative financial instruments.
The investments are categorised into a hierarchy consisting of levels 1, 2 and 3.
Level 1: The unadjusted quoted price in an active market for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable i. e. : developed using market data for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly Level 3: Inputs are unobservable i. e. : for which market data is unavailable for the asset or liability Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset.
Details of the valuation techniques used by the Company are given in note 1 b on page 50.
The following table sets out the fair value measurements using the FRS 102 hierarchy as at 30th September.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies As an investment trust, the Company invests in equities for the long term so as to secure its investment objective stated on the Features page.
In pursuing this objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of financial risks that could result in a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for dividends.
These financial risks include market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Directors policy for managing these risks is set out below.
The Company Secretary, in close cooperation with the Board and the Manager, coordinates the Companys risk management policy.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks and the methods used to measure the risks that are set out below, have not changed from those applying in the comparative year.
The Companys classes of financial instruments are as follows: investments in equity shares of Japanese companies which are held in accordance with the Companys investment objective: short term debtors, creditors and cash arising directly from its operations: a loan facility: and senior secured loan notes issued by the Company.

This market risk comprises three elements currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk.
Information to enable an evaluation of the nature and extent of these three elements of market risk is given in parts i to iii of this note 22 a, together with sensitivity analyses where appropriate.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and these policies have remained unchanged from those applying in the comparative year.
The Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
i Currency risk The Companys functional currency and the currency in which it reports, is sterling.
However the Companys assets, liabilities and income are almost entirely denominated in yen.
As a result, movements in exchange rates will affect the sterling value of those items.
Management of currency risk The Manager monitors the Companys exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the Board, which meets on at least four occasions each year.
The Manager measures the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and income of a movement in the yen sterling exchange rate.
Yen denominated borrowing may be used to limit the exposure of the Companys portfolio to the yen sterling exchange rate.
Income is converted to sterling on receipt.
The Company may use short term forward currency contracts to manage working capital requirements.
It is currently not the Companys policy to hedge against foreign currency risk.
Foreign currency exposure The fair value of the Companys monetary items that have exposure to the yen at 30th September are shown below.
The Companys investments which are not monetary items have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.
2018 2017 New New US Zealand US Zealand Yen Dollar Dollar Total Yen Dollar Dollar Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Current assets 14,138 2 5 14,145 7,268 4 7,272 Creditors 139,359 139,359 99,535 99,535 Foreign currency exposure on netmonetary items 125,221 2 5 125,214 92,267 4 92,263 Investments held at fair value throughprofit or loss 976,724 976,724 771,143 771,143 Total net foreign currency exposure 851,503 2 5 851,510 678,876 4 678,880 In the opinion of the Directors, the above year end amounts are broadly representative of the exposure to foreign currency risk during the year.
Foreign currency sensitivity The following tables illustrate the sensitivity of return after taxation for the year and net assets with regard to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities and exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary currency financial instruments held at each balance sheet date and the income receivable in foreign currency and assumes a 10% 2017: 10% appreciation or depreciation in sterling against the yen, which is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on the volatility of exchange rates during the year.

ii Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable on cash deposits and the interest payable on the Companys variable rate cash borrowings.
Management of interest rate risk The Company does not normally hold significant cash balances.
Short term borrowings are used when required.
The Company may finance part of its activities through borrowings at levels approved and monitored by the Board.
The possible effects on cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when the Company borrows on the loan facility.
However, amounts drawn down on this facility are for short term periods and therefore exposure to interest rate risk is not significant.
Interest rate exposure The exposure of financial assets and liabilities to floating interest rates, giving cash flow interest rate risk when rates are reset, is shown below.
2018 2017 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates: Cash and cash equivalents 7,278 3,551 Floating rate bank loan 47,259 39,729 Total exposure 39,981 36,178 Interest receivable on cash balances, or paid on overdrafts, is at a margin below or above LIBOR respectively 2017: same.
Interest rate sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and net assets to a 1% 2017: 1% increase or decrease in interest rates in regards to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities.
This level of change is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on observation of current market conditions.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary financial instruments held at the balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.

iii Other price risk Other price risk includes changes in market prices, other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk, which may affect the value of equity investments.
Management of other price risk The Board meets on at least four occasions each year to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors.
The investment management team has responsibility for monitoring the portfolio, which is selected in accordance with the Companys investment objective and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Other price risk exposure The Companys total exposure to changes in market prices at 30th September comprises its holdings in equity investments as follows: 2018 2017 000 000 Investments held at fair value through profit or loss 976,724 771,143 The above data is broadly representative of the exposure to other price risk during the current and comparative year.
Concentration of exposure to other price risk An analysis of the Companys investments is given on pages 16 and 17.
This shows that all investments are in Japanese listed equities.
Accordingly, there is a concentration of exposure to that country.
However, it should also be noted that an investment may not be entirely exposed to the economic conditions in its country of domicile or of listing.

Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the Companys assets comprise readily realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.
Short term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft facilities.
The Boards policy is for the Company to remain fully invested in normal market conditions and that short term borrowings be used to manage short term liabilities, working capital requirements and to gear the Company as appropriate.
Details of the current loan facilities are given in note 14 on page 57.
Liquidity risk exposure Contractual maturities of the financial liabilities, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required are as follows: 2018 More than Three three months months but not more More than or less than one year one year Total 000 000 000 000 Creditors: Securities purchased awaiting settlement 4,648 4,648 Other creditors and accruals 105 105 Bank loan & senior secured loan notes including interest 539 1,043 154,547 156,129 5,292 1,043 154,547 160,882 6 4 | J P M O R G A N J A P A N E S E I N V E S T M E N T T R U S T P L C.

c Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that the failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in loss to the Company.
Management of credit risk Portfolio dealing The Company invests in markets that operate Delivery Versus Payments DVP settlement.
The process of DVP mitigates the risk of losing the principal of a trade during the settlement process.
However, the Companys holdings in Participatory Notes and Warrants are subject to counterparty risk associated with each issuer.
The Manager continuously monitors dealing activity to ensure best execution, a process that involves measuring various indicators including the quality of trade settlement and incidence of failed trades.
Counterparty lists are maintained and adjusted accordingly.
Cash and cash equivalents Counterparties are subject to regular credit analysis by the Manager and deposits can only be placed with counterparties that have been approved by JPMAMs Counterparty Risk Group.
Exposure to JPMorgan Chase JPMorgan Chase Bank, N. A. is the custodian of the Companys assets.
The Companys assets are segregated from JPMorgan Chases own trading assets.
Therefore these assets are designed to be protected from creditors in the event that JPMorgan Chase were to cease trading.
The Depositary, Bank of New York Mellon International Limited, is responsible for the safekeeping of all custodial assets of the Company and for verifying and maintaining a record of all other assets of the Company.
However, no absolute guarantee can be given on the protection of all the assets of the Company.
Credit risk exposure The amounts shown in the Statement of Financial Position under debtors and cash and cash equivalents represent the maximum exposure to credit risk at the current and comparative year ends.
The aggregate value of securities on loan at 30th September 2018 amounted to 87.9 million 2017: nil and the maximum value of stock on loan during the year amounted to 96.7 million 2017: nil.
Collateral is obtained by JPMorgan Asset Management and is called in on a daily basis to a value of 102% 2017: nil of the value of the securities on loan if that collateral is denominated in the same currency as the securities on loan and 105% 2017: nil if it is denominated in a different currency.
