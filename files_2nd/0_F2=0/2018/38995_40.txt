SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The basis of preparation and accounting policies used in preparing the historical financial information for the year ended 31 December 2018 are set out below.
These accounting policies have been consistently applied in all material respects to all the periods presented.
2.1 Basis of preparation and statement of compliance with IFRSs The Companys financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as endorsed by the European Union regulations as they apply to the financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2018 and also in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018.
The Companys financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis.
The financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling and all values are rounded to one decimal place of a million m unless otherwise indicated.
No income statement or statement of comprehensive income is presented by the Company as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
The results of Polypipe Group plc are included in the consolidated financial statements of Polypipe Group plc.
2.2 Going concern The Directors, having considered all relevant risk factors, believe the Company has adequate financial resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
2.3 Investments Investments in subsidiary undertakings are held at historical cost less any applicable provision for impairment.
2.4 Share-based payments In the case of equity-settled schemes, the fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at the date of grant and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The value of the options is measured using the BlackScholes and Monte Carlo models, taking into account the terms and conditions including market and non-vesting conditions upon which the options were granted.
Nonmarket vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of options that eventually vest.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for equity-settled transactions where vesting is conditional upon a market or non-vesting condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and or service conditions are satisfied.
The financial effect of awards by the Company of options over its equity shares to employees of subsidiary undertakings are recognised by the Company in its individual financial statements.
In particular, the Company records an increase in its investment in subsidiaries with a corresponding adjustment to equity equivalent to the IFRS 2 cost in subsidiary undertakings.
2.5 Cash dividend The Company recognises a liability to pay a dividend when the distribution is authorised and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Under UK company law a distribution is authorised when it is approved by the shareholders.
A corresponding amount is then recognised directly in equity.
