The UK corporation tax rate had been 20% since 1 April 2015.
The rate reduced to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017 and will reduce to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020.
This will reduce the groups future current tax charge accordingly.
The deferred tax liability at 3 February 2018 has been calculated based on a rate of 17% as this is the prevailing rate at which the group expects the deferred tax liability to reverse.
