140 Notes to the Financial Statements Interest rate risk The Group seeks to manage interest rate risk to ensure reasonable certainty of its interest charge while allowing an element of risk exposure consistent with the variability of its cash flows.
Interest rate risk is managed by the use of fixed interest debt and interest rate derivatives, which are approved in advance by the Treasury Committee.
The Group policy is to fix a minimum of 50% of its estimated future interest rate exposures excluding pensions for a minimum period of 12 months forward.
The Treasury Committee reviews this exposure monthly.
A hypothetical 1.0% increase in euro interest rates would reduce the market value of the Groups bond liabilities by 51.7m at 31 December 2018 2017: 53.2m.
The income statement impact is nil as changes in interest rates do not change the expected cash flows on the bonds.
The Group had outstanding bond debt issues at 31 December 2018 with a market value of 1,146.6m 2017: 1,206.8m.
This exceeds the book value of 1,120.1m 2017: 1,143.2m as a result of reductions in interest rates in Europe.
There are no circumstances where the Group would be obliged to pay the fair market value.
The Group could however decide to redeem some or all of its bonds early and the fair market value is indicative of the price that would be required to do so.
Capital risk The Group is committed to maintaining a debt equity structure that allows continued access to a broad range of financing sources and sufficient flexibility to pursue commercial opportunities as they present themselves, without onerous financing terms and conditions.
The Groups policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to support the Groups strategy.
Capital consists of ordinary shares, retained earnings and non-controlling interests in the Group.
Management monitor the return on capital as well as the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.
e Treasury risk The Groups treasury activities are governed by a treasury policy, which is reviewed and approved by the Board on an annual basis.
The treasury policy covers all activities associated with managing the above risks.
The policy requires that financial instruments are only utilised to manage known financial exposures and speculative derivative contracts are not entered into.
The treasury policy requires that treasury must approve opening and closing of all bank accounts, and that funds transfers and other payments are only made in accordance with bank mandates.
To ensure an appropriate control environment exists in the treasury function, duties are segregated between front and back office teams.
In addition a number of controls are in place to protect against potential cyber security and other risks.
