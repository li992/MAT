Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 37 Interest in unconsolidated structured entities As described in note 36, at 31 December 2018, the group owned units in collectives managed by Rathbone Unit Trust Management with a value of 3,205,000 2017: 2,565,000, representing 0.06% 2017: 0.05% of the total value of the collectives managed by the group.
These assets are held to hedge the group's exposure to deferred remuneration schemes for employees of Unit Trusts.
The group's primary risk associated with its interest in the unit trusts is from changes in fair value of its holdings in the funds.
The group is not judged to control, and therefore does not consolidate, the collectives.
Although the fund trustees have limited rights to remove Rathbone Unit Trust Management as manager, the group is exposed to very low variability of returns from its management and share of ownership of the funds and is therefore judged to act as an agent rather than having control under IFRS 10.
