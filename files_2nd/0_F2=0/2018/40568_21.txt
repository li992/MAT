Where a brand has not been established for a significant period of time the Directors do not have sufficient evidence to support a contention that it will have an indefinite useful life.
Accordingly for Toolstation, Plumbnation, Primaflow, Underfloor Heating and certain product-related brands the Directors have decided it is appropriate to amortise their brand costs over their estimated useful lives.
The useful lives of those brands being amortised range from 10 to 20 years with the remaining lives ranging from 1 to 10 years.
The Directors consider that the other brands, which are also all leading brands in their sectors with significant histories and significant growth prospects, have an indefinite useful life.
They are reviewed annually for impairment: details of impairment tests are shown in note 27.
Key judgement Derecognition of software assets under construction The charge of 11.2m in respect of the derecognition of assets under construction includes 6.7m in respect of two specific components of the Groups ERP project.
An assessment of whether the remaining 48.7m of capitalised spend continued to meet the criteria of IAS 38 Intangible Assets for capitalisation as development costs at 31 December 2018 concluded that no further derecognition was needed.

Due to the inherent uncertainty associated with legal disputes, it is not possible to be virtually certain that the Group will recover all costs associated with this defective external hardstanding.

Pension arrangements Accounting policy Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered services entitling them to the contributions.
For defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each reporting period.
Remeasurement comprising actuarial gains and losses, theeffects of asset ceilings and minimum funding payments and the return on scheme assets excluding interest are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit to the statement of comprehensive income.
Remeasurement recorded in the statement of comprehensive income is not recycled.
Net interest is calculated by applying a discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset.
Net interest expense or income is recognised within finance costs.
Where the Group is committed to pay additional contributions under a minimum funding arrangement and it has no unconditional right to receive any surplus in a winding up of the scheme, the pension obligation recognised in the financial statements is the higher of the IAS 19 revised 2011 obligation or the net present value of future minimum funding payments to which the Group is unconditionally committed, discounted using the IAS 19 revised 2011 discount rate.

In addition the Company has agreed to make contributions of 0.8m per annum to the TP DB schemes until 30 September 2022 with the aim of eliminating the deficit in these schemes by that date.
The Group has also agreed to make monthly contributions to cover the ongoing management and administrative expenses of the BSS Schemes and the TP DB Schemes.

In respect of longevity, the valuation adopts the S2PA year of birth tables with improvements in life expectancy to continue in the medium term, with base year appropriate to the members date of birth.
This results in the following life expectancies at illustrative ages: Weighted average life expectancy at age 65 for mortality tables used to determine pension liabilities at 31 December 2018: Current member age Sex Life expectancy 45 Male 23.3 45 Female 26.2 65 Male 21.9 65 Female 24.6 137 Travis Perkins plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 Travis Perkins plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 Financial statements Financial statements 16.

On 26 October 2018 the High Court issued a ruling on GMP equalisation clarifying that pension scheme trustees are under a duty to equalise for GMPs between members of different sexes and setting out a number of different lawful methods for equalisation.
The Group has recognised a past service cost for the impact of this ruling, which has been calculated by qualified actuaries assuming that the Schemes are able to limit back-payments to a maximum of 28 years and using Method C2.
The past service cost of 9.6m represents 0.7% of the accounting liability.
If the impact of this ruling had been calculated using one of the other potentially suitable methods the past service cost would still have represented 0.7% of the accounting liability.
Future changes in this estimate will be recognised as an actuarial gain or loss.
The 4.7m pension curtailment gain, recognised as a result of the closure of the Travis Perkins Pensions and Dependants Benefit Scheme and the BSS Defined Benefit Scheme to future accrual, is stated net of 0.5m of associated administrative expenses.
The curtailment gain and the charge for GMP equalisation have been recognised as adjusting items and are discussed further in note 3 and on page 31. c.
