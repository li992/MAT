155 Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Companys objective for managing its capital is to ensure that Group entities will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to shareholders, as well as sustaining the future development of its business.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may alter the total amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, draw down additional debt or reduce debt.
The Groups capital structure consists of debt, which includes the loans and borrowings disclosed in Note 21, cash and cash equivalents disclosed in Note 20 and the equity attributable to the parent, comprising share capital, reserves and retained earnings, as disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
The Group seeks to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.
One of the Groups subsidiaries, CDLHT which is a stapled group comprising CDL Hospitality Real Estate Investment Trust H-REIT and CDL Hospitality Business Trust HBT, a business trust, is required to maintain certain minimum base capital and financial resources.
H-REIT is subject to the aggregate leverage limit as defined in the Property Fund Appendix of the Code on Collective Investment Schemes CIS Code issued by Monetary Authority of Singapore.
The CIS Code stipulates that the total borrowings and deferred payments together the Aggregate Leverage of a property fund should not exceed 45.0% of its Deposited Property except that the Aggregate Leverage of a property fund may exceed 45.0% of its Deposited Property up to a maximum of 60.0% if a credit rating of the property fund from Fitch Inc. Moodys or Standard and Poors is obtained and disclosed to the public.
The property fund should continue to maintain and disclose a credit rating so long as its Aggregate Leverage exceeds 45.0% of its Deposited Property.
For this financial year, H-REIT has a credit rating of BBBfrom Fitch Inc.
The Aggregate Leverage of H-REIT as at 31 December 2018 was 34.2% 2017: 32.6% of H-REITs Deposited Property.
This complied with the aggregate leverage limit as described above.
HBT, H-REIT and CDLHT have complied with the borrowing limit requirements imposed by the relevant Trust Deeds and all externally imposed capital requirements for the financial years ended 31 December 2018 and 2017.
Except for the above, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
23 EMpLoyEE BENEFITS Pension arrangements The Group operates various funded pension schemes which are established in accordance with local conditions and practices within the countries concerned.
The most significant funds are described below.
United Kingdom The pension arrangements in the United Kingdom operate under the Millennium & Copthorne Pension Plan, which was set up in 1993.
The plan operates a funded defined benefit arrangement together with a defined contribution plan, both with different categories of membership.
The defined benefit section of the plan was closed to new entrants in 2001 and at the same time rights to a Guaranteed Minimum Pension GMPs under the defined contribution scheme also ceased.
The plan entitles a retired employee to receive an annual pension payment.
The contributions required are determined by a qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit credit method.
The last full actuarial valuation of this scheme was carried out by a qualified independent actuary as at 5 April 2017 and this has been updated on an approximate basis to 31 December 2018.
The contributions of the Group during the year were 11% 2017: 24% of pensionable salary.
Annual Report & Accounts 2018 156 NoTES To ThE CoNSoLIdATEd FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CoNTINuEd As the defined benefit section is closed to new entrants, the current service cost, as a percentage of pensionable payroll is likely to increase as the membership ages, although it will be applied to a decreasing pensionable payroll.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the discount rate and the rates of increase in salaries and pensions.
South Korea The Group operates a defined benefit pension plan for its employees in South Korea.
The contributions required are determined by an external qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
The most recent valuation was carried out on 31 December 2018.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuations are those relating to the discount rate and rate of increase in salaries.
Taiwan The Group operates a defined benefit pension plan for its employees in Taiwan.
The contributions of the Group were no less than 6% 2017: 6% of the employees earnings.
The defined benefit plans are administered by pension funds that are legally separated from the Group.
The boards of the pension funds are required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants.
These defined benefit plans expose the Group to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, currency risk, interest rate risk and market investment risk.
The above plans are substantially funded by the Groups subsidiaries.
The funding requirements are based on the pension funds actuarial measurement framework set out in the funding policies of the plans.
The assets of each scheme have been taken at market value and the liabilities have been calculated using the following principal assumptions: 2018 2017 2018 SouTh 2018 2017 SOUTH 2017 uK KorEA TAIwAN UK KOREA TAIWAN Inflation rate 3.5% 2.0% 3.5% 3.0% Discount rate 2.9% 2.5% 1.0% 2.5% 3.0% 1.0% Rate of salary increase 4.0% 3.0% 3.0% 4.0% 3.0% 3.0% Rate of pension increases 3.3% 3.5% Rate of revaluation 2.5% 2.5% The methodology for computing the discount rate has changed during 2018 from the spot method to the yield range method.
The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The present values of the schemes liabilities are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are inherently uncertain.
Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc 157 Reasonably possible changes at the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions, holding other assumptions consistent, would have altered the defined benefit obligation by the amounts shown below: DEFINED BENEFIT OBLIGATION 2018 2018 2017 2017 INCrEASE dECrEASE INCREASE DECREASE M M M M Discount rate 1% movement 12 14 14 14 Rate of salary increase 1% movement 1 1 2 2 Although the analysis does not take account of the full distribution of cash flows expected under the plans, it does provide an approximation of the sensitivity of the assumptions shown.

The estimated GMP equalisation impact for the UK scheme is an increase of 1.83% of the total value of scheme liabilities on the IAS19 basis as at 31 December 2018, or 1m.

The Group expects 2m in contributions to be paid to the defined benefit plans in 2019.
The Group monitors the deficit of the fund and believes any risk associated with the deficit is mitigated by the Groups strong balance sheet position.
Share-based payments The Group operates a number of share option schemes, a majority being designed to link remuneration to the future performance of the Group.
Details of these schemes are given in the Remuneration Committee report.
In accordance with the Groups accounting policy 2.2N iv on share-based payment transactions, the fair value of share options and long-term incentive awards is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the share options and long-term incentive awards.
The charge to the income statement for the year was nil 2017: nil.
The Group has applied IFRS 2 to its active employee share-based payment arrangements from 1 January 2005 except for arrangements granted before 7 November 2002. i Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP Performance Share Awards under this scheme are awarded to Executive Directors and senior management of the Group.
