Notes to the Financial Statements continued As at 31 March 2018 the Company had unutilised management expenses of 116.1 million carried forward 2017: 97.0 million.
These balances have been generated because a large part of the Companys income is derived from dividends which are not taxed.
Based on current UK tax law, the Company is not expected to generate taxable income in a future period in excess of deductible expenses for that period and, accordingly, is unlikely to be able to reduce future tax liabilities by offsetting these excess management expenses.
These excess management expenses are therefore not recognised as a deferred tax asset.
