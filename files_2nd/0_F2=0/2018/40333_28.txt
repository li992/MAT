Group financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 31 December 2018 1 General information Synthomer plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act.
The address of the registered office is given on page 160.
The Company is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in pounds sterling functional currency of the parent company.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.
New and amended standards adopted by the Group The Group has applied the following standards and amendments for the first time for the annual reporting period commencing 1 January 2018.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9 replaced IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
It addresses the classification, measurement and fide-recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, introduces new rules for hedge accounting and a new impairment model for financial assets.
This standard is mandatory for financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2018.
The adoption of IFRS 9 did not have a material impact on the amounts recognised in the current period or the prior period and it is not expected to significantly impact future periods.
The Group has chosen to continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 as permitted by the standard.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers The IASB issued a new standard for the recognition of revenue which is mandatory for financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2018.
This replaced IAS 18 which covered contracts for goods and services and IAS 11 which covered construction contracts.
The new standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognised when performance obligations are met and control of goods or services transfers to a customer.
The standard applies a five step approach to the timing of revenue recognition.
The adoption of IFRS 15 did not have a material impact on the amounts recognised in the current period or the prior period and it is not expected to significantly impact future periods.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted Certain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for the 31 December 2018 reporting period and have not been early adopted by the Group.
The Groups assessment of the impact of these new standards and interpretations is set out below: IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016.
For lessees, it will result in almost all leases being recognised on the balance sheet, as the distinction between operating and finance leases is removed.
Under the new standard, an asset the right-to-use the leased item and a financial liability to pay rentals are recognised.
The only exceptions are short-term and low-value leases.
This standard is mandatory for financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2019.
The standard will primarily affect the accounting for the Groups operating leases, and the Group has undertaken a review to identify all leases in each entity.
As at the reporting date, the Group has non-cancellable operating lease commitments of 30.4m see note 34.
Work has now been carried out to determine the financial impact on adoption of this accounting standard as at 1 January 2019.
Using the modified retrospective method of adoption the Group expects to recognise right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities of approximately 43m.
The approximate impact will be an increase to EBITDA of 7m, an increase to depreciation of 6m and an increase to interest payable to give a nil impact on profit before taxation in the year ending 31 December 2019.
There are no other standards that are not yet effective and that would be expected to have a material impact on the entity in the current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions.
2 Significant accounting policies Basis of accounting These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union IFRSs as adopted by the EU, IFRS Interpretations Committee and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of financial instruments at fair value through the Income Statement.
As discussed in the Report of the Directors on page 91, the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below and have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries made up to 31 December each year.
Control is achieved where the Company is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
104 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2018 Strategic report IFC-57 Governance 58-92 Company financial statements 145-156 Other information 157-160 Group financial statements 93-144 The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
The results of joint ventures are accounted for using equity accounting.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups equity therein.
Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination see below and the non-controlling interests share of changes in equity since the date of combination.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Should the fair value of the identifiable assets exceed the cost of acquisition, a Bargain purchase, the excess is credited to the income statement immediately on acquisition.
For the purpose of impairment testing goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
Should the fair value of the identifiable assets exceed the cost of acquisition, the excess is credited to the income statement immediately onacquisition.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Business combinations Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values at the date of completion of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquired entity.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the profit or loss as incurred.
The identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 2008 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that: deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes: liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits: and assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that standard.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete.
Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period see below, or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts as of that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of one year.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirers previously held investment is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date: any gains or losses from such re-measurement are recognised in the income statement.
Synthomer plc Annual Report 2018 105 Group financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 31 December 2018 2 Significant accounting policies continued Acquired intangible assets Intangible assets acquired through acquisition are measured at their fair value and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, on the following bases: Customer relationships between 5 and 15 years Other intangibles up to 10 years Assets with an indefinite life are not subject to amortisation.
Where necessary the fair value at acquisition and estimated useful lives for these intangible assets are based on independent valuation reports.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets that are not acquired through a business combination are initially measured at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of between 3 and 5 years.
An internally-generated intangible asset arising from the Groups product development is recognised only if all of the following conditions in IAS 38 are met: an asset is created that can be separately identified such as software and new processes : it is technically feasible to complete the asset: management intends to complete the development: there is an ability to use or sell the asset once development has been completed: it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits: adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development are available: and the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Cost comprises original purchase price and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use, including, where appropriate, capitalised finance costs.
Except for freehold land, which is not depreciated, the cost of property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Leasehold land and buildings the lesser of 50 years and the period of the lease Plant and equipment between 3 and 10 years Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until the assets are ready for their intended use.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its plant, property and equipment and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount to the extent that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
106 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2018 Strategic report IFC-57 Governance 58-92 Company financial statements 145-156 Other information 157-160 Group financial statements 93-144 Joint ventures Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
Under the equity method of accounting, interests in joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Groups share of the post-acquisition profits or losses and movements in other comprehensive income.
Leases Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Group as the lessee are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases net of any incentives received from the lessor are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Cost is calculated using the weighted average method.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where appropriate.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Loans and receivables Trade receivables Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold in the ordinary course of business.
They are generally short-term in nature and are therefore classified as current assets and their fair value recognised at the consideration due.
The carrying value of trade receivables are considered to be the same as their fair values, due to their short-term nature.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the income statement based on expected losses All trade receivables that are factored by third parties are done so on a non-recourse basis.
At the point of factoring, the Group forfeits the right to future cash flows from these receivables and those amounts are derecognised.
The cost of factoring receivables is recognised as a finance cost in the period in which the receivable is factored.
Amortised bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis to the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables Trade payables are generally short-term in nature and are therefore classified as current liabilities.
They are recognised initially at their fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
The carrying value of trade payables are considered to be the same as their fair values, due to their short-term nature.
Impairment of financial assets At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its financial assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
Finance costs Finance costs of debt are recognised in the income statement over the term of such instruments at an effective interest rate on the carrying amount.
Finance costs that are directly attributable to the construction of property, plant and equipment are capitalised as part of the cost of those assets in accordance with IAS 23.
Synthomer plc Annual Report 2018 107 Group financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 31 December 2018 2 Significant accounting policies continued Foreign currencies In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts see below for details of the Groups accounting policies in respect of such derivative financial instruments.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the relevant average exchange rates for the period.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised in the income statement in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
The Group elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS as sterling-denominated assets and liabilities.
Derivative financial instruments The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives, as set out in note 23.
The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk, including foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and foreign currency options.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each balance sheet date.
A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a financial liability.
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in the income statement depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.
The Group designates certain derivatives as either hedges of highly probable forecast transactions or hedges of foreign currency risk of firm commitments cash flow hedges, or hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
Hedge accounting The Group designates certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives, embedded derivatives and non-derivatives in respect of foreign currency risk as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
Fair value hedges Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged assets or liabilities that are attributable to the hedged risk.
The Group only applies fair value hedge accounting for foreign currency exposure associated with the underlying hedged item.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is also recognised in the income statement.
Cash flow hedges At the inception of the hedge relationship the entity documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss, in the same line of the income statement as the recognised hedged item.
However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
108 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2018 Strategic report IFC-57 Governance 58-92 Company financial statements 145-156 Other information 157-160 Group financial statements 93-144 Hedges of net investments in foreign operations Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges.
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in equity in the foreign currency translation reserve.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks which become fully liquid within three months or less and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
Retirement benefit costs Current and past service costs in respect of the Group's defined benefit pension schemes are charged to the consolidated income statement.
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged to the income statement as they fall due.
Actuarial gains on the defined benefit schemes are recognised in full in each period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside of the consolidated income statement and are presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation.
The UK defined benefit scheme is funded, with the assets of the scheme held separately from those of the Group, in separate trusteeadministered funds.
For the German schemes, the assets are included within the assets of the respective companies, as permitted under local laws.
The assets of the other overseas schemes are held separately from those of the Group.
Synthomer plc Annual Report 2018 109 Group financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 31 December 2018 2 Significant accounting policies continued Provisions Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has been communicated to affected parties.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods provided in the normal course of business net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Revenue is recognised under the provisions of IFRS 15 when performance obligations are met and control of the goods passes to thecustomer.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The Group will on occasion, at its own discretion, settle the share-based payments in cash rather than equity.
Definitions Operating profit Operating profit represents profit from continuing activities before financing costs and taxation.
EBITDA EBITDA is calculated as operating profit before depreciation, amortisation and Special Items as defined below.
Special Items The following are disclosed separately as Special Items in order to provide a clearer indication of the Groups underlying performance: Re-structuring and site closure costs: Sale of a business or significant asset: Acquisition costs: Amortisation of acquired intangible assets: Impairment of non-current assets: Fair value adjustment mark to market adjustments in respect of cross currency and interest rate derivatives used for hedging purposes where IAS 39 hedge accounting is not applied: Items of income and expense that are considered material, either by their size and or nature: Tax impact of above items: and Settlement of prior period tax issues.
These Special Items are either irregular and therefore including them in the assessment of a segments performance would lead to a distortion of trends or are technical adjustments which ensure the Groups financial statements are in compliance with IFRS but do not reflect the operating performance of the segment in the year.
Underlying performance Underlying performance represents the statutory performance of the Group under IFRS, excluding Special Items.
Net cash borrowings Net cash borrowings represents cash and cash equivalents less short and long term borrowings, as adjusted for the effect of related derivative instruments, irrespective of whether they qualify for hedge accounting, non-recourse factoring arrangements and the inclusion of financial assets.
Critical accounting judgements and estimates The following provides information on those policies that management considers critical because of the level of judgement and estimation required which often involves assumptions regarding future events which can vary from what is anticipated.
The directors believe that the financial statements reflect appropriate judgements and estimates and provide a true and fair view of Synthomers performance and financial position.
Valuation of goodwill and intangibles on acquisition Acquired intangibles IFRS 3 revised Business Combinations requires that goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is capitalised and included in intangible assets.
IFRS 3 revised also requires the identification of other intangible assets at acquisition.
The assumptions involved in valuing these intangible assets require the use of estimates and judgements, that may differ from the actual outcome.
These estimates and judgements cover future growth rates, expected inflation rates and the discount rate used.
Changing the assumptions selected by management could significantly affect the allocation of the purchase price paid between goodwill and other acquired intangibles.
110 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2018 Strategic report IFC-57 Governance 58-92 Company financial statements 145-156 Other information 157-160 Group financial statements 93-144 Post retirement benefit obligations Included in the actuaries calculation of the post retirement benefit obligations are a number of assumptions.
Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying value of the obligations.
These are shown in detail in note 26.
Current tax liability and deferred tax The Group annually incurs significant amounts of income taxes payable to various jurisdictions around the world and it also recognises significant changes in deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, all of which are based on managements interpretations of applicable laws, regulations and relevant court decisions.
The quality of these estimates is highly dependent upon managements ability to properly apply what can be very complex sets of rules and to recognise changes in applicable rules.
3 Special Items The Special Items are made up as follows: 2018 2017 Note m m Continuing operations Restructuring and site closure 12.2 11.6 Sale of business 3.8 Sale of land 24 16.4 1.3 Acquisition costs 31 0.5 2.3 Amortisation of acquired intangibles 16 16.4 31.0 Aborted bond costs 1.7 UK Guaranteed Minimum Pension equalisation 2.8 Operating loss 13.4 43.6 Finance costs Fair value of unhedged interest derivatives 9 1.4 Loss before taxation from continuing operations 14.8 43.6 Taxation 10 6.0 13.1 Loss for the year from continuing operations 8.8 30.5 Restructuring and site closure relates to the natural rubber and polyester resins production lines, in Kluang Malaysia, which closed in Q4 2018, and an increase in the onerous lease and related provisions for the Ossett site due to a change in circumstance relating to the subletting of the site.
In 2017, it primarily related to the rationalisation of the Ribcourt France site and the initial onerous lease provision for the Ossett site.
Sale of business relates to the disposal of the Leuna Germany site and the disposal of 51% of our sales entities in Dubai.
Sale of land in 2018 relates to the disposal of the final tranche of Malaysian land at Kluang.
The profit on sale of land in 2017 related to a disposal of land in Hapton UK.
Acquisition costs were incurred in relation to BASF Pischelsdorf 2017: BASF Pischelsdorf and Speciality Additives and for other potential acquisitions which will not occur or had not occurred before the balance sheet date.
Amortisation of acquired intangibles decreased significantly during 2018 due to the full amortisation during the year of the PolymerLatex customer relationships acquired during 2011.
The amortisation includes 1.4m in respect of intangibles relating to the acquisition of BASF Pischelsdorf in 2018.
Ahead of the Group refinancing during the year, a process was undertaken to issue fixed rate unsecured senior notes.
Despite a strong response from investors, the Group decided not to complete the transaction due to unfavourable market conditions.
The costs of this process are not reflective of Underlying performance.
Following a UK High Court ruling during the year in relation to the equalisation of male and female Guaranteed Minimum Pensions GMP a pension plan amendment is deemed to have occurred.
The actuarial estimate of this irregular cost was 2.8m.
As part of the Group refinancing in July 2018 we entered into swap arrangements to fix interest rates on the full value of the 440m committed, unsecured revolving credit facility.
The fair value of the unhedged derivatives relates to the mark to market of the swap at 31December 2018 in excess of the current borrowings of the Group and has been taken through Special Items as it is not reflective of the Underlying performance.
Synthomer plc Annual Report 2018 111 Group financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 31 December 2018 4 Segmental analysis The Group's Executive Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive Officer, examines the Group's performance and has identified two reportable segments of its business: Europe and North America ENA These markets are well developed and are typically growing in line with GDP.
Asia and Rest of the World ARW These markets are characterised by growing at rates generally above GDP coupled with an increased penetration of more sophisticated products into wider uses.
The Executive Committee primarily uses a measure of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA to assess the performance of the operating segments.

"To provide increased clarity on the ongoing trading performance of the Group's businesses, management uses ""underlying performance"" as an alternative performance measure to plan for, control and assess the performance of the segments."
Underlying performance differs from the IFRS measures as it excludes Special Items.
The definition of Special Items is shown in note 2 and has been consistently applied.
Special Items are either irregular, and therefore including them in the assessment of a segment's performance would lead to a distortion of trends, or are technical adjustments which ensure the Group's financial statements are in compliance with IFRS but do not reflect the operating performance of the segment in the year, or both.
An example of the latter is the amortisation of acquired intangibles, which principally relates to acquired customer relationships.
The Group incurs costs, which are recognised as an expense in the income statement, in maintaining these customer relationships.
The Group considers that the exclusion of the amortisation charge on acquired intangibles from Underlying performance avoids the potential double counting of such costs and therefore excludes it as a Special Item from Underlying performance.

In October 2017 the European Commission opened a state aid investigation into the Group Financing Exemption in the UK controlled foreign company legislation.
In common with other UK-based international companies, the Group may be affected by the outcome of this investigation and is therefore monitoring developments.
If the preliminary findings of the European Commission's investigations into the UK legislation are upheld, we have estimated the Group's potential liability to be 5.8m.
Based on the current status of the investigation, we have concluded that no provision is required in relation to this amount.
11 Deferred taxation Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of all tax losses and other temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets to the extent that it is probable that these assets will be recovered.

The key assumptions for those discounted cash flow calculations are the discount rate, profitability and growth rate.
The discount rate is based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted, where appropriate, for the risk premium attributable to the particular CGUs activities and geography of operation.
Profitability and growth rates are based on past experience combined with managements expectations for future business performance, which is informed by a number of factors including economic growth, internal plans and competitor and customer activity.

The profit used in the cash flows for the first five years is derived from management forecasts: for years six to ten a growth rate is applied.
Growth rates of 2% 2017: 2% and 5% 2017: 5% have been used for Europe & North America and Asia & Rest of World respectively, representing managements best estimate of each CGUs circumstances, and these do not exceed the long term growth rates for the markets concerned.
The profit for year ten is then assumed to apply without further growth into perpetuity.
The directors consider that there is no reasonably possible change in key assumptions that would lead to an impairment.

Where market values are not available, fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash flow at prevailing interest rates and by applying year end exchange rates.
The carrying amount of short-term borrowings approximates to book value.
The fair values of the Group's financial instruments are measured using inputs other than quoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable Level 2 as defined by IFRS 13.
The main risks arising from the Group's financial instruments are market risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below, together with the related disclosure required by IFRS.
128 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2018 Strategic report IFC-57 Governance 58-92 Company financial statements 145-156 Other information 157-160 Group financial statements 93-144 Market risk The Group's main exposure to market risk is in the form of interest rate risk and foreign currency risk.
The policies adopted to address these risks are as follows: Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, loan notes and bank borrowings.
The Group monitors interest rate trends regularly, through discussion with its banks, and fixes interest rates when it is prudent to do so.
Foreign currency risk When it is effective to do so the Group uses currency borrowings, forward contracts and currency swaps to hedge overseas net assets, which are predominantly denominated in Euro, US dollar and Malaysian Ringgit.
Profit translation exposures are not hedged.
The Group hedges currency transaction exposures at the point of confirmed order, using forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Group's policy is, where practicable, to hedge all exposures on monetary assets and liabilities.
Consequently, there are no material currency exposures to disclose 2017: none.
Hedge accounting The Group has interest rate swaps that are used to reduce the exposure to interest rate risk in relation to the ineffective portion of interest rate hedges.
These swaps are fully effective at eliminating the risks they address.
The Group has reviewed the requirements necessary to permit the application of hedge accounting under IAS 39.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments to which hedge accounting is not applied or is not effective are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
1.4 million has been debited to the income statement in the year 2017:nil.
These changes are shown separately as a Special Item in the consolidated income statement.
Interest rate risk profile Financial liabilities After taking into account the various interest rate and currency swaps entered into by the Group, the currency and interest rate exposure of the Group as at 31 December 2018 was: 2018 2017 Floating rate Fixed rate Total Floating rate Fixed rate Total borrowings borrowings borrowings borrowings borrowings borrowings m m m m m m Sterling 0.3 0.3 12.4 12.4 Euro 17.4 292.0 309.4 219.6 219.6 US dollar 1.2 1.2 5.7 5.7 Other 32.4 32.4 18.9 292.0 310.9 270.1 270.1 Cash and cash equivalents 96.9 89.6 Net borrowings 214.0 180.5 At 31 December 2018 the Group had in place swap arrangements to fix interest rates on the full value of the 440m committed, unsecured revolving credit facility.

For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
For interest rate derivatives the mark to market adjustment, and amount recognised in equity as part of a hedging arrangement is estimated using the interest rate sensitivity against the nominal amount.
The foreign currency sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates.
The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group where the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the functional currency of the lender or borrower.
Liquidity risk The objective of the Group is to meet financial commitments as and when they fall due.
The Board closely monitors liquidity through monthly management accounts.

Synthomer plc Annual Report 2018 131 Group financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 31 December 2018 24 Assets classified as held for sale continued Malaysia The Group owns agricultural land in Malaysia, which is operated as a palm oil and natural rubber plantation.
The land was owned by Kind Action Sdn Bhd, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Revertex Malaysia Sdn Bhd that has a 30% non-controlling interest.
The directors decided in 2013 to dispose of this land on the open market excluding the 300 acres immediately surrounding the manufacturing facilities.

All pension benefits since that time are provided by way of a defined contribution scheme.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the companies concerned.
The triennial valuation of the scheme was performed during 2018 and is in the process of being finalised with the trustees of the scheme.
Defined benefit scheme The defined benefit scheme is administered by a separate fund that is legally separated from the Company.
The trustees of the pension fund are required by law to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the scheme.
The trustees of the pension are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out as at 6 April 2015 and updated to 31 December 2018 by a qualified actuary.
The Group is committed to a funding deficit recovery plan entered into following the 2015 valuation.
This valuation indicated a shortfall, when measured against the Scheme's technical provisions of 118.7m.
This shortfall is expected to be eliminated in eight years following the valuation date.
As a result the Group is committed to paying contributions for the period 6 April 2015 to 5 April 2023, increasing from 14.0m for the year commencing 6 April 2015 to 18.2m for the year commencing 6 April 2022.
Synthomer plc Annual Report 2018 133 Group financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 31 December 2018 26 Post retirement benefit obligations continued The scheme is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below: Asset return risk The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if plan assets underperform this yield, this will increase the deficit.
The scheme holds a significant proportion of equities which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term while providing volatility and risk in the short term.
Interest rate risk A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans' bond holdings.
Longevity risk The majority of the plans' obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans' liabilities.
The risk relating to benefits to be paid to the dependants of scheme members widow and orphan benefits is re-insured by an external insurance company.
The major assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuations were as follows: 2018 2017 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.00% 2.00% Rate of increase in pensions in deferment 2.20% 2.00% Discount rate 2.80% 2.50% Inflation assumption 3.20% 3.10% Assumptions regarding future mortality are based on actuarial advice in accordance with published statistics.
These assumptions translate into an average life expectancy in years for a pensioner retiring at 65 as follows: 2018 2017 years years Retiring today: Males 87.1 87.2 Females 89.4 89.1 Retiring in 20 years: Males 88.7 88.7 Females 91.2 90.6 Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount rate and mortality.
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting periodassuming that all other assumptions are held constant: Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities Discount rate Increase decrease by 1% Decrease increase by 48m Rate of mortality Increase by 1 year Increase by 14m The above sensitivities are based on a change of assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice this is unlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may have some correlation.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions, the same method present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the balance sheet.

The largest of these schemes accounts for 69.1 million 2017: 68.5 million of the deficit at 31 December 2018.
The major assumption used in the actuarial valuation of this scheme are: 2018 2017 Rate of increase in salaries 3.00% 3.00% Rate of increase in pensions 1.75% 1.75% Discount rate 2.00% 1.90% Mortality assumptions The assumed life expectations on retirement at age 65 are: 2018 2017 years years Retiring today: Males 85.0 84.3 Females 88.6 88.3 Retiring in 20 years: Males 87.8 86.9 Females 90.8 90.8 The major assumptions used in the valuation of the other overseas schemes do not differ significantly from the above.

Regular contributions are payable to the scheme by each participating employer fornew benefits accruing.
The assets of all participating employers are pooled, and contributions are calculated based on aggregated demographic experience.
Therefore sufficient information is not available to identify the Groups share of the assets on a consistent and reliable basis and the Group accounts for the scheme on a defined contribution basis.
The Group expects to make regular contributions of 2.3m to the scheme in 2019.
To the extent that there is underfunding in the scheme deficit contributions are payable.
Based on the latest actuarial assessment each participating employers share has been determined according to the value of its future benefit accrual and it has been determined that the Group is liable for total deficit contributions of 4.6m in three instalments payable in January 2017, 2018 and 2019.
As a result an accrual of 1.3m 2017: 2.7m has been included at 31 December 2018.

Legal and customer claims This amount represented a provision for certain legal and customer claims brought against the Group.
During the year the time passed for which these claims could be settled and the amounts were credited to the income statement.
Restructuring The Group has additionally provided for an onerous lease and related costs on the closed site in Ossett, and as part of the post PAC acquisition restructuring programme, the Group has planned the demolition of buildings at the site in Ribcourt, France.
The Group also closed its natural rubber and polyester resins production lines in Kluang in 2018.
The cost of all these restructuring programmes is charged to the income statement when permitted by the Group's accounting policy within Special Items.
The provision reflects the amount that has been charged but not yet spent.
Liability arising on a business combination As part of the acquisition of PolymerLatex in 2011, the Group acquired a leasehold interest in an empty property.
The provision reflects this onerous contract.
The provisions are expected to be fully utilised over the next five years with the exception of the Ossett overseas lease provision which is expected to be utilised over 50 years.

The Company has and will continue to fully cooperate with the Commission during its investigation.
As the investigation is ongoing and the Commission does not provide feedback on its work until the investigation is complete, it is not possible to determine whether or not a liability exists in relation to this matter.

The Synthomer Employee Benefit Trust The Company established a trust, formerly the Yule Catto Employee Benefit Trust, on 17 July 1996 to distribute shares to employees enabling the obligations under the Yule Catto Longer-Term Performance Share Plan and the Yule Catto Longer-Term Deferred Bonus Plan to be met.
The Trust is managed by the RBC Trustees Guernsey Limited, an independent company located in Guernsey.
At 31 December 2018, the Trust held 110,969 2017: 249 ordinary shares in the Company with a market value of 0.4m 2017: nil.
The dividends on these shares have been waived.
All of the shares are under option.
Costs are amortised over the life of the plans.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 4.91 2017: 4.70.
The weighted average fair value of the options at the measurement date granted during the year was 2.68 2017: 2.97.
The valuation was based on the following inputs and assumptions, using a Monte Carlo simulation model: 2018 2017 Weighted average share price 4.88 5.03 Option price Value of optionality nil nil Vesting assumption 55% 59% Given the option price is nil, the only circumstance in which a vested option will not be exercised is if the current share price is nil.
There is some value associated with the timing of when the exercise would be made but this is considered to be minimal and therefore this has not been modelled.
The vesting assumption is the estimate at the measurement date of the percentage of the options that will ultimately vest and is based on market conditions and management's assessment of the likelihood of achievement of the performance criteria.
