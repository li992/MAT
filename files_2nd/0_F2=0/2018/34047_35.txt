190 Consolidated Financial Statements BBA Aviation Annual Report 2018 Alternative Performance Measures Financial statements Introduction 103 Consolidated Income We assess the performance of the Group using a variety of Alternative Performance Measures.
We principally discuss the Groups results Statement onan adjusted and or underlying basis.
Results on an adjusted basis are presented before exceptional and other items.
104 Consolidated Statement ofComprehensive Income Alternative Performance Measures have been defined and reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure below, along with the rationale behind using the measures.
105 Consolidated Balance Sheet The Alternative Performance Measures we use are: organic revenue growth, underlying operating profit and margin, EBITDA and underlying 106 Consolidated Cash Flow EBITDA, underlying profit before tax, underlying deferred tax, adjusted basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share, return on invested Statement capital, operating cash flow, free cash flow, cash conversion, and net debt.
A reconciliation from these adjusted performance measures 107 Consolidated Statement to the nearest measure prepared in accordance with IFRS is presented below.
The Alternative Performance Measures we use may not of Changes in Equity be directly comparable with similarly titled measures used by other companies.
Where applicable, divisional measures are calculated inaccordance with Group measures.
108 Accounting Policies oftheGroup Exceptional and other items 116 Notes to the The Groups Income Statement and segmental analysis separately identify trading results before exceptional and other items.
The Consolidated directors believe that presentation of the Groups results in this way is relevant to an understanding of the Groups financial performance, Financial Statements as exceptional and other items are identified by virtue of their size, nature or incidence.
This presentation is consistent with the way that 171 Company Balance Sheet financial performance is measured by management and reported to the Board and the Executive Committee and assists in providing a meaningful analysis of the trading results of the Group.
In determining whether an event or transaction is treated as an exceptional and 172 Company Statement ofChanges in Equity otheritem, management considers quantitative as well as qualitative factors such as the frequency or predictability of occurrence.
173 Accounting Policies Examples of charges or credits meeting the above definition and which have been presented as exceptional items in the current and or oftheCompany prior years include costs relating to acquisitions which are material to the associated business segment, costs related to strategic disposals 175 Notes to the Company including those previously completed, significant restructuring programmes some of which span multiple years asset, impairment charges Financial Statements and impact of the US Tax Cuts and Job Act 2017.
In the event that other items meet the criteria, which are applied consistently from year to year, they are treated as exceptional and other items.
Other items include amortisation of intangible assets arising onacquisition and valued 182 Subsidiaries and Related Undertakings in accordance withIFRS 3.
These charges are presented separately to improve comparability of the Groups underlying profitability with peer companies.
189 Five Year Summary 190 Alternative Performance Exceptional and other items are disclosed and reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Measures Organic revenue growth 195 Shareholder Information Organic revenue growth is a measure which seeks to reflect the performance of the Group that will contribute to long-term sustainable growth.
As such, organic revenue growth excludes the impact of acquisitions or disposals, fuel price movements and foreign exchange movements.
We focus on the trends in organic revenue growth.
A reconciliation from the growth in reported revenue, the most directly comparable IFRS measures, to the organic revenue growth is set out below.

As such, they exclude the impact of exceptional and other items.
We focus on the trends in underlying operating profit and margins.

EBITDA is defined as the Group profit or loss before depreciation, amortisation, net finance expense and taxation.
Underlying EBITDA is defined as EBITDA before exceptional and other items.
EBITDA is a common measure used by investors and analysts to evaluate the operating financial performance of companies.
We consider EBITDA and underlying EBITDA to be useful measures of our operating performance because they approximate the underlying operating cash flow by eliminating depreciation and amortisation.
EBITDA and underlying EBITDA are not direct measures of our liquidity, which is shown by our cash flow statement, and need to be considered in the context of our financial commitments.
A reconciliation from Group profit to EBITDA and underlying EBITDA, is set out below.

ROIC is calculated by dividing the last twelve months underlying operating profit for ROIC by invested capital for ROIC, both of which are at the same exchange rate which is the average of the last 13 months spot rate.
The invested capital for ROIC is calculated by adding net assets for ROIC and net debt for ROIC, both of which are calculated by averaging their respective balance over the last 13 months.
A reconciliation from underlying operating profit to underlying operating profit for ROIC is set out below.
In addition, a reconciliation from net assets, the most directly comparable IFRS measure, to invested capital for ROIC is set out below.
For the purposes of the ROIC calculation only, the 2017 balance sheet has been presented to show ERO Discontinued Operations separately.
Operating cash flow Operating cash flow is one of the Groups Key Performance Indicators by which our financial performance is measured.
Operating cash flow is defined as the aggregate of cash generated by operations, purchase of property, plant and equipment, purchase of intangible assets less Ontic licences not accounted for under IFRS 3, and proceeds from disposal of property, plant and equipment.
Operating cash flow is primarily an overall operational performance measure.
However, we also believe it is an important indicator of our liquidity.
Operating cash flow reflects the cash we generate from operations after net capital expenditure which is a significant ongoing cash outflow associated with investing in our infrastructure.
In addition, operating cash flow excludes cash flows that are determined at a corporate level independently of ongoing trading operations such as dividends, share buy-backs, acquisitions and disposals, financing costs, tax payments, dividends from associates and the repayment and raising of debt.
Operating cash flow is not a measure of the funds that are available for distribution to shareholders.

190 Alternative Performance Measures Net debt 195 Shareholder Information Net debt consists of borrowings both current and non-current, less cash and cash equivalents, the fair value adjustment on the US private placement senior notes and the fair value adjustment on the US senior notes.
Net debt is a measure of the Groups net indebtedness that provides an indicator of the overall balance sheet strength.
It is also a single measure that can be used to assess both the Groups cash position and its indebtedness.
The use of the term net debt does not necessarily mean that the cash included in the net debt calculation is available to settle the liabilities included in this measure.
Net debt is considered to be an alternative performance measure as it is not defined in IFRS.
The most directly comparable IFRS measure is the aggregate of borrowings current and non-current, and cash and cash equivalents.
