com Warning to shareholders boiler room fraud and other investment scams Share or investment scams are often run from boiler rooms where fraudsters cold-call investors offering them worthless, overpriced or even non-existent shares, or offer to buy their shares in a company at a higher price than the market value.
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount, or offers of free reports about the company.
Even seasoned investors have been caught out by such fraudsters and it is estimated that 200m is lost in this way in the UK each year.
The FCA has some helpful information about such scams on its website, including tips to protect your savings and how to report a suspected investment scam.
