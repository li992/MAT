Sky plc company only financial statements continued All other amounts receivable from subsidiaries are non-interest bearing and are also repayable on demand.

The Companys credit risk is primarily attributable to its other receivables.
The majority of its other receivables balance is due from Sky Operational Finance Limited and Sky UK Limited.
The risk of these entities defaulting on amounts owed is considered low due to Sky Operational Finance Limited being a conduit to pass through intercompany financing and due to Sky UK Limiteds successful operation of pay television broadcasting and home communications services in the UK and Ireland.

Financial risk management Interest rate and foreign exchange risk management The Company manages its exposure to interest rates and foreign exchange movements, which arise from the Companys sources of finance, by selectively entering into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure.
The Company has also entered into derivative contracts on behalf of its subsidiary Sky Group Finance plc, and has back-to-back intercompany contracts.
Foreign exchange risk The following analysis details the Companys sensitivity to movements in pounds sterling against all currencies in which it has significant transactions.
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated financial instruments and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 25% change in foreign currency rates.
A 25% strengthening in pounds sterling against the US dollar would have nil impact on profit 2017: adverse impact of 5 million, relating to non-cash movements in the valuation of derivatives.
The same strengthening would have an adverse impact on other equity of 9 million 2017: adverse impact of 40 million.
A 25% weakening in pounds sterling against the US dollar would have nil impact on profit 2017: beneficial impact of 9 million, relating to non-cash movements in the valuation of derivatives.
The same weakening would have a beneficial impact on other equity of 15 million 2017: beneficial impact of 67 million.
A 25% strengthening in pounds sterling against the euro would have a beneficial impact on profit of 25 million 2017: beneficial impact of 27 million, relating to non-cash movements in the valuation of derivatives.
The same strengthening would have an adverse impact on other equity of 11 million 2017: adverse impact of 12 million.
A 25% weakening in pounds sterling against the euro would have an adverse impact on profit of 41 million 2017: adverse impact of 45 million, relating to non-cash movements in the valuation of derivatives.
The same weakening would have a beneficial impact on other equity of 18 million 2017: beneficial impact of 19 million.
Interest rate risk The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments at the balance sheet date.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
For each one hundred basis point rise or fall in interest rates at 30 June 2018, and if all other variables were held constant, the Companys profit for the year ended 30 June 2018 would decrease or increase by 5 million 2017: decrease or increase by 6 million and other equity reserves would decrease or increase by 15 million 2017: decrease or increase by 22 million.
A one hundred basis point rise or fall in interest rates represents a large but realistic movement which can easily be multiplied to give sensitivities at different interest rates.
The sensitivity analyses provided are hypothetical only and should be used with caution as the impacts provided are not necessarily indicative of the actual impacts that would be experienced because the effect of a change in a particular market variable on fair values or cash flows is calculated without considering interrelationships between the various market rates or mitigating actions that would be taken by the Company.
In addition, the Companys actual exposure to market rates changes as the Companys portfolio of debt changes.
The changes in valuations are estimates of the impact of changes in market variables and are not a prediction of future events or anticipated gains or losses.
Financial risk management continued Liquidity risk See note 22 for the Companys policy on liquidity management.
The following table analyses the Companys non-derivative financial liabilities, net settled interest rate swaps and gross settled currency swaps into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows and may therefore not reconcile to the amounts disclosed on the balance sheet for borrowings, derivative financial instruments and other payables.
