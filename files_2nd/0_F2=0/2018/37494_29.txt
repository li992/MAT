Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2018 177 Notes to the consolidated financialstatements for the year ended 31 December Note 1: Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of Lloyds BankingGroupplc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU.
IFRS comprises accounting standards prefixed IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and those prefixed IAS issued by the IASBs predecessor body as well as interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRSIC and its predecessor body.
As noted below, in adopting IFRS9, the Group has elected to continue applying hedge accounting under IAS39.
TheEU endorsed version of IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement relaxes some of the hedge accounting requirements: the Group has not taken advantage of this relaxation, and therefore there is no difference in application to the Group between IFRS as adopted by the EU and IFRS as issued by the IASB.
The financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of investment properties, financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, trading securities and certain other financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and all derivative contracts.
As stated on page 80, the directors consider that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financialstatements.
The Group has adopted IFRS9 and IFRS 15 with effect from 1 January 2018. i IFRS9 Financial Instruments IFRS9 replaces IAS 39 and addresses classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and liabilities, the impairment of financial assets measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income, expected credit loss provisions for loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts and general hedge accounting.
Impairment: IFRS9 replaces the IAS 39 incurred loss impairment approach with an expected credit loss approach.
The revised approach applies to financial assets including finance lease receivables, recorded at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income: loan commitments and financial guarantees that are not measured at fair value through profit or loss are also in scope.
The expected credit loss approach requires an allowance to be established upon initial recognition of an asset reflecting the level of losses anticipated after having regard to, amongst other things, expected future economic conditions.
Subsequently the amount of the allowance is affected by changes in the expectations of loss driven by changes in associated credit risk.
Classification and measurement: IFRS9 requires financial assets to be classified into one of the following measurement categories: fair value through profit or loss, fair value through other comprehensive income and amortised cost.
Classification is made on the basis of the objectives of the entitys business model for managing its financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the instruments.
The requirements for derecognition are broadly unchanged from IAS 39.
The standard also retains most of the IAS 39 requirements for financial liabilities except for those designated at fair value through profit or loss whereby that part of the fair value change attributable to the entitys own credit risk is recorded in other comprehensive income.
TheGroup early adopted this requirement with effect from 1 January 2017.
General hedge accounting: The new hedge accounting model aims to provide a better link between risk management strategy, the rationale for hedging and the impact of hedging on the financial statements.
The standard does not explicitly address macro hedge accounting solutions, which are being considered in a separate IASB project Accounting for Dynamic Risk Management.
Until this project is finalised, the IASB has provided an accounting policy choice to retain IAS 39 hedge accounting in its entirety or choose to apply the IFRS9 hedge accounting requirements.
The Group has elected to continue applying hedge accounting as set out in IAS 39.
In adopting IFRS 9, the Group has reclassified loans and advances to banks with a maturity of less than three months totalling 2,274million to financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss, resulting in a corresponding reduction in cash and cash equivalents at 1 January 2018 compared to the amount previously reported at 31 December 2017. ii IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 has replaced IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 Construction Contracts.
The core principle of IFRS 15 is that revenue reflects the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled.
The recognition of such revenue is in accordance with five steps to: identify the contract: identify the performance obligations: determine the transaction price: allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations: and recognise revenue when the performance obligations are satisfied.
Details of the impact of adoption of IFRS9 and IFRS 15 are provided in note 54.
Details of those IFRS pronouncements which will be relevant to the Group but which were not effective at 31December 2018 and which have not been applied in preparing these financial statements are given in note 55.
Note 2: Accounting policies The Groups accounting policies are set out below.
These accounting policies have been applied consistently.
A Consolidation The assets, liabilities and results of Group undertakings including structured entities are included in the financial statements on the basis of accounts made up to the reporting date.
Group undertakings include subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.
Details of the Groups subsidiaries and related undertakings are given on pages 289 to 295.
1 Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it has power over the entity, is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity, and has the ability to affect those returns through the exercise of its power.
This generally accompanies a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights although in certain circumstances a holding of less than one half of the voting rights may still result in the ability of the Group to exercise control.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an entity if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to any of the above elements.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group: they are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
The Group consolidates collective investment vehicles if its beneficial ownership interests give it substantive rights to remove the external fund manager over the investment activities of the fund.
Where a subsidiary of the Group is the fund manager of a collective investment vehicle, the Group considers a number of factors in determining whether it acts as principal, and therefore controls the collective investment vehicle, including: an assessment of the scope of the Groups decision making authority over the investment vehicle: the rights held by other parties including substantive removal rights without cause over the Group acting as fund manager: the remuneration to which the Group is entitled in its capacity as decision maker: and the Groups exposure to variable returns from the beneficial interest it holds in the investment vehicle.
Consolidation may be appropriate in circumstances where the Group has 178 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Notes to the consolidated financialstatements continued Note 2: Accounting policies continued less than a majority beneficial interest.
Where a collective investment vehicle is consolidated the interests of parties other than the Group are reported in other liabilities and the movement in these interests in interest expense.
Structured entities are entities that are designed so that their activities are not governed by way of voting rights.
In assessing whether the Group has power over such entities in which it has an interest, the Group considers factors such as the purpose and design of the entity: its practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the entity: the nature of the relationship with the entity: and the size of its exposure to the variability of returns of theentity.
The treatment of transactions with noncontrolling interests depends on whether, as a result of the transaction, the Group loses control of the subsidiary.
Changes in the parents ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions: any difference between the amount by which the noncontrolling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the parent entity.
Where the Group loses control of the subsidiary, at the date when control is lost the amount of any noncontrolling interest in that former subsidiary is derecognised and any investment retained in the former subsidiary is remeasured to its fair value: the gain or loss that is recognised in profit or loss on the partial disposal of the subsidiary includes the gain or loss on the remeasurement of the retainedinterest.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations by the Group.
The consideration for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group.
The consideration includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement.
Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred except those relating to the issuance of debt instruments see E 5 below or share capital see P below.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair value at the acquisition date.
2 Joint ventures and associates Joint ventures are joint arrangements over which the Group has joint control with other parties and has rights to the net assets of the arrangements.
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity, but is not control or joint control of those policies, and is generally achieved through holding between 20 percent and 50percent of the voting share capital of the entity.
The Group utilises the venture capital exemption for investments where significant influence or joint control is present and the business unit operates as a venture capital business.
These investments are designated at initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss.
Otherwise, the Groups investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for by the equity method of accounting.
B Goodwill Goodwill arises on business combinations and represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Where the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity is greater than the cost of acquisition, the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset at cost and is tested at least annually for impairment.
If an impairment is identified the carrying value of the goodwill is written down immediately through the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
At the date of disposal of a subsidiary, the carrying value of attributable goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal.
C Other intangible assets Intangible assets which have been determined to have a finite useful life are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful life as follows: up to 7 years for capitalised software: 10 to 15 years for brands and other intangibles.
Intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed at each reporting date to assess whether there is any indication that they are impaired.
If any such indication exists the recoverable amount of the asset is determined and in the event that the assets carrying amount is greater than its recoverable amount, it is written down immediately.
Certain brands have been determined to have an indefinite useful life and are not amortised.
Such intangible assets are reassessed annually to reconfirm that an indefinite useful life remains appropriate.
In the event that an indefinite life is inappropriate a finite life is determined and an impairment review is performed on the asset.
D Revenue recognition 1 Net interest income Interest income and expense are recognised in the income statement for all interestbearing financial instruments using the effective interest method, except for those classified at fair value through profit or loss.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or liability and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the expected life of the financial instrument.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset before adjusting for expected credit losses or to the amortised cost of the financial liability, including early redemption fees, and related penalties, and premiums and discounts that are an integral part of the overall return.
Direct incremental transaction costs related to the acquisition, issue or disposal of a financial instrument are also taken into account.
Interest income from noncredit impaired financial assets is recognised by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of the asset: for credit impaired financial assets, the effective interest rate is applied to the net carrying amount after deducting the allowance for expected credit losses.
Impairment policies are set out in H below.
2 Fee and commission income and expense Fees and commissions receivable which are not an integral part of the effective interest rate are recognised as income as the Group fulfils its performance obligations.
The Groups principal performance obligations arising from contracts with customers are in respect of value added current accounts, credit cards and debit cards.
These fees are received, and the Groups provides the service, monthly: the fees are recognised in income on this basis.
The Group also receives certain fees in respect of its asset finance business where the performance obligations are typically fulfilled towards the end of the customer contract: these fees are recognised in income on this basis.
Where it is unlikely that the loan commitments will be drawn, loan commitment fees are recognised in fee and commission income over the life of the facility, rather than as an adjustment to the effective interest rate for loans expected to be drawn.
Incremental costs incurred to generate fee and commission income are charged to fees and commissions expense as they are incurred.
3 Other Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Revenue recognition policies specific to trading income are set out in E 3 below, life insurance and general insurance business are detailed below see M below : those relating to leases are set out in J 2 below.
Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2018 179 Note 2: Accounting policies continued E Financial assets and liabilities On initial recognition, financial assets are classified as measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss, depending on the Groups business model for managing the financial assets and whether the cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest.
The Group assesses its business models at a portfolio level based on its objectives for the relevant portfolio, how the performance of the portfolio is managed and reported, and the frequency of asset sales.
Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when considering their cash flow characteristics.
The Group reclassifies financial assets when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes.
A reclassification will only take place when the change is significant to the Groups operations and will occur at a portfolio level and not for individual instruments: reclassifications are expected to be rare.
Equity investments are measured at fair value through profit or loss unless the Group elects at initial recognition to account for the instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income.
For these instruments, principally strategic investments, dividends are recognised in profit or loss but fair value gains and losses are not subsequently reclassified to profit or loss following derecognition of the investment.
The Group initially recognises loans and advances, deposits, debt securities in issue and subordinated liabilities when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Regular way purchases and sales of securities and other financial assets and trading liabilities are recognised on trade date, being the date that the Group is committed to purchase or sell anasset.
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual right to receive cash flows from those assets has expired or when the Group has transferred its contractual right to receive the cash flows from the assets and either: substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred: or the Group has neither retained nor transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards, but has transferred control.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires.
1 Financial instruments measured at amortised cost Financial assets that are held to collect contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost.
A basic lending arrangement results in contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
Where the contractual cash flows introduce exposure to risks or volatility unrelated to a basic lending arrangement such as changes in equity prices or commodity prices, the payments do not comprise solely principal and interest.
Financial assets measured at amortised cost are predominantly loans and advances to customers and banks together with certain debt securities.
Loans and advances are initially recognised when cash is advanced to the borrower at fair value inclusive of transaction costs.
Interest income is accounted for using the effective interest method see D above.
Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, except for trading liabilities and other financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition which are held at fair value.
2 Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income Financial assets that are held to collect contractual cash flows and for subsequent sale, where the assets cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are recognised in the balance sheet at their fair value, inclusive of transaction costs.
Interest calculated using the effective interest method and foreign exchange gains and losses on assets denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
All other gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, until the financial asset is either sold or matures, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in the income statement other than in respect of equity shares, for which the cumulative revaluation amount is transferred directly to retained profits.
The Group recognises a charge for expected credit losses in the income statement see H below.
As the asset is measured at fair value, the charge does not adjust the carrying value of the asset, it is reflected in other comprehensive income.
3 Financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets are classified at fair value through profit or loss where they do not meet the criteria to be measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income or where they are designated at fair value through profit or loss to reduce an accounting mismatch.
All derivatives are carried at fair value through profit or loss.
The assets backing the insurance and investment contracts issued by the Group do not meet the criteria to be measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income as they are managed on a fair value basis and accordingly are measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Similarly, trading securities, which are debt securities and equity shares acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term or which are part of a portfolio which is managed for short-term gains, do not meet these criteria and are also measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in the balance sheet at their fair value.
Fair value gains and losses together with interest coupons and dividend income are recognised in the income statement within net trading income.
Financial liabilities are measured at fair value through profit or loss where they are trading liabilities or where they are designated at fair value through profit or loss in order to reduce an accounting mismatch: where the liabilities are part of a group of liabilities or assets and liabilities which is managed, and its performance evaluated, on a fair value basis: or where the liabilities contain one or more embedded derivatives that significantly modify the cash flows arising under the contract and would otherwise need to be separately accounted for.
Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in the balance sheet at their fair value.
Fair value gains and losses are recognised in the income statement within net trading income in the period in which they occur, except that gains and losses attributable to changes in own credit risk are recognised in other comprehensive income.
The fair values of assets and liabilities traded in active markets are based on current bid and offer prices respectively.
If the market is not active the Group establishes a fair value by using valuation techniques.
The fair values of derivative financial instruments are adjusted where appropriate to reflect credit risk via credit valuation adjustments CVAs, debit valuation adjustments DVAs and funding valuation adjustments FVAs, market liquidity and other risks.
4 Borrowings Borrowings which include deposits from banks, customer deposits, debt securities in issue and subordinated liabilities are recognised initially at fair value, being their issue proceeds net of transaction costs incurred.
These instruments are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective interestmethod.
Preference shares and other instruments which carry a mandatory coupon or are redeemable on a specific date are classified as financial liabilities.
Thecoupon on these instruments is recognised in the income statement as interest expense.
Securities which carry a discretionary coupon and have no fixed maturity or redemption date are classified as other equity instruments.
Interest payments on these securities are recognised, net of tax, as distributions from equity in the period in which they are paid.
An exchange of financial liabilities on substantially different terms is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability.
The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability extinguished and the new financial liability is recognised in profit or loss together with any related costs or fees incurred.
When a financial liability is exchanged for an equity instrument, the new equity instrument is recognised at fair value and any difference between the carrying value of the liability and the fair value of the new equity is recognised in profit or loss.
180 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Notes to the consolidated financialstatements continued Note 2: Accounting policies continued 5 Sale and repurchase agreements including securities lending and borrowing Securities sold subject to repurchase agreements repos continue to be recognised on the balance sheet where substantially all of the risks and rewards are retained.
Funds received under these arrangements are included in deposits from banks, customer deposits, or trading liabilities.
Conversely, securities purchased under agreements to resell reverse repos, where the Group does not acquire substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership, are recorded as loans and advances measured at amortised cost or trading securities.
The difference between sale and repurchase price is treated as interest and accrued over the life of the agreements using the effective interest method.
Securities borrowing and lending transactions are typically secured: collateral takes the form of securities or cash advanced or received.
Securities lent to counterparties are retained on the balance sheet.
Securities borrowed are not recognised on the balance sheet, unless these are sold to third parties, in which case the obligation to return them is recorded at fair value as a trading liability.
Cash collateral given or received is treated as a loan and advance measured at amortised cost or customer deposit.
F Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting As permitted by IFRS9, the Group continues to apply the requirements of IAS39 to its hedging relationships.
All derivatives are recognised at their fair value.
Derivatives are carried on the balance sheet as assets when their fair value is positive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative.
Refer to note49 3 Financial instruments: Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value fordetails of valuation techniques and significant inputs to valuationmodels.
Changes in the fair value of all derivative instruments, other than those in effective cash flow and net investment hedging relationships, are recognised immediately in the income statement.
As noted in 2 and 3 below, the change in fair value of a derivative in an effective cash flow or net investment hedging relationship is allocated between the income statement and other comprehensive income.
Derivatives embedded in a financial asset are not considered separately: the financial asset is considered in its entirety when determining whether its cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest.
Derivatives embedded in financial liabilities and insurance contracts unless the embedded derivative is itself an insurance contract are treated as separate derivatives when their economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not carried at fair value through profit or loss.
These embedded derivatives are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
In accordance with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts, a policyholders option to surrender an insurance contract for a fixed amount is not treated as an embedded derivative.
Hedge accounting allows one financial instrument, generally a derivative such as a swap, to be designated as a hedge of another financial instrument such as a loan or deposit or a portfolio of such instruments.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, formal documentation is drawn up specifying the hedging strategy, the hedged item, the hedging instrument and the methodology that will be used to measure the effectiveness of the hedge relationship in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flow of the hedged risk.
The effectiveness of the hedging relationship is tested both at inception and throughout its life and if at any point it is concluded thatit is no longer highly effective in achieving its documented objective, hedge accounting is discontinued.
Note 17 provides details of the types of derivatives held by the Group and presents separately those designated in hedge relationships.
Further information on hedge accounting is set out below.
1 Fair value hedges Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk: this also applies if the hedged asset is classified as a financial asset at fair value through other comprehensive income.
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are no longer recognised in the income statement.
The cumulative adjustment that has been made tothe carrying amount of the hedged item is amortised to the income statement using the effective interest method over the period tomaturity.
2 Cash flow hedges The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income in the cash flow hedge reserve.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the income statement in the periods in which the hedged item affects profit or loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised in the income statement when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
3 Net investment hedges Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges.
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income, the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
The hedging instrument used in net investment hedges may include non-derivative liabilities as well as derivativefinancial instruments.
G Offset Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right of set-off and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Cash collateral on exchange traded derivative transactions is presented gross unless the collateral cash flows are always settled net with the derivative cash flows.
In certain situations, even though master netting agreements exist, the lack of management intention to settle on a net basis results in the financial assets and liabilities being reported gross on the balancesheet.
H Impairment of financial assets The impairment charge in the income statement includes the change in expected credit losses and certain fraud costs.
Expected credit losses are recognised for loans and advances to customers and banks, other financial assets held at amortised cost, financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, and certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts.
Expected credit losses are calculated as an unbiased and probability-weighted estimate using an appropriate probability of default, adjusted to take into account a range of possible future economic scenarios, and applying this to the estimated exposure of the Group at the point of default after taking into account the value of any collateral held, repayments, or other mitigants of loss and including the impact of discounting using the effective interest rate.
At initial recognition, allowance or provision in the case of some loan commitments and financial guarantees is made for expected credit losses resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months 12-month expected credit losses.
In the event of a significant increase in credit risk since origination, allowance or provision is made for expected credit losses resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument lifetime expected credit losses.
Financial assets where 12-month expected credit losses are recognised are considered to be Stage 1: financial Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2018 181 Note 2: Accounting policies continued assets which are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition are in Stage 2: and financial assets which have defaulted or are otherwise considered to be credit impaired are allocated to Stage 3.
Some Stage 3 assets, mainly in Commercial Banking, are subject to individual rather than collective assessment.
Such cases are subject to a risk-based impairment sanctioning process, and these are reviewed and updated at least quarterly, or more frequently if there is a significant change in the credit profile.
An assessment of whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition considers the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining expected life of the financial instrument.
The assessment is unbiased, probability-weighted and uses forward-looking information consistent with that used in the measurement of expected credit losses.
In determining whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk, the Group uses quantitative tests based on relative and absolute probability of default PD movements linked to internal credit ratings together with qualitative indicators such as watchlists and other indicators of historical delinquency, credit weakness or financial difficulty.
However, unless identified at an earlier stage, the credit risk of financial assets is deemed to have increased significantly when more than 30 days past due.
Where the credit risk subsequently improves such that it no longer represents a significant increase in credit risk since origination, the asset is transferred back to Stage 1.
Assets are transferred to Stage 3 when they have defaulted or are otherwise considered to be credit impaired.
Default is considered to have occurred when there is evidence that the customer is experiencing financial difficulty which is likely to affect significantly the ability to repay the amount due.
IFRS9 contains a rebuttable presumption that default occurs no later than when a payment is 90 days past due.
The Group uses this 90 day backstop for all its products except for UK mortgages.
For UK mortgages, the Group uses a backstop of 180 days past due as mortgage exposures more than 90days past due, but less than 180 days, typically show high cure rates and this aligns with the Groups risk management practices.
In certain circumstances, the Group will renegotiate the original terms of a customers loan, either as part of an ongoing customer relationship or in response to adverse changes in the circumstances of the borrower.
In the latter circumstances, the loan will remain classified as either Stage 2 or Stage 3 until the credit risk has improved such that it no longer represents a significant increase since origination for a return to Stage 1, or the loan is no longer credit impaired for a return to Stage 2.
Renegotiation may also lead to the loan and associated allowance being derecognised and a new loan being recognised initially at fair value.
Purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets POCI are financial assets that are purchased or originated at a deep discount that reflects incurred credit losses.
At initial recognition, POCI assets do not carry an impairment allowance: instead, lifetime expected credit losses are incorporated into the calculation of the effective interest rate.
All changes in lifetime expected credit losses subsequent to the assets initial recognition are recognised as an impairment charge.
A loan or advance is normally written off, either partially or in full, against the related allowance when the proceeds from realising any available security have been received or there is no realistic prospect of recovery and the amount of the loss has been determined.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off decrease the amount of impairment losses recorded in the income statement.
For both secured and unsecured retail balances, the write-off takes place only once an extensive set of collections processes has been completed, or the status of the account reaches a point where policy dictates that continuing attempts to recover are no longer appropriate.
For commercial lending, a write-off occurs if the loan facility with the customer is restructured, the asset is under administration and the only monies that can be received are the amounts estimated by the administrator, the underlying assets are disposed and a decision is made that no further settlement monies will be received, or external evidence for example, third party valuations is available that there has been an irreversible decline in expected cash flows.
I Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment other than investment property is included at cost less accumulated depreciation.
The value of land included in premises is not depreciated.
Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the difference between the cost andthe residual value over their estimated useful lives, as follows: the shorter of 50 years and the remaining period of the lease for freehold long and short leasehold premises: the shorter of 10 years and, if lease renewal is not likely, the remaining period of the lease for leasehold improvements: 10to20 years for fixtures and furnishings: and 2 to 8 years for other equipment and motor vehicles.
The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
Assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
In the event that an assets carrying amount is determined to be greater than its recoverable amount it is written down immediately.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
Investment property comprises freehold and long leasehold land and buildings that are held either to earn rental income or for capital accretion or both, primarily within the life insurance funds.
In accordance with the guidance published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, investment property is carried at fair value based on current prices for similar properties, adjusted for the specific characteristics of the property such as location or condition.
If this information is not available, the Group uses alternative valuation methods such as discounted cash flow projections or recent prices in less active markets.
These valuations are reviewed at least annually by independent professionally qualified valuers.
Investment property being redeveloped for continuing use as investment property, or for which the market has become less active, continues to be valued at fair value.
J Leases 1 As lessee The leases entered into by the Group are primarily operating leases.
Operating lease rentals payable are charged to the income statement onastraight-line basis over the period of the lease.
When an operating lease is terminated before the end of the lease period, any payment made to the lessor by way of penalty is recognised asanexpense in the period of termination.
2 As lessor Assets leased to customers are classified as finance leases if the lease agreements transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee but not necessarily legal title.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
When assets are subject to finance leases, the present value of the lease payments, together with any unguaranteed residual value, is recognised as a receivable, net of allowances for expected credit losses, within loans and advances to banks and customers.
The difference between the gross receivable and the present value of the receivable is recognised as unearned finance lease income.
Finance lease income is recognised in interest income over the term of the lease using the net investment method before tax so as to give a constant rate of return on the net investment in the leases.
Unguaranteed residual values are reviewed regularly to identify any impairment.
Operating lease assets are included within tangible fixed assets at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives, which equates to the lives of the leases, after taking into account anticipated residual values.
Operating lease rental income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of thelease.
The Group evaluates non-lease arrangements such as outsourcing and similar contracts to determine if they contain a lease which is then accounted forseparately.
182 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Notes to the consolidated financialstatements continued Note 2: Accounting policies continued K Employee benefits Shortterm employee benefits, such as salaries, paid absences, performancebased cash awards and social security costs are recognised over the period in which the employees provide the related services.
1 Pension schemes The Group operates a number of postretirement benefit schemes for its employees including both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans.
A defined benefit scheme is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and salary.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan into which the Group pays fixed contributions: there is no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions.
Scheme assets are included at their fair value and scheme liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit method.
The defined benefit scheme liabilities are discounted using rates equivalent to the market yields at the balance sheet date on highquality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pensionliability.
The Groups income statement charge includes the current service cost of providing pension benefits, past service costs, net interest expense income, and plan administration costs that are not deducted from the return on plan assets.
Past service costs, which represents the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from a plan amendment or curtailment, are recognised when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs.
Net interest expense income is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset.
Remeasurements, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets excluding amounts included in net interest expense income and net of the cost of managing the plan assets, and the effect of changes to the asset ceiling if applicable are reflected immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Remeasurements recognised in other comprehensive income are reflected immediately in retained profits and will not subsequently be reclassified to profit or loss.
The Groups balance sheet includes the net surplus or deficit, being the difference between the fair value of scheme assets and the discounted value of scheme liabilities at the balance sheet date.
Surpluses are only recognised to the extent that they are recoverable through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the schemes.
In assessing whether a surplus is recoverable, the Group considers its current right to obtain a refund or a reduction in future contributions and does not anticipate any future acts by other parties that could change the amount of the surplus that may ultimately be recovered.
The costs of the Groups defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement in the period in which they fall due.
2 Share-based compensation The Group operates a number of equitysettled, sharebased compensation plans in respect of services received from certain of its employees.
The value of the employee services received in exchange for equity instruments granted under these plans is recognised as an expense over the vesting period of the instruments, with a corresponding increase in equity.
This expense is determined by reference to the fair value of the number of equity instruments that are expected to vest.
The fair value of equity instruments granted is based on market prices, if available, at the date of grant.
In the absence of market prices, the fair value of the instruments at the date of grant is estimated using an appropriate valuation technique, such as a BlackScholes option pricing model or a Monte Carlo simulation.
The determination of fair values excludes the impact of any nonmarket vesting conditions, which are included in the assumptions used to estimate the number of options that are expected to vest.
At each balance sheet date, this estimate is reassessed and if necessary revised.
Any revision of the original estimate is recognised in the income statement, together with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Cancellations by employees of contributions to the Groups Save As You Earn plans are treated as nonvesting conditions and the Group recognises, in the year of cancellation, the amount of the expense that would have otherwise been recognised over the remainder of the vesting period.
Modifications are assessed at the date of modification and any incremental charges are charged to the incomestatement.
L T axation Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax.
Current and deferred tax are charged or credited in the income statement except to the extent that the tax arises from a transaction or event which is recognised, in the same or a different period, outside the income statement either in other comprehensive income, directly in equity, or through a business combination, in which case the tax appears in the same statement as the transaction that gave rise to it.
Current tax is the amount of corporate income taxes expected to be payable or recoverable based on the profit for the period as adjusted for items that are not taxable or not deductible, and is calculated using tax rates and laws that were enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Current tax includes amounts provided in respect of uncertain tax positions when management expects that, upon examination of the uncertainty by HerMajestys Revenue and Customs HMRC or other relevant tax authority, it is more likely than not that an economic outflow will occur.
Provisions reflect managements best estimate of the ultimate liability based on their interpretation of tax law, precedent and guidance, informed by external tax advice as necessary.
Changes in facts and circumstances underlying these provisions are reassessed at each balance sheet date, and the provisions are remeasured as required to reflect current information.
For the Groups longterm insurance businesses, the tax expense is analysed between tax that is payable in respect of policyholders returns and tax that is payable on the shareholders returns.
This allocation is based on an assessment of the rates of tax which will be applied to the returns under the current UK tax rules.
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the balance sheet.
Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and which are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences but not recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries where the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised on temporary differences that arise from goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised, and are reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised in respect of temporary differences that arise on initial recognition of assets and liabilities acquired other than in a business combination.
Deferred tax is not discounted.
Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2018 183 Note 2: Accounting policies continued M Insurance The Group undertakes both life insurance and general insurance business.
Insurance and participating investment contracts are accounted for under IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts, which permits with certain exceptions the continuation of accounting practices for measuring insurance and participating investment contracts that applied prior to the adoption of IFRS.
The Group, therefore, continues to account for these products using UKGAAP and UK established practice.
Products sold by the life insurance business are classified into three categories: Insurance contracts these contracts transfer significant insurance risk and may also transfer financial risk.
The Group defines significant insurance risk as the possibility of having to pay benefits on the occurrence of an insured event which are significantly more than the benefits payable if the insured event were not to occur.
These contracts may or may not include discretionary participation features.
Investment contracts containing a discretionary participation feature participating investment contracts these contracts do not transfer significant insurance risk, but contain a contractual right which gives the holder the right to receive, in addition to the guaranteed benefits, further additional discretionary benefits or bonuses that are likely to be a significant proportion of the total contractual benefits and the amount and timing of which is at the discretion of the Group, within the constraints of the terms and conditions of the instrument and based upon the performance of specifiedassets.
Non-participating investment contracts these contracts do not transfer significant insurance risk or contain a discretionary participation feature.
The general insurance business issues only insurance contracts.
1 Life insurance business i Accounting for insurance and participating investment contracts Premiums and claims Premiums received in respect of insurance and participating investment contracts are recognised as revenue when due except for unit-linked contracts on which premiums are recognised as revenue when received.
Claims are recorded as an expense on the earlier of the maturity date orthe date on which the claim is notified.
Liabilities Changes in the value of liabilities are recognised in the income statement through insurance claims.
Insurance and participating investment contracts in the Groups with-profit funds Liabilities of the Groups with-profit funds, including guarantees and options embedded within products written by these funds, are stated at their realistic values in accordance with the Prudential Regulation Authoritys realistic capital regime, except that projected transfers out of the funds into other Group funds are recorded in the unallocated surplus see below.
Insurance and participating investment contracts which are not unit-linked or in the Groups with-profit funds A liability for contractual benefits that are expected to be incurred in the future is recorded when the premiums are recognised.
The liability is calculated by estimating the future cash flows over the duration of in-force policies and discounting them back to the valuation date allowing for probabilities of occurrence.
The liability will vary with movements in interest rates and with the cost of life insurance and annuity benefits where future mortality is uncertain.
Assumptions are made in respect of all material factors affecting future cash flows, including future interest rates, mortality and costs.
Insurance and participating investment contracts which are unit-linked Liabilities for unit-linked insurance contracts and participating investment contracts are stated at the bid value of units plus an additional allowance where appropriate such as for any excess of future expenses over charges.
The liability is increased or reduced by the change in the unit prices and is reduced by policy administration fees, mortality and surrender charges and any withdrawals.
Benefit claims in excess of the account balances incurred in the period are also charged through insurance claims.
Revenue consists of fees deducted for mortality, policy administration and surrender charges.
Unallocated surplus Any amounts in the with-profit funds not yet determined as being due to policyholders or shareholders are recognised as an unallocated surplus which is shown separately from liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts.
ii Accounting for non-participating investment contracts The Groups non-participating investment contracts are primarily unit-linked.
These contracts are accounted for as financial liabilities whose value iscontractually linked to the fair values of financial assets within the Groups unitised investment funds.
The value of the unit-linked financial liabilities is determined using current unit prices multiplied by the number of units attributed to the contract holders at the balance sheet date.
Their value is never less than the amount payable on surrender, discounted for the required notice period where applicable.
Investment returns including movements in fair value and investment income allocated to those contracts are recognised in the income statement through insurance claims.
Deposits and withdrawals are not accounted for through the income statement but are accounted for directly in the balance sheet as adjustments to the non-participating investment contract liability.
The Group receives investment management fees in the form of an initial adjustment or charge to the amount invested.
These fees are in respect of services rendered in conjunction with the issue and management of investment contracts where the Group actively manages the consideration received from its customers to fund a return that is based on the investment profile that the customer selected on origination of the contract.
These services comprise an indeterminate number of acts over the lives of the individual contracts and, therefore, the Group defers these fees and recognises them over the estimated lives of the contracts, in line with the provision of investment management services.
Costs which are directly attributable and incremental to securing new non-participating investment contracts are deferred.
This asset is subsequently amortised over the period of the provision of investment management services and its recoverability is reviewed in circumstances where its carrying amount may not be recoverable.
If the asset is greater than its recoverable amount it is written down immediately through fee and commission expense in the income statement.
All other costs are recognised as expenses when incurred.
iii V alue of in-force business The Group recognises as an asset the value of in-force business in respect of insurance contracts and participating investment contracts.
The asset represents the present value of the shareholders interest in the profits expected to emerge from those contracts written at the balance sheet date.
This is determined after making appropriate assumptions about future economic and operating conditions such as future mortality and persistency rates and includes allowances for both non-market risk and for the realistic value of financial options and guarantees.
Each cash flow is valued using the discount rate 184 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Notes to the consolidated financialstatements continued Note 2: Accounting policies continued consistent with that applied to such a cash flow in the capital markets.
The asset in the consolidated balance sheet is presented gross of attributable tax and movements in the asset are reflected within other operating income in the incomestatement.
The Groups contractual rights to benefits from providing investment management services in relation to non-participating investment contracts acquired in business combinations and portfolio transfers are measured at fair value at the date of acquisition.
The resulting asset is amortised over the estimated lives of the contracts.
At each reporting date an assessment is made to determine if there is any indication of impairment.
Where impairment exists, the carrying value of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount and the impairment loss recognised in the income statement.
2 General insurance business The Group both underwrites and acts as intermediary in the sale of general insurance products.
Underwriting premiums are included in insurance premium income, net of refunds, in the period in which insurance cover is provided to the customer: premiums received relating to future periods are deferred in the balance sheet within liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts on a basis that reflects the length of time for which contracts have been in force and the projected incidence of risk over the term of the contract and only credited to the income statement when earned.
Broking commission is recognised when the underwriter accepts the risk of providing insurance cover to the customer.
Where appropriate, provision is made for the effect of future policy terminations based upon pastexperience.
The underwriting business makes provision for the estimated cost of claims notified but not settled and claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date.
The provision for the cost of claims notified but not settled is based upon a best estimate of the cost of settling the outstanding claims after taking into account all known facts.
In those cases where there is insufficient information to determine the required provision, statistical techniques are used which take into account the cost of claims that have recently been settled and make assumptions about the future development of the outstanding cases.
Similar statistical techniques are used to determine the provision for claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date.
3 Liability adequacy test At each balance sheet date liability adequacy tests are performed to ensure the adequacy of insurance and participating investment contract liabilities net of related deferred cost assets and value of in-force business.
In performing these tests current best estimates of discounted future contractual cash flows and claims handling and policy administration expenses, as well as investment income from the assets backing such liabilities, are used.
Any deficiency is immediately charged to the income statement, initially by writing off the relevant assets and subsequently byestablishing a provision for losses arising from liability adequacy tests.
4 Reinsurance Contracts entered into by the Group with reinsurers under which the Group is compensated for benefits payable on one or more contracts issued by the Group are recognised as assets arising from reinsurance contracts held.
Where the underlying contracts issued by the Group are classified as insurance contracts and the reinsurance contract transfers significant insurance risk on those contracts to the reinsurer, the assets arising from reinsurance contracts held are classified as insurance contracts.
Where the underlying contracts issued by the Group are classified as non-participating investment contracts and the reinsurance contract transfers financial risk on those contracts to the reinsurer, the assets arising from reinsurance contracts held are classified as nonparticipating investment contracts.
Assets arising from reinsurance contracts held Classified as insurance contracts Amounts recoverable from or due to reinsurers are measured consistently with the amounts associated with the reinsured contracts and in accordance with the terms of each reinsurance contract and are regularly reviewed for impairment.
Premiums payable for reinsurance contracts are recognised as an expense when due within insurance premium income.
Changes in the reinsurance recoverable assets are recognised in the income statement through insurance claims.
Assets arising from reinsurance contracts held Classified as non-participating investment contracts These contracts are accounted for as financial assets whose value is contractually linked to the fair values of financial assets within the reinsurers investment funds.
Investment returns including movements in fair value and investment income allocated to these contracts are recognised in insurance claims.
Deposits and withdrawals are not accounted for through the income statement but are accounted for directly in the balance sheet as adjustments to the assets arising from reinsurance contracts held.
N Foreign currency translation Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the appropriate functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when recognised in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow or net investment hedges.
Non-monetary assets that are measured at fair value are translated using the exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined.
Translation differences on equities and similar non-monetary items held at fair value through profit and loss are recognised in profit or loss as part of the fair value gain or loss.
Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, such as equity shares, are included in the fair value reserve in equity unless the asset is a hedged item in a fair value hedge.
The results and financial position of all group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into thepresentation currency as follows: the assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity, are translated into sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date: and the income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into sterling at average exchange rates unless these do not approximate to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange differences arising on the translation of a foreign operation are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity together with exchange differences arising from the translation of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments see F 3 above.
On disposal or liquidation of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount of exchangedifferences relating to that foreign operation are reclassified from equity and included in determining the profit or loss arising on disposal orliquidation.
O Provisions and contingent liabilities Provisions are recognised in respect of present obligations arising from past events where it is probable that outflows of resources will be required to settle the obligations and they can be reliably estimated.
Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2018 185 Note 2: Accounting policies continued Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence depends on the outcome of uncertain future events or those present obligations where the outflows of resources are uncertain or cannot be measured reliably.
Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed unless they are remote.
Provision is made for expected credit losses in respect of irrevocable undrawn loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts see H above.
P Share capital Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options or to the acquisition of a business are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Dividends paid on the Groups ordinary shares are recognised as a reduction in equity in the period in which they are paid.
Where the Company or any member of the Group purchases the Companys share capital, the consideration paid is deducted from shareholders equityas treasury shares until they are cancelled: if these shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received is included in shareholdersequity.
Q Cash and cash equivalents For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and non-mandatory balances with central banks and amounts due from banks with a maturity of less than three months.
Note 3: Critical accounting judgements and estimates The preparation of the Groups financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions in applying the accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Due to the inherent uncertainty in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be based upon amounts which differ from those estimates.
Estimates, judgements and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The significant judgements made by management in applying the Groups accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty in these financial statements, which together are deemed critical to the Groups results and financial position, are as follows: Allowance for impairment losses At 31 December 2018 the Groups expected credit loss allowance was 3,362million 1 January 2018: 3,533million, of which 3,169 million 1January 2018: 3,260million was in respect of drawn balances.
The calculation of the Groups expected credit loss ECL allowances and provisions against loan commitments and guarantees under IFRS 9 requires the Group to make a number of judgements, assumptions and estimates.
The most significant are set out below.
Definition of default The probability of default PD of an exposure, both over a 12 month period and over its lifetime, is a key input to the measurement of the ECL allowance.
Default has occurred when there is evidence that the customer is experiencing significant financial difficulty which is likely to affect the ability to repay amounts due.
The definition of default adopted by the Group is described in note 2 H Impairment of financial assets.
The Group has rebutted the presumption in IFRS 9 that default occurs no later than when a payment is 90 days past due for UK mortgages.
As a result, approximately 0.6billion of UK mortgages were classified as Stage 2 rather than Stage 3 at 31 December 2018: the impact on the Groups ECL allowance was not material.
Lifetime of an exposure The PD of a financial asset is dependent on its expected life.
A range of approaches, segmented by product type, has been adopted by the Group to estimate a products expected life.
These include using the full contractual life and taking into account behavioural factors such as early repayments and refinancing.
For non-revolving retail assets, the Group has assumed the expected life for each product to be the time taken for all significant losses to be observed and for a material proportion of the assets to fully resolve through either closure or write-off.
For retail revolving products, the Group has considered the losses beyond the contractual term over which the Group is exposed to credit risk.
For commercial overdraft facilities, the average behavioural life has been used.
Changes to the assumed expected lives of the Groups assets could have a material effect on the ECL allowance recognised by the Group.
Significant increase in credit risk Performing assets are classified as either Stage 1 or Stage 2.
An ECL allowance equivalent to 12 months expected losses is established against assets in Stage 1: assets classified as Stage 2 carry an ECL allowance equivalent to lifetime expected losses.
Assets are transferred from Stage 1 to Stage 2 when there has been a significant increase in credit risk SICR since initial recognition.
The Group uses a quantitative test together with qualitative indicators to determine whether there has been a SICR for an asset.
For retail, a deterioration in the Retail Master Scale of four grades for credit cards, personal loans or overdrafts, three grades for personal mortgages, or two grades in the CorporateMaster Scale for UK motor finance accounts is treated as a SICR.
For Commercial a doubling of PD with a minimum increase in PD of 1per cent and a resulting change in the underlying grade is treated as a SICR.
All financial assets are assumed to have suffered a SICR if they are more than 30 days past due.
The setting of precise trigger points combined with risk indicators requires judgement.
The use of different trigger points may have a material impact upon the size of the ECL allowance.
The Group monitors the effectiveness of SICR criteria on an ongoing basis.
186 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Notes to the consolidated financialstatements continued Note 3: Critical accounting judgements and estimates continued Origination PDs The assessment of whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk is a relative measure, dependent on an asset's PD at origination.
For assets existing at 1 January 2018, the initial application date of IFRS 9, this information is not generally available and consequently management judgement has been used to determine a reasonable basis for estimating the original PD.
Management used various information sources, including regulatory PDs and credit risk data available at origination, or where this is not available the first available data.
In addition, the Group has not created a forward looking view of PDs at initial recognition for the back book as to do so would involve the use of hindsight and could introduce the risk of bias.
The use of proxies and simplifications is not considered to materially impact the ECL allowance on transition.
Post-model adjustments Limitations in the Groups impairment models or input data may be identified through the on-going assessment and validation of the output of the models.
In these circumstances, management make appropriate adjustments to the Groups allowance for impairment losses.
These adjustments are generally modelled taking into account the particular attributes of the exposure which have not been adequately captured by the primary impairment models.
At 31December 2018, post-model adjustments were mainly related to UK secured lending with no individual adjustment being material.
Forward looking information The measurement of expected credit losses is required to reflect an unbiased probability-weighted range of possible future outcomes.
In order to do this, the Group has developed an economic model to project sixteen key impairment drivers using information derived mainly from external sources.
Thesedrivers include factors such as the unemployment rate, the house price index, commercial property prices and corporate credit spreads.
The model-generated economic scenarios for the six years beyond 2018 are mapped to industry-wide historical loss data by portfolio.
Combined losses across portfolios are used to rank the scenarios by severity of loss.
Fourscenarios from specified points along the loss distribution are selected to reflect the range of outcomes: the central scenario reflects the Groups base case assumptions used for medium-term planning purposes, an upside and a downside scenario are also selected together with a severe downside scenario.
Rare occurrences of adverse economic events can lead to relatively large credit losses which means that typically the most likely outcome is less than the probability-weighted outcome of the range of possible future events.
To allow for this a relatively unlikely severe downside scenario is therefore included.
At 1 January and 31 December 2018, the base case, upside and downside scenarios each carry a 30 per cent weighting: the severe downside scenario is weighted at 10 per cent.
The choice of alternative scenarios and scenario weights is a combination of quantitative analysis and judgemental assessment to ensure that the full range of possible outcomes and material non-linearity of losses are captured.
A committee under the chairmanship of the Chief Economist meets quarterly, to review and, if appropriate, recommend changes to the economic scenarios to the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Risk Officer.
Findings dealing with all aspects of the expected credit loss calculation are presented to the Group Audit Committee.
For each major product grouping models have been developed which utilise historical credit loss data to produce PDs for each scenario: an overall weighted average PD is used to assist in determining the staging of financial assets and related ECL.
The key UK economic assumptions made by the Group as at 31December 2018 averaged over a five-year period are shown below: Severe Base Case Upside Downside downside Economic assumptions % % % % At 31 December 2018 Interest rate 1.25 2.34 1.30 0.71 Unemployment rate 4.5 3.9 5.3 6.9 House price growth 2.5 6.1 4.8 7.5 Commercial real estate price growth 0.4 5.3 4.7 6.4 At 1 January 2018 Interest rate 1.18 2.44 0.84 0.01 Unemployment rate 5.0 4.0 6.1 7.1 House price growth 2.7 7.0 2.4 8.2 Commercial real estate price growth 0.0 3.0 2.5 5.4 The Groups base-case economic scenario has changed little over the year and reflects a broadly stable outlook for the economy.
Although there remains considerable uncertainty about the economic consequences of the UKs planned exit from the European Union, the Group considers that at this stage the range of possible economic outcomes is adequately reflected in its choice and weighting of scenarios.
The averages shown above do not fully reflect the peak to trough changes in the stated assumptions over the period.
The tables below illustrate the variability of the assumptions from the start of the scenario period to the peak and trough.
Severe Base Case Upside Downside Downside Economic assumptions start to peak % % % % At 31 December 2018 Interest rate 1.75 4.00 1.75 1.25 Unemployment rate 4.8 4.3 6.3 8.6 House price growth 13.7 34.9 0.6 1.6 Commercial real estate price growth 0.1 26.9 0.5 0.5 Severe Base Case Upside Downside Downside Economic assumptions start to trough % % % % At 31 December 2018 Interest rate 0.75 0.75 0.75 0.25 Unemployment rate 4.1 3.5 4.3 4.2 House price growth 0.4 2.3 26.5 33.5 Commercial real estate price growth 0.1 0.0 23.8 33.8 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2018 187 Note 3: Critical accounting judgements and estimates continued The table below shows the extent to which a higher ECL allowance has been recognised to take account of forward looking information from the weighted multiple economic scenarios.

All non-modelled provisions, including management judgement, remain unchanged.
Upside Downside m m ECL allowance 2,775 3,573 The impact of changes in the UK unemployment rate and House Price Index HPI have also been assessed.
Although such changes would not be observed in isolation, as economic indicators tend to be correlated in a coherent scenario, this gives insight into the sensitivity of the Groups ECL to changes in these two critical economic factors.
The assessment has been made against the base case with the reported staging unchanged.
The changes to HPI and the unemployment rate have been phased in to the forward-looking economic outlook over three years.

The value of in-force business asset represents the present value of future profits expected to arise from the portfolio of in-force life insurance and participating investment contracts.
The valuation of this asset requires assumptions to be made about future economic and operating conditions which are inherently uncertain and changes could significantly affect the value attributed to this asset.
The methodology used to value this asset and the key assumptions that have been made in determining the carrying value of the value of in-force business asset at 31December 2018 are set out in note 24.
At 31 December 2018, the Group carried total liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts of 98,874 million 2017:103,413million.
The methodology used to value these liabilities is described in note 31.
Elements of the valuations of liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts require management to estimate future investment returns, future mortality rates and future policyholder behaviour.
These estimates are subject to significant uncertainty.
The methodology used to value these liabilities and the key assumptions that have been made in determining their carrying value are set out in note 31.
The effect on the Groups profit before tax and shareholders equity of changes in key assumptions used in determining the life insurance assets and liabilities is set out in note 32.
Defined benefit pension scheme obligations The net asset recognised in the balance sheet at 31 December 2018 in respect of the Groups defined benefit pension scheme obligations was 1,146million comprising an asset of 1,267 million and a liability of 121 million 2017: a net asset of 509 million comprising an asset of 723 million and a liability of 214 million.
The Groups accounting policy for its defined benefit pension scheme obligations is set out in note 2 K. The accounting valuation of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes liabilities requires management to make a number of assumptions.
The key areas of estimation uncertainty are the discount rate applied to future cash flows and the expected lifetime of the schemes members.
The discount rate is required to be set with reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on high quality corporate bonds in the currency and with a term consistent with the defined benefit pension schemes obligations.
The average duration of the schemes obligations is approximately 18 years.
The market for bonds with a similar duration is illiquid and, as a result, significant management judgement is required to determine an appropriate yield curve on which to base the discount rate.
The cost of the benefits payable by the schemes will also depend upon the life expectancy of the members.
The Group considers latest market practice and actual experience in determining the appropriate assumptions for both current mortality expectations and the rate of future mortality improvement.
It is uncertain whether this rate of improvement will be sustained going forward and, as a result, actual experience may differ from current expectations.
The effect on the net accounting surplus or deficit and on the pension charge in the Groups income statement of changes to the principal actuarial assumptions is set out in part iii of note 35.
Recoverability of deferred tax assets At 31 December 2018 the Group carried deferred tax assets on its balance sheet of 2,453 million 2017: 2,284 million principally relating to tax losses carried forward.
188 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Notes to the consolidated financialstatements continued Note 3: Critical accounting judgements and estimates continued Estimation of income taxes includes the assessment of recoverability of deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent they are considered more likely than not to be recoverable based on existing tax laws and forecasts of future taxable profits against which the underlying tax deductions can be utilised.
The Group has recognised a deferred tax asset of 3,778million 2017: 4,034million in respect of UK trading losses carried forward.
Substantially all of these losses have arisen in Bank of Scotland plc and Lloyds Bank plc, and they will be utilised as taxable profits arise in those legal entities in futureperiods.
The Groups expectations as to the level of future taxable profits take into account the Groups long-term financial and strategic plans, and anticipated future tax-adjusting items.
In making this assessment, account is taken of business plans, the Board-approved operating plan and the expected future economic outlook as set out in the strategic report, as well as the risks associated with future regulatory change.
Under current law there is no expiry date for UK trading losses not yet utilised, although since Finance Act 2016 banking losses that arose before 1 April 2015 can only be used against 25percent of taxable profits arising after 1 April 2016, and they cannot be used to reduce the surcharge on banking profits.
This restriction in utilisation means that the value of the deferred tax asset is only expected to be fully recovered by 2033.
It is possible that future tax law changes could materially affect the value of these losses ultimately realised by the Group.
As disclosed in note 36, deferred tax assets totalling 585 million 2017: 683 million have not been recognised in respect of certain capital and trading losses carried forward, unrelieved foreign tax credits and other tax deductions, as there are currently no expected future taxable profits against which these assets can beutilised.
Payment protection insurance and other regulatory provisions At 31December 2018, the Group carried provisions of 2,385million 2017: 4,070million against the cost of making redress payments to customers and the related administration costs in connection with historical regulatory breaches, principally the mis-selling of payment protection insurance 20181,524million: 2017: 2,778million.
Determining the amount of the provisions, which represent managements best estimate of the cost of settling these issues, requires the exercise of significant judgement.
It will often be necessary to form a view on matters which are inherently uncertain, such as the scope of reviews required by regulators, the number of future complaints, the extent to which they will be upheld, the average cost of redress and the impact of legal decisions that may be relevant to claims received.
Consequently the continued appropriateness of the underlying assumptions is reviewed on a regular basis against actual experience and other relevant evidence and adjustments made to the provisions where appropriate.
More detail on the nature of the assumptions that have been made and key sensitivities is set out in note 37.
Fair value of financial instruments At 31 December 2018, the carrying value of the Groups financial instrument assets held at fair value was 206,939million 2017: 230,810 million, and its financial instrument liabilities held at fair value was 51,920million 2017: 77,001 million.
In accordance with IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement, the Group categorises financial instruments carried on the balance sheet at fair value using a three level hierarchy.
Financial instruments categorised as level 1 are valued using quoted market prices and therefore there is minimal judgement applied in determining fair value.
However, the fair value of financial instruments categorised as level 2 and, in particular, level 3 is determined using valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis and valuation models.
The valuation techniques for level 2 and, particularly, level 3 financial instruments involve management judgement and estimates the extent of which depends on the complexity of the instrument and the availability of market observable information.
In addition, in line with market practice, the Group applies credit, debit and funding valuation adjustments in determining the fair value of its uncollateralised derivative positions.
A description of these adjustments is set out in note 49.
Further details of the Groups level 3 financial instruments and the sensitivity of their valuation including the effect of applying reasonably possible alternative assumptions in determining their fair value are also set out in note 49.
Details about sensitivities to market risk arising from trading assets and other treasury positions can be found in the risk management section on page 154.
Note 4: Segmental analysis Lloyds Banking Group provides a wide range of banking and financial services in the UK and in certain locationsoverseas.
The Group Executive Committee GEC has been determined to be the chief operating decision maker for the Group.
The Groups operating segments reflect its organisational and management structures.
The GEC reviews the Groups internal reporting based around these segments in order to assess performance and allocate resources.
GEC considers interest income and expense on a net basis and consequently the total interest income and expense for all reportable segments is presented net.
The segments are differentiated by the type of products provided and by whether the customers are individuals or corporate entities.
The segmental results and comparatives are presented on an underlying basis, the basis reviewed by the chief operating decision maker.
The effects of the following are excluded in arriving at underlyingprofit: losses on redemption of the Enhanced Capital Notes in 2016 and the volatility in the value of the embedded equity conversion feature: market volatility and asset sales, which includes the effects of certain asset sales, the volatility relating to the Groups own debt and hedging arrangements and that arising in the insurance businesses and insurance gross up: the unwind of acquisition-related fair value adjustments and the amortisation of purchased intangible assets: restructuring costs, comprising costs relating to the Simplification programme and the costs of implementing regulatory reform and ring-fencing, the rationalisation of the non-branch property portfolio and the integration of MBNA: and payment protection insurance.
For the purposes of the underlying income statement, operating lease depreciation net of gains on disposal of operating lease assets is shown as an adjustment to total income.
In 2018 charges in relation to other conduct provisions referred to as remediation have been reclassified so that they are now included in underlying profit.
In addition, results in relation to certain assets which are outside the Group's risk appetite, previously reported as part of run-off within Other, have been reclassified into Retail and Commercial.
Comparative figures have been restated accordingly.
The Groups activities are organised into three financial reporting segments: Retail: Commercial Banking: and Insurance and Wealth.
Retail offers a broad range of financial service products, including current accounts, savings, mortgages, motor finance and unsecured consumer lending to personal and small business customers.
Commercial Banking provides a range of products and services such as lending, transactional banking, working capital management, risk management and debt capital markets services to SMEs, corporates and financial institutions.
Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2018 189 Note 4: Segmental analysis continued Insurance and Wealth offers insurance, investment and wealth management products and services.
Other includes certain assets previously reported as outside of the Groups risk appetite and income and expenditure not attributed to divisions, including the costs of certain central and head office functions and the Groups private equity business, Lloyds Development Capital.
Inter-segment services are generally recharged at cost, with the exception of the internal commission arrangements between the UK branch and other distribution networks and the insurance product manufacturing businesses within the Group, where a profit margin is also charged.
Inter-segment lending and deposits are generally entered into at market rates, except that non-interest bearing balances are priced at a rate that reflects the external yield that could be earned on such funds.
For the majority of those derivative contracts entered into by business units for risk management purposes, the business unit recognises the net interest income or expense on an accrual accounting basis and transfers the remainder of the movement in the fair value of the derivative to the central group segment where the resulting accounting volatility is managed where possible through the establishment of hedge accounting relationships.
Any change in fair value of the hedged instrument attributable to the hedged risk is also recorded within the central group segment.

Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Note Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2018 199 Note 12: Auditors remuneration continued The Group has procedures that are designed to ensure auditor independence, including prohibiting certain non-audit services.
All statutory audit work as well as most non-audit assignments must be pre-approved by the audit committee on an individual engagement basis: for certain types of non-audit engagements where the fee is fide minimis the audit committee has pre-approved all assignments subject to confirmation by management.
On a quarterly basis, the audit committee receives and reviews a report detailing all pre-approved services and amounts paid to the auditors for such pre-approved services.

Other changes in credit quality Changes in loss allowance as a result of movements in risk parameters that reflect changes in customer quality, but which have not resulted in a transfer to a different stage.
This also contains the impact on the impairment charge as a result of write-offs and recoveries, where the related loss allowances are reassessed to reflect ultimate realisable or recoverable value.
Additions repayments Expected loss allowances are recognised on origination of new loans or further drawdowns of existing facilities.
Repayments relate to the reduction of loss allowances as a result of repayments of outstanding balances.
Methodology changes Increase or decrease in impairment charge as a result of adjustments to the models used for expected credit loss calculations: either as changes to the model inputs risk parameters or to the underlying assumptions.

For the calculation of diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares that arise in respect of share options and awards granted to employees.
The number of shares that could have been acquired at the average annual share price of the Companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share options and awards is determined.
This is deducted from the number of shares issuable under such options and awards to leave a residual bonus amount of shares which are added to the weighted-average number of ordinary shares in issue, but no adjustment is made to the profit attributable to equityshareholders.
There were no anti-dilutive share options and awards excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share 2017:none: 2016: weighted-average of 0.3million.

204 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Notes to the consolidated financialstatements continued Note 17: Derivative financial instruments continued The principal derivatives used by the Group are as follows: Interest rate related contracts include interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and options.
An interest rate swap is an agreement between two parties to exchange fixed and floating interest payments, based upon interest rates defined in the contract, without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts.
Forward rate agreements are contracts for the payment of the difference between a specified rate of interest and a reference rate, applied to a notional principal amount at a specific date in the future.
An interest rate option gives the buyer, on payment of a premium, the right, but not the obligation, to fix the rate of interest on a future loan or deposit, for a specified period and commencing on a specified future date.
Exchange rate related contracts include forward foreign exchange contracts, currency swaps and options.
A forward foreign exchange contract isan agreement to buy or sell a specified amount of foreign currency on a specified future date at an agreed rate.
Currency swaps generally involve the exchange of interest payment obligations denominated in different currencies: the exchange of principal can be notional or actual.
Acurrency option gives the buyer, on payment of a premium, the right, but not the obligation, to sell specified amounts of currency at agreed rates of exchange on or before a specified future date.
Credit derivatives, principally credit default swaps, are used by the Group as part of its trading activity and to manage its own exposure to credit risk.
A credit default swap is a swap in which one counterparty receives a premium at pre-set intervals in consideration for guaranteeing to make a specific payment should a negative credit event take place.
Equity derivatives are also used by the Group as part of its equity-based retail product activity to eliminate the Groups exposure to fluctuations invarious international stock exchange indices.
Index-linked equity options are purchased which give the Group the right, but not the obligation, tobuy or sell a specified amount of equities, or basket of equities, in the form of published indices on or before a specified future date.

210 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Notes to the consolidated financialstatements continued Note 23: Goodwill continued The goodwill held in the Groups balance sheet is tested at least annually for impairment.
For the purposes of impairment testing the goodwill is allocated to the appropriate cash generating unit: of the total balance of 2,310million 2017: 2,310million, 1,836million, or 79percent of the total 2017:1,836million, 79percent of the total has been allocated to Scottish Widows in the Groups Insurance and Wealth division: 302million, or 13percent of the total 2017: 302million, or 13percent of the total has been allocated to Cards in the Groups Retail division: and 170million, or 7percent of the total 2017: 170million, 7percent of the total to Motor Finance in the Groups Retail division.
The recoverable amount of the goodwill relating to Scottish Widows has been based on a value-in-use calculation.
The calculation uses pre-tax projections of future cash flows based upon budgets and plans approved by management covering a three-year period, the related run-off of existing business in force and a discount rate of 9percent.
The budgets and plans are based upon past experience adjusted to take into account anticipated changes in sales volumes, product mix and margins having regard to expected market conditions and competitor activity.
The discount rate is determined with reference to internal measures and available industry information.
New business cash flows beyond the three-year period have been extrapolated using a steady 2percent growth rate which does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the life assurance market.
Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions above would not cause the recoverable amount of Scottish Widows to fall below its balance sheet carrying value.
The recoverable amount of the goodwill relating to Motor Finance has also been based on a value-in-use calculation using pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets and plans approved by management covering a five-year period and a discount rate of 14 percent.
The cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 0.5percent which does not exceed the long-term average growth rates for the markets in which Motor Finance participates.
Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions above would not cause the recoverable amount of Motor Finance to fall below the balance sheet carrying value.
The recoverable amount of the goodwill relating to the Cards business has been based on a value-in-use calculation using pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets and plans approved by management covering a five-year period and a discount rate of 14percent.
The cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 0.5percent which does not exceed the long-term average growth rates for the markets in which Cards participates.
Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions above would not cause the recoverable amount of the Cards business to fall below the balance sheet carrying value.
Note 24: Value of in-force business Key assumptions The impact of reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions made in respect of the Group's life insurance business, which include the impact on the value of in force business, are disclosed in note 32.
The principal features of the methodology and process used for determining key assumptions used in the calculation of the value of in-force business are set out below: Economic assumptions Each cash flow is valued using the discount rate consistent with that applied to such a cash flow in the capital markets.
In practice, to achieve thesame result, where the cash flows are either independent of or move linearly with market movements, a method has been applied known as the certainty equivalent approach whereby it is assumed that all assets earn a risk-free rate and all cash flows are discounted at a risk-free rate.
The certainty equivalent approach covers all investment assets relating to insurance and participating investment contracts, other than the annuity business where an illiquidity premium is included, see below.
A market-consistent approach has been adopted for the valuation of financial options and guarantees, using a stochastic option pricing technique calibrated to be consistent with the market price of relevant options at each valuation date.
Further information on options and guarantees can be found in note 31.
The liabilities in respect of the Groups UK annuity business are matched by a portfolio of fixed interest securities, including a large proportion of corporate bonds and illiquid loan assets.
The value of the in-force business asset for UK annuity business has been calculated after taking into account an estimate of the market premium for illiquidity in respect of corporate bond holdings and relevant illiquid loan assets.
In determining the market premium for illiquidity, a range of inputs are considered which reflect actual asset allocation and relevant observable market data.
The illiquidity premium is estimated to be 128basis points at 31December 2018 2017: 114basispoints.
The risk-free rate is derived from the relevant swap curve with a deduction for credit risk.
The table below shows the resulting range of yields and other key assumptions at 31December: 2018 2017 % % 1 Risk-free rate value of in-force non-annuity business 0.00 to 4.05 0.00 to 4.20 1 Risk-free rate value of in-force annuity business 1.28 to 5.33 1.14 to 5.34 1 Risk-free rate financial options and guarantees 0.00 to 4.05 0.00 to 4.20 Retail price inflation 3.43 3.43 Expense inflation 3.75 3.67 1 All risk-free rates are quoted as the range of rates implied by the relevant forward swap curve.
Non-market risk An allowance for non-market risk is made through the choice of best estimate assumptions based upon experience, which generally will give the mean expected financial outcome for shareholders and hence no further allowance for non-market risk is required.
However, in the case ofoperational risk, reinsurer default and the with-profit funds these can be asymmetric in the range of potential outcomes for which an explicit allowance is made.
Non-economic assumptions Future mortality, morbidity, expenses, lapse and paid-up rate assumptions are reviewed each year and are based on an analysis of past experience and on managements view of future experience.
Further information on these assumptions is given in note 31 and the effect of changes in key assumptions is given in note 32.

Cash deposits of 4,102million 2017: 3,507million which support the debt securities issued by the structured entities, the term advances related to covered bonds and other legal obligations are held by the Group.
Additionally, the Group had certain contractual arrangements to provide liquidity facilities to some of these structured entities.
At 31December 2018 these obligations had not been triggered: the maximum exposure under these facilities was 88million 2017:95million.
The Group has a number of covered bond programmes, for which Limited Liability Partnerships have been established to ring-fence asset pools and guarantee the covered bonds issued by the Group.
At the reporting date the Group had over-collateralised these programmes as set out in the table above to meet the terms of the programmes, to secure the rating of the covered bonds and to provide operational flexibility.
From time-to-time, the obligations of the Group to provide collateral may increase due to the formal requirements of the programmes.
The Group may also voluntarily contribute collateral to support the ratings of the covered bonds.
The Group recognises the full liabilities associated with its securitisation and covered bond programmes within debt securities in issue, although the obligations of the Group are limited to the cash flows generated from the underlying assets.
The Group could be required to provide additional support to a number of the securitisation programmes to support the credit ratings of the debt securities issued, in the form of increased cash reserves and the holding of subordinated notes.
Further, certain programmes contain contractual obligations that require the Group to repurchase assets should they become credit impaired.
The Group has not voluntarily offered to repurchase assets from any of its public securitisation programmes during 2018 2017:none.

1 Life insurance The movement in life insurance contract and participating investment contract liabilities over the year can be analysed as follows: Participating Insurance investment contracts contracts Gross Reinsurance Net m m m m m At 1 January 2017 77,881 15,896 93,777 671 93,106 New business 4,154 43 4,197 21 4,176 Changes in existing business 4,928 58 4,870 129 4,999 Change in liabilities charged to the income statement note10 9,082 15 9,067 108 9,175 Exchange and other adjustments 14 14 14 At 31December 2017 86,949 15,881 102,830 563 102,267 New business 5,476 31 5,507 42 5,465 Changes in existing business 8,072 2,000 10,072 111 10,183 Change in liabilities charged to the income statement note10 2,596 1,969 4,565 153 4,718 Exchange and other adjustments 13 13 13 At 31December 2018 84,366 13,912 98,278 716 97,562 Liabilities for insurance contracts and participating investment contracts can be split into with-profit fund liabilities, accounted for using the PRAs realistic capital regime realistic liabilities and non-profit fund liabilities, accounted for using a prospective actuarial discounted cash flow methodology, asfollows: 2018 2017 With-profit Non-profit With-profit Non-profit fund fund Total fund fund Total m m m m m m Insurance contracts 7,851 76,515 84,366 8,946 78,003 86,949 Participating investment contracts 7,438 6,474 13,912 8,481 7,400 15,881 Total 15,289 82,989 98,278 17,427 85,403 102,830 With-profit fund realistic liabilities i Business description Scottish Widows Limited has the only with-profit funds within the Group.
The primary purpose of the conventional and unitised business written in the withprofit funds is to provide a smoothed investment vehicle to policyholders, protecting them against short-term market fluctuations.
Payouts may be subject to a guaranteed minimum payout if certain policy conditions are met.
With-profit policyholders are entitled to at least 90percent of the distributed profits, with the shareholders receiving the balance.
The policyholders are also usually insured against death and the policy may carry a guaranteed annuity option at retirement.
ii Method of calculation of liabilities With-profit liabilities are stated at their realistic value, the main components of which are: With-profit benefit reserve, the total asset shares for with-profit policies: Cost of options and guarantees including guaranteed annuity options : Deductions levied against asset shares: Planned enhancements to with-profits benefits reserve: and Impact of the smoothing policy.
216 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Notes to the consolidated financialstatements continued Note 31: Liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts continued iii Assumptions Key assumptions used in the calculation of with-profit liabilities, and the processes for determining these, are: Investment returns and discount rates With-profit fund liabilities are valued on a market-consistent basis, achieved by the use of a valuation model which values liabilities on a basis calibrated to tradable market option contracts and other observable market data.
The with-profit fund financial options and guarantees are valued using a stochastic simulation model where all assets are assumed to earn, on average, the risk-free yield and all cash flows are discounted using the risk-free yield.
The risk-free yield is defined as the spot yield derived from the relevant swap curve, adjusted for credit risk.
Further information on significant options and guarantees is given below.
Guaranteed annuity option take-up rates Certain pension contracts contain guaranteed annuity options that allow the policyholder to take an annuity benefit on retirement at annuity rates that were guaranteed at the outset of the contract.
For contracts that contain such options, key assumptions in determining the cost of options are economic conditions in which the option has value, mortality rates and take up rates of other options.
The financial impact is dependent on the value of corresponding investments, interest rates and longevity at the time of the claim.
Investment volatility The calibration of the stochastic simulation model uses implied volatilities of derivatives where possible, or historical volatility where it is not possible to observe meaningful prices.
Mortality The mortality assumptions, including allowances for improvements in longevity for annuitants, are set with regard to the Groups actual experience where this is significant, and relevant industry data otherwise.
Lapse rates persistency Lapse rates refer to the rate of policy termination or the rate at which policyholders stop paying regular premiums due under the contract.
Historical persistency experience is analysed using statistical techniques.
As experience can vary considerably between different product types and for contracts that have been in force for different periods, the data is broken down into broadly homogenous groups for the purposes of this analysis.
The most recent experience is considered along with the results of previous analyses and managements views on future experience, taking into consideration potential changes in future experience that may result from guarantees and options becoming more valuable under adverse market conditions, in order to determine a best estimate view of what persistency will be.
In determining this best estimate view a number of factors are considered, including the credibility of the results which will be affected by the volume of data available, any exceptional events that have occurred during the period under consideration, any known or expected trends in underlying data and relevant published market data.
iv Options and guarantees within the With-Profit Funds The most significant options and guarantees provided from within the With-Profit Funds are in respect of guaranteed minimum cash benefits on death, maturity, retirement or certain policy anniversaries, and guaranteed annuity options on retirement for certain pension policies.
For those policies written in Scottish Widows pre-demutualisation containing potentially valuable options and guarantees, under the terms of the Scheme a separate memorandum account was set up, within the With-Profit Fund originally held in Scottish Widows plc and subsequently transferred into Scottish Widows Limited, called the Additional Account which is available, inter alia, to meet any additional costs of providing guaranteed benefits in respect of those policies.
The Additional Account had a value at 31December 2018 of 2.5 billion 2017: 2.8 billion.
The eventual cost of providing benefits on policies written both pre and post demutualisation is dependent upon a large number of variables, including future interest rates and equity values, demographic factors, such as mortality, and the proportion of policyholders who seek to exercise their options.
The ultimate cost will therefore not be known for many years.
As noted above, the liabilities of the With-Profit Funds are valued using a market-consistent stochastic simulation model which places a value on the options and guarantees which captures both their intrinsic value and their time value.
The most significant economic assumptions included in the model are risk-free yield and investment volatility.
Non-profit fund liabilities i Business description The Group principally writes the following types of life insurance contracts within its non-profit funds.
Shareholder profits on these types of business arise from management fees and other policy charges.
Unit-linked business This includes unit-linked pensions and unit-linked bonds, the primary purpose of which is to provide an investment vehicle where the policyholder is also insured against death.
Life insurance The policyholder is insured against death or permanent disability, usually for predetermined amounts.
Such business includes whole of life and term assurance and long-term creditor policies.
Annuities The policyholder is entitled to payments for the duration of their life and is therefore insured against surviving longer than expected.
ii Method of calculation of liabilities The non-profit fund liabilities are determined on the basis of recognised actuarial methods and involve estimating future policy cash flows over the duration of the in-force book of policies, and discounting the cash flows back to the valuation date allowing for probabilities of occurrence.
iii Assumptions Generally, assumptions used to value non-profit fund liabilities are prudent in nature and therefore contain a margin for adverse deviation.
Thismargin for adverse deviation is based on managements judgement and reflects managements views on the inherent level of uncertainty.
Thekey assumptions used in the measurement of non-profit fund liabilities are: Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2018 217 Note 31: Liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts continued Interest rates The rates of interest used are determined byreference to a number of factors including the redemption yields on fixed interest assets at the valuationdate.
Margins for risk are allowed for in the assumed interest rates.
These are derived from the limits in the guidelines set by local regulatory bodies, including reductions made to the available yields to allow for default risk based upon the credit rating of the securities allocated to the insurance liability.
Mortality and morbidity The mortality and morbidity assumptions, including allowances for improvements in longevity for annuitants, are set with regard to the Groups actual experience where this provides a reliable basis, and relevant industry data otherwise, and include a margin for adverse deviation.
Lapse rates persistency Lapse rates are allowed for on some non-profit fund contracts.
The process for setting these rates is as described for with-profit liabilities, however a prudent scenario is assumed by the inclusion of a margin for adverse deviation within the non-profit fund liabilities.
Maintenance expenses Allowance is made for future policy costs explicitly.
Expenses are determined by reference to an internal analysis of current and expected future costs plus a margin for adverse deviation.
Explicit allowance is made for future expense inflation.
Key changes in assumptions A detailed review of the Groups assumptions in 2018 resulted in the following key impacts on profit before tax: Change in persistency assumptions 135million decr ease.
Change in the assumption in respect of current and future mortality and morbidity rates 173million increase.
Change in expenses assumptions 43million decrease.
These amounts include the impacts of movements in liabilities and value of the in-force business in respect of insurance contracts and participating investment contracts.
iv Options and guarantees outside the With-Profit Funds A number of typical guarantees are provided outside the With-Profit Funds such as guaranteed payments on death e. g. term assurance or guaranteed income for life e. g. annuities.
In addition, certain personal pension policyholders in Scottish Widows, for whom reinstatement to their occupational pension scheme was not an option, have been given a guarantee that their pension and other benefits will correspond in value to the benefits of the relevant occupational pension scheme.
The key assumptions affecting the ultimate value of the guarantee are future salary growth, gilt yields at retirement, annuitant mortality at retirement, marital status at retirement and future investment returns.
There is currently a provision, calculated on a deterministic basis, of 39million 2017: 35million in respect of those guarantees.
2 Non-life insurance For non-life insurance contracts, the methodology and assumptions used in relation to determining the bases of the earned premium and claims provisioning levels are derived for each individual underwritten product.
Assumptions are intended to be neutral estimates of the most likely or expected outcome.
There has been no significant change in the assumptions and methodologies used for setting reserves.
The movements in non-life insurance contract liabilities and reinsurance assets over the year have been as follows: 2018 2017 m m Provisions for unearned premiums Gross provision at 1 January 358 404 Increase in the year 681 724 Release in the year 697 770 Change in provision for unearned premiums charged to income statement 16 46 Gross provision at 31December 342 358 Reinsurers share 13 13 Net provision at 31December 329 345 These provisions represent the liability for short-term insurance contracts for which the Groups obligations are not expired at the year end.
2018 2017 m m Claims outstanding Gross claims outstanding at 1 January 225 209 Cash paid for claims settled in the year 306 321 1 Increase decrease in liabilities charged to the income statement 335 337 29 16 Gross claims outstanding at 31December 254 225 Reinsurers share Net claims outstanding at 31December 254 225 Notified claims 170 174 Incurred but not reported 84 51 Net claims outstanding at 31December 254 225 1 Of which an increase of 367million 2017: 350million was in respect of current year claims and a decrease of 32million 2017: a decrease of 13million was in respect of prior year claims.
218 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Notes to the consolidated financialstatements continued Note 32: Life insurance sensitivity analysis The following table demonstrates the effect of reasonably possible changes in key assumptions on profit before tax and equity disclosed in these financial statements assuming that the other assumptions remain unchanged.
In practice this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some assumptions may be correlated.
These amounts include movements in assets, liabilities and the value of the in-force business in respect of insurance contracts and participating investment contracts.
The impact is shown in one direction but can be assumed to be reasonably symmetrical.

1 This sensitivity shows the impact of reducing mortality and morbidity rates on non-annuity business to 95 per cent of the expected rate.
2 This sensitivity shows the impact on the annuity and deferred annuity business of reducing mortality rates to 95 per cent of the expected rate.
3 This sensitivity shows the impact of reducing lapse and surrender rates to 90 per cent of the expected rate.
4 This sensitivity shows the impact of reducing maintenance expenses and investment expenses to 90 per cent of the expected rate.
5 This sensitivity shows the impact on the value of in-force business, financial options and guarantee costs, statutory reserves and asset values of reducing the risk-free rate by 25 basis points.
6 This sensitivity shows the impact of a flat 5 per cent addition to the expected rate.
7 This sensitivity shows the impact of a flat 1 per cent addition to the expected rate.
8 This sensitivity shows the impact of a 25 basis point increase in credit default spreads on corporate bonds and the corresponding reduction in market values.
Swap curves, the risk-free rate and illiquidity premia are all assumed to be unchanged.
9 This sensitivity shows the impact of a 10 basis point increase in the allowance for illiquidity premia.
It assumes the overall spreads on assets are unchanged and hence market values are unchanged.
Swap curves and the non-annuity risk-free rate are both assumed to be unchanged.
The increased illiquidity premium increases the annuity risk-free rate.

All significant schemes are based in the UK, with the three most significant being the defined benefit section of the Lloyds Bank Pension Schemes No.
1, the Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No.
2 and the HBOS Final Salary Pension Scheme.
At 31December 2018, these schemes represented 94percent of the Groups total gross defined benefit pension assets 2017: 95percent.
These schemes provide retirement benefits calculated as a percentage of final pensionable salary depending upon the length of service: the minimum retirement age under the rules of the schemes at 31December 2018 is generally 55 although certain categories of member are deemed to have a contractual right to retire at 50.
The Group operates a number of funded and unfunded pension arrangements, the majority, including the three most significant schemes, are funded schemes in the UK.
All these schemes are operated as separate legal entities under trust law and are in compliance with the Pensions Act 2004.
All of the Groups funded UK defined benefit pension schemes are managed by a Trustee Board the Trustee whose role is to ensure that their Scheme is administered in accordance with the Scheme rules and relevant legislation, and to safeguard the assets in the best interests of all members and beneficiaries.
The Trustee is solely responsible for setting investment policy and for agreeing funding requirements with the employer through the funding valuation process.
The Board of Trustees must be composed of representatives of the Company and plan participants in accordance with the Schemes regulations.
A valuation to determine the funding status of each scheme is carried out at least every three years, whereby scheme assets are measured at market value and liabilities technical provisions are measured using prudent assumptions.
If a deficit is identified a recovery plan is agreed between the Group and the scheme Trustee and sent to the Pensions Regulator for review.
The Group has not provided for these deficit contributions as the future economic benefits arising from these contributions are expected to be available to the Group.
The Groups overseas defined benefit pension schemes are subject to local regulatory arrangements.
The most recent triennial funding valuation of the Groups three main schemes, based on the position as at 31December 2016, was completed during 2018.
The valuation showed an aggregate funding deficit of 7.3 billion a funding level of 85.6percent compared to a 5.2 billion deficit a funding level of 85.9percent for the previous valuation as at 30 June 2014.
In the light of this funding deficit, and in contemplation of the changes that the Group has made as a result of its Structural Reform Programme, the Group agreed a recovery plan with the trustees.
Under the plan, deficit contributions of 412million were paid during 2018, and these will rise to 618million in 2019, 798million in 2020, 1,287million in 2021 and 1,305million per annum from 2022 to 2024.
Contributions in the later years will be subject to review and renegotiation at subsequent funding valuations.
The next funding valuation is due to be completed by March 2021 with an effective date of 31December 2019.
The deficit contributions are in addition to the regular contributions to meet of benefits accruing over the year.
The Group currently expects to pay contributions of approximately 1,050million to its defined benefit schemes in2019.
During 2009, the Group made one-off contributions to the Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No 1 and Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No 2 in the form of interests in limited liability partnerships for each of the two schemes which hold assets to provide security for the Groups obligations to the two schemes.
At 31December 2018, the limited liability partnerships held assets of approximately 6.7 billion.
The limited liability partnerships are consolidated fully in the Groups balance sheet.
The Group has also established three private limited companies which hold assets to provide security for the Groups obligations to the HBOS Final Salary Pension Scheme, a section of the Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No 1 and the Lloyds Bank Offshore Pension Scheme.
At 31December 2018 these held assets of approximately 4.6 billion in aggregate.
The private limited companies are consolidated fully in the Groups balance sheet.
The terms of these arrangements require the Group to maintain assets in these vehicles to agreed minimum values in order to secure obligations owed to the relevant Group pension schemes.
The Group has satisfied this requirement during 2018.
The last funding valuations of other Group schemes were carried out on a number of different dates.
In order to report the position under IAS 19 as at 31December 2018 the most recent valuation results for all schemes have been updated by qualified independent actuaries.
The main differences between the funding and IAS 19 valuations are different and more prudent approach to setting the discount rate and more conservative longevity assumptions used in the funding valuations.
220 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Notes to the consolidated financialstatements continued Note 35: Retirement benefit obligations continued In July 2018 a decision was sought from the High Court in respect of the requirement to equalise the Guaranteed Minimum Pension GMP benefits accrued between 1990 and 1997 from contracting out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme.
In its judgment handed down on 26 October 2018 the High Court confirmed the requirement to treat men and women equally with respect to these benefits and a range of methods that the Trustee is entitled to adopt to achieve equalisation.
The Group continues to work with the Trustee on the detail of implementing this judgment and has recognised a past service cost of 108 million consistent with the principles outlined within the judgment.
This is based on a number of assumptions and the actual impact may be different.

The table shows that a member retiring at age 60 at 31December 2018 is assumed to live for, on average, 27.8 years for a male and 29.4 years for a female.
In practice there will be much variation between individual members but these assumptions are expected to be appropriate across all members.
It is assumed that younger members will live longer in retirement than those retiring now.
This reflects the expectation that mortality rates will continue to fall over time as medical science and standards of living improve.
To illustrate the degree of improvement assumed the table also shows the life expectancy for members aged 45 now, when they retire in 15 years time at age 60. v Amount timing and uncertainty of future cash flows Risk exposure of the defined benefit schemes Whilst the Group is not exposed to any unusual, entity specific or scheme specific risks in its defined benefit pension schemes, it is exposed to a number of significant risks, detailed below: Inflation rate risk: the majority of the plans benefit obligations are linked to inflation both in deferment and once in payment.
Higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities although this will be materially offset by holdings of inflation-linked gilts and, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation.
Interest rate risk: The defined benefit obligation is determined using a discount rate derived from yields on AA-rated corporate bonds.
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities although this will be materially offset by an increase in the value of bond holdings.
Longevity risk: The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the members so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans liabilities.
Investment risk: Scheme assets are invested in a diversified portfolio of debt securities, equities and other return-seeking assets.
If the assets underperform the discount rate used to calculate the defined benefit obligation, it will reduce the surplus or increase the deficit.
Volatility in asset values and the discount rate will lead to volatility in the net pension asset on the Groups balance sheet and in other comprehensive income.
To a lesser extent this will also lead to volatility in the pension expense in the Groups income statement.
The ultimate cost of the defined benefit obligations to the Group will depend upon actual future events rather than the assumptions made.
The assumptions made are unlikely to be borne out in practice and as such the cost may be higher or lower than expected.
Sensitivity analysis The effect of reasonably possible changes in key assumptions on the value of scheme liabilities and the resulting pension charge in the Groups income statement and on the net defined benefit pension scheme liability, for the Groups three most significant schemes, is set out below.
The sensitivities provided assume that all other assumptions and the value of the schemes assets remain unchanged, and are not intended to represent changes that are at the extremes of possibility.
The calculations are approximate in nature and full detailed calculations could lead to a different result.
It is unlikely that isolated changes to individual assumptions will be experienced in practice.
Due to the correlation of assumptions, aggregating the effects of these isolated changes may not be a reasonable estimate of the actual effect of simultaneous changes in multiple assumptions.

2 At 31December2018, the assumed discount rate is 2.90 percent 2017: 2.59percent.
Sensitivity analysis method and assumptions The sensitivity analysis above reflects the impact on the Groups three most significant schemes which account for over 90percent of the Groups defined benefit obligations.
Whilst differences in the underlying liability profiles for the remainder of the Groups pension arrangements mean they may exhibit slightly different sensitivities to variations in these assumptions, the sensitivities provided above are indicative of the impact across the Group as awhole.
The inflation assumption sensitivity applies to both the assumed rate of increase in the Consumer Prices Index CPI and the Retail Prices Index RPI, and include the impact on the rate of increases to pensions, both before and after retirement.
These pension increases are linked to inflation either CPI or RPI subject to certain minimum and maximum limits.
The sensitivity analysis including the inflation sensitivity does not include the impact of any change in the rate of salary increases as pensionable salaries have been frozen since 2April2014.
The life expectancy assumption has been applied by allowing for an increase decrease in life expectation from age 60 of one year, based upon the approximate weighted average age for each scheme.
Whilst this is an approximate approach and will not give the same result as a one year increase in life expectancy at every age, it provides an appropriate indication of the potential impact on the schemes from changes in life expectancy.
There was no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis from the prior year.
Asset-liability matching strategies The main schemes assets are invested in a diversified portfolio, consisting primarily of debt securities.
The investment strategy is not static and will evolve to reflect the structure of liabilities within the schemes.
Specific asset-liability matching strategies for each pension plan are independently determined by the responsible governance body for each scheme and in consultation with the employer.
A significant goal of the asset-liability matching strategies adopted by Group schemes is to reduce volatility caused by changes in market expectations of interest rates and inflation.
In the main schemes, this is achieved by investing scheme assets in bonds, primarily fixed interest gilts and index linked gilts, and by entering into interest rate and inflation swap arrangements.
These investments are structured to take into account the profile of scheme liabilities, and actively managed to reflect both changing market conditions and changes to the liability profile.
At 31December 2018 the asset-liability matching strategy mitigated 105percent of the liability sensitivity to interest rate movements and 106percent of the liability sensitivity to inflation movements.
In addition a small amount of interest rate sensitivity arises through holdings of corporate and other debtsecurities.
Maturity profile of defined benefit obligation The following table provides information on the weighted average duration of the defined benefit pension obligations and the distribution and timing of benefit payments: 2018 2017 Years Years Duration of the defined benefit obligation 18 19 2018 2017 m m Maturity analysis of benefits expected to be paid: Within 12 months 1,225 1,174 Between 1 and 2 years 1,299 1,235 Between 2 and 5 years 4,303 4,089 Between 5 and 10 years 8,305 8,082 Between 10 and 15 years 9,416 9,360 Between 15 and 25 years 18,417 19,044 Between 25 and 35 years 15,631 16,735 Between 35 and 45 years 9,924 11,156 In more than 45 years 4,270 5,219 224 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Notes to the consolidated financialstatements continued Note 35: Retirement benefit obligations continued Maturity analysis method and assumptions The projected benefit payments are based on the assumptions underlying the assessment of the obligations, including allowance for expected future inflation.
They are shown in their undiscounted form and therefore appear large relative to the discounted assessment of the defined benefit obligations recognised in the Groups balance sheet.
They are in respect of benefits that have been accrued prior to the respective year-end date only and make no allowance for any benefits that may have been accrued subsequently.
Defined contribution schemes The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes in the UK and overseas, principally Your Tomorrow and the defined contribution sections ofthe Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No.
During the year ended 31December 2018 the charge to the income statement in respect of defined contribution schemes was 300million 2017:256million: 2016:268million, representing the contributions payable by the employer in accordance with each schemes rules.
Other post-retirement benefit schemes The Group operates a number of schemes which provide post-retirement healthcare benefits and concessionary mortgages to certain employees, retired employees and their dependants.
The principal scheme relates to former Lloyds Bank staff and under this scheme the Group has undertaken to meet the cost of post-retirement healthcare for all eligible former employees and their dependants who retired prior to 1January 1996.
The Group has entered into an insurance contract to provide these benefits and a provision has been made for the estimated cost of future insurance premiumspayable.
For the principal post-retirement healthcare scheme, the latest actuarial valuation of the liability was carried out at 31December 2018 by qualified independent actuaries.
The principal assumptions used were as set out above, except that the rate of increase in healthcare premiums has been assumed at 6.81 percent 2017: 6.81percent.

The tax disclosure of deferred tax assets and liabilities ties to the amounts outlined in the tables below which splits the deferred tax assets and liabilities by type, before such netting.
As a result of legislation enacted in 2016, the UK corporation tax rate will reduce from 19percent to 17percent on 1 April 2020.
The Group measures its deferred tax assets and liabilities at the value expected to be recoverable or payable in future periods, and re-measures them at each reporting date based on the most recent estimates of utilisation or settlement, including the impact of bank surcharge where appropriate.
The deferred tax impact of this re-measurement in 2018 is a credit of 32million in the income statement and a charge of 19million in other comprehensive income.
On 29 October 2018, the UK government announced its intention to restrict the use of capital tax losses to 50 per cent of any future gains arising.
Had this restriction been substantively enacted at 31 December 2018, the effect would have been to reduce net deferred tax assets by 41million.

Deferred tax not recognised No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of the future tax benefit of certain expenses of the life assurance business carried forward.
The deferred tax asset not recognised in respect of these expenses is approximately 371million 2017: 470million, and these expenses can be carried forward indefinitely.
The unrecognised deferred tax asset has reduced in 2018, as the Group's utilisation estimate has improved over the year.
Deferred tax assets of approximately 78million 2017: 76million have not been recognised in respect of 438million of UK tax losses and other temporary differences which can only be used to offset future capital gains.
UK capital losses can be carried forward indefinitely.
In addition, no deferred tax asset is recognised in respect of unrelieved foreign tax credits of 46million 2017: 46million, as there are no expected future taxable profits against which the credits can be utilised.
These credits can be carried forward indefinitely.
No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of foreign trade losses where it is not more likely than not that we will be able to utilise them in future periods.
Of the asset not recognised, 36million 2017: 35million relates to losses that will expire if not used within 20 years, and 53million 2017:56million relates to losses with no expiry date.
As a result of parent company exemptions on dividends from subsidiaries and on capital gains on disposal there are no significant taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and joint arrangements.

Payment protection insurance excluding MBNA The Group increased the provision for PPI costs by a further 750 million in the year ended 31 December 2018, bringing the total amount provided to 19,425 million.
The charge in 2018 related to a number of factors including higher expected complaint volumes, which increased to 13,000 per week, and associated administration costs, an increase in average redress per complaint, additional operational costs to deal with potential complaint volatility and continued improvements in data interrogation and the Groups ability to identify valid complaints.
The remaining provision is consistent with an average of approximately 13,000 complaints per week to the industry deadline of the end of August 2019.
At 31 December 2018, a provision of 1,329 million remained unutilised relating to complaints and associated administration costs.
Total cash payments were 1,859 million during the year ended 31 December 2018.
Sensitivities The Group estimates that it has sold approximately 16 million PPI policies since 2000.
These include policies that were not mis-sold and those that have been successfully claimed upon.
Since the commencement of the PPI redress programme in 2011 the Group estimates that it has contacted, settled or provided for approximately 53 per cent of the policies sold since 2000.
The total amount provided for PPI represents the Groups best estimate of the likely future cost.
However a number of risks and uncertainties remain including with respect to future complaint volumes.
The cost could differ from the Groups estimates and the assumptions underpinning them, and could result in a further provision being required.
There is also uncertainty around the impact of the regulatory changes, Financial Conduct Authority media campaign and Claims Management Company and customer activity, and potential additional remediation arising from the continuous improvement of the Groups operational practices.
For every additional 1,000 reactive complaints per week above 13,000 on average from January 2019 through to the industry deadline of the end of August2019, the Group would expect an additional charge of approximately 85 million.
Payment protection insurance MBNA As announced in December 2016, the Groups exposure is capped at 240 million, which is already provided for through an indemnity received from Bankof America.
MBNA increased its PPI provision by 100 million in the year ended 31 December 2018 but the Groups exposure continues to remain capped at 240 million under the arrangement with Bank of America, notwithstanding this increase by MBNA.
Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2018 227 Note 37 Other provisions continued Other provisions for legal actions and regulatory matters In the course of its business, the Group is engaged in discussions with the PRA, FCA and other UK and overseas regulators and other governmental authorities on a range of matters.
The Group also receives complaints in connection with its past conduct and claims brought by or on behalf of current and former employees, customers, investors and other third parties and is subject to legal proceedings and other legal actions.
Where significant, provisions are held against the costs expected to be incurred in relation to these matters and matters arising from related internal reviews.
During the year ended 31 December 2018 the Group charged a further 600 million in respect of legal actions and other regulatory matters, and the unutilised balance at 31 December 2018 was 861 million 31 December 2017: 1,292 million.
The most significant items are as follows.
Arrears handling related activities The Group has provided an additional 151 million in the year ended 31 December 2018 for the costs of identifying and rectifying certain arrears management fees and activities, taking the total provided to date to 793 million.
The Group has put in place a number of actions to improve its handling of customers in these areas and has made good progress in reimbursing arrears fees to impacted customers.
Packaged bank accounts The Group has provided a further 45 million in the year ended 31 December 2018 245 million was provided in the year ended 31 December 2017 in respect of complaints relating to alleged mis-selling of packaged bank accounts, raising the total amount provided to 795 million.
A number of risks and uncertainties remain particularly with respect to future volumes.
Customer claims in relation to insurance branch business in Germany The Group continues to receive claims in Germany from customers relating to policies issued by Clerical Medical Investment Group Limited subsequently renamed Scottish Widows Limited, with smaller numbers received from customers in Austria and Italy.
The industry-wide issue regarding notification of contractual cooling off periods continued to lead to an increasing number of claims in 2016 and 2017 levelling out in 2018.
Up to 31 December 2017 the Group had provided a total of 639 million, with no further amounts provided during the year ended 31 December 2018.
The validity of the claims facing the Group depends upon the facts and circumstances in respect of each claim.
As a result the ultimate financial effect, which could be significantly different from the current provision, will be known only once all relevant claims have been resolved.
HBOS Reading customer review The Group has now completed its compensation assessment for all 71 business customers within the customer review, with more than 96 per cent of these offers accepted.
In total, more than 96 million has been offered of which 78 million has been accepted, in addition to 9 million for ex-gratia payments and 5million for the reimbursements of legal fees.
The review follows the conclusion of a criminal trial in which a number of individuals, including two former HBOS employees, were convicted of conspiracy to corrupt, fraudulent trading and associated money laundering offences which occurred prior to the acquisition of HBOS by the Group in 2009.
The Group has provided a further 15 million in the year ended 31 December 2018 for customer settlements, raising the total amount provided to 115 million and is now nearing the end of the process of paying compensation to the victims of the fraud, including ex-gratia payments and re-imbursements of legalfees.
Vacant leasehold property Vacant leasehold property provisions are made by reference to a prudent estimate of expected sub-let income, compared to the head rent, and the possibility of disposing of the Groups interest in the lease, taking into account conditions in the property market.
These provisions are reassessed on a biannual basis and will normally run off over the period of under-recovery of the leases concerned, currently averaging three years: where a property is disposed of earlier than anticipated, any remaining balance in the provision relating to that property is released.
Other Following the sale of TSB Banking Group plc, the Group raised a provision of 665million in relation to various ongoing commitments: 168million of this provision remained unutilised at 31December 2018.
Provisions are made for staff and other costs related to Group restructuring initiatives at the point at which the Group becomes irrevocably committed to the expenditure.
At 31December 2018 provisions of 191million 31December 2017: 104million were held.
The Group carries provisions of 122million 2017: 136million for indemnities and other matters relating to legacy business disposals in prior years.

3 Share capital and control There are no restrictions on the transfer of shares in the Company other than as set out in the articles of association and: certain restrictions which may from time to time be imposed by law and regulations for example, insider trading laws : where directors and certain employees of the Company require the approval of the Company to deal in the Companys shares: and pursuant to the rules of some of the Companys employee share plans where certain restrictions may apply while the shares are subject to the plans.
Where, under an employee share plan operated by the Company, participants are the beneficial owners of shares but not the registered owners, the voting rights are normally exercised by the registered owner at the direction of the participant.
Outstanding awards and options would normally vest and become exercisable on a change of control, subject to the satisfaction of any performance conditions at that time.
In addition, the Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities and or votingrights.
Information regarding significant direct or indirect holdings of shares in the Company can be found on page 80.
The directors have authority to allot and issue ordinary and preference shares and to make market purchases of ordinary and preference shares as granted at the annual general meeting on 24May2018.
The authority to issue shares and the authority to make market purchases of shares will expire at the next annual general meeting.
Shareholders will be asked, at the annual general meeting, to give similar authorities.
Subject to any rights or restrictions attached to any shares, on a show of hands at a general meeting of the Company every holder of shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote has one vote and on a poll every member present and entitled to vote has one vote for every share held.
Further details regarding voting at the annual general meeting can be found in the notes to the notice of the annual general meeting.
Ordinary shares The holders of ordinary shares, who held 100percent of the total ordinary share capital at 31December 2018, are entitled to receive the Companys report and accounts, attend, speak and vote at general meetings and appoint proxies to exercise voting rights.
Holders of ordinary shares may also receive a dividend subject to the provisions of the Companys articles of association and on a winding up may share in the assets of the Company.
Limited voting ordinary shares At the annual general meeting on 11 May 2017, the Companys shareholders approved the redesignation of the 80,921,051 limited voting ordinary shares held by the Lloyds Bank Foundations as ordinary shares of 10 pence each.
The redesignation took effect on 1 July 2017 and the redesignated shares now rank equally with the existing issued ordinary shares of the Company.
The Company has entered into deeds of covenant with the Foundations under the terms of which the Company makes annual donations.
The deeds of covenant in effect as at 31December 2018 provide that such annual donations will cease in certain circumstances, including the Company providing nineyears notice.
Such notice has been given to the LloydsTSB Foundation for Scotland.
Preference shares The Company has in issue various classes of preference shares which are all classified as liabilities under accounting standards and which are included in note38.

236 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Notes to the consolidated financialstatements continued Note 45: Share-based payments continued Other share plans Lloyds Banking Group Executive Share Ownership Plan The plan, introduced in 2006, is aimed at delivering shareholder value by linking the receipt of shares to an improvement in the performance of the Group over a three year period.
Awards are made within limits set by the rules of the plan, with the limits determining the maximum number of shares that can be awarded equating to three times annual salary.
In exceptional circumstances this may increase to four times annual salary.
For the 2016 and 2017 plan participants may be entitled to any dividends paid during the vesting period if the performance conditions are met.
An amount equal in value to any dividends paid between the award date and the date the Remuneration Committee determine that the performance conditions were met may be paid, based on the number of shares that vest.
The Remuneration Committee will determine if any dividends are to be paid in cash or in shares.
Details of the performance conditions for the plan are provided in the Directors remuneration report.
At the end of the performance period for the 2015 grant, the targets had not been fully met and therefore these awards vested in 2018 at a rate of 66.3percent.
The weighted average fair value of awards granted in the year was 0.48 2017: 0.57.
The fair value calculations at 31December 2018 for grants made in the year, using Black-Scholes models and Monte Carlo simulation, are based on the following assumptions: Executive Share Plan Save-As-You-Earn 2003 LTIP Weighted average risk-free interest rate 0.96% 0.74% 0.94% Weighted average expected life 3.3 years 1.3 years 3.7 years Weighted average expected volatility 28% 21% 29% Weighted average expected dividend yield 4.0% 4.0% 4.0% Weighted average share price 0.59 0.58 0.67 Weighted average exercise price 0.48 Nil Nil Expected volatility is a measure of the amount by which the Groups shares are expected to fluctuate during the life of an option.
The expected volatility is estimated based on the historical volatility of the closing daily share price over the most recent period that is commensurate with the expected life of the option.
The historical volatility is compared to the implied volatility generated from market traded options in the Groups shares to assess the reasonableness of the historical volatility and adjustments made where appropriate.
Share Incentive Plan Free Shares An award of shares may be made annually to employees up to a maximum of 3,000.
The shares awarded are held in trust for a mandatory period of three years on the employees behalf, during which period the employee is entitled to any dividends paid on such shares.

Note 47: Contingent liabilities and commitments Interchange fees With respect to multi-lateral interchange fees MIFs, the Group is not directly involved in the ongoing investigations and litigation as described below which involve card schemes such as Visa and Mastercard.
However, the Group is a member licensee of Visa and Mastercard and other card schemes: The European Commission continues to pursue competition investigations against Mastercard and Visa probing, amongst other things, MIFs paid in respect of cards issued outside the EEA: Litigation brought by retailers continues in the English Courts against both Visa and Mastercard: Any ultimate impact on the Group of the above investigations and litigation against Visa and Mastercard remains uncertain at this time.
Visa Inc completed its acquisition of Visa Europe on 21 June 2016.
As part of this transaction, the Group and certain other UK banks also entered into a Loss Sharing Agreement LSA with Visa Inc, which clarifies the allocation of liabilities between the parties should the litigation referred to above result in Visa Inc being liable for damages payable by Visa Europe.
The maximum amount of liability to which the Group may be subject under the LSA is capped at the cash consideration which was received by the Group at completion.
Visa Inc may also have recourse to a general indemnity, previously in place under Visa Europes Operating Regulations, for damages claims concerning inter or intra-regional MIF setting activities.
LIBOR and other trading rates In July 2014, the Group announced that it had reached settlements totalling 217 million at 30 June 2014 exchange rates to resolve with UK and USfederal authorities legacy issues regarding the manipulation several years ago of Group companies submissions to the British Bankers Association BBA London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR and Sterling Repo Rate.
The Group continues to cooperate with various other government and regulatory authorities, including the Swiss Competition Commission, and a number of US State Attorneys General, in conjunction with their investigations into submissions made by panel members to the bodies that set LIBOR and various other interbank offered rates.
Certain Group companies, together with other panel banks, have also been named as defendants in private lawsuits, including purported class action suits, in the US in connection with their roles as panel banks contributing to the setting of US Dollar, Japanese Yen and Sterling LIBOR and the Australian BBSW Reference Rate.
Certain of the plaintiffs claims, have been dismissed by the US Federal Court for Southern District of New York subject to appeals.
Certain Group companies are also named as defendants in i UK based claims: and ii in 2 Dutch class actions, raising LIBOR manipulation allegations.
A number of the claims against the Group in relation to the alleged mis-sale of interest rate hedging products also include allegations of LIBOR manipulation.
It is currently not possible to predict the scope and ultimate outcome on the Group of the various outstanding regulatory investigations not encompassed by the settlements, any private lawsuits or any related challenges to the interpretation or validity of any of the Groups contractual arrangements, including their timing and scale.
UK shareholder litigation In August 2014, the Group and a number of former directors were named as defendants in a claim by a number of claimants who held shares in Lloyds TSB Group plc LTSB prior to the acquisition of HBOS plc, alleging breaches of duties in relation to information provided to shareholders in connection with the acquisition and the recapitalisation of LTSB.
The defendants refute all claims made.
A trial commenced in the English High Court on 18 October 2017 and concluded on 5 March 2018 with judgment to follow.
It is currently not possible to determine the ultimate impact on the Group if any.
Tax authorities The Group has an open matter in relation to a claim for group relief of losses incurred in its former Irish banking subsidiary, which ceased trading on 31December 2010.
In 2013 HMRC informed the Group that their interpretation of the UK rules which allow the offset of such losses denies the claim.
If HMRCs position is found to be correct management estimate that this would result in an increase in current tax liabilities of approximately 770 million including interest and a reduction in the Groups deferred tax asset of approximately 250 million.
The Group does not agree with HMRCs position and, having taken appropriate advice, does not consider that this is a case where additional tax will ultimately fall due.
There are a number of other open matters on which the Group is in discussion with HMRC including the tax treatment of certain costs arising from the divestment of TSB Banking Group plc, none of which is expected to have a material impact on the financial position of the Group.
Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2018 239 Note 47: Contingent liabilities and commitments continued Residential mortgage repossessions In August 2014, the Northern Ireland High Court handed down judgment in favour of the borrowers in relation to three residential mortgage test cases concerning certain aspects of the Groups practice with respect to the recalculation of contractual monthly instalments of customers in arrears.
The FCA has been actively engaged with the industry in relation to these considerations and has published Guidance on the treatment of customers with mortgage payment shortfalls.
The Guidance covers remediation for mortgage customers who may have been affected by the way firms calculate these customers monthly mortgage instalments.
The Group is implementing the Guidance and has now contacted nearly all affected customers with any remaining customers anticipated to be contacted by the end of March 2019.
Mortgage arrears handling activities FCA investigation On 26 May 2016, the Group was informed that an enforcement team at the FCA had commenced an investigation in connection with the Groups mortgage arrears handling activities.
This investigation is ongoing and the Group continues to cooperate with the FCA.
It is not currently possible to make a reliable assessment of any liability that may result from the investigation including any financial penalty or public censure.
HBOS Reading FCA investigation On 7 April 2017 the FCA announced that it had resumed its investigation into the events surrounding the discovery of misconduct within the Readingbased Impaired Assets team of HBOS.
The investigation is ongoing and the Group continues to cooperate with the FCA.
Other legal actions and regulatory matters In addition, during the ordinary course of business the Group is subject to other complaints and threatened or actual legal proceedings including class or group action claims brought by or on behalf of current or former employees, customers, investors or other third parties, as well as legal and regulatory reviews, challenges, investigations and enforcement actions, both in the UK and overseas.
All such material matters are periodically reassessed, with the assistance of external professional advisers where appropriate, to determine the likelihood of the Group incurring a liability.
In those instances where it is concluded that it is more likely than not that a payment will be made, a provision is established to management's best estimate of the amount required at the relevant balance sheet date.
In some cases it will not be possible to form a view, for example because the facts are unclear or because further time is needed properly to assess the merits of the case, and no provisions are held in relation to such matters.
In these circumstances, specific disclosure in relation to a contingent liability will be made where material.
However the Group does not currently expect the final outcome of any such case to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, operations or cash flows.

Some of these operating lease arrangements have renewal options and rent escalation clauses, although the effect of these is not material.
No arrangements have been entered into for contingent rentalpayments.
Capital commitments Excluding commitments in respect of investment property note 26, capital expenditure contracted but not provided for at 31December 2018 amounted to 378million 2017: 444million.
Of this amount, 369million 2017: 440million related to assets to be leased to customers under operating leases.
The Groups management is confident that future net revenues and funding will be sufficient to cover these commitments.
Note 48: Structured entities The Groups interests in structured entities are both consolidated and unconsolidated.
Detail of the Groups interests in consolidated structured entities are set out in: note 30 for securitisations and covered bond vehicles, note35 for structured entities associated with the Groups pension schemes, and below in part A and B.
Details of the Groups interests in unconsolidated structured entities are included below in part C. A Asset-backed conduits In addition to the structured entities discussed in note30, which are used for securitisation and covered bond programmes, the Group sponsors an active asset-backed conduit, Cancara, which invests in client receivables and debt securities.
The total consolidated exposure of Cancara at 31December 2018 was 5,122million 2017:6,049million, comprising 5,012million of loans and advances 2017:5,939million and 110million ofdebt securities 2017:110million.
All lending assets and debt securities held by the Group in Cancara are restricted in use, as they are held by the collateral agent for the benefit of the commercial paper investors and the liquidity providers only.
The Group provides liquidity facilities to Cancara under terms that are usual and customary for standard lending activities in the normal course of the Groups banking activities.
During 2018 there have continued to be planned drawdowns on certain liquidity facilities for balance sheet management purposes, supporting the programme to provide funding alongside the proceeds of the asset-backed commercial paper issuance.
The Group could be asked to provide support under the contractual terms of these arrangements including, for example, if Cancara experienced a shortfall in external funding, which may occur in the event of market disruption.
The external assets in Cancara are consolidated in the Groups financialstatements.
B Consolidated collective investment vehicles and limited partnerships The assets of the Insurance business held in consolidated collective investment vehicles, such as Open-Ended Investment Companies and limited partnerships, are not directly available for use by the Group.
However, the Groups investment in the majority of these collective investment vehicles is readily realisable.
As at 31 December 2018, the total carrying value of these consolidated collective investment vehicle assets and liabilities held by the Group was 62,648million 2017: 68,124million.
The Group has no contractual arrangements such as liquidity facilities that would require it to provide financial or other support to the consolidated collective investment vehicles: the Group has not previously provided such support and has no current intentions to provide suchsupport.
C Unconsolidated collective investment vehicles and limited partnerships The Groups direct interests in unconsolidated structured entities comprise investments in collective investment vehicles, such as Open-Ended Investment Companies, and limited partnerships with a total carrying value of 26,028million at 31 December 2018 2017: 28,759million, included within financial assets designated at fair value through profit and loss see note 16.
These investments include both those entities managed by third parties and those managed by the Group.
At 31 December 2018, the total asset value of these unconsolidated structured entities, including the portion in which the Group has no interest, was 2,435billion 2017:2,338billion.
The Groups maximum exposure to loss is equal to the carrying value of the investment.
However, the Groups investments in these entities are primarily held to match policyholder liabilities in the Insurance division and the majority of the risk from a change in the value of the Groups investment is matched by a change in policyholder liabilities.
The collective investment vehicles are primarily financed by investments from investors in thevehicles.
During the year the Group has not provided any non-contractual financial or other support to these entities and has no current intention of providing any financial or other support.
There were no transfers from to these unconsolidated collective investment vehicles and limited partnerships.
The Group considers itself the sponsor of a structured entity where it is primarily involved in the design and establishment of the structured entity: and further where the Group transfers assets to the structured entity: market products associated with the structured entity in its own name and or provide guarantees regarding the structured entitys performance.
The Group sponsors a range of diverse investment funds and limited partnerships where it acts as the fund manager or equivalent decision maker and markets the funds under one of the Groups brands.
The Group earns fees from managing the investments of these funds.
The investment management fees that the Group earned from these entities, including those in which the Group held no ownership interest at 31 December 2018, are reported in note6.

It is a measure as at a specific date and may be significantly different from the amount which will actually be paid or received on maturity or settlement date.
Wherever possible, fair values have been calculated using unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical instruments held by the Group.
Where quoted market prices are not available, or are unreliable because of poor liquidity, fair values have been determined using valuation techniques which, to the extent possible, use market observable inputs, but in some cases use non-market observable inputs.
Valuation techniques used include discounted cash flow analysis and pricing models and, where appropriate, comparison to instruments with characteristics similar to those of the instruments held by the Group.
The Group manages valuation adjustments for its derivative exposures on a net basis: the Group determines their fair values on the basis of their net exposures.
In all other cases, fair values of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are determined on the basis of their gross exposures.
The carrying amount of the following financial instruments is a reasonable approximation of fair value: cash and balances at central banks, items in the course of collection from banks, items in course of transmission to banks, notes in circulation and liabilities arising from non-participating investmentcontracts.
Because a variety of estimation techniques are employed and significant estimates made, comparisons of fair values between financial institutions may not be meaningful.
Readers of these financial statements are thus advised to use caution when using this data to evaluate the Groups financialposition.
Fair value information is not provided for items that are not financial instruments or for other assets and liabilities which are not carried at fair value in the Groups consolidated balance sheet.
These items include intangible assets, such as the value of the Groups branch network, the long-term relationships with depositors and credit card relationships: premises and equipment: and shareholders equity.
These items are material and accordingly the Group believes that the fair value information presented does not represent the underlying value of the Group.
Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2018 243 Note 49: Financial instruments continued Valuation control framework The key elements of the control framework for the valuation of financial instruments include model validation, product implementation review and independent price verification.
These functions are carried out by appropriately skilled risk and finance teams, independent of the business area responsible for the products.
Model validation covers both qualitative and quantitative elements relating to new models.
In respect of new products, a product implementation review is conducted pre and posttrading.
Pretrade testing ensures that the new model is integrated into the Groups systems and that the profit and loss and risk reporting are consistent throughout the trade life cycle.
Posttrade testing examines the explanatory power of the implemented model, actively monitoring model parameters and comparing inhouse pricing to external sources.
Independent price verification procedures cover financial instruments carried at fair value.
The frequency of the review is matched to the availability of independent data, monthly being the minimum.
Valuation differences in breach of established thresholds are escalated to senior management.
The results from independent pricing and valuation reserves are reviewed monthly by senior management.
Formal committees, consisting of senior risk, finance and business management, meet at least quarterly to discuss and approve valuations in more judgemental areas, in particular for unquoted equities, structured credit, overthecounter options and the Credit Valuation Adjustment CVA reserve.
Valuation of financial assets and liabilities Assets and liabilities carried at fair value or for which fair values are disclosed have been classified into three levels according to the quality and reliability of information used to determine the fair values.
Level 1 Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Products classified as level 1 predominantly comprise equity shares, treasury bills and other government securities.
Level 2 Level 2 valuations are those where quoted market prices are not available, for example where the instrument is traded in a market that is not considered to be active or valuation techniques are used to determine fair value and where these techniques use inputs that are based significantly on observable market data.
Examples of such financial instruments include most overthecounter derivatives, financial institution issued securities, certificates of deposit and certain assetbacked securities.
Level 3 Level 3 portfolios are those where at least one input which could have a significant effect on the instruments valuation is not based on observable market data.
Such instruments would include the Groups venture capital and unlisted equity investments which are valued using various valuation techniques that require significant management judgement in determining appropriate assumptions, including earnings multiples and estimated future cash flows.
Certain of the Groups assetbacked securities and derivatives, principally where there is no trading activity in such securities, are also classified as level 3.
Transfers out of the level 3 portfolio arise when inputs that could have a significant impact on the instruments valuation become market observable after previously having been nonmarket observable.
In the case of assetbacked securities this can arise if more than one consistent independent source of data becomes available.
Conversely transfers into the portfolio arise when consistent sources of data cease to be available.

The fair value of these assets is determined using discounted cash flow techniques.
The discount rates are derived from observable repo curves specific to the type of security purchased under the reverse repurchase agreement.
Debt securities Debt securities measured at fair value and classified as level2 are valued by discounting expected cash flows using an observable credit spread applicable to the particular instrument.
Where there is limited trading activity in debt securities, the Group uses valuation models, consensus pricing information from third party pricing services and broker or lead manager quotes to determine an appropriate valuation.
Debt securities are classified as level 3 if there is a significant valuation input that cannot be corroborated through market sources or where there are materially inconsistent values for an input.
Asset classes classified as level 3 mainly comprise certain collateralised loan obligations and collateralised debt obligations.
Equity investments Unlisted equity and fund investments are valued using different techniques in accordance with the Groups valuation policy and International Private Equity and Venture Capital Guidelines.
Depending on the business sector and the circumstances of the investment, unlisted equity valuations are based on earnings multiples, net asset values or discounted cash flows.
A number of earnings multiples are used in valuing the portfolio including price earnings, earnings before interest and tax and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.
The particular multiple selected being appropriate for the type of business being valued and is derived by reference to the current market-based multiple.
Consideration is given to the risk attributes, growth prospects and financial gearing ofcomparable businesses when selecting an appropriate multiple.
Discounted cash flow valuations use estimated future cash flows, usually based on management forecasts, with the application of appropriate exit yields or terminal multiples and discounted using rates appropriate to the specific investment, business sector or recent economic rates of return.
Recent transactions involving the sale of similar businesses may sometimes be used as a frame of reference in deriving an appropriate multiple.
For fund investments the most recent capital account value calculated by the fund manager is used as the basis for the valuation and adjusted, ifnecessary, to align valuation techniques with the Groups valuation policy.
Unlisted equity investments and investments in property partnerships held in the life assurance funds are valued using thirdparty valuations.
Management take account of any pertinent information, such asrecent transactions and information received on particular investments, to adjust the third party valuations where necessary.
B Financial liabilities, excluding derivatives Valuation hierarchy At 31December 2018, the Groups financial liabilities carried at fair value, excluding derivatives, comprised its financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and totalled 30,547million 31December 2017: 50,877million.

The carrying amount of the securities is adjusted to reflect the effect of changes in own credit spreads and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in other comprehensive income.
At 31December 2018, the own credit adjustment arising from the fair valuation of 7,085million 2017: 7,812million of the Groups debt securities in issue designated at fair value through profit or loss resulted in a gain of 533million 2017: loss of 55million, before tax, recognised in other comprehensive income.
Trading liabilities in respect of securities sold under repurchase agreements The fair value of these liabilities is determined using discounted cash flow techniques.
The discount rates are derived from observable repo curves specific to the type of security sold under the repurchase agreement.
C Derivatives All of the Groups derivative assets and liabilities are carried at fair value.
At 31December 2018, such assets totalled 23,595million 31December 2017:25,834million and liabilities totalled 21,373million 31December 2017: 26,124million.
The table below analyses these derivative balances by valuation methodology level 1, 2 or 3, as described on page 243.
There were no significant transfers between level 1 and level 2 during the year.

The types of derivatives classified as level 2 and the valuation techniques used include: Interest rate swaps which are valued using discounted cash flow models: the most significant inputs into those models are interest rate yield curves which are developed from publicly quoted rates.
Foreign exchange derivatives that do not contain options which are priced using rates available from publicly quoted sources.
Credit derivatives which are valued using standard models with observable inputs, except for the items classified as level 3, which are valued using publicly available yield and credit default swap CDS curves.
Less complex interest rate and foreign exchange option products which are valued using volatility surfaces developed from publicly available interest rate cap, interest rate swaption and other option volatilities: option volatility skew information is derived from a market standard consensus pricing service.
For more complex option products, the Group calibrates its models using observable at-the-money data: where necessary, the Group adjusts for out-of-themoney positions using a market standard consensus pricing service.
Complex interest rate and foreign exchange products where there is significant dispersion of consensus pricing or where implied funding costs are material and unobservable are classified as level 3.
Where credit protection, usually in the form of credit default swaps, has been purchased or written on asset-backed securities, the security is referred to as a negative basis asset-backed security and the resulting derivative assets or liabilities have been classified as either level 2 or level 3 according to the classification of the underlying asset-backed security.
Certain unobservable inputs are used to calculate CVA, FVA, and own credit adjustments, but are not considered significant in determining the classification of the derivative and debt portfolios.
Consequently, those inputs do not form part of the Level 3 sensitivities presented.

i Uncollateralised derivative valuation adjustments, excluding monoline counterparties The following table summarises the movement on this valuation adjustment account during 2017 and 2018: 2018 2017 m m At 1 January 521 744 Income stat ement char ge cr edit 47 260 Transfers 6 37 At 31 December 562 521 Represented by: 2018 2017 m m Credit Valuation Adjustment 409 408 Debit Valuation Adjustment 79 37 Funding Valuation Adjustment 232 150 562 521 Credit and Debit Valuation Adjustments CVA and DVA are applied to the Groups over-the-counter derivative exposures with counterparties that are not subject to standard interbank collateral arrangements.
These exposures largely relate to the provision of risk management solutions for corporate customers within the Commercial Banking division.
A CVA is taken where the Group has a positive future uncollateralised exposure asset.
A DVA is taken where the Group has a negative future uncollateralised exposure liability.
These adjustments reflect interest rates and expectations of counterparty creditworthiness and the Groups own credit spread respectively.
The CVA is sensitive to: the current size of the mark-to-market position on the uncollateralised asset: expectations of future market volatility of the underlying asset: and expectations of counterparty creditworthiness.
In circumstances where exposures to a counterparty become impaired, any associated derivative valuation adjustment is transferred and assessed for specific loss alongside other non-derivative assets and liabilities that the counterparty may have with the Group.
Market Credit Default Swap CDS spreads are used to develop the probability of default for quoted counterparties.
For unquoted counterparties, internal credit ratings and market sector CDS curves and recovery rates are used.
The Loss Given Default LGD is based on market recovery rates and internal credit assessments.
The combination of a one notch deterioration in the credit rating of derivative counterparties and a tenpercent increase in LGD increases the CVA by 89million.
Current market value is used to estimate the projected exposure for products not supported by the model, which are principally complex interest rate options that are traded in very low volumes.
For these, the CVA is calculated on an add-on basis although no such adjustment was required at31 December 2018.
The DVA is sensitive to: the current size of the mark-to-market position on the uncollateralised liability: expectations of future market volatility of the underlying liability: and the Groups own CDS spread.
Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2018 249 Note 49: Financial instruments continued A onepercent rise in the CDS spread would lead to an increase in the DVA of 67million to 146million.
The risk exposures that are used for the CVA and DVA calculations are strongly influenced by interest rates.
Due to the nature of the Groups business the CVA DVA exposures tend to be on average the same way around such that the valuation adjustments fall when interest rates rise.
Aonepercent rise in interest rates would lead to a 108million fall in the overall valuation adjustment to 222million.
The CVA model used by theGroup does not assume any correlation between the level of interest rates and default rates.
The Group has also recognised a Funding Valuation Adjustment to adjust for the net cost of funding uncollateralised derivative positions.
This adjustment is calculated on the expected future exposure discounted at a suitable cost of funds.
A ten basis points increase in the cost of funds willincrease the funding valuation adjustment by approximately 23million.
ii Market liquidity The Group includes mid to bid-offer valuation adjustments against the expected cost of closing out the net market risk in the Groups trading positions within a timeframe that is consistent with historical trading activity and spreads that the trading desks have accessed historically during the ordinary course of business in normal market conditions.
At 31December2018, the Groups derivative trading business held mid to bid-offer valuation adjustments of 80million 2017: 74million.

250 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Notes to the consolidated financialstatements continued Note 49: Financial instruments continued Unobservable inputs Significant unobservable inputs affecting the valuation of debt securities, unlisted equity investments and derivatives are as follows: Interest rates and inflation rates are referenced in some derivatives where the payoff that the holder of the derivative receives depends on the behaviour of those underlying references through time.
Credit spreads represent the premium above the benchmark reference instrument required to compensate for lower credit quality: higher spreads lead to a lower fair value.
Volatility parameters represent key attributes of option behaviour: higher volatilities typically denote a wider range of possible outcomes.
Earnings multiples are used to value certain unlisted equity investments: a higher earnings multiple will result in a higher fair value.
Reasonably possible alternative assumptions Valuation techniques applied to many of the Groups level 3 instruments often involve the use of two or more inputs whose relationship is interdependent.
The calculation of the effect of reasonably possible alternative assumptions included in the table above reflects such relationships.
Debt securities Reasonably possible alternative assumptions have been determined in respect of the Groups structured credit investment by flexing creditspreads.
Derivatives Reasonably possible alternative assumptions have been determined in respect of swaptions in the Groups derivative portfolios which are priced using industry standard option pricing models.
Such models require interest rate volatilities which may be unobservable at longer maturities.
To derive reasonably possible alternative valuations these volatilities have been flexed within a range of 19percent to 80percent 2017: 9percent to 94percent.
Unlisted equity, venture capital investments and investments in property partnerships The valuation techniques used for unlisted equity and venture capital investments vary depending on the nature of the investment.
Reasonably possible alternative valuations for these investments have been calculated by reference to the approach taken, as appropriate to the business sector and investment circumstances and as such the following inputs have been considered: for valuations derived from earnings multiples, consideration is given to the risk attributes, growth prospects and financial gearing of comparable businesses when selecting an appropriate multiple: the discount rates used in discounted cash flow valuations: and in line with International Private Equity and Venture Capital Guidelines, the values of underlying investments in fund investments portfolios.
4 Financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost A Financial assets Valuation hierarchy The table below analyses the fair values of the financial assets of the Group which are carried at amortised cost by valuation methodology level1,2or3, as described on page 243.
Financial assets carried at amortised cost are mainly classified as level 3 due to significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation models.
Where inputs are observable, debt securities are classified as level 1 or 2.
Valuation hierarchy Carrying value Fair value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 m m m m m At 31 December 2018 Financial assets at amortised cost: Loans and advances to customers: Stage 1 441,006 440,542 40,483 400,059 Loans and advances to customers: Stage 2 24,351 25,516 25,516 Loans and advances to customers: Stage 3 4,188 3,289 3,289 Loans and advances to customers: purchased or originated credit-impaired 15,313 15,313 15,313 Loans and advances to customers 484,858 484,660 40,483 444,177 Loans and advances to banks 6,283 6,286 461 5,825 Debt securities 5,238 5,244 5,233 11 Reverse repos included in above amounts: Loans and advances to customers 40,483 40,483 40,483 Loans and advances to banks 461 461 461 At 31 December 2017 Financial assets at amortised cost: Loans and advances to customers: unimpaired 467,670 467,276 16,832 450,444 Loans and advances to customers: impaired 4,828 4,809 4,809 Loans and advances to customers 472,498 472,085 16,832 455,253 Loans and advances to banks 6,611 6,564 771 5,793 Debt securities 3,643 3,586 3,571 15 Reverse repos included in above amounts: Loans and advances to customers 16,832 16,832 16,832 Loans and advances to banks 771 771 771 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2018 251 Note 49: Financial instruments continued Valuation methodology Loans and advances to customers The Group provides loans and advances to commercial, corporate and personal customers at both fixed and variable rates due to their short termnature.
The carrying value of the variable rate loans and those relating to lease financing is assumed to be their fair value.
To determine the fair value of loans and advances to customers, loans are segregated into portfolios of similar characteristics.
A number of techniques are used to estimate the fair value of fixed rate lending: these take account of expected credit losses based on historic trends, prevailing market interest rates and expected future cash flows.
For retail exposures, fair value is usually estimated by discounting anticipated cash flows including interest at contractual rates at market rates for similar loans offered by the Group and other financial institutions.
Certain loans secured on residential properties are made at a fixed rate for a limited period, typically two to five years, after which the loans revert to the relevant variable rate.
The fair value of such loans is estimated by reference to the market rates for similar loans of maturity equal to the remaining fixed interest rate period.
The fair value of commercial loans is estimated by discounting anticipated cash flows at a rate which reflects the effects of interest rate changes, adjusted for changes incredit risk.
No adjustment is made to put it in place by the Group to manage its interest rate exposure.
Loans and advances to banks The carrying value of short dated loans and advances to banks is assumed to be their fair value.
The fair value of loans and advances to banks is estimated by discounting the anticipated cash flows at a market discount rate adjusted for the credit spread of the obligor or, where not observable, the credit spread of borrowers of similar credit quality.
Debt securities The fair values of debt securities are determined predominantly from lead manager quotes and, where these are not available, by alternative techniques including reference to credit spreads on similar assets with the same obligor, market standard consensus pricing services, broker quotes and other research data.
Reverse repurchase agreements The carrying amount is deemed a reasonable approximation of fair value given the short-term nature of these instruments.
B Financial liabilities Valuation hierarchy The table below analyses the fair values of the financial liabilities of the Group which are carried at amortised cost by valuation methodology level1,2or 3, as described on page 243.

The fair value for all other deposits is estimated using discounted cash flows applying either market rates, where applicable, or current rates for deposits of similar remaining maturities.
Debt securities in issue The fair value of short-term debt securities in issue is approximately equal to their carrying value.
Fair value for other debt securities is calculated based on quoted market prices where available.
Where quoted market prices are not available, fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow techniques at a rate which reflects market rates of interest and the Groups own credit spread.
Subordinated liabilities The fair value of subordinated liabilities is determined by reference to quoted market prices where available or by reference to quoted market prices of similar instruments.
Subordinated liabilities are classified as level 2, since the inputs used to determine their fair value are largely observable.
Repurchase agreements The carrying amount is deemed a reasonable approximation of fair value given the short term nature of these instruments.
252 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Notes to the consolidated financialstatements continued Note 49: Financial instruments continued 5 Reclassifications of financial assets Other than the reclassifications on adoption of IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018 note 54, there have been no reclassifications of financial assets in 2017 or 2018.
Note 50: Transfers of financial assets There were no significant transferred financial assets which were derecognised in their entirety, but with ongoing exposure.
Details of transferred financial assets that continue to be recognised in full are as follows.
The Group enters into repurchase and securities lending transactions in the normal course of business that do not result in derecognition of the financial assets covered as substantially all of the risks and rewards, including credit, interest rate, prepayment and other price risks are retained by the Group.
In all cases, the transferee has the right to sell or repledge the assets concerned.
As set out in note 30, included within financial assets measured at amortised cost are loans transferred under the Groups securitisation and covered bond programmes.
As the Group retains all of a majority of the risks and rewards associated with these loans, including credit, interest rate, prepayment and liquidity risk, they remain on the Groups balance sheet.
Assets transferred into the Groups securitisation and covered bond programmes are not available to be used by the Group whilst the assets are within the programmes.
However, the Group retains the right to remove loans from the covered bond programmes where they are in excess of the programmes requirements.
In addition, where the Group has retained some of the notes issued by securitisation and covered bond programmes, the Group has the ability to sell or pledge these retainednotes.
The table below sets out the carrying values of the transferred assets and the associated liabilities.
For repurchase and securities lending transactions, the associated liabilities represent the Groups obligation to repurchase the transferred assets.
For securitisation programmes, the associated liabilities represent the external notes in issue note 30.
Except as otherwise noted below, none of the liabilities shown in the table below have recourse only to the transferred assets.

3 The Group enters into derivatives and repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements with various counterparties which are governed by industry standard master netting agreements.
The Group holds and provides cash and securities collateral in respective of derivative transactions covered by these agreements.
The right to set off balances under these master netting agreements or to set off cash and securities collateral only arises in the event of non-payment or default and, as a result, these arrangements do not qualify for offsetting under IAS32.
The effects of over collateralisation have not been taken into account in the above table.
Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2018 255 Note 52: Financial risk management As a bancassurer, financial instruments are fundamental to the Groups activities and, as a consequence, the risks associated with financial instruments represent a significant component of the risks faced by theGroup.
The primary risks affecting the Group through its use of financial instruments are: credit risk: market risk, which includes interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk: liquidity risk: capital risk: and insurance risk.
Information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks and capital can be found on pages 105 to 159.
The following additional disclosures, which provide quantitative information about the risks within financial instruments held or issued by the Group, should be read in conjunction with that earlier information.
Market risk A Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises from the different repricing characteristics of the assets and liabilities.
Liabilities are either insensitive to interest rate movements, for example interest free or very low interest customer deposits, or are sensitive to interest rate changes but bear rates which may be varied at the Groups discretion and that for competitive reasons generally reflect changes in the Bank of Englands base rate.
The rates on the remaining deposits are contractually fixed for their term to maturity.
Many banking assets are sensitive to interest rate movements: there is a large volume of managed rate assets such as variable rate mortgages which may be considered as a natural offset to the interest rate risk arising from the managed rate liabilities.
However, a significant proportion ofthe Groups lending assets, for example many personal loans and mortgages, bear interest rates which are contractually fixed.
The Groups risk management policy is to optimise reward whilst managing its market risk exposures within the risk appetite defined by the Board.
The largest residual risk exposure arises from balances that are deemed to be insensitive to changes in market rates including current accounts, a portion of variable rate deposits and investable equity, and is managed through the Groups structural hedge.
The structural hedge consists of longer-term fixed rate assets or interest rate swaps and the amount and duration of the hedging activity is reviewed regularly by the Group Asset and Liability Committee.
Further details on the Group market risk policy can be found on page 154.
The Group establishes hedge accounting relationships for interest rate risk using cash flow hedges and fair value hedges.
The Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk on its variable rate loans and deposits together with its floating rate subordinated debt.
The derivatives used to manage the structural hedge may be designated into cash flow hedges to manage income statement volatility.
The economic items related to the structural hedge, for example current accounts, are not suitable hedge items to be documented into accounting hedge relationships.
The Group is exposed to fair value interest rate risk on its fixed rate customer loans, its fixed rate customer deposits and the majority of its subordinated debt, and to cash flow interest rate risk on its variable rate loans and deposits together with its floating rate subordinated debt.
The Group applies netting between similar risks before applying hedge accounting.
Hedge ineffectiveness arises during the management of interest rate risk due to residual unhedged risk.
Sources of ineffectiveness, which the Group may decide to not fully mitigate, can include basis differences, timing differences and notional amount differences.
The effectiveness of accounting hedge relationships is assessed between the hedging derivatives and the documented hedged item, which can differ to the underlying economically hedged item.
At 31December 2018 the aggregate notional principal of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges was 150,971million 2017:109,670million with a net fair value asset of 760million 2017: asset of 738million note 17.
The gains on the hedging instruments were 94million 2017:losses of 420million.
The losses on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk were 32million 2017:gains of 484million.
The gains and losses relating to the fair value hedges are recorded in net trading income.
In addition the Group has cash flow hedges which are primarily used to hedge the variability in the cost of funding within the commercial business.
Note17 shows when the hedged cash flows are expected to occur and when they will affect income for designated cashflow hedges.
The notional principal of the interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges at 31December 2018 was 556,945million 2017:549,099million with a net fair value liability of 486million 2017: liability of 456million note17.
In 2018, ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement that arises from cash flow hedges was a loss of 25million 2017: loss of 21million.
B Currency risk The corporate and retail businesses incur foreign exchange risk in the course of providing services to their customers.
All non-structural foreign exchange exposures in the non-trading book are transferred to the trading area where they are monitored and controlled.
These risks reside in the authorised trading centres who are allocated exposure limits.
The limits are monitored daily by the local centres and reported to the market and liquidity risk function in London.
Associated VaR and the closing, average, maximum and minimum are disclosed on page 159.
The Group also manages foreign currency risk via cash flow hedge accounting, utilising currency swaps.
Risk arises from the Groups investments in its overseas operations.
The Groups structural foreign currency exposure is represented by the net asset value of the foreign currency equity and subordinated debt investments in its subsidiaries and branches.
Gains or losses on structural foreign currency exposures are taken to reserves.
The Group ceased all hedging of the currency translation risk of the net investment in foreign operations on 1 January 2018.
At 31December2017 the Group used foreign currency borrowings with an aggregate principal of 41million to hedge currency translation risk.
In 2017, an ineffectiveness loss of 11million before tax and 8million after tax was recognised in the income statement arising from netinvestment hedges.

Information about the Groups exposure to credit risk, credit risk management, measurement and mitigation can be found on pages 115 to 135.
A Maximum credit exposure The maximum credit risk exposure of the Group in the event of other parties failing to perform their obligations is detailed below.
No account is taken of any collateral held and the maximum exposure to loss, which includes amounts held to cover unit-linked and With Profits funds liabilities, is considered to be the balance sheet carrying amount or, for non-derivative off-balance sheet transactions and financial guarantees, their contractual nominal amounts.

Credit risk in respect of trading and other financial assets at fair value through profit or loss held within the Groups unit-linked funds is borne by the policyholders and credit risk in respect of with-profits funds is largely borne by the policyholders.
Consequently, the Group has no significant exposure to credit risk for such assets which back those contract liabilities.
Derivative assets An analysis of derivative assets is given in note17.
The Group reduces exposure to credit risk by using master netting agreements and by obtaining collateral in the form of cash or highly liquid securities.
In respect of the Groups net credit risk relating to derivative assets of 9,268million 2017:12,785million, cash collateral of 6,039million 2017:5,419million was held and a further 213million was due from OECD banks 2017:275million.
2 Other comprises sub-investment grade 2018: 1,920million: 2017: 1,878million and not rated 2018: 344million: 2017: 340million.
Financial guarantees and irrevocable loan commitments Financial guarantees represent undertakings that the Group will meet a customers obligation to third parties if the customer fails to do so.
Commitments to extend credit represent unused portions of authorisations to extend credit in the form of loans, guarantees or letters of credit.
The Group is theoretically exposed to loss in an amount equal to the total guarantees or unused commitments, however, the likely amount of loss is expected to be significantly less: most commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards.
D Collateral held as security for financial assets A general description of collateral held as security in respect of financial instruments is provided on page 116.
The Group holds collateral against loans and advances and irrevocable loan commitments: qualitative and, where appropriate, quantitative information is provided in respect of this collateral below.
Collateral held as security for financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and for derivative assets is also shown below.
The Group holds collateral in respect of loans and advances to banks and customers as set out below.
The Group does not hold collateral against debt securities, comprising asset-backed securities and corporate and other debt securities, which are classified as financial assets held at amortised cost.
264 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Notes to the consolidated financialstatements continued Note 52: Financial risk management continued Loans and advances to banks There were reverse repurchase agreements which are accounted for as collateralised loans within loans and advances to banks with a carrying valueof 461million 2017:771million, against which the Group held collateral with a fair value of 481million 2017:796million.
These transactions were generally conducted under terms that are usual and customary for standard secured lending activities.
Loans and advances to customers Retail lending Mortgages An analysis by loan-to-value ratio of the Group's residential mortgage lending is provided below.
The value of collateral used in determining the loan-to-value ratios has been estimated based upon the last actual valuation, adjusted to take into account subsequent movements in house prices, aftermaking allowances for indexation error and dilapidations.
In some circumstances, where the discounted value of the estimated net proceeds from the liquidation of collateral i. e. net of costs, expected haircuts and anticipated changes in the value of the collateral to the point of sale is greater than the estimated exposure at default, no credit losses are expected and no ECL allowance is recognised.
At 31 December 2018, Stage 3 non-mortgage lending amounted to 631million, net of an impairment allowance of 366million 2017: impaired non-mortgage lending amounted to 817million, net of an impairment allowance of 542million.
Stage 1 and Stage 2 non-mortgage retail lending amounted to 52,450million 2017: unimpaired non-mortgage lending amounted to 49,482million.
Lending decisions are predominantly based on an obligors ability to repay from normal business operations rather than reliance on the disposal of any security provided.
Collateral values are rigorously assessed at the time of loan origination and are thereafter monitored in accordance with business unit credit policy.
The Group credit risk disclosures for unimpaired non-mortgage retail lending report assets gross of collateral and therefore disclose the maximum loss exposure.
The Group believes that this approach is appropriate.
Commercial lending Reverse repurchase transactions At 31 December 2018 there were reverse repurchase agreements which were accounted for as collateralised loans with a carrying value of 40,483million 2017:16,832million, against which the Group held collateral with a fair value of 42,339million 2017: 17,122million, all of which the Group was able to repledge.
Included in these amounts were collateral balances in the form of cash provided in respect of reverse repurchase agreements of nil 2017:nil.
Stage 3 secured lending The value of collateral is re-evaluated and its legal soundness re-assessed if there is observable evidence of distress of the borrower: this evaluation is used to determine potential loss allowances and managements strategy to try to either repair the business or recover the debt.
At 31 December 2018, Stage 3 secured commercial lending amounted to 658million, net of an impairment allowance of 215million 2017:impaired secured commercial lending amounted to 698million, net of an impairment allowance of 242million.
The fair value of the collateral held in respect of impaired secured commercial lending was 590million 2017:797 million.
In determining the fair value of collateral, no specific amounts have been attributed to the costs of realisation.
For the purposes of determining the total collateral held by the Group in respect of impaired secured commercial lending, the value of collateral for each loan has been limited to the principal amount of the outstanding advance in order to eliminate the effects of any  and to provide a clearer representation of the Groups exposure.
Stage 3 secured commercial lending and associated collateral relates to lending to property companies and to customers in the financial, business and other services: transport, distribution and hotels: and construction industries.
Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2018 265 Note 52: Financial risk management continued Stage 1 and Stage 2 secured lending For Stage 1 and Stage 2 secured commercial lending, the Group reports assets gross of collateral and therefore discloses the maximum loss exposure.
The Group believes that this approach is appropriate as collateral values at origination and during a period of good performance may not be representative of the value of collateral if the obligor enters a distressed state.
Stage 1 and Stage 2 secured commercial lending is predominantly managed on a cash flow basis.
On occasion, it may include an assessment of underlying collateral, although, for Stage 3 lending, this will not always involve assessing it on a fair value basis.
No aggregated collateral information for the entire unimpaired secured commercial lending portfolio is provided to key management personnel.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss excluding equity shares Included in financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are reverse repurchase agreements treated as collateralised loans with a carrying value of 28,356million 2017:31,590million.
Collateral is held with a fair value of 36,101million 2017:39,099million, all of which the Group is able to repledge.
In addition, securities held as collateral in the form of stock borrowed amounted to 51,202million 2017:61,469million.
Of this amount, 49,233million 2017:44,432million had been resold or repledged as collateral for the Groups own transactions.
Derivative assets, after offsetting of amounts under master netting arrangements The Group reduces exposure to credit risk by using master netting agreements and by obtaining collateral in the form of cash or highly liquidsecurities.
In respect of the net derivative assets after offsetting of amounts under master netting arrangements of 14,327million 2017:12,785million, cash collateral of 6,039million 2017:5,419million was held.
Irrevocable loan commitments and other credit-related contingencies At 31 December 2018, the Group held irrevocable loan commitments and other credit-related contingencies of 62,640million 2017: 63,237million.
Collateral is held as security, in the event that lending is drawn down, on 10,661million 2017:10,956million of these balances.
Collateral repossessed During the year, 245million of collateral was repossessed 2017: 297million, consisting primarily of residential property.
In respect of retail portfolios, the Group does not take physical possession of properties or other assets held as collateral and uses external agents to realise the value as soon as practicable, generally at auction, to settle indebtedness.
Any surplus funds are returned to the borrower or are otherwise dealt with in accordance with appropriate insolvency regulations.
In certain circumstances the Group takes physical possession of assets held as collateral against commercial lending.
In such cases, the assets are carried on the Groups balance sheet and are classified according to the Groups accounting policies.
E Collateral pledged as security The Group pledges assets primarily for repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions which are generally conducted under terms that are usual and customary for standard securitised borrowing contracts.
Repurchase transactions Deposits from banks Included in deposits from banks are balances arising from repurchase transactions of 21,170million 2017: 23,175million : the fair value of the collateral provided under these agreements at 31 December 2018 was 19,615million 2017: 23,082million.
Customer deposits Included in customer deposits are balances arising from repurchase transactions of 1,818million 2017: 2,638million : the fair value of the collateral provided under these agreements at 31 December 2018 was 1,710million 2017: 2,640million.
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss The fair value of collateral pledged in respect of repurchase transactions, accounted for as secured borrowing, where the secured party is permitted by contract or custom to repledge was 28,438million 2017: 48,765million.
Securities lending transactions The following on balance sheet financial assets have been lent to counterparties under securities lending transactions: 2018 2017 m m Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 5,837 6,622 Loans and advances to customers 197 Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income 2017: available-for-sale financial assets 1,917 2,608 7,754 9,427 Securitisations and covered bonds In addition to the assets detailed above, the Group also holds assets that are encumbered through the Groups asset-backed conduits and its securitisation and covered bond programmes.
Further details of these assets are provided in notes 30 and 48.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group has insufficient financial resources to meet its commitments as they fall due, or can only secure them at excessive cost.
Liquidity risk is managed through a series of measures, tests and reports that are primarily based on contractual maturity.
The Group carries out monthly stress testing of its liquidity position against a range of scenarios, including those prescribed by the PRA.
The Groups liquidity risk appetite is also calibrated against a number of stressed liquidity metrics.
266 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Notes to the consolidated financialstatements continued Note 52: Financial risk management continued The table below analyses assets and liabilities of the Group into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining contractual period at the balance sheet date: balances with no fixed maturity are included in the over 5 years category.
Certain balances, included in the table below on the basis of their residual maturity, are repayable on demand upon payment of a penalty.
The Groups assets and liabilities may be repaid or otherwise mature earlier or later than implied by their contractual terms and readers are, therefore, advised to use caution when using this data to evaluate the Groups liquidity position.
In particular, amounts in respect of customer deposits are usually contractually payable on demand or at short notice.
However, in practice, these deposits are not usually withdrawn on their contractual maturity.

These unit-linked products are invested in accordance with unit fund mandates.
Clauses are included in policyholder contracts to permit the deferral of sales, where necessary, so that linked assets can be realised without being a forced seller.
The principal amount for undated subordinated liabilities with no redemption option is included within the over five years column: interest of approximately 27million 2017: 24million per annum which is payable in respect of those instruments for as long as they remain in issue is not included beyond five years.

In accordance with the transition requirements of IFRS9, comparative information for 2017 has not been restated and transitional adjustments have been accounted for through retained earnings as at 1 January 2018, the date of initial application: and as a result shareholders equity reduced by 1,180million, driven by the effects of additional impairment provisions following the implementation of the expected credit loss methodology and measurement adjustments following the reclassification of certain financial assets to be measured at fair value rather than amortised cost.
It is not practicable to quantify the impact of adoption of IFRS9 on the results for the current year.
The following table summarises the impact of the transitional adjustment on the Groups loss allowances at 1 January 2018: IAS 39 allowance Transitional IFRS9 loss at 31 December adjustment to loss allowance at 2017 allowance 1 January 2018 m m m Loans and advances to banks 1 1 Loans and advances to customers 2,201 1,022 3,223 Debt securities 26 26 Other 10 10 2,227 1,033 3,260 Provisions for undrawn commitments and financial guarantees 30 243 273 Total loss allowance 2,257 1,276 3,533 There were no impacts on the Groups loss allowances as a result of changes in the measurement category of financial assets at 1 January 2018.
The net impact of IFRS 9 on transition was an increase in impairment allowances of 1,276 million which is analysed as follows: Multiple IAS 39 12-month Lifetime Undrawn economic Latent risk expected loss expected loss commitments scenarios Total m m m m m m Retail Secured 561 24 371 1 226 61 Unsecured 133 279 251 161 8 566 UK Motor Finance 99 112 72 1 1 87 Other 30 30 29 13 4 46 823 445 723 176 239 760 Commercial Banking 190 108 330 60 63 371 Insurance and Wealth 5 15 6 1 17 Other 115 51 144 48 128 Total 1,133 619 1,203 236 351 1,276 The key drivers for the provision movements from IAS 39 to IFRS 9 for the Group are as follows: Latent risk: under IAS 39 provisions were held against losses that had been incurred at the balance sheet date but had either not been specifically identified or not been adequately captured in the provisioning models.
Under IFRS 9 assets which had not defaulted are allocated to Stages 1 and 2 and an appropriate expected credit loss allowance made.
12-month expected loss: IFRS 9 requires that for financial assets where there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination Stage 1 a loss allowance equivalent to 12-month expected credit losses should be held.
Under IAS 39 these balances would not be specifically provided against although a provision for latent risk would be held.
Lifetime expected credit loss: financial assets that have experienced a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition Stage 2 and credit impaired assets Stage 3 are required to carry a lifetime expected credit loss allowance.
Under IAS 39, Stage 2 assets were treated as performing and consequently no specific impairment provision was held, although a proportion of the provision held against latent risks was held against these assets.
Assets treated as impaired under IAS 39 carried a provision reducing the carrying value to the estimated recoverable amount.
Undrawn commitments: IFRS 9 requires a loss allowance to be held against undrawn lending commitments.
Previously, an impairment provision would only have been held in the event that the commitment was irrevocable and a loss event had occurred.
Multiple economic scenarios: IFRS 9 requires that the expected credit loss allowance should reflect an unbiased range of possible future economic outcomes.
This was not required under IAS 39.
Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2018 273 Note 54: Adoption of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 continued Reclassifications On transition to IFRS 9, the Group assessed its business models in order to determine the appropriate classification.
The Retail and Commercial Banking loan books are generally held to collect contractual cash flows until the lending matures and met the criteria to remain at amortised cost.
Certain portfolios which are subject to higher levels of sales were reclassified as fair value through other comprehensive income.
Within the Groups insurance business, assets are managed on a fair value basis and so continued to be accounted for at fair value through profit or loss.

Upon implementation of IFRS 9, these assets were been designated at FVTPL, in common with other assets within the insurance business, as they are backing insurance and investment contract liabilities which either have cash flows that are contractually based upon the performance of the assets or are contracts whose measurement takes account of current market conditions and where significant measurement inconsistencies would otherwise arise.
Loans and advances to banks of 2,274 million were transferred to FVTPL for similar reasons.
assets held by the Commercial business totalling 3,116 million were reclassified to FVTPL having not met the requirements of the SPPI test.
These assets are principally holdings of notes issued by securitisation vehicles.
Whilst the credit quality of these notes is generally good, there is a contractual linkage to the underlying asset pools which are exposed to residual value risk.
A further 847 million of Commercial lending assets were reclassified following changes in the business model.
At 1 January 2018, the Group was required to reclassify certain assets from fair value through profit or loss to fair value through other comprehensive income: these assets were sold during the course of the year.
If these assets had not been reclassified, the Group would have recognised a loss of 0.2million in the period before being sold.
The effective interest rate applied to these assets on 1 January 2018 was 1.97 per cent, and the interest revenue recognised prior to the sale was 20 million.
274 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Notes to the consolidated financialstatements continued Note 54: Adoption of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 continued Remeasurements There has been a pre-tax charge of 229million 207million net of tax arising from the reclassification of financial assets and liabilities to fair value through profit or loss and fair value through other comprehensive income and consequent remeasurement to fair value.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers The Group has adopted IFRS 15 from 1 January 2018 and in nearly all cases the Groups existing accounting policy was consistent with the requirements of IFRS 15: however, certain income streams within the Groups car leasing business are now deferred, resulting in an additional 14million being recognised as deferred income at 1 January 2018 with a corresponding debit of 11million, net of tax, to shareholders equity.
As permitted by the transition options under IFRS 15, comparative figures for the prior year have not been restated.
The impact of adoption of IFRS 15 on the current period is not material.
Accounting policies applied for comparative periods In accordance with the transition requirements of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15, comparative information has not been restated.
The comparative information was prepared in accordance with IAS 39 and IAS 18.
With the exception of certain income streams within the Groups car leasing business, the Group accounting policy under IAS 18 was substantially aligned with the requirements of IFRS 15 and is not reproduced here: the principal policies applied by the Group under IAS 39 are set out below: Impairment At each balance sheet date the Group assesses whether, as a result of one or more events occurring after initial recognition of a financial asset accounted for at amortised cost and prior to the balance sheet date, there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets has become impaired.
Where such an event, including the identification of fraud, has had an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets, an impairment allowance is recognised.
The amount of impairment allowance is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the assets original effective interest rate.
The Group assesses, at each balance sheet date, whether there is objective evidence that an available-for-sale financial asset is impaired.
In addition to the criteria for financial assets accounted for at amortised cost set out above, this assessment involves reviewing the current financial circumstances including creditworthiness and future prospects of the issuer, assessing the future cash flows expected to be realised and, in the case of equity shares, considering whether there has been a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the asset below its cost.
If an impairment loss has been incurred, the cumulative loss measured as the difference between the acquisition cost net of any principal repayment and amortisation and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that asset previously recognised, is reclassified from equity to the income statement.
Classification and measurement On initial recognition, financial assets are classified into fair value through profit or loss, available for sale financial assets, held to maturity investments or loans and receivables.
Financial instruments are classified at fair value through profit or loss where they are trading securities or where they are designated at fair value through profit or loss by management.
Derivatives are carried at fair value.
Loans and receivables include loans and advances to banks and customers and are accounted for at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Debt securities and equity shares that are not classified as trading securities, at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity investments or as loans and receivables are classified as available-for-sale financial assets and are recognised in the balance sheet at their fair value, inclusive of transaction costs.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, until the financial asset is either sold, becomes impaired or matures, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in the income statement.
Interest calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in the income statement Note 55: Future accounting developments The following pronouncements are not applicable for the year ending 31 December 2018 and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements.
Save as disclosed below, the impact of these accounting changes is still being assessed by the Group and reliable estimates cannot be made at this stage.
With the exception of IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts and certain other minor amendments as at 19February 2019 these pronouncements have been endorsed by the EU.
IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 replaces IAS 17 Leases and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
The Groups accounting as a lessor will remain aligned to the current approach under IAS 17: however for lessee accounting there will no longer be a distinction between finance and operating leases.
The transition approach adopted by the Group will result in the recognition of right of use assets and lease liabilities of approximately 1.8billion in respect of leased properties previously accounted for as operating leases: there will be no impact on shareholders equity.
As permitted by the transition options under IFRS 16, comparative figures for the prior year will not be restated.
Going forward, the Group will recognise a finance charge on the lease liability and a depreciation charge on the right-of-use asset, whereas previously the Group included lease rentals within operating expenses.
The Group intends to take advantage of a number of exemptions within IFRS 16, including the election not to recognise a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for leases for which the underlying asset is of low value.
IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts IFRS 17 replaces IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts and is currently effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021 although the International Accounting Standards Board have proposed delaying implementation until 1 January 2022.
IFRS 17 requires insurance contracts and participating investment contracts to be measured on the balance sheet as the total of the fulfilment cash flows and the contractual service margin.
Changes to estimates of future cash flows from one reporting date to another are recognised either as an amount in profit or loss or as an adjustment to the expected profit for providing insurance coverage, depending on the type of change and the reason for it.
The effects of some changes in discount rates can either be recognised in profit or loss or in other comprehensive income as an accounting policy choice.
The risk adjustment is released to profit and loss as an insurers risk reduces.
Profits which are currently recognised through a Value in Force asset, will no longer be recognised at inception of an insurance contract.
Instead, the expected profit for providing insurance coverage is recognised in profit or loss over time as the insurance coverage is provided.
The standard will have a significant impact on the accounting for the insurance and participating investment contracts issued by the Group.
Minor amendments to other accounting standards The IASB has issued a number of minor amendments to IFRSs effective 1 January 2019 and 1 January 2020 including IAS 19 Employee Benefits, IAS12 Income Taxes and IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments.
The Group will adopt the changes to IAS 12 Income Taxes with effect from 1January2019, resulting in the presentation of the tax benefit of distributions on other equity instruments in the Groups income statement: these impacts are currently recognised directly in equity.
Comparative information will be restated.
For the comparative year ended 31 December 2018, this will result in the reclassification of a tax credit of 106 million 2017: 102 million.
These changes will have no impact on the Groups reported balance sheet or profit before tax.
The amendments to other accounting standards are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group.
