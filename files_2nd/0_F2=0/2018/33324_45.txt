At that point, the amounts are considered irrecoverable and are written off against the trade receivable directly, with a corresponding charge being recorded in administration costs.
Where trade receivables are past due, an assessment is made of individual customers and the outstanding balance.
No provision is required in respect of amounts owed by subsidiary companies.
The creation and release of the trade receivables provision has been included within administration costs in the income statement.
The other classes within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets.
Company prepayments for the year to 28 January 2017 have been restated to reflect the change in accounting policy treatment of a payment made to the pension scheme for the rental of the property that was transferred from the Company into the pension scheme as part of the asset backed funding arrangement.
