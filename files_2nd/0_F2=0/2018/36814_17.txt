Financial assets continued Trade receivables The Company has a policy for providing fully for those receivable balances that it does not expect to recover.
This assessment has been undertaken by reviewing the status of all significant balances that are past due and involves assessing both the reason for non-payment and the creditworthiness of the counterparty.
Ageing of past due but not impaired receivables: 2018 2017 m m Current 417.0 368.3 Balance at 31 March 417.0 368.3 In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Company considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date.
The concentration of credit risk is mitigated through the close management and regular review of performance of the subsidiary companies.
No allowance for doubtful debts is considered necessary based on prior experience and the Directors assessment of the current economic environment.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.
Cash balances and cash equivalents Cash balances and cash equivalents of 75.6m FY17: nil comprise cash held by the Company and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.

Capital risk management The Company manages its capital to ensure that it is able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to stakeholders through the appropriate balance of debt and equity.
The capital structure of the Company consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 41, cash and cash equivalents disclosed in note 38 and equity comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in this note and notes 25, 26 and the Company Statement of Changes in Equity.

Financial risk management objectives The Companys principal financial instruments comprise bank and other loans, overdrafts and cash and cash equivalents.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Companys operations.
The Company also has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly from its operations.
The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
HomeServe plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 199 Company financial statements Interest rate risk The Companys exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates primarily relates to the Companys long-term debt requirements with floating interest rates.
The Companys policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate debts.
The Companys exposure to interest rate risk is closely aligned to that of the Group, more details of which can be found in note 24.
Foreign currency risk The Company has exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies due to borrowings made to fund investments in its overseas subsidiaries which are affected by foreign exchange movements.
The carrying amount of the Companys foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the year end are set out in the table below.

Financial instruments continued Liquidity risk Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Companys Board which sets the framework for the management of the Companys short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities and continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows.
Included in note 23 are details of the undrawn facilities that are available to the Company and the Group to further reduce liquidity risk.

APMs used in this annual report address profitability, leverage and liquidity and together with operational KPIs give an indication of the current health and future prospects of the Group.
Definitions of APMs and the rationale for their usage are included below with a reconciliation, where applicable, back to the equivalent statutory measure.
Profitability The Group uses adjusted operating profit, EBITDA, adjusted profit before tax and adjusted earnings per share as its primary profit performance measures.
These are non-IFRS measures which exclude the impact of the amortisation of acquisition intangible assets.
Intangible assets principally arise as a result of the past actions of the former owners of businesses in respect of marketing and business development activity.
Therefore, the adjusted measures reflect the post acquisition revenue attributable to, and operating costs incurred by, the Group.
In FY18 the adjusted earnings per share measure also removes the one-off effect of a deferred tax benefit arising as a result of US and French tax reform.
This is considered a more accurate indicator of the underlying operational and financial performance and a better guide to future performance.

Following the growth of the Group since the last review of the capital structure policy, the Board has determined that the Group can now support a leverage policy range of 1.0 to 2.0x Net Debt: EBITDA at March year ends.
The range reflects HomeServes relatively low risk appetite.
Due to the seasonality of the business and depending on M&A opportunities, HomeServe is able to operate outside 1.0 to 2.0x for periods of time but with a highly cash generative business model HomeServe will seek to return to its target range.
The leverage ratio is also important as it factors into the Groups banking covenants and the rolling 12 month rate at the half year influences the forward interest rates payable on the Groups Revolving Credit Facility.
Certain of the Groups segmental bonus measures relate to net cash.
Net cash is defined and calculated in the same way as net debt but returns a positive closing balance.
Note 23 provides a full reconciliation of the movements in liabilities arising from borrowings and finance leases.
The closing balances at 31 March were as follows: million 2018 2017 Current liabilities from borrowings and finance leases Finance leases 0.5 0.6 Bank and other loans 38.0 35.9 38.5 36.5 Non-current liabilities from borrowings and finance leases Finance leases 0.4 1.0 Bank and other loans 256.7 270.1 257.1 271.1 Total liabilities from borrowings and finance leases 295.6 307.6 Cash and cash equivalents 57.8 46.2 Net Debt 237.8 261.4 EBITDA 197.6 154.2 Leverage 1.2x 1.7x HomeServe plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 213 Glossary Liquidity Cash conversion % is defined as cash generated by operations divided by adjusted operating profit.
The measure demonstrates the cash generative nature of the ordinary trading operations of HomeServes business model and the ability to produce positive cashflows that can be invested for future growth initiatives or in capital projects to maintain customer service initiatives, digital enhancements or efficiencies that benefit the long-term health of the business.
Free cash flow is stated after capital expenditure, tax and interest obligations and is an indication of the strength of the business to generate funds to meet its liabilities and repay borrowings.
It also shows the funds that might be made available to pursue M&A activities and to pay dividends.
