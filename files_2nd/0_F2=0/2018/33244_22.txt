a Basis of accounting The financial statements have been presented under Financial Reporting Standard 102 FRS 102 and under the AICs Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts SORP issued in 2014, updated in February 2018.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of the Companys investments as described below.
The functional and presentation currency is pounds sterling, which is the currency of the environment in which the Company operates.
The Board confirms that no significant accounting judgements or estimates have been applied to the financial statements and therefore there is not a significant risk of a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
b Investments The Companys investments have been categorised as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss as the Companys business is to invest in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of capital growth and income.
Quoted investments are valued at their fair value, which is represented by the bid price.
Where trading in the securities of an investee company is suspended, the investment is valued at the Boards estimate of its fair value.
Purchases and sales of investments are recognised and fide-recognised on trade date.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in the capital return for the period and transaction costs on acquisition or disposal of a security are expensed to the capital reserve.
c Income Dividends receivable on quoted equity shares are accounted for on the ex dividend date as revenue, except where, in the opinion of the Board, the dividend is capital in nature, in which case it is treated as a return of capital.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, an amount equivalent to the cash dividend is recognised as income.
Any surplus or deficit in the value of the shares received compared to the cash dividend forgone is recognised as capital.
Other income is accounted for on an accruals basis.
d Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are charged to revenue except as follows: expenses that are related to the acquisition and disposal of an investment are charged to capital: and expenses are charged to capital reserve where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated.
In this respect the investment management fee has been allocated 62.5% to capital reserve and 37.5% to revenue reserve, in line with the Boards expected long-term split of returns, in the form of capital gains and income respectively, from the investment portfolio of the Company.
e Finance costs Interest costs are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Finance costs of debt, insofar as they relate to the financing of the Companys investments or to financing activities aimed at maintaining or enhancing the value of the Companys investments, are allocated 62.5% to capital reserve and 37.5% to revenue reserve, in line with the Boards expected long-term split of returns, in the form of capital gains and income respectively, from the investment portfolio of the Company.
The arrangement fee in relation to the 125 million bank debt facility is being amortised over the expected life of the facility with 62.5% allocated to capital reserve and 37.5% to revenue reserve on a straight line basis.
The unamortised value of these costs is deducted from the fair value of the bank debt facility.
f Capital reserve The following are accounted for in this reserve: gains and losses on the realisation of investments: increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end: gains on the return of capital by way of investee companies paying dividends that are capital in nature: and expenses, together with the related taxation effect, charged to this reserve in accordance with the above policies.
g Special reserve This reserve may be treated as distributable profits for all purposes, excluding the payment of dividends.
The cost of purchasing Ordinary Shares for cancellation is accounted for in this reserve.
h Revenue reserve This reserve represents the only reserve from which dividends can be funded.
i Capital Redemption Reserve The nominal value of shares bought back for cancellation is added to this reserve.

The Company believes that APMs, referred to as Key Performance Indicators on page 6, provide shareholders with important information on the Company and are appropriate for an investment trust company.
These APMs are also a component of management reporting to the Board.

Bank debt facilities are utilised when the Managers believe it is in the interest of the Company to gear the portfolio.
Note 1 sets out the significant accounting policies, including criteria for recognition of and the basis of measurement applied for significant financial instruments excluding cash at bank, which is carried at fair value.
Note 1 also includes the basis on which income and expenses arising from financial assets and liabilities are recognised and measured.
The main risks that the Company faces arising from its financial instruments are as follows: i Interest rate risk, is the risk that the interest receivable payable and the market value of investment holdings may fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
The Companys investment portfolio is not directly exposed to interest rate risk.
ii Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty raising funds to meet its cash commitments as they fall due.
Liquidity risk may result from either the inability to sell financial instruments quickly at their fair values or from the inability to generate cash inflows as required.
iii Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment that it has entered into with the Company.
iv Market price risk is the risk that the market value of investment holdings will fluctuate as a result of fluctuations in market prices caused by factors other than interest rate or currency rate movement.
The Companys financial instruments are all denominated in sterling and therefore the Company is not directly exposed to significant currency risk.
However, it is recognised that most investee companies, whilst listed in the UK, are exposed to global economic conditions and currency fluctuations.
i Interest rate risk The Companys policy is to hold cash in variable rate bank accounts and not usually to invest in fixed rate securities.
Cash deposit balances are held on variable rate bank accounts yielding nil as at 31 December 2018 2017: 0.10%.
The Company has a bank debt facility of 125,000,000 of which 17,500,000 was drawn down as at 31 December 2018 2017: debt facility of 125,000,000, of which 8,750,000 was drawn down.
Further details of this facility can be found in Note 13.
If LIBOR and the bank base rate had been 1% point higher at 31 December 2018, the impact on the profit or loss and therefore Shareholders funds would have been negative 175,000 per annum 2017: negative 87,500.
If LIBOR and the bank base rate had been 0.25% point lower at 31 December 2018, the impact on the profit or loss and therefore Shareholders funds would have been a positive 43,750 per annum 2017: positive 21,875.
There would be no direct impact on the portfolio valuation.
The calculations are based on the bank facility drawn down and cash balances as at the respective balance sheet dates and are not representative of the year as a whole and assume all other variables remain constant.
The level of change is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on current market conditions.

Short term funding flexibility can be achieved through the use of bank debt facilities.
The Companys current liabilities all have a remaining contractual maturity of less than three months with the exception of the bank debt facility.
iii Credit risk The Company invests in UK equities traded on the London Stock Exchange.
Investment transactions are carried out with a number of FCA regulated brokers, with trades typically undertaken on a delivery versus payment basis and on a short settlement period.
The investment portfolio assets of the Company are held by The Northern Trust Company, the Companys custodian, in a segregated account.
In the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of Northern Trust the Companys rights with respect to the securities held by the custodian may be delayed or limited.
The Secretaries and the Depositary monitor the Companys risk by reviewing Northern Trusts credit ratings and their internal control report.
Cash at bank is held with reputable banks with acceptable external credit ratings.
Outstanding investment income is reconciled to receipts on payment date.
The exposure to credit risk at the year-end comprises: 2018 2017 000 000 Investment income receivable 3,187 3,610 Cash at bank 59 293 3,246 3,903 iv Market price risk The Companys investment portfolio is exposed to market price fluctuations, which are monitored by the investment managers in pursuance of the investment objective.
Further information on the investment portfolio is set out in the Managers Report on pages 8 to 12.
It is not the Managers policy to use derivatives or hedging instruments to manage market price risk.
If the investment portfolio valuation fell by 10% at 31 December 2018, the impact on the profit or loss and therefore Shareholders funds would have been negative 116.8m 2017: negative 144.0m.
If the investment portfolio valuation rose by 10% at 31 December 2018, the impact on the profit or loss and therefore Shareholders funds would have been positive 116.8m 2017: positive 144.0m.
The calculations are based on the portfolio valuation as at the respective balance sheet dates, are not representative of the year as a whole and assume all other variables remain constant.
The level of change is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on historic stockmarket volatility.
As at 31 December 2018, all of the Companys financial instruments excluding loans were included in the balance sheet at fair value.
The investment portfolio consisted of investments, other than two investments that have been fair valued at nil, valued at their bid price, which represents fair value.
Any cash balances, which are held in variable rate bank accounts, can be withdrawn on demand with no penalty.

This is achieved through the appropriate balance of equity capital and gearing.
Further details can be found in the Strategic Report.
The Company does not have any externally imposed capital requirements other than the covenant on its bank debt facility as set out in Note 13.
20 Related Party Transactions Directors fees and their shareholdings are detailed in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 31 and 32.
There were no matters requiring disclosure under s412 of the Companies Act 2006.
