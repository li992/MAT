Appendices For the year ended 31 December 2018 Appendix A: Other accounting policies Investments in associates An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, through its participation in the entitys financial and operating policy decisions.
Significant influence is generally demonstrated by the Group holding between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.
Where voting rights are irrelevant, all other factors, contractual or otherwise, are assessed in determining whether the Group has the ability to exercise significant influence.
The results, assets and liabilities of associates, other than those that are measured at FVTPL see below are incorporated into these consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting from the date that significant influence commences until the date itends.
Under this method, the cost of the investment in an associate together with the Groups share of that entitys post-acquisition changes to shareholders funds is included as an asset in the consolidated statement of financial position.
The cost includes goodwill recognised on acquisition.
The Groups share of associates post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the income statement and its share of postacquisition movements in reserves is recognised in reserves.
Where a Group entity transacts with an associate of the Group, unrealised profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the relevant associate.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Investments in associates that are held with a view to subsequent resale are accounted for as non-current assets held for sale.
Where the Group has an investment in an associate, a portion of which is held by, or is held indirectly through a unit trust or similar entity, including investment-linked insurance funds, that portion of the investment is measured at FVTPL.
Foreign currency translation The Groups presentation currency is pounds sterling.
The functional currency of the Groups foreign operations is the currency of the primary economic environment in which these entities operate.
The Parent Company functional currency is pounds sterling.
Income statements and cash flows of foreign entities are translated into the Groups presentation currency at average exchange rates for the year and their statements of financial position are translated at the year-end exchange rates.
Exchange rate differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign subsidiaries and associates are recognised in other comprehensive income and taken to the currency translation reserve within equity.
To the extent that these gains and losses are effectively hedged, the cumulative effect of such gains and losses arising on the hedging instruments are also included in that component of shareholders equity.
On disposal of a foreign entity, exchange differences are transferred out of this reserve to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Foreign currency transactions are converted into the relevant functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the relevant functional currency at exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated into the functional currency at foreign exchange rates prevailing at the dates the fair values were determined.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at historical cost are converted into the functional currency at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the initial recognition of the asset and liability and are not subsequently retranslated.
Exchange gains and losses on the translation and settlement during the period of foreign currency assets and liabilities are recognised in profit or loss.
Exchange differences for non-monetary items are recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income when the changes in the fair value of the non-monetary item are recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income, and in profit or loss if the changes in fair value of the non-monetary item are recognised in profit or loss.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment consists principally of computer equipment, motor vehicles, fixtures and fittings, and is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment losses.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs of bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Depreciation is charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis to write down the cost of the asset to its residual value over its estimated useful life, ranging between 3 and 10 years depending on the length of time the Group expects to derive benefit from the asset.
Management determines useful lives and residual values for assets when they are acquired, based on experience of similar assets and taking into account other relevant factors such as any expected changes in technology.
The Group assesses and adjusts if required the useful life, residual value and depreciation method for property, plant and equipment on an annual basis.
Items of property, plant and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
For assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.
Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, which represents the higher of the assets fair value less costs of disposal and value in use, it is written down immediately to its recoverable amount and an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
Impaired non-financial assets, except goodwill, are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
On fide-recognition of an item of equipment, any gain or loss on disposal, determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, is included in profit or loss in the period of the fide-recognition.
Items of property and equipment that are not owned by the Group, but are held under lease arrangements are accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy on leases.
Financial statements | Appendices Quilter Annual Report 2018 181 Financial statements Appendices continued For the year ended 31 December 2018 Appendix A: Other accounting policies continued Leases Leases where the lessor retains the risks and rewards of ownership of the underlying asset are classified as operating leases.
Where the Group is the lessee, payments made under operating leases net of any incentives received from the lessor are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Share Capital Equity instruments Shares are classified as equity instruments when there is no contractual obligation to deliver cash or other assets to another entity on terms that may be unfavourable.
The value of the Companys share capital consists of the number of Ordinary Shares in issue multiplied by their nominal value.
The difference between the proceeds received on issue of the shares and the nominal value of the shares issued is recorded inshare premium.
Share issue costs Incremental external costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds ofthe issue and disclosed where material.
Dividends Dividends are distributions of profit to holders of the Groups share capital and as a result are recognised as a deduction in equity.
Dividends payable to holders of equity instruments are recognised in the period in which they are authorised or approved.
Interim dividends payable to holders of the Groups Ordinary Share capital are announced with the half year results and authorised by the Directors of the Parent Company.
The final dividend is announced with the Annual Report and Accounts and typically requires shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting.
For this reason it is not included in the annual consolidated financial statements.
Shares held by trusts Shares in the Parent Company that are held by the Employee Benefit Trust EBT are treated as own shares or Treasury shares.
The EBT purchases shares in the Parent Company for delivery to employees under employee incentive plans.
Purchased shares are recognised as adeduction from equity at the price paid for them.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the ordinary shareholders of the Parent Company by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the period, excluding Ordinary Shares purchased by various share trusts of the Group and held as own shares.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by increasing the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding to assume conversion ofall dilutive potential Ordinary Shares, notably those related to employee share schemes.
