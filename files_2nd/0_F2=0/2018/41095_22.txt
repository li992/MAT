ACCOUNTING POLICIES The principal accounting policies, all of which have been applied consistently throughout the year in the preparation of these financial statements, are set out below: a Basis of preparation These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, FRS 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Ireland UK GAAP and the guidelines set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP, updated in January 2017, for Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts issued by the Association of Investment Companies AIC, the historical cost convention, as modified by the valuation of investments and derivatives at fair value and on a going concern basis, as set out on page 31.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a Cash Flow Statement under FRS102, as it is an investment fund and its investments are substantially all highly liquid and carried at fair market value.
The Companys financial statements are presented in sterling, being the functional and presentational currency of the Company.
All values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds 000 except where otherwise indicated.
In addition, investments and derivatives held at fair value are categorised into a fair value hierarchy based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, which are described as follows: Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets.
Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable i. e. developed using market data, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 Inputs are unobservable i. e. for which market data is unavailable.
Presentation of the Income Statement In order to reflect better the activities of an investment trust company and in accordance with the SORP, supplementary information which analyses the Income Statement between items of a revenue and capital nature has been presented alongside the Income Statement.
The net revenue return is the measure the Directors believe appropriate in assessing the Companys compliance with certain requirements set out in Sections 1158 and 1159 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010. b Investments Investments are measured initially, and at subsequent reporting dates, at fair value, and are recognised and fide-recognised at trade date where a purchase or sale is under a contract whose terms require delivery within the time frame established by the market concerned.
For quoted securities fair value is either bid price or last traded price, depending on the convention of the exchange on which the investment is listed.
Unquoted debt investments are fair valued using prices from independent market sources.
Changes in fair value and gains or losses on disposal are included in the Income Statement as a capital item.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued c Derivative financial instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments namely put and call options and equity swaps.
All derivative instruments are valued initially, and at subsequent reporting dates, at fair value in the Statement of Financial Position.
The equity swaps are accounted for as Fixed Assets and Options are accounted for as Current Assets or Current Liabilities.
Options are reviewed on a case-by-case basis and gains and losses are charged to the capital column of the Income Statement, where the option has been entered into to generate or protect capital returns.
All of the put and call options bought and sold during the current and comparative year were capital in nature.
All gains and losses on over-the-counter OTC equity swaps are accounted for as gains or losses on investments.
Where there has been a re-positioning of the swap, gains and losses are accounted for on a realised basis.
All such gains and losses have been debited or credited to the capital column of the Income Statement.
Cash collateral held by counterparties is included within cash, except where there is a right of offset against the overdraft facility.
d Investment income Dividends receivable are recognised on the ex-dividend date.
Where no ex-dividend date is quoted, dividends are recognised when the Companys right to receive payment is established.
Foreign dividends are grossed up at the appropriate rate of withholding tax.
Income from fixed interest securities is recognised on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective interest rate.
Deposit interest is accounted for on an accruals basis.
e Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are charged through the revenue column of the Income Statement except as follows: expenses which are incidental to the acquisition or disposal of an investment are charged to the capital column of the Income Statement: and expenses are charged to the capital column of the Income Statement where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated.
In this respect the portfolio management and AIFM fees have been charged to the Income Statement in line with the Boards expected long-term split of returns, in the form of capital gains and income, from the Companys portfolio.
As a result 5% of the portfolio management and AIFM fees are charged to the revenue column of the Income Statement and 95% are charged to the capital column of the Income Statement.
Any performance fee accrued or paid is charged in full to the capital column of the Income Statement.
f Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Finance costs are charged to the Income Statement in line with the Boards expected long-term split of returns, in the form of capital gains and income, from the Companys portfolio.
As a result 5% of the finance costs are charged to the revenue column of the Income Statement and 95% are charged to the capital column of the Income Statement.
Finance charges are accounted for on an accruals basis in the Income Statement using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.

qxp 03 07 2018 12:28 Page 57 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements g Taxation The tax effect of different items of expenditure is allocated between capital and revenue using the marginal basis.
Deferred taxation is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not been reversed by the Statement of Financial Position date other than those differences regarded as permanent.
This is subject to deferred tax assets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the reversal of timing differences can be deducted.
Any liability to deferred tax is provided for at the rate of tax enacted or substantially enacted.
h Foreign currency Transactions recorded in overseas currencies during the year are translated into sterling at the appropriate daily exchange rates.
Assets and liabilities denominated in overseas currencies at the Statement of Financial Position date are translated into sterling at the exchange rates ruling at that date.
Exchange gains losses on foreign currency balances Any gains or losses on the translation of foreign currency balances, including the foreign currency overdraft, whether realised or unrealised, are taken to the capital or the revenue column of the Income Statement, depending on whether the gain or loss is of a capital or revenue nature.
i Capital reserve The following are transferred to this reserve: gains and losses on the disposal of investments: exchange differences of a capital nature, including the effects of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency borrowings: expenses, together with the related taxation effect, in accordance with the above policies: and changes in the fair value of investments and derivatives.
This reserve can be used to distribute realised capital profits by way of dividend.
Any gains in the fair value of investments that are not readily convertible to cash are treated as unrealised gains in the capital reserve.
j Capital redemption reserve This reserve arose when ordinary shares were redeemed by the Company and subsequently cancelled.
When ordinary shares are redeemed by the Company and subsequently cancelled, an amount equal to the par value of the ordinary share capital is transferred from the ordinary share capital to the capital redemption reserve.
k Revenue reserve The revenue reserve is distributable by way of dividend.
l Dividend payments Dividends paid by the Company on its shares are recognised in the financial statements in the year in which they are paid and are shown in the Statement of Changes in Equity.

OTC equity swaps The Company uses OTC equity swap positions to gain access to the Indian and Chinese markets, because the Company is not locally registered to trade in either market, and to gain exposure to thematic baskets of stocks.

Offsetting disclosure Swap trades and OTC derivatives are traded under ISDA Master Agreements.
The Company currently has such agreements in place with Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan.
These agreements create a right of set-off that becomes enforceable only following a specified event of default, or in other circumstances not expected to arise in the normal course of business.
As the right of set-off is not unconditional, for financial reporting purposes, the Company does not offset derivative assets and derivative liabilities.
