Goodwill and intangible assets Accounting policy Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identiable net assets and contingent liabilities of the acquired subsidiary, associate or joint venture at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in Intangible assets.
Goodwill on acquisitions of associates is included in Investments in associates.
Goodwill included in intangible assets is assessed at each balance sheet date for impairment and carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Detailed calculations are performed based on discounting expected cash ows of the relevant cash generating units CGUs and discounting these at an appropriate discount rate, the determination of which requires the exercise of judgement.
Goodwill is allocated to CGUs for the purpose of impairment testing.
CGUs represent the lowest level within the Group which generate separate cash inows and at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
These are equal to or smaller than the Groups reportable segments as set out in Note 2 as the Group views its reportable segments on a global basis.
The major CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are set out in the CGU table page 298.
Signi cant accounting estimates and judgements The carrying amount of goodwill is based on the application of judgements including the basis of goodwill impairment calculation assumptions.
Judgement is also applied in determination of cash generating units.
Estimates include forecasts used for determining cash ows for CGUs and discount rates which factor in country risk free rates and applicable risk premiums.
The Group undertakes an annual assessment to evaluate whether the carrying value of goodwill on-balance sheet is impaired.
The estimation of future cash ows and the level to which they are discounted is inherently uncertain and requires significant judgement and subject to potential change over time.
Acquired intangibles At the date of acquisition of a subsidiary or associate, intangible assets which are deemed separable and that arise from contractual or other legal rights are capitalised and included within the net identiable assets acquired.
These intangible assets are initially measured at fair value, which reects market expectations of the probability that the future economic benets embodied in the asset will ow to the entity, and are amortised on the basis of their expected useful lives 4 to 16 years.
At each balance sheet date, these assets are assessed for indicators of impairment.
In the event that an assets carrying amount is determined to be greater than its recoverable amount, the asset is written down immediately.
Computer software Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specic software.
Direct costs of the development of separately identiable internally generated software are capitalised where it is probable that future economic benets attributable to the asset will ow from its use internally generated software.
These costs include salaries and wages, materials, service providers and contractors, and directly attributable overheads.
Costs incurred in the ongoing maintenance of software are expensed immediately when incurred.
Internally generated software is amortised over a three to five year time period.

Goodwill and intangible assets continued Goodwill CGU structure When considering the generation of independent cash inows and appropriate level of management, Corporate Finance, Private Banking and Transaction Banking are managed on a global basis, while Retail Banking, Commercial Banking, Central and others including Treasury Market activities are managed on a country basis.
Testing of goodwill for impairment An annual assessment is made as to whether the current carrying value of goodwill is impaired.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated at the date of acquisition to a CGU.
Goodwill is considered to be impaired if the carrying amount of the relevant CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.
Indicators of impairment include changes in the economic performance and outlook of the region including geopolitical changes, changes in market value of regional investments, large credit defaults and strategic decisions to exit certain regions.
The recoverable amounts for all the CGUs were measured based on value-in-use ViU.
The calculation of ViU for each CGU is calculated using five-year cash ow projections and an estimated terminal value based on a perpetuity value after year five.
The cash ow projections are based on forecasts approved by management up to 2023.
The perpetuity terminal value amount is calculated using year five cash ows using long-term GDP growth rates.
All cash ows are discounted using discount rates which reect market rates appropriate to the CGU.
The goodwill allocated to each CGU and key assumptions used in determining the recoverable amounts are set out below and are solely estimates for the purposes of assessing impairment of acquired goodwill.
