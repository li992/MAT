The 500 million Eurobond issued in October 2016 was designated as the hedged item in an effective cash flow value hedging relationship.
The Group used cross-currency interest rate swaps to convert the fixed rate Eurobond to a Sterling fixed rate exposure.
The cross-currency interest rate swaps have the same maturity and common terms as the Eurobond that they are hedging.
The carrying value of the fixed rate Eurobond net of cross-currency interest rate swaps at 30 September 2018 was 445 million.
