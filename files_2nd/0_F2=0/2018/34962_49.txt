The EPRA net assets per share measure highlights the fair value of equity on a long-term basis, and so excludes items which have no impact on the Group in the long term, such as fair value movements of derivative financial instruments and deferred tax on the fair value of investment properties.
The EPRA triple net assets per share measure discloses net assets per share on a true fair value basis: all balance sheet items are included at their fair value in arriving at this measure, including deferred tax, fixed-rate loan liabilities and any other balance sheet items not reported at fair value.

Valuations were based on current prices in an active market for all properties.
Theproperty valuations were carried out by external, professionally qualified valuers as follows: United Kingdom: Cushman and Wakefield Germany: Cushman and Wakefield France: Jones Lang LaSalle Property valuations are complex and require a degree of judgement and are based on data which is not publicly available.
Consistent with EPRA guidance, we have classified the valuations of our property portfolio as level 3 as defined by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
Inputs into the valuations include equivalent yields and rental income and are unobservable under the definition in IFRS 13.
These inputs are analysed by segment in the property portfolio information on the inside front cover.
All other factors remaining constant, an increase in rental income would increase valuations, whilst an increase in the true equivalent yield would result in a fall in value, and vice versa.
KEY INPUTS TO THE VALUATION ERV True equivalent yield Average Range Average Range per sq ft per sq ft % % UK 30.81 8.50-60.00 5.76% 3.3%-10.75% Germany 12.07 8.61-17.14 5.30% 4.63%-6.00% France 23.28 10.50-48.97 5.23% 3.30%-7.75% A decrease in the true equivalent yield by 25 basis points would result in an increase in the fair value of the Groups investment property by 101.1 million, whilst a 25 basis point increase would reduce the fair value by 101.6 million.
Investment properties included leasehold properties with a carrying amount of 73.3 million 2017: 73.1 million.
Interestcapitalised within capital expenditure in the year amounted to nil 2017: 0.5 million.
Where the Group leases out its investment property under operating leases the duration is typically three years or more.
Nocontingent rents have been recognised in either the current or the comparative year.
Around 85% of investment properties and the hotel detailed in note 14 are secured against debt.
