122 SEGRO PLC | ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2018 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018 1.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES General information SEGRO plc the Company is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act.
The address of the registered office is given on the inside back cover.
The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries the Group and the nature of the Groups operations are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 12 to 21.
These Financial Statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates and is the functional currency of the Company.
Basis of preparation The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the EU, IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRS IC interpretations, and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Groups Financial Statements also comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulations.
In addition, the Group has also disclosed additional measures relating to the Best Practice Recommendations Guidelines issued by the European Public Real Estate Association EPRA as appropriate, as discussed further in Note 2.
The Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
This is discussed in the Financial Review on page 33.
The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption offered by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present a separate income statement and statement of comprehensive income for the Company.
The Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of properties and certain financial assets and liabilities including derivatives.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Group financial statements.
New and amended standards adopted by the Group In the current year, the Group has applied a number of amendments to IFRSs and a new Interpretation issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB that are mandatorily effective for an accounting period that begins on or after 1 January 2018.
The following standards and amendments have been adopted by the Group and the Company for the first time for the financial year beginning on 1 January 2018: IFRS 9 Financial instruments IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers Amendments to IAS 40, Investment property relating to transfers of investment property Annual improvements to IFRSs 2014-2016 Cycle IFRIC 22 Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration Amendments to IFRS 2, Share-based payments, on clarifying how to account for certain types of share-based payment transactions The Group and the Company had to update its accounting policies following the adoption of IFRS 9 and 15 but there were no retrospective adjustments following the adoption.
This is disclosed further below.
The other amendments did not have any impact on the amounts recognised in prior period and are not expected to significantly affect the current or future periods.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9 replaces the provision of IAS 39 that relate to the recognition, classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liability, derecognition of financial instruments, impairment of financial assets and hedge accounting.
The adoption of IFRS 9 from 1 January 2018 resulted in no adjustments to the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, comparative figures have not been restated.
a Classification and measurement On 1 January 2018 the date of initial application of IFRS 9, the Groups management has assessed which business models apply to the financial assets held by the Group and has classified its financial instruments into the appropriate IFRS 9 categories.
The Group did not hold assets classified as held to maturity or available for sale under IAS 39 at 1 January 2018 and as a result there was no reclassification of these financial assets on adoption of IFRS 9.
The other financial assets held in the current or previous reporting period have not been reclassified upon adoption of IFRS 9.
See Note 17. b Derivatives and hedging activity The designated foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swap contracts in place as at 31 December 2017 qualified as net investment hedges under IFRS 9.
The Groups risk management strategies and hedge documentation are aligned with the requirement of IFRS 9 and these relationships are therefore treated as continuing hedges.
The Group has not changed the designation of derivative instruments used as part of its risk management strategy as hedging relationships under IFRS 9.
123 OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE 1.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED c Impairment of financial assets The Group's significant financial assets that are subject to IFRS 9s new expected credit loss model are trade receivables from the leasing of investment properties.
Based on the reasons set out in the credit risk management section in Note 17 the credit risk associated with unpaid rent is deemed to be low.
The Group was required to revise its impairment methodology under IFRS 9.
This did not result in a material change in the loss allowance recognised under IFRS 9 compared to the previous impairment provision held under IAS 39.
Note 17 provides further details on the measurement of the loss allowance and amount recognised at 31 December 2018.
While cash and cash equivalents are also subject to the impairment requirements of IFRS 9, the identified impairment loss was immaterial.
The Company holds intercompany loan and receivables balances with the subsidiaries of the Group as disclosed in Note 7.
There is no material impact on the Company only Financial Statements from the recognition of loss allowance for the loans and receivables under IFRS 9 compared to the previous impairment provision held under IAS 39.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers The Group has adopted IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers from 1 January 2018.
IFRS 15 does not apply to rental income which makes up over 80 per cent of total revenue of the Group, but does apply to other non-core revenue streams: service charge income, management and performance fees and proceeds from the sale of trading properties.
IFRS 15 did not have a material impact on the timing of revenue recognition for the non-core income streams.
There were no adjustments to the amounts recognised in the financial statements and no restatement of the comparative for the 2017 financial year.
The wording of the accounting policies for Service charges and other recoveries from tenants and Sale of trading properties have been updated in line with the new IFRS 15 requirements.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted Certain new accounting standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, and have not been applied in preparing these Financial Statements.
The Groups assessment of the impact of these new standards and interpretations is set out below.
Title of standard IFRS 16 Leases Nature of change IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016.
It will result in almost all leases being recognised on the balance sheet for a lessee, as the distinction between operating and finance leases is removed.
Under the new standard, an asset the right to use the leased item and a financial liability to pay rentals are recognised.
The only exceptions are short-term and low-value leases.
The accounting for lessors will not significantly change.
Impact Details of the operating leases held by the Group at 31 December 2018 is shown in Note 24.
Management have performed an assessment of the impact of bringing the existing operating leases held by the Group on balance sheet under IFRS 16.
It is not estimated that IFRS 16 will have a material impact on the gross and net asset position of the Group upon transition and the Income Statement for the year ending 31 December 2019.
Date of adoption by Group Mandatory for financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2019.
The Group intends to apply the simplified transition approach and will not restate comparative amounts for the year prior to first adoption.
Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations subject to EU endorsement and effective for financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2020 provides a revised framework for evaluating a business and introduces and optional concentration test.
The amendment will impact the assessment and judgements used in determining whether future property transactions represent an asset acquisition or business combination.
As a result of the amendment it is expected that future transactions are more likely to be treated as an asset acquisition.
There are no other standards that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group in the current or future reporting periods and on the foreseeable future transactions.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated Financial Statements comprise the Financial Statements of the Company and the Subsidiaries the Group, plus the Groups share of the results and net assets of the joint ventures.
Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights.
The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer.
The Financial Statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated Financial Statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing so causes the noncontrolling interests to have a deficit balance.
124 SEGRO PLC | ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2018 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018 1.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Joint ventures A joint venture is a contract under which the Group and other parties undertake an activity or invest in an entity, under joint control.
The Group uses equity accounting for such entities, carrying its investment at cost plus the movement in the Groups share of net assets after acquisition, less impairment.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Groups interest in the investee.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment on the asset transferred.
The Company holds investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition related costs are recognised in the Income Statement as incurred.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
If, after reassessment, the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
The interest of non-controlling interest shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at their proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
When the consideration transferred by the Group in a business combination includes a contingent consideration arrangement, the contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition-date fair value.
Changes in fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as measurement period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments against goodwill.
Measurement period adjustments are adjustments that arise from additional information obtained during the measurement period which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date.
Contingent consideration that is classified as an asset or a liability is re-measured at subsequent reporting dates in accordance with IFRS 9, as appropriate, with the corresponding gain or loss being recognised in the Income Statement.
Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are translated to the respective functional currency of Group entities at the foreign exchange rate ruling on the transaction date.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from settling these, or from retranslating monetary assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies, are booked in the Income Statement.
The exception is for foreign currency loans and derivatives that hedge investments in foreign subsidiaries, where exchange differences are booked in equity until the investment is realised.
Consolidation of foreign entities Assets and liabilities of foreign entities are translated into sterling at exchange rates ruling at the Balance Sheet date.
Their income, expenses and cash flows are translated at the average rate for the period or at spot rate for significant items.
Resultant exchange differences are booked in other comprehensive income and recognised in the Group Income Statement when the operation is sold.
The principal exchange rates used to translate foreign currency denominated amounts in 2018 are: Balance Sheet: 1 1.11 31 December 2017: 1 1.13.
Investment properties These properties include completed properties that are generating rent or are available for rent, and development properties that are under development or available for development.
Investment properties comprise freehold and leasehold properties and are first measured at cost including transaction costs, then revalued to market value at each reporting date by independent professional valuers.
Valuation gains and losses in a period are taken to the Income Statement.
As the Group uses the fair value model, as per IAS 40 Investment Properties, no depreciation is provided.
An asset will be classified as held for sale within investment properties, in line with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, where there is Board approval at the year-end date and the asset is expected to be disposed of within 12 months of the Balance Sheet date.
Investment properties are transferred to trading properties when there is a change in use and the property ceases to meet the definition of investment property.
125 OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE 1.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Other interests in property Other interests in property include the cost and related fees in respect of land options, which are initially capitalised and regularly tested for impairment.
The impairment review includes consideration of the resale value of the option and likelihood of achieving planning consent.
Other investments Other investments includes an equity investment in an entity whose primary business activity is property investment.
The investments are initially measured at cost, and then revalued to fair value.
Gains and losses arising from valuation are recognised in the Income Statement within realised and unrealised property gain.
Trading properties These are properties being developed for sale or being held for sale after development is complete, and are shown at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes direct expenditure and capitalised interest.
Trading properties are transferred to investment properties when there is a change in use usually evidenced by the commencement of an operating lease to another party, together with the intention to hold the property to generate rent, or for capital appreciation, or for both.
Property acquisitions and disposals Properties are treated as acquired at the point when the Group assumes the control of ownership and as disposed when transferred to the buyer.
Generally this would occur on completion of contract.
Any gains or loss arising on fide-recognition of the property, which is calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset at the commencement of the accounting period plus capital expenditure in the period, is included in profit or loss in the period in which the property is derecognised.
Leases Leases where substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the lessee are classified as finance leases.
All others are deemed operating leases.
Under operating leases, properties leased to tenants are accounted for as investment properties.
In cases where only the buildings part of a property lease qualifies as a finance lease, the land is shown as an investment property.
Revenue Revenue includes gross rental income, joint venture management and performance fee income, income from service charges and proceeds from the sale of trading properties.
Rental income Rental income from properties let as operating leases are recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Lease incentives and initial costs to arrange leases are capitalised, then amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term rent averaging.
Surrender premiums received in the period are included in rental income.
Service charges and other recoveries from tenants These include income in relation to service charges, directly recoverable expenditure and management fees.
Revenue from providing services is recognised in the accounting period in which the services are rendered.
Revenue from services is recognised based on the actual service provided to the end of the reporting period as a proportion of the total services to be provided and recognised over time.
Where the Group acts as an agent, service charge income is netted against the relevant property operating expenses.
Joint venture management and performance fees Joint venture management and performance fees are recognised as income in the period to which they relate.
Management fees are recognised in the accounting period in which the services are rendered.
Performance fees are recognised at the end of the performance period to the extent that it is highly probable there will not be a significant future reversal and the fee can be reliably estimated.
Sale of trading properties Proceeds from the sale of trading properties are recognised at the point in time at which control of the property has been transferred to the purchaser.
Therefore, revenue is recognised at a point in time and generally occurs on completion of the contract.
126 SEGRO PLC | ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2018 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018 1.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Plant and equipment Plant and equipment is stated at historic cost less accumulated depreciation.
Cost includes purchase price and any directly attributable costs.
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets other than investment properties less their residual values, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: Plant and equipment 20% per annum Solar panels 5% per annum The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.
Financial instruments Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption value being recognised in the Income Statement over the period of the borrowings, using the effective interest rate method.
Gross borrowing costs relating to direct expenditure on properties under development or undergoing major refurbishment are capitalised.
The interest capitalised is calculated using the Groups weighted average cost of borrowing for the relevant currency.
Interest is capitalised from the commencement of the development work until the date of practical completion.
The capitalisation of finance costs is suspended if there are prolonged periods when development activity is interrupted.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivatives principally interest rate swaps, currency swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts and interest caps in managing interest rate risk and currency risk, and does not use them for trading.
They are recorded, and subsequently revalued, at fair value, with revaluation gains or losses being immediately taken to the Income Statement fair value through profit or loss FVPL.
The exception is for derivatives qualifying as hedges, when the treatment of the gain loss depends upon the item being hedged, and may go to other comprehensive income within the Statement of Comprehensive Income fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI.
Derivatives with a maturity of less than 12 months or that expect to be settled within 12 months of the Balance Sheet date are presented as current assets or liabilities.
Other derivatives are presented as non-current assets or liabilities.
Trade and other receivables and payables Trade and other receivables are booked at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised costs using the effective interest method.
The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses ECLs which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables.
Note 17 details the Groups calculation for measuring ECLs.
Pensions Defined benefit scheme The Schemes assets are measured at fair value, their obligations are calculated at discounted present value, and any net surplus or deficit is recognised in the Balance Sheet.
Operating and financing costs are charged to the Income Statement, with service costs spread systematically over employees working lives, and financing costs expensed in the period in which they arise.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income within the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Where the actuarial valuation of the scheme demonstrates that the scheme is in surplus, the recognisable asset is limited to that for which the Group can benefit in the future either through a cash refund or reduction in future payments is available.
Professional actuaries are used in relation to defined benefit schemes and the assumptions made are outlined in Note 18.
Share-based payments The cost of granting share options and other share-based remuneration is measured at their fair value at the grant date.
The costs are expensed straight-line over the vesting period in the Income Statement, based on estimates of the shares or options that will eventually vest.
Charges are reversed if it appears that non-market-based performance conditions will not be met.
The fair value excludes the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
At each Balance Sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of nonmarket-based vesting conditions.
The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in the Income Statement such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity within the share based payment reserve.
127 OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE 1.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Share capital Ordinary shares Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
When shares recognised as equity are repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, which includes directly attributable costs, is recognised as a deduction from equity.
Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented in the treasury share reserve.
When treasury shares are sold or reissued subsequently, the amount received is recognised as an increase in equity and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is presented within share premium.
Shares held by Estera Trust Jersey Limited and Equiniti Limited to satisfy various Group share schemes are disclosed as own shares held and deducted from contributed equity.
Income tax Income tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the tax payable on the taxable income for the year and any adjustment in respect of previous years.
Current tax is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period in the countries where the Companys subsidiaries and associates operate and generate taxable income.
Deferred tax is provided in full using the Balance Sheet liability method on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the asset is realised or the liability is settled.
No provision is made for temporary differences i arising on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities, other than a business combination, that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit and ii relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that suitable taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the application of the Groups accounting policies, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revisions and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Significant areas of estimation uncertainty Property valuations Valuation of property is a central component of the business.
In estimating the fair value, the Group engage a third party qualified valuer to perform the valuation.
Information about the valuation techniques and inputs used in determining the fair value of the property portfolio is disclosed in Note 27 property valuation techniques and related quantitative information.
128 SEGRO PLC | ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2018 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018 1.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Significant areas of judgements in applying the Groups accounting policies Accounting for significant property transactions Property transactions are complex in nature.
Management considers each material transaction separately, with an assessment carried out to determine the most appropriate accounting treatment and judgements applied.
The judgements include whether the transaction represents an asset acquisition or business combination and the cut off for property transactions on recognition of property assets and revenue recognition.
In making its judgement over the cut-off for property transactions, management considers whether the control of ownership of the assets acquired or disposed of has transferred to or from the Group this consideration includes the revenue recognition criteria set out in IFRS 15 Revenue for the sale of trading properties.
In making its judgement on whether the acquisition of property through the purchase of a corporate vehicle represents an asset acquisition or business combination, management consider whether the integrated set of assets and activities acquired contain both input and processes along with the ability to create outputs.
REIT Status The Company has elected for UK REIT and French SIIC status.
To continue to benefit from these tax regimes, the Group is required to comply with certain conditions as outlined in Note 10.
Management intends that the Group should continue as a UK REIT and a French SIIC for the foreseeable future.
Other less significant judgements and sources of uncertainty relate to estimating the fair value of financial instruments and the judgement applied in determining the accounting treatment of the pension buy-out costs detailed further in Note 18.
ADJUSTED PROFIT Adjusted profit is a non-GAAP measure and is the Groups measure of underlying profit, which is used by the Board and senior management to measure and monitor the Groups income performance.
It is based on the Best Practices Recommendations Guidelines of European Public Real Estate Association EPRA, which calculate profit excluding investment and development property revaluations and gains or losses on disposals.
Changes in the fair value of financial instruments and associated close-out costs and their related taxation, as well as other permitted one-off items, are also excluded.
Refer to the Supplementary Notes for all EPRA adjustments.
The Directors may also exclude from the EPRA profit measure additional items gains and losses which are considered by them to be nonrecurring, unusual or significant by virtue of size and nature.
In the period to 31 December 2018, 51.8 million of pension buy-out costs incurred in respect of the SEGRO Pension Scheme following the commitment to buy-out the scheme during the period, were excluded from the calculation of Adjusted profit, see Note 18 for further details.
There is no tax effect of this item in the period to 31 December 2018.
No non-EPRA adjustments to underlying profit were made in 2017.

Consequently, the APP share of profit is only included in the table above to 9 March 2017 the date of acquisition and no balance sheet in respect of APP is included at 31 December 2017.
Trading properties held by joint ventures were externally valued resulting in no increase in provision 2017: nil.
Based on the fair value at 31 December 2018, the Groups share of joint ventures trading property portfolio has unrecognised surplus of 0.9 million 2017: nil.
Other comprehensive income at share of nil is included in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income 2017: 3.1 million loss in respect offair value of derivatives in effective hedge relationships.
SELP is a SPPICAV in France, and does not pay tax on its French property income or gains on property sales, provided that at least 85 per cent of the French subsidiaries property income is distributed to their immediate shareholder.
In addition, SELP has to meet certain conditions such as ensuring the property rental business of each French subsidiary represents more than 60 per cent of its assets.
Any potential or proposed changes to the SPPICAV legislation are monitored.
134 SEGRO PLC | ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2018 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018 7.
The external borrowings of the joint ventures are non-recourse to the Group.
At 31 December 2018, the fair value of 1,120.4 million 2017: 926.9 million of borrowings was 1,104.3 million 2017: 938.6 million.
This results in a fair value adjustment increase in EPRA triple net asset value of 16.1 million 2017: 11.7 million decrease, at share 8.0 million 2017: 5.9 million decrease, see Note 12.
SEGRO provides certain services, including venture advisory and asset management to the SELP joint venture and receives fees for doing so.
Performance fees are payable from SELP to SEGRO based on its IRR subject to certain hurdle rates.
The first calculation and payment was on the fifth anniversary of the inception of SELP, being October 2018, but 50 per cent of this is subject to clawback based on performance over the period to the tenth anniversary, October 2023.
If performance has improved at this point, additional fees might be triggered.
The first fee paid by SELP in October 2018 including the amount subject to clawback, was 52.4 million.
Only 26.2 million representing the 50 per cent of the performance fee paid not subject to future claw back has been recognised by SEGRO in the 2018 Income Statement see Note 4.
The 50 per cent subject to clawback has been recognised as a contract liability within Trade and other payables at 31 December 2018 see Note 15.
SELP has recognised a corresponding performance fee expense of 26.2 million at share 13.1 million and deferred expense of 26.2 million at share 13.1 million in other receivables shown in the table above.
The net profit before tax impact on the SEGRO 2018 Group Income Statement of the performance fee is a 13.1 million profit and the net profit after tax impact is a 12.3 million profit.
A double tax treaty between France and Luxembourg has been signed but the ratification process has not yet completed, and is consequently not yet substantially enacted.
The impact of the treaty has therefore not been recognised in the reported SELP results, however had this been the case, the deferred tax liability is estimated to increase by around 54.0 million 27.0 million at share at 31 December 2018.

In measuring expected credit losses ECLs of the intercompany loans under IFRS 9 the ability of each subsidiary to repay the loan at the reporting date if demanded by the Company is assessed.
For the purpose of the impairment review the manner for recovering the loan is assumed to be through the sale of the investment properties held by the subsidiary.
Investment properties are held at fair value at each reporting date and the assumptions and inputs used in determining their fair value are shown in Note 27.
Therefore the net asset value of the subsidiary is considered to be a reasonable approximation of the available assets that could be realised to recover the loan balance and the requirement to recognise expected credit losses.
The adoption of IFRS 9 did not result in a material change in the loss allowance and the impairments recognised for intercompany loans under IFRS 9 compared to that held under IAS 39.

TAX CONTINUED 10 iii REIT and SIIC regimes and other tax judgements SEGRO is a Real Estate Investment Trust REIT and does not pay tax on its UK property income or gains on property sales, provided that at least 90 per cent of the Groups UK property income is distributed as a dividend to shareholders, which becomes taxable in their hands.
In addition, the Group has to meet certain conditions such as ensuring its worldwide property rental business represents more than 75 per cent of total profits and assets.
Any potential or proposed changes to the REIT legislation are monitored and discussed with HMRC.
It is managements intention that the Group will continue as a REIT for the foreseeable future.
SEGRO is also a SIIC in France, and does not pay tax on its French property income or gains on property sales, provided that at least 95 per cent of the French subsidiaries property income is distributed to their immediate shareholder.
In addition, the Group has to meet certain conditions such as ensuring the property rental business of each French subsidiary represents more than 80 per cent of its assets.
Any potential or proposed changes to the SIIC legislation are monitored.
It is managements intention that the Group will continue as a SIIC for the foreseeable future.
The joint venture tax adjustment is required because the profit on ordinary activities before tax includes share of profit from joint ventures after tax, whereas the total tax balance excludes joint ventures.
The Group believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax years based on its assessment of many factors, including interpretations of tax laws and prior experience.
10 iv Deferred tax liabilities Movement in deferred tax was as follows: Balance Exchange Acquisitions Recognised Balance 1January movement disposals inincome 31December Group 2018 m m m m m Valuation surpluses and deficits on properties accelerated tax allowances 33.0 0.4 0.1 8.1 25.2 Deferred tax asset on revenue losses 1.2 0.1 0.1 0.2 1.4 Others 2.8 0.1 0.2 3.1 Total deferred tax liabilities 34.6 0.4 8.1 26.9 Balance Exchange Acquisitions Recognised Balance 1January movement disposals inincome 31December Group 2017 m m m m m Valuation surpluses and deficits on properties accelerated tax allowances 14.3 1.0 1.0 18.7 33.0 Deferred tax asset on revenue losses 0.3 0.9 1.2 Others 2.3 0.2 0.3 2.8 Total deferred tax liabilities 16.3 1.2 1.0 18.1 34.6 The Group has recognised revenue tax losses of 1.4 million 2017: 1.2 million available for offset against future profits.
Further unrecognised tax losses of 790.9 million also exist at 31 December 2018 2017: 813.0 million of which 41.3 million 2017: 48.6 million expires within nine years.
The majority of the unrecognised tax loss balance relates to historic capital losses that arose on property disposals and on losses generated from debt close-out costs.
For the purposes of measuring deferred tax liabilities or deferred tax assets arising from investment properties that are measured using the fair value model, the Directors have reviewed the Groups investment property portfolios and concluded that the Groups investment properties are not held under a business model whose objective is to consume substantially all of the economic benefits embodied in the investment properties over time, rather than through sale.
Therefore, in determining the Groups deferred taxation on investment properties, the Directors have determined that the presumption that the carrying amounts of investment properties measured using the fair value model are recovered entirely through sale is not rebutted.
As a result, the Group has recognised deferred taxes on changes in fair value of investment properties for alljurisdictions, with the exception of the UK and France, where the Group is not subject to any corporate income taxes on the fair value changes of the investment properties on disposal.
10 v Factors that may affect future tax charges No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries and joint ventures.
In the event of their remittance totheUK, no net UK tax is expected to be payable.
The standard rate of UK corporation tax is due to fall to 17 per cent by 2020.
This is unlikely to significantly impact the Groups tax charge.

The carrying values of these financial assets and liabilities approximate their fair value, with the exception of unsecured bond issues and unsecured US Private Placement notes classified as borrowings.
At 31 December 2018, the fair value of 1,389.8 million of unsecured bonds issued was 1,463.0 million 2017: 1,489.0 million compared with 1,680.4 million fair value.
At 31 December 2018, the fair value of 853.5 million of unsecured US Private Placement notes was 797.7 million 2017: 573.9 million compared with 546.0 million fair value.
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows: Forward foreign exchange contracts are measured using quoted exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates with maturities matching the contracts.
Interest rate swaps, currency swap contracts and interest rate caps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates and the appropriate exchange rate at the Balance Sheet date.
The fair value of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities traded on active liquid markets is determined with reference to the quoted market prices.
Financial guarantees are issued by the Company to support bank borrowings of 100 per cent owned subsidiary companies domiciled overseas.
Fair value measurements recognised in the Balance Sheet The Group and Company financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are listed equity investments, forward exchange and currency swap contracts, interest rate swaps and interest rate caps as detailed above.
Investments in equity securities traded in active liquid markets are classified as level 1.
All other financial instruments would be classified as level 2 fair value measurements, as defined by IFRS 13, being those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
There were no transfers between categories in the current or prior year.
149 OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE 17.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUES CONTINUED 17 iii Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern and as such it aims to maintain a prudent mix between debt and equity financing in keeping with our long-term mid-cycle LTV target of 40 per cent.
The current capital structure of the Group consists of a mix of equity and debt.
Equity comprises issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the statement of changes in equity and Notes 19 to 21.
Debt primarily comprises long-term debt issues and drawings against medium-term committed revolving credit facilities from banks as disclosed in Note 16.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
17 iv Foreign currency risk management The Groups transactional foreign exchange exposures mainly arise as a result of treasury financing and hedging activities.
These activities are carried out in SEGRO plc on behalf of the Group and the resulting exposures to euro or US dollar are not routinely hedged.
The Group does not have any regular transactional foreign currency exposures resulting from cross border flows.
The business does however have operations in Continental Europe which transact business denominated mostly in euros, hence there is currency exposure caused by translating the local trading performance and local net assets into sterling for each financial period and at each Balance Sheet date.
The Groups approach to managing Balance Sheet translation exposure is described in the Foreign Currency Translation Risk section in the Financial Review on page 33.
The Groups and Companys Balance Sheet translation exposure including the impact of derivative financial instruments is summarised below: 2018 2017 Euros US Dollars Total Euros US Dollars Total m m m m m m Group Gross currency assets 2,770.2 0.5 2,770.7 2,242.6 35.7 2,278.3 Gross currency liabilities 1,850.6 1,850.6 1,547.2 21.2 1,568.4 Net exposure 919.6 0.5 920.1 695.4 14.5 709.9 Company Gross currency assets 1,197.1 1,197.1 1,182.5 25.9 1,208.4 Gross currency liabilities 1,879.9 1,879.9 1,683.4 47.1 1,730.5 Net exposure 682.8 682.8 500.9 21.2 522.1 2018 Group gross currency liabilities include 758.0 million 682.9 million designated as net investment hedges.
2017 Group gross currency liabilities include 567.2 million 502.0 million and USD 28.6 million 21.3 million designated as net investment hedges.
The remaining gross currency liabilities of the Group shown in the table above that are not designated as net investment hedges are either held directly in a euro or US dollar functional currency entity or passed down to such an entity from a sterling functional currency company through inter-company funding arrangements.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Groups main currency exposure is the euro.
The sensitivity of the net assets of the Group to a 10 per cent change in the value of sterling against the relevant currencies is 83.6 million 2017: 64.5 million, with a sensitivity of 83.6 million against the euro 2017: 63.2 million and nil against the US dollar 2017: 1.3 million.
The 10 per cent sensitivity rate is used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to management and represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis adjusts the translation of net assets after taking account of external loans, currency swap contracts and forward foreign exchange contracts at the period end for a 10 per cent change in the value of sterling against the relevant currencies.
For the Company, the sensitivity of the net assets to a 10 per cent change in the value of sterling against the relevant currencies is 62.1 million 2017: 47.4 million with a sensitivity of 62.1 million against the euro 2017: 45.5 million and nil million against the US dollar 2017: 1.9 million.
150 SEGRO PLC | ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2018 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018 17.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUES CONTINUED Forward foreign exchange and currency swap contracts Some of the forward foreign exchange and currency swap contracts held by the Group are designated as net investment hedges of euro and US dollar denominated subsidiaries, where exchange differences are booked in reserves and recognised in the Income Statement when the operation is sold.
The remaining foreign exchange and currency swap contracts are effectively economic cash flow hedges, for example using surplus cash in one currency to provide typically through intercompany debt funding arrangements with overseas subsidiaries funds to repay debt, or to fund development expenditure or acquisitions in another currency.
These instruments have not been designated as hedges.
As a consequence exchange movements in respect of these instruments are taken through the Income Statement.
Offsetting these movements are 11.7 million exchange gains 2017: 30.0 million gain arising on intercompany debt funding arrangements discussed above resulting in a loss on exchange differences of 0.2 million 2017: 0.1 million gain within net finance costs in Note 9.
The Groups translation exposure risk management policy is that between 29 and 100 per cent of assets denominated in a foreign currency should be hedged by liabilities in the same currency.
During the year the foreign currency denominated liabilities of the Group were predominantly the currency leg of foreign exchange and currency swap contracts both those designated as net investment hedges and those which are effectively cash flow hedges and the application of this policy is the main economic purpose of these instruments.

Forward foreign exchange contracts The Group designated US dollar and euro denominated forward foreign exchange contracts as net investment hedges during 2018, but no contracts were outstanding at the Balance Sheet date.
There was no ineffectiveness to be recorded from net investments in foreign entity hedges in 2018 and 2017 where the hedging instrument was forward foreign exchange contracts.
This is because the critical terms of both the net investment in foreign entity and the hedging instrument match, and at each Balance Sheet date both are revalued to the closing spot rate.
Any forward points in the foreign exchange contract are taken tothe Income Statement.

Although these instruments are expected to have a high degree of effectiveness, some ineffectiveness may arise due to the hedging instrument having periodic interest payments, which net investment does not.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUES CONTINUED 17 v Interest rate risk management The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates.
The risk is managed by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings.
The current Group policy states that 50 to 100 per cent of net borrowings should be at fixed rate provided by long-term debt issues attracting a fixed coupon or from floating rate bank borrowings converted into fixed rate or hedged via interest rate swaps, forwards, caps, collars or floors or options on these products.
Hedging activities require approval and are evaluated and reported on regularly to ensure that the policy is being adhered to.
The Board reviews the policy on interest rate exposure annually with a view to establishing that it is still relevant in the prevailing and forecast economic environment.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative instruments at the Balance Sheet date.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming that the amount of liability outstanding at the Balance Sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
A 1 per cent increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 1 per cent higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit for the year ended 31 December 2018 would decrease increase by 10.7 million 2017: decrease increase by 5.8 million.
This is attributable to the Groups exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings and cash deposits.
Fixed rate debt issues are held at amortised cost and are not re-valued in the Balance Sheet to reflect interest rate movements.
Interest rate swap contracts Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the Group to manage the interest rate risk of the Groups borrowings.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the yield curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.
The following tables detail the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts, based on their contractual maturities, outstanding as at the reporting date: Average contract fixed interest rate Notional principal amount Fair value 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 % % m m m m Receive fixed, pay floating contracts: Group In one year or less 6.41 181.0 9.3 In more than one year but less than two 5.63 6.41 250.0 181.0 3.5 16.6 In more than two years but less than five 2.61 3.52 578.0 828.0 18.8 41.6 In more than five years 2.19 270.3 2.2 Total 1,279.3 1,009.0 33.8 58.2 Company In one year or less 6.41 181.0 9.3 In more than one year but less than two 5.63 6.41 250.0 181.0 3.5 16.6 In more than two years but less than five 2.61 3.52 578.0 828.0 18.8 41.6 In more than five years 2.19 270.3 2.2 Total 1,279.3 1,009.0 33.8 58.2 The above are effective economic hedges although the Group has not elected to adopt hedge accounting for them, hence their change in fair value is taken direct to the Income Statement.
The interest rate swaps settle on either a three-month or six-month basis with the floating rate side based on the EURIBOR or sterling LIBOR rate for the relevant period.
The Group will settle or receive the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis.
153 OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE 17.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUES CONTINUED Interest rate cap contracts Under interest rate caps, the Group agrees to receive floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts, should prevailing market rates rise above a specified strike rate.
Such contracts enable the Group to manage the interest rate risk of the Groups floating rate borrowings.
The fair value of interest rate caps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the yield curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below.
The following tables detail the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate cap contracts, based on their contractual maturities, outstanding as at the reporting date: Average strike price Notional principal amount Fair value 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 % % m m m m Group In one year or less In more than one year but less than two In more than two years but less than five 1.40 1.40 375.2 371.2 1.2 2.5 In more than five years Total 375.2 371.2 1.2 2.5 Company In one year or less In more than one year but less than two In more than two years but less than five 1.40 1.40 375.2 371.2 1.2 2.5 In more than five years Total 375.2 371.2 1.2 2.5 The above are effective economic hedges although the Group has not elected to adopt hedge accounting for them, hence their change in fair value is taken direct to the Income Statement.
The interest rate caps settle on either a three-month or six-month basis based on the EURIBOR or sterling LIBOR rate for the relevant period.
The Group will receive the difference between the floating rate and the specified strike rate.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUES CONTINUED 17 vi Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
Potential customers are evaluated for creditworthiness and where necessary collateral is secured.
There is no concentration of credit risk within the lease portfolio to either business sector or individual company as the Group has a diverse customer base with no one customer accounting for more than 5 per cent of rental income.
Trade receivables were less than 1 per cent of total assets at 31 December 2018 and at 31 December 2017.
The Directors are of the opinion that the credit risk associated with unpaid rent is low.
In excess of 95 per cent of rent due is generally collected within 21 days of the due date.
Ageing of past due trade but not impaired receivables were as follows: 2018 2017 m m 030 days 1.5 2.1 3060 days 0.8 1.0 6090 days 0.5 0.1 90180 days 0.8 1.0 180 days 0.4 0.7 Past due 4.0 4.9 Not due 21.6 21.8 Total trade receivables 25.6 26.7 The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses ECLs which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables IAS 39 was applied at 31 December 2017.
To measure ECLs trade receivables have been grouped by geographic Business Unit to reflect the shared credit risk characteristics.
Expected loss rates are based on the historic credit loss experienced for each Business Unit and adjusted for current and forward information affecting the ability of the individual customers to settle receivables.
The adoption of IFRS 9 did not result in a material change in the loss allowance and impairments recognised under IFRS 9 compared to that held under IAS 39.
Trade receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.
The Group held a loss allowances for trade receivables as at 31 December 2018 of 2.5 million 2017: 3.7 million.
Loss allowances, amounts written off and recoveries of amounts previously written off are accounted in property operating expenses within operating profit, these amounts were not material in 2018 and 2017 see Note 5.
No other financial assets were considered impaired or overdue.
Investment in financial instruments is restricted to banks and short-term liquidity funds with a good credit rating.
Derivative financial instruments are transacted via International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA agreements with counterparties with a good investment grade credit rating.
The Groups exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread among approved counterparties.
17 vii Liquidity risk management Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by requiring that adequate cash and committed bank facilities are available to cover and match all debt maturities, development spend, trade related and corporate cash flows over a rolling 18-month period.
This is achieved by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Liquidity risk management is discussed in more detail in the Financial Review on page 31.

RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEMES Background The Group has one defined benefit pension scheme, the SEGRO Pension Scheme the Scheme, a trust-based scheme.
This arrangement is now closed to new entrants and to future accrual of benefits.
In this arrangement, the assets of the Scheme are invested separately from those of the Group and the Scheme is run by an independent Trustee Board.
The Trustee Board of the pension scheme is required by law to act in the best interests of the fund and its members and also takes into consideration the interests of the employer.
There is a requirement for the Trustee Board to have member representation, with the other Trustees being Company appointed.
The Trustee Board is responsible for the investment policy in respect of the assets of the relevant fund, although the Company must be consulted on this and typically has some input into the investment decisions.
Other than market and demographic risks, which are common to most retirement benefit schemes, there are no specific risks in the Scheme which the Group considers to be significant or unusual.
During 2018, and following approval from the SEGRO plc Board, the Trustees of the Scheme contracted to buy-out the Scheme.
The Trustees decided to insure members benefits with a third party specialist insurance company, and the terms and conditions of the buy-out were agreed on 6 December 2018 subject to true-up following a data verification exercise expected to be completed during 2019.
At this point the final settlement of the Scheme will be triggered, the buy-out complete and the Scheme, ultimately, wound-up.
The transaction, which has been funded from the assets of the Scheme, will fide-risk this scheme and reduce the administrative burden of managing it.
In 2018, pension buy-out costs of 51.8 million 2017: nil have been recognised in the Income Statement in conjunction with this process, as shown in Note 2.
Cash contributions payable to the Scheme are reviewed at least every three years as part of an actuarial valuation.
Following each actuarial valuation the Company agrees a deficit recovery plan with the Trustee Board if necessary.
SEGRO and the Trustee Board are required to agree prudent assumptions for the actuarial valuation, which differs to the corporate bond yield based discount rate and best estimate assumptions required to measure the Schemes obligations under IAS 19 for the purpose of our Company financial statements.
This is the main reason why the IAS 19 position disclosed in recent financial statements, prior to the buy-out process, is a surplus, whereas the Schemes most recent actuarial valuation at 31 March 2016 revealed a deficit of 17.7 million.
Historically, to meet this deficit, SEGRO agreed to pay annual contributions of 7.24 million, payable in monthly instalments over the period up to February 2018 which, together with a prudent allowance for investment returns, was expected to remove the deficit.
As a result, the Company paid contributions of 1.2 million in 2018 2017: 7.9 million.
In 2018, in addition to the pension buy-out costs discussed above, costs of 0.4 million were recognised within administration expenses 2017: 0.5 million.
The Schemes funding position and cash contributions will be reviewed as part of the next actuarial valuation due to take place as at 31 March 2019.
The IAS 19 valuation of the Scheme has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation at 31 March 2016 and updated by the independent actuary to 31 December 2018.
The Schemes insured pensions are valued by an actuary and the asset value is equal to the corresponding benefit obligation.
All other asset fair values were provided by the relevant fund managers.
As, prior to the transaction discussed above, the Scheme mostly invested in pooled funds, the asset fair values reflected the fund managers valuations, rather than quoted prices in active markets.
However, the fund values were all based on the prices of the underlying investments within each fund.
The Schemes assets do not include any financial instruments or property owned by the Group.
By undertaking a buy-out process to fully insure member benefits, the Company has sought to mitigate the requirement to make additional contributions to recover any deficit that arises.

The average duration of the benefit obligations at the end of the reporting period is 18 years 2017: 21 years for the Scheme.
As the Scheme has closed to future benefit accrual, there are no active members within the Scheme.
The liabilities are split 32 per cent 2017: 42 per cent to deferred and 68 per cent 2017: 58 per cent to retired members.
The expected employers contributions to be paid in the year ending 31 December 2019 are nil 2018: 1.2 million.
The Group also has a number of defined contribution schemes for which 1.4 million has been recognised as an expense 2017: 1.6 million.
Sensitivities These sensitivities have been calculated to show the movement in the defined benefit obligation in isolation and assuming no other changes in market conditions at the accounting date.
By undertaking the buy-out process, the value of the assets held by the Scheme will move by the same amount.

19 i Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSBP The DSBP is for Executive Directors and the Leadership team.
A percentage of any payment made under the Bonus Scheme is deferred to shares and held in trust for three years.
The percentage subject to deferral for Executive Directors is 50 per cent of the Bonus payment.
This scheme is detailed in the Remuneration Report on page 95.
If a participant ceases to be employed by the Group, the award will lapse unless the participant is deemed to be a Good Leaver, in which case the award will be released on the vesting date.
19 ii Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP is a discretionary employee share scheme for Executive Directors and senior managers.
Vesting of awards is subject to three or fouryear performance conditions and is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The performance conditions of the LTIP are detailed in the Remuneration Report on pages 96 to 97.
If a participant ceases to be employed by the Group, the award will lapse, unless the participant is deemed to be a Good Leaver, in which case the award will be reduced pro-rata on length of employment in relation to the award date.
From 2017 onwards, a mandatory two-year holding period after vesting was introduced for the Executive Directors.
The calculation of the award was based on a share price of 628.8 pence, the closing midmarket share price on 25 April 2018.
No consideration was paid for the grant of any award.

UK employees, who have been employed by the Group since 1 October of the preceding year, may be awarded shares in relation to the Companys prior year PBT performance.
In 2018, as the PBT performance target was achieved in full participating employees were each awarded shares to the value of 3,000.
If a participant ceases to be employed by the Group within three years from the date of award the shares will be forfeited, unless the employee is deemed to be a Good Leaver, in which case the shares will be transferred out of the trust to the participant.
246,801 of these shares have been held by the SIP Trust on behalf of employees for over three years.
19 iv Global Share Incentive Plan GSIP The GSIP was launched in 2008 as an all-employee share scheme for non-UK based employees.
It is not HMRC approved but the eligibility and performance conditions of the award are designed to replicate the SIP.
Employees are granted awards which are released by the Trustees at the conclusion of a three-year holding period.
If a participant ceases to be employed by the Group during the three-year period then the award will lapse unless the participant is deemed to be a Good Leaver.
Shares in respect of the GSIP are held in the SEGRO plc Employees Benefit Trust.

SHARE CAPITAL AND SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED 19 v Sharesave The Group operates an HMRC approved all-employee savings related share option plan for UK-based employees.
For 2018, a three-year period was offered to employees and if they remain in employment, employees can purchase shares in the Company at a price which is fixed at the start of the saving period.
The price is usually set at a 20 per cent discount to the market price.
If a participant ceases to be employed by the Group, in certain circumstances the participant may be able to exercise their options within a fixed period from the date of leaving.

Level 3 inputs used in valuing the properties are those which are unobservable, as opposed to level 1 inputs from quoted prices and level 2 observable inputs either directly, i. e. as prices, or indirectly, i. e. derived from prices.
Based on different approaches for different properties, the following valuation techniques can be used for the same class of assets: The yield methodology valuation technique is used when valuing the Groups assets which uses market rental values capitalised with a market capitalisation rate.
The resulting valuations are cross-checked against the initial yields and the fair market values per square metre derived from actual market transactions for similar assets.
For properties under construction and the majority of land held for development, properties are valued using a residual method valuation.
Under this methodology, the valuer assesses the investment value using the above mentioned methodology for completed buildings.
Deductions are then made for the total estimated costs to complete, including notional finance costs and developers profit, to take into account the hypothetical purchasers management of the remaining development process and their perception of risk with regard to construction and the property market e. g. as regards potential cost overruns and letting risk.
Land values are cross-checked against the rate per hectare derived from actual market transactions.
Other land is also valued on this comparative basis, the ranges for which are per hectare 0.1 million 2.6 million 2017: 0.1 million 3.6 million for the UK and 0.1 million 4.1 million 2017: 0.1 million 2.6 million for Continental Europe.
An increase decrease to ERV will increase decrease valuations, while an increase decrease to yield will decrease increase valuations.
A sensitivity analysis showing the impact on valuations of changes in yields and ERV on the property portfolio including joint ventures at share is shown below.

The existence of an increase in more than one input would be to magnify the impact on the valuation.
The impact on the valuation will be mitigated by the interrelationship of two inputs in opposite directions, e. g. an increase in rent may be offset by an increase in yield.
The below table includes the Groups wholly-owned and joint venture assets at share in order to include the entire portfolio.
The equivalent analysis for the range of inputs on a wholly-owned basis would not be significantly different.
The Group portfolio by asset type classification has been revised in 2018 compared to that disclosed in Annual Report and Accounts 2017 and shown in the 2017 comparatives.
This classification change is to better highlight SEGRO's differentiated portfolio of big box and urban warehouses.
To provide comparison the second table below shows the 2018 Group portfolio split by asset type as reported in the Annual Report and Accounts 2017 and comparatives.
Combined property portfolio column will not cast down but row does cast across.
