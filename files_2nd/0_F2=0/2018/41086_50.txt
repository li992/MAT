Investment property finance lease commitment details are shown in note 16 h. Level 2 Use of a model with inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable market data.
Level 3 Use of a model with inputs that are not based on observable market data.
As noted in the Significant judgements, key assumptions and estimates section, property valuations are complex and involve data which is not publicly available and involves a degree of judgement.
All the investment properties are classified as Level 3, due to the fact that one or more significant inputs to the valuation are not based on observable market data.
If the degree of subjectivity or nature of the measurement inputs changes then there could be a transfer between Levels 2 and 3 of classification.
No changes requiring a transfer have occurred during the current or previous year.
