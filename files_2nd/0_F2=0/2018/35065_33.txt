The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described on pages 28 to 31 of the Strategic Report.
Further disclosures regarding borrowings are provided in Note 24 to the Group financial statements.
As described in the Viability Statement, the Directors have assessed the prospects and viability of the Company over a three-year period to September 2021.
The Board has performed a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Company, including those risks that would threaten Countrysides business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
Having considered the Groups cash flow forecasts, the Directors are satisfied the Group has sufficient liquidity and covenant headroom to enable the Group to conduct its business and meet its liabilities as they fall due for at least the next 12 months.
Accordingly these financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis.
The Companys ability to continue as a going concern is inextricably linked to the results of the Group as a whole.
As such, the Directors consider the Company to be a going concern and these financial statements are prepared on this basis.

Where appropriate, transactions ofasimilar nature are aggregated unless, in the opinion of the Directors, separate disclosure is necessary to understand the effect of the transactions onthe Group financial statements.
Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty The preparation of the financial statements requires the Directors to make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, expenses and related disclosures.
Critical accounting judgements In the process of applying the Companys accounting policies, which are described above, the Directors have made no individual judgements that have had significant impact upon the financial information, apart from those involving estimations, which are dealt with below.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty The estimates and underlying assumptions are based on historical experience and other relevant factors and are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Thisapproach forms the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Changes in accounting estimates may be necessary if there are changes in the circumstances on which the estimate was based or as a result of new information.
Such changes are recognised in the year in which the estimate is revised.
The key assumptions about the future and key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities are described below.
Impairment of fixed asset investments Determining whether fixed asset investments are impaired requires judgement and estimation.
The Directors periodically review fixed asset investments for possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in managements judgement, that the carrying amount of an asset may notbe recoverable.
Such indicating events would include a significant planned restructuring, a major change in market conditions or technology andexpectations of future operating losses or negative cash flows.
When such impairment reviews are conducted, the Company will perform valuations based on cash flow forecasts, following thesame valuation methodologies and assumptions as set out in the Groups annual goodwill reviews described in Note 11 tothe Group financialstatements.
