Financial statements Notes to the Company financial statements C. 25.
Accounting policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the financial statements of the Company.
Basis of preparation The financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101.
In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU adopted IFRS, but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with the Companies Act 2006.
The Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures: A cash flow statement and related notes.
Comparative period reconciliations for share capital, tangible fixed assets and intangible fixed assets.
Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly-owned subsidiaries.
Disclosures in respect of capital management.
The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs.
Disclosures in respect of the compensation of key management personnel.
As the consolidated financial statements of the Company include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken the exemptions under FRS 101 available in respect of certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair value measurement and the disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial instruments disclosures.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the fair value of financial instruments.
Historical cost is based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.
The principal accounting policies are set out below.
Under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
Investments Investments in subsidiary and associated undertakings are stated at cost less any provision for permanent impairment losses.
Property, plant and equipment, and depreciation Property, plant and equipment assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of assets less their estimated residual value on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Plant and equipment 3 to 25 years Motor vehicles 3 to 4 years No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of actual cost on a FIFO basis and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and labour plus overheads applicable to the stage of manufacture reached.
Research and development Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Expenditure on development activities is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Company intends and has the technical ability and sufficient resources to complete development, future economic benefits are probable and the Company can measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the Companys profit for the year.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as probable that they will be recovered.

Accounting policies continued Employee benefits The Company operated a contributory pension scheme, of the defined benefit type up to 5th April 2007, after which this scheme was closed for future accruals to existing members and was closed to new members.
Since 5th April 2007, the Company has operated a defined contribution scheme.
The scheme is administered by trustees who are independent of the Company finances.
Pension scheme assets in the defined benefit scheme are measured at fair value using market value.
Pension scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on a high-quality corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liability.
The expected return on the schemes assets and the interest on the schemes liabilities arising from the passage of time are included in other finance income.
The pension schemes surplus, to the extent that it is considered recoverable, or deficit is recognised in full and presented on the face of the balance sheet.
Where a guarantee is in place in relation to a pension scheme deficit, liabilities are reported in accordance with IFRIC 14.
To the extent that contributions payable will not be available as a refund after they are paid into the plan, a liability is recognised at the point the obligation arises, which is the point at which the minimum funding guarantee is agreed.
Accruals are made for holiday pay, based on a calculation of the number of days holiday earned during the year, but not yet taken and also for the annual performance bonus.
Derivative financial instruments In accordance with its treasury policy, the Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
The Company uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risk arising from operational and financing activities.
Forward exchange contracts are recognised at fair value, being the estimated amount that the Company would pay or receive to terminate them at the balance sheet date based on prevailing foreign currency rates.
Changes in the fair value of foreign currency derivatives which are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised in Other comprehensive income and in the currency hedging reserve, and subsequently transferred to the carrying amount of the hedged item or the Consolidated income statement.
The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised in the income statement immediately.
Other financial instruments Long term loans to associates and joint ventures are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently held at amortised cost.
Trade and other current receivables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently held at amortised cost less any provision for bad and doubtful debts.
Trade and other current payables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently held at amortised cost.
Warranty on the sale of products The Company provides a warranty from the date of purchase, except for those products that are installed by the Company where the warranty starts from the date of completion of the installation.
This is typically for a 12-month period, although up to three years is given for a small number of products.
A warranty provision is included in the accounts, which is calculated on the basis of historical returns and internal quality reports.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated into Sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on such translation are recognised in the income statement.
Going concern The Companys business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic report, where also given are details of the financial and liquidity positions.
In addition, note 20 in the financial statements includes the Companys objectives and policies for managing its capital, details of its financial instruments and hedging activities and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Company has considerable financial resources at its disposal and the directors have considered the current financial projections.
As a consequence, the directors believe that the Company is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual report and accounts.
