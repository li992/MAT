Other reserves consist of the merger reserve, the capital redemption reserve and own shares held.
The capital redemption reserve was created as a consequence of the share buyback programme during the year ended 30 September 2009.
The merger reserve arose on the reverse acquisition of Thomas Cook Group plc and MyTravel Group plc currently known as MyTravel Group Limited by Thomas Cook AG currently known as Thomas Cook GmbH.
In the case of Thomas Cook Group plc, the merger reserve represents the difference between the existing share capital and share premium of Thomas Cook AG and the share capital of Thomas Cook Group plc issued in exchange, and in the case of MyTravel Group plc, the merger reserve represents the difference between the fair value and the nominal value of the share capital issued by Thomas Cook Group plc.
