The difference between initial cost and the redemption value isamortised through the consolidated income statement over the period of the borrowing using the effective interest method.
Certain borrowings are designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss and measured at fair value where doing soprovides more meaningful information due to the reasons stated in the financial liabilities accounting policy see note E1.
Transaction costs relating to borrowings designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are expensed as incurred.

c. I n July 2012, AXIA Insurance Limited AXIA provided financing to Abbey Life, a Group company, for Abbey Life to in turnprovide the financing for the securitisation of the future surplus arising on a block of 1.7 million life insurance policies originating from the wholly-owned Spanish and Portuguese insurance subsidiaries of Banco Santander, S. A. the Cedants.
This transaction was executed in the form of a reinsurance and retrocession arrangement that, taken as a whole, does not meet the definition of an insurance contract under the Groups accounting policies see note E3.2.
Abbey Life received anupfront reinsurance commission from AXIA and makes monthly repayments based on the surplus emerging from the securitised policies as defined in the contracts.
The repayments comprise a minimum guaranteed surplus amount and ashare of any excess surplus, net of certain other amounts.
Any excess amount serves to accelerate the repayment oftheprincipal.
Repayments are contingent on the receipt of payments due from the Cedants.
Repayment of the loan principal is expected to occur by 2021.
The contracts are recognised in the consolidated financial statements at fair value.
On 31 December 2018, the retrocession contracts were transferred from Abbey Life to Phoenix Life Limited PLL, another Group company, under the terms of a scheme Part VII of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. d.

The earliest repayment date of the notes is 25 March 2021 and thereafter on each fifth anniversary so long as the notes are outstanding.
With effect from 1 January 2009, following a Part VII transfer, these loan notes were transferred into the shareholder fund of PLL.
In the event of the winding-up of PLL, theright of payment under the notes is subordinated tothe rights of the higher-ranking creditors principally policyholders.
As a result of the acquisition of the PhoenixLife businesses in 2009, these subordinated loan notes were acquired at their fair value and as such, the outstanding principal of these subordinated loan notes differs from the carrying value in the statement of consolidated financial position.
The fair value adjustments, which were recognised on acquisition, will unwind over the remaining life of these subordinated loan notes.
With effect from 23 December 2014, minor modifications were made to the terms of the notes to enable them to qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory reporting purposes.
Expenses incurred in effecting these modifications amounted to 10 million.
Given the modifications were notsubstantial, the carrying amount of the liability was adjusted accordingly and the expenses are being amortised over the life of the notes.
