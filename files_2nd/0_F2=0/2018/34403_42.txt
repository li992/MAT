The STraTegic reporT governance Financial STaTemenTS addiTional inFormaTion What estimates and critical judgements have we made in accounting for our BDUK contracts?
The group receives government grants in relation to the BDUK programme and other rural superfast broadband contracts.
Where weve achieved certain service levels, or delivered the network more efficiently than anticipated, weve an obligation to either re-invest or repay grant funding.
Where this is the case, we assess and defer the income with a corresponding increase in capital expenditure.
Assessing the timing of whether and when we change the estimated take-up assumption is judgemental as it involves considering information which is not always observable.
Our consideration on whether and when to change the base case assumption is dependent on our expectation of the long term take-up trend.
Our assessment of how much grant income to defer includes consideration of the difference between the take-up percentage agreed with the local authority and the likelihood of actual take-up.
The value of the government grants deferred is disclosed in note 17.
In the current year we had a net grant funding of 74m 2016 17: 28m net grant deferral mainly related to our activity on the BDUK programme.
Our base case assumption for take-up in BDUK areas has been increased to 41% 2016 17: 39% following our review of the level of customer take-up.
Based on the current build, a change in the take-up assumption of 4% would result in approximately a 50m movement in the amount deferred.
To date we have a grant funding liability of 536m 2016 17: 446m.
13. Business combinations All business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method regardless of whether equity instruments or other assets are acquired.
We didnt make any material acquisitions in the year ended 31 March 2018 2016 17: no material acquisitions.
The acquisition of EE was completed in 2015 16 with the provisional acquisition accounting at 31 March 2016 and the final acquisition accounting was reflected during 2016 17.

These were included in Operating costs in our income statement.
Trade and other receivables Weve made various judgements in accounting for trade and other receivables.
These include long-term contracts and bad debt provisions.
Long-term customer contracts Long-term customer contracts can extend over a number of financial years.
During the contractual period recognition of costs and profits may be impacted by judgements and estimates made.

Estimates are required in assessing the lifetime profitability of a contract when determining whether we have an onerous contract liability.
Where we have an onerous contract liability this would be classified in provisions and include an impairment of any receivables relating to these contracts.
The level of uncertainty in the estimates and assumptions supporting expected future revenues and costs can vary with the complexity of each contract and with the form of service delivery.
We'five exercised judgement in assessing when the transition or transformation phase of a contract ends.
This influences the timing of recognition of revenue and costs which are deferred until the transition or transformation phase ends unless these elements of a contract have standalone value.
How do we estimate and recognise contract losses?
We estimate and recognise immediately the entire estimated loss for a contract when we have evidence that the contract is unprofitable.
Also if these estimates indicate that any contract will be less profitable than previously forecast, contract assets may have to be written down to the extent they are no longer considered to be fully recoverable.
We perform ongoing profitability reviews of our contracts in order to determine whether the latest estimates are appropriate.
Key factors reviewed include: Transaction volumes or other inputs affecting future revenues which can vary depending on customer requirements, plans, market position and other factors such as general economic conditions.
Our ability to achieve key contract milestones connected with the transition, development, transformation and deployment phases for customer contracts.
The status of commercial relations with customers and the implication for future revenue and cost projections.
Our estimates of future staff and third-party costs and the degree to which cost savings and efficiencies are deliverable.

We provide services to consumer and business customers, mainly on credit terms.
We know that certain debts due to us will not be paid through the default of a small number of our customers.
Judgements are required in assessing the recoverability of trade receivables and whether a provision for doubtful debts may be required.
In estimating a provision for doubtful debts we consider historical experience alongside other factors such as the current state of the economy and particular industry issues.
The value of the provision for doubtful debts is disclosed above.
Trade receivables are continuously monitored and allowances applied against trade receivables consist of both specific impairments and collective impairments based on our historical loss experiences for the relevant aged category as well as taking into account general economic conditions.
Historical loss experience allowances are calculated by a customer-facing unit in order to reflect the specific nature of the customers relevant to that customer-facing unit.
Trade and other receivables are classified as loans and receivables and are held at amortised cost.
The carrying amount of these balances approximates to fair value due to the short maturity of amounts receivable.
Note 25 provides further disclosure regarding the credit quality of our gross trade receivables.
Trade receivables are due as follows: Past due and not specifically impaired Trade receivables specifically Between Between Between impaired net 0 and 3 3 and 6 6 and 12 Over 12 Not past due of provision months months months months Total At 31 March m m m m m m m 2018 1,251 61 293 44 25 67 1,741 2017 1,184 146 292 17 41 94 1,774 2016 1,152 98 368 51 44 90 1,803 Gross trade receivables which have been specifically impaired amounted to 124m 2016 17: 238m, 2015 16: 192m.
