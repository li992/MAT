3 Basis of preparation These are the Companys separate accounts and have been prepared on a going concern basis, under the historical cost convention, as modified by the recognition of certain financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value through profit and loss.
The principal accounting policies have been consistently applied unless otherwise stated.
The preparation of accounts under FRS 102 requires the Company to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
There are no areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant that are included in these accounts.
Under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
The Company has taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions available under FRS 102: i. preparation of a cash flow statement ii.

The majority of the scheme members work for RS Components Limited and so it accounts for the UK scheme as a defined benefit scheme in its accounts.
The Company recognises a cost equal to its contributions.

Defined contribution scheme Contributions to the defined contribution scheme are expensed as they fall due.
7 Tangible assets Tangible assets are stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for impairment.

10 Financial instruments Basic financial instruments Basic financial assets, including trade and other receivables and cash and bank balances, are initially recognised at transaction price and then subsequently at amortised cost less any provision for impairment.
Basic financial liabilities, including trade and other payables, bank loans and loans from subsidiaries, are initially recognised at transaction price and then subsequently at amortised cost.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The Company has elected to adopt the recognition and measurement provisions of IAS 39 as adopted by the European Union and the disclosure provisions of FRS 102 in respect of financial instruments.
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risks arising from operational and financing activities.
It principally employs forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge against changes in exchange rates on behalf of its operating subsidiaries and these subsidiaries apply cash flow hedging.
In addition, there are a small number of cross currency interest rate swaps which swap certain US dollar fixed rate loans into sterling at a fixed interest rate.
During the year, the cross currency interest rate swaps which swapped certain US dollar fixed rate loans into sterling and euros at floating rates matured.
In accordance with its treasury policies, the Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
All the Companys derivatives are measured at fair value with changes in the fair values recognised in profit or loss.
In line with the Companys risk management policies, the cross currency interest rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges.
The fair value of the swaps is the market value of the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates.
Changes in the fair values of the swaps and changes in fair value of the related hedged item are recognised directly in profit or loss.

In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contracts as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Guarantees exist in respect of bank facilities available to certain subsidiaries, up to a maximum of 55.7 million 2017: 49.0 million, of which 2.3 million 2017: 0.9 million had been drawn down at the end of the year.
