Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Notes to the Company accounts 1 Accounting policies and basis of preparation Basis of preparation The Company accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with UK Accounting Standards.
As permitted under FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to share-based payments, business combinations, financial instruments, fair values, presentation of a cash flow statement and certain related party transactions.
Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the consolidated financial statements.
The financial statements are presented in sterling, rounded to the nearest thousand.
Going concern basis The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as, after making appropriate enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future at the time of approving the financial statements.
Investments Investments are valued at cost less any provision for impairment.
Long term loan All loans are initially recognised at fair value of consideration transferred.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Dividends In accordance with IAS 10 Events after the Balance Sheet Date, dividends declared after the balance sheet date are not recognised as a liability at that balance sheet date, and are recognised in the financial statements when they have received approval by shareholders.
Share-based payment transactions The Group operates a share option programme which allows employees of the Group to acquire shares in the Company.
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense in the company in which the employees are employed with a corresponding increase in capital contribution.
The Company recognises an increase in the investment held by the Company in the subsidiary in which the employees are employed.
The fair value of the options is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The Stochastic, Black-Scholes and Finnerty valuation models are used to measure the fair value of the options granted, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due to market based conditions not achieving the threshold for vesting.
