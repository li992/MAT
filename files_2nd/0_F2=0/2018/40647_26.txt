Financial risk management objectives The Company follows the Groups policies for managing all its financial risks.
Fair values of derivative instruments All derivatives are recognised at fair value on the balance sheet with valuation changes recognised immediately in the income statement.
Fair value is the amount for which the asset or liability could be exchanged in an arms length transaction at the relevant date.
Where available, fair values are determined using quoted prices in active markets.
To the extent that market prices are not available, fair values are estimated by reference to market-based transactions, or using standard valuation techniques for the applicable instruments and commodities involved.
The Company has an intercompany oil derivative trade with a wholly owned subsidiary to purchase downside oil price protection up to 31 December 2020, for a deferred consideration of $69.1 million.
The Companys derivative carrying and fair values were as follows: 2018 2017 Less than 2018 2018 Less than 2017 2017 1 year 13 years Total 1 year 13 years Total Assets liabilities $m $m $m $m $m $m Intercompany oil derivatives 11.2 0.8 12.0 35.6 13.4 49.0 Total assets Total liabilities 11.2 0.8 12.0 35.6 13.4 49.0 The following provides an analysis of the Companys financial instruments measured at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1: fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 which are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3: fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques which include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
All of the Companys derivatives are Level 2 2017: Level 2.
There were no transfers between fair value levels during the year.
For financial instruments which are recognised on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether transfers have occurred between levels by re-assessing categorisation based on the lowest-level input which is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole at the end of each reporting period.
Income statement summary Derivative fair value movements during the year which have been recognised in the income statement were as follows: 2018 2017 Loss on derivative instruments $m $m Intercompany oil derivatives 1.0 58.3 Cash flow and interest rate risk The interest rate profile of the Companys financial assets and liabilities, excluding trade and other receivables and trade and other payables, at 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017 was as follows: 2018 2018 2017 2017 2018 Fixed rate Floating rate 2018 2017 Fixed rate Floating rate 2017 Cash at bank debt debt Total Cash at bank debt debt Total $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m US$ 5.5 1,450.0 1,490.0 2,934.5 6.2 1,300.0 1,855.0 3,148.8 Euro 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 5.6 1,450.0 1,490.0 2,934.4 6.3 1,300.0 1,855.0 3,148.7 Cash at bank consisted mainly of deposits which earn interest at rates set in advance for periods ranging from overnight to one month by reference to market rates.

New accounting standards IFRS 9 Financial Instruments The implementation of IFRS 9 had two key impacts on the Companys financial statements.
These both related to the treatment of modification or exchange of financial liabilities.
1 The classification and measurement of financial liabilities held with third parties is materially consistent with that required byIAS 39 with the exception of the treatment of modification or exchange of financial liabilities which do not result in fide-recognition.
The Group has identified that retrospective application of IFRS 9 has increased the carrying value of the Reserves Based Lending credit facility by $110.8 million and resulted in the need to record a modification loss due to the refinancing of the facility in November 2017.
Implementation therefore reduced retained earnings on 1 January 2018.
This will lower the finance costs recognised over the remaining life of the facility compared to the treatment under IAS 39.
No other material impact as a result of IFRS 9s classification and measurement requirements has been identified.
2 The classification and measurement of financial liabilities held with Group companies is materially different to that required by IAS 39.
The Company has identified that retrospective application of IFRS 9 has resulted in a higher provision being made in respect of the recoverability of amounts due from subsidiary undertakings.
A summary of the impact of the implementation of IFRS 9 is shown below: Balance sheet Transition adjustment on implementation of IFRS 9 31 December 1 January 2017 2018 1 2 $m $m $m $m Current assets Other current assets 2,136.3 1,800.7 335.6 Non-current liabilities Borrowings 3,349.5 3,460.3 110.8 Net assets 3,693.5 3,247.1 110.8 335.6 Retained earnings 1,306.6 860.2 110.8 335.6 Total equity 3,693.5 3,247.1 110.8 335.6 IFRS 16 Leases The implementation of IFRS 16 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial statements as it does not presently hold any qualifying leases.
