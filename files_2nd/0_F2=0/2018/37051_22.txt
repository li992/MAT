Reclassifications of financial instruments During the year ended 31 March 2009 the group reclassified certain financial instruments out of fair value through profit or loss.
These assets were originally classified as held-for-trading but the group's intentions in regard to these assets changed and the group reclassified 112.3 million and 7.8 million to the loans and receivables and available-for-sale classifications, respectively.
Theamount reclassified reflected the fair value of the financial assets at the date of reclassification.
The group did not undertake any further reclassifications under the amendment to IAS 39 in the current year and in the prior year.
The following table shows carrying values and fair values of the assets reclassified: 2018 2017 At 31 March Carrying Carrying 000 value Fair value value Fair value Trading assets reclassified to loans and receivables 9 220 3 481 9 220 3 481 If the reclassifications had not been made, the groups income before tax in 2018 would have decreased by 0.5 million 2017: decrease of 2.3 million.
In the current year the reclassified assets have contributed a 50 000 loss through the margin line and a gain of 2.6 million through impairments before taxation, due to impairments release.
In the prior year, after reclassification, the assets contributed a 0.1 million loss to through the margin line and a gain of 0.4 million through impairments before taxation.

Fair value hierarchy The following table analyses recurring fair value measurements for financial assets and financial liabilities.
These fair value measurements are categorised into different levels in the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs to the valuation technique used.
The different levels are identified as follows: Level 1 quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
Fair value disclosures on investment properties are included in the investment properties note 32 on page 227.

Fair value hierarchy continued In determining the value of level 3 financial instruments, the following are the principal inputs that can require judgement: Credit spreads Credit spreads reflect the additional yield that a market participant would demand for taking exposure to the credit risk of an instrument.
The credit spread for an instrument forms part of the yield used in a discounted cash flow calculation.
In general, a significant increase in a credit spread in isolation will result in a movement in fair value that is unfavourable for the holder of a financial instrument.
It is an unobservable input into a discounted cash flow valuation.
Discount rates Discount rates including WACC are used to adjust for the time value of money when using a discounted cash flow valuation method.
Where relevant, the discount rate also accounts for illiquidity, market conditions and uncertainty of future cash flows.
Volatilities Volatility is a key input in the valuation of derivative products containing optionality.
Volatility is a measure of the variability or uncertainty in returns for a given derivative underlying.
It represents an estimate of how much a particular underlying instrument, parameter or index will change in value over time.
Volatilities are a key input into the Black-Scholes valuation method.
Cash flows Cash flows relate to the future cash flows which can be expected from the instrument and require judgement.
Cash flows are input into a discounted cash flow valuation.
Price earnings multiple The price-to-earnings ratio is an equity valuation multiple used in the adjustment and underlying market prices.
It is a key driver in the valuation of unlisted investments.
EBITDA Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation.

This assumption also applies to demand deposits, savings accounts without a specific maturity which are included in customer accounts deposits and variable rate instruments.
Fixed rate financial instruments The fair value of fixed rate financial assets and financial liabilities carried at amortised cost are estimated by comparing spreads earned on the transactions with spreads earned on similar new transactions entered into by the group.
The estimated fair value of fixed interest-bearing deposits is based on discounted cash flows, using prevailing money market interest rates for debts with similar credit risk and maturity.
For quoted sub-debt issued, the fair values are calculated based on quoted market prices.
For those notes issued where quoted market prices are not available, a discounted cash flow model is used based on a current interest rate yield curve appropriate for the remaining term to maturity.
Certain financial instruments that would normally be carried at fair value continue to be recognised at transaction price.
This occurs when the fair value would normally be determined using valuation techniques which cannot be relied on due to insufficient external inputs.
This results in gains or losses which have not been recognised on balance sheet.

The assessment of the likelihood of future profits is based on past performance and current projections.
Deferred taxation assets are not recognised in respect of capital losses and excess management expenses as crystallisation of capital gains and the eligibility of potential losses is uncertain.
There are trading losses carried forward of 200.2 million 2017: 216.1 million, capital losses carried forward of 41.9 million 2017: 41.9 million and excess management expenses of 9.5 million 2017: 9.5 million on which deferred tax assets have not been recognised due to uncertainty regarding future profits against which these losses can be utilised.
The Finance Act 2015 reduced the main rate of corporate taxation to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017.
In addition, the bank corporation tax surcharge of 8% effective from 1 January 2016 was enacted in November 2015.
On 16 March 2016, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced a further reduction of the corporation tax rate to 17% effective from 1 April 2020.

Fair value hierarchy - Investment properties For all investment properties that are measured at fair value, the current use of the property is considered the highest and best use.
Properties are valued under the income capitalisation method or discounted cash flow method DCF.
Under the income capitalisation method a propertys fair value is estimated based on the normalised net operating income generated by the property, which is divided by the capitalisation rate.
Under the DCF method, a propertys fair value is estimated using explicit assumptions about the benefits and liabilities of ownership over the assets life including an exit or terminal value.
This involves the projection of a series of cash flows and to this: an appropriate, market-derived discount rate is applied to establish the present value of the income stream.
Valuation techniques used to derive level 3 fair values For all classes of investment property, the significant unobservable inputs listed below are used in the income capitalisation method to determine the fair value measurement at the end of the reporting period.
Significant Relationship between unobservable inputs and fair unobservable inputs value measurement Expected rental value ERV Increases decreases in ERV would increase decrease estimated fair value.
Equivalent yield Increases decreases in the equivalent yield would result in decreases increases in the estimated fair value.

The recoverable amount of goodwill is determined based on expected cash flows within the cash-generating units of the group to which the goodwill is allocated.
Key assumptions within the calculation include discount rates, growth rates in revenue and related expenditure and loan impairment rates.
Discount rates are based on pre-tax rates that reflect current market conditions, adjusted for the specific risks associated with the cash-generating unit.
Growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
Cash flow forecasts are based on the most recent financial budgets for the next financial year and are extrapolated for a period of three to five years, adjusted for expected future events.
The two most significant cash-generating units giving rise to goodwill are Investec Asset Management and Investec Wealth & Investment IWI which now includes the business of Williams fide Bro acquired in 2012 as part of the Evolution Group which was merged with IWI in August 2012.
For Investec Wealth & Investment, goodwill of 236.3 million has been tested for impairment on the basis of the cash flow projections for the next three years discounted at 8.8% 2017: 8.8% which incorporate an expected revenue growth rate of 2% in perpetuity 2017: 2%.
The valuation is based on value in use of the business.
Sensitivity analysis has been carried out and it has been concluded that no reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would cause an impairment to be recognised.
For Investec Asset Management, goodwill of 88.0 million has been tested for impairment on the basis of a valuation of the business based on 3% of funds under management.
The valuation is based on managements assessment of appropriate external benchmarks to estimate the fair value less cost to sell business.
Valuing an asset management business as a percentage of funds under management, taking into account asset mix, is in line with market practice and the percentage used by management reflects external transactions that are comparable to Investec Asset Management.
The valuation would be level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
Movement in goodwill 2018 There were no significant movements in goodwill during the year.
2017 An impairment of 3.1 million was recognised in relation to an historic acquisition in the Specialist Banking businesses, due to a change in the nature of the ongoing business.

The majority of the schemes are defined contribution schemes with the exception of one scheme in the United Kingdom being the Investec Asset Management Pension scheme IAMscheme.
The scheme is a final salary pension plan with assets held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The plan is subject to UK regulations, which require the trustees to agree a funding strategy and contribution schedule for the plan.
The role of the trustees is to ensure that the scheme is administered in accordance with the scheme rules and relevant legislation, and to safeguard the assets in the best interest of all members and beneficiaries.
The trustees are solely responsible for setting investment policy and for agreeing funding requirements with the employer through the triennial valuation process.
The scheme is closed to new members and the accrual of service ceased on 31 March 2002.
Thescheme has been valued at 31 March 2018 by qualified independent actuaries in accordance with IAS 19.
There were no unpaid contributions in relation to the defined contribution scheme outstanding at the year end.
During the year the groups previous other defined benefit scheme, Guinness Mahon Pension Fund GM scheme entered into a buy-out with the assets and liabilities being transferred to the insurer Aviva.
Members now receive their pension from Aviva and Investec has no remaining liability relating to the GM scheme.

Thespecific mortality rates used for 2018 are based on the 2017 Club Vita base tables with allowance for future improvements in line with CMI 2016 core projections and a long-term improvement of 1.25% per annum.
The life expectancies underlying the valuation are as follows: Years Male aged 65 88.7 88.4 Female aged 65 88.9 91.0 Male aged 45 89.5 90.2 Female aged 45 90.7 92.9 Sensitivity analysis of assumptions Historically sensitivities have only been presented for the GM scheme as the equivalent increases decreases in assumptions for the IAM scheme did not have a material impact.
As the GM scheme has been bought out and there is no remaining liability, the sensitivies below are now presented for the IAM scheme.
If the discount rate were 0.25% higher, the scheme liabilities would decrease by approximately 615 000 if all the other assumptions remained unchanged.
If the inflation assumption were 0.25% higher, the scheme liabilities would increase by approximately 324 000.
In this calculation all assumptions related to the inflation assumption have been appropriately adjusted, that is the salary, deferred pension and pension in payment increases.
The other assumptions remain unchanged.
If the pension increases assumptions were 0.25% higher, the scheme liabilities would increase by approximately 305 000 if all the other assumptions remained unchanged.
If life expectancies were to increase by 1 year, the scheme liabilities would increase by approximately 645 000 if all the other assumptions remained unchanged.
The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
The sensitivity analysis has been performed on the basis that the relevant assumption would occur in isolation, holding other assumptions constant.
In presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the same methodology that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the balance sheet.
Risk exposures A description of the risks which the pension schemes expose Investec can be found in the risk management report on page 98.
The group ultimately underwrites the risks relating to its defined benefit plan.
If the contributions currently agreed are insufficient to pay the benefits due, the group will need to make further contributions to the plan.

The group makes awards available to staff members via the underlying share trusts.
The particular instrument used varies from time to time, depending on taxation legislation and factors affecting the group structure.
Nevertheless, whatever the instrument chosen, its underlying value depends solely on the performance of the groups share price.
At present, the practice of the group is to grant all permanent staff members a share allocation, based on their annual package, after completing six months of employment.
In line with the objective of providing a long-term incentive for staff, these share awards vest over periods varying from three to five years.
After the initial allocation referred to above, additional allocations are made to staff members at the discretion of group management and depending on the individual performance and contribution made by the respective staff members.

Financial services compensation scheme The Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS, the UKs statutory fund of last resort, provides compensation to customers of UK authorised financial institutions in the event that an institution which is a participating member of the FSCS is unable, or is likely to be unable, to pay claims against it.
The FSCS raises annual levies from participating members based on their level of participation in the case of deposits, the proportion that their protected deposits represent to total protected deposits as at 31 December of the year preceding the scheme year.
Following the default of a number of deposit takers in 2008, the FSCS has borrowed from HM Treasury to fund the compensation costs for customers of those firms.
Although the majority of this loan is expected to be repaid from funds the FSCS receives from asset sales, surplus cash flow or other recoveries in relation to the assets of the firms that defaulted, any shortfall will be funded by deposittaking participants of the FSCS.
Investec Bank plc is a participating member of the FSCS and the bank has accrued 1.2 million for its share of levies that will be raised by the FSCS.
The accrual is based on estimates for the interest the FSCS will pay on the loan and estimates of the level of the banks market participation in the relevant periods.
Interest will continue to accrue to the FSCS on the HM Treasury loan and will form part of future FSCS levies.
At the date of these financial statements, it is not possible to estimate whether there will ultimately be additional levies on the industry, the level of Investecs market participation or other factors that may affect the amount or timing of amount that may ultimately become payable, nor the effect that such levies may have upon operating results in any particular financial period.
Legal proceedings Investec operates in a legal and regulatory environment that exposes it to litigation risks.
As a result, Investec is involved in disputes and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business.
These claims, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, but Investec does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of the proceedings to which Investec is party to have a significant adverse effect on the financial position of the group.
Specifically, a claim has been made in the Royal Court of Guernsey against ITG Limited, a subsidiary of Investec plc, for breach of equitable duty for skill and care with a related claim for liability for the debts of a client trust.
These claims are currently the subject of appeals before the Judicial committee of the Privy Council.
The outcome of these claims cannot reasonably be estimated at this time but Investec does not expect the ultimate resolution of the proceedings to have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the group.
On Monday, 23 April 2018, the Privy Council rejected all of the client trust claims against ITG in their entirety.

2018 2017 Amounts due from associates 4 634 Interest income from loans to associates 516 632 Fees and commission income from associates The above outstanding balances arose from the ordinary course of business and on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and security, as for comparable transactions with third party counterparties.
Hedges The group uses derivatives for the management of financial risks relating to its asset and liability portfolios, mainly associated with non-trading interest rate risks and exposures to foreign currency risk.
Most non-trading interest rate risk is transferred from the originating business to the Central Treasury in the Specialist Bank.
Once aggregated and netted, Central Treasury, as the sole interface to the wholesale market for cash and derivative transactions, actively manages the liquidity mismatch and non-trading interest rate risk from our asset and liability portfolios.
In this regard, Central Treasury is required to exercise tight control of funding, liquidity, concentration and non-trading interest rate risk within defined parameters.
The accounting treatment of accounting hedges is dependent on the requirement to identify a direct relationship between a hedged item and hedging instrument.
This relationship is established in limited circumstances based on the manner in which the group manages its risk exposure.
Below is a description of each category of accounting hedges achieved by the group.
Fair value hedges Fair value hedges are entered into mainly to hedge the exposure of changes in fair value of fixed-rate financial instruments attributable to interest rates.

Consolidated structured entities Investec plc has no equity interest in the following structured entities which are consolidated.
Typically, a structured entity is an entity in which voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding control.
The judgements to assess whether the group has control over these structures include assessing the purpose and design of the entity, considering whether the group or another involved party with power over the relevant activities is acting as a principal in its own right or as an agent on behalf of others.

Principal subsidiaries and associated companies Investec plc continued The key assumptions for the main types of structured entities which the group consolidates are summarised below: Securitised residential mortgages The group has securitised residential mortgages in order to provide investors with exposure to residential mortgage risk and to raise funding.
These structured entities are consolidated due to the groups holdings of equity notes combined with its control over servicing activities.
The group is not required to fund any losses above those incurred on the notes it has retained: such losses are reflected in any impairment of securitised mortgages as those assets have not been derecognised.
Structured debt and loan portfolios The group has structured debt and loan portfolios for the purpose of issuing asset-backed securities.
These structured entities are consolidated due to the groups retention of equity notes and because it continues to act as the collateral manager.
The group is not required to fund any losses above those incurred on the notes it has retained.
Structured commercial real estate loan assets The group has securitised a number of commercial real estate loan assets.
These structured entities are consolidated as the group has retained all of the notes issued.
The group continues to recognise the commercial real estate loan assets on its balance sheet.
Securitised receivables The group has securitised portfolios of medium-term lease and hire purchase receivables.
These structured entities are consolidated as the group has retained the equity notes and control over servicing activities.
Other structured entities commercial operations The group also consolidates a number of structured entities where control arises from rights attached to lending facilities and similar commercial involvement.
These arise primarily in the areas of aircraft funds, where the group has rights which allow it to maximise the value of the assets held and investments in mining projects due to its exposure to equity like returns and ability to influence the strategic and financial decision-making.
The group is not required to fund any losses above those which could be incurred on debt positions held or swaps which exist with these structured entities.
The risks to which the group is exposed from these structured entities are related to the underlying assetsheld in the structures.
The total assets held in structured entities arising from commercial operations is 77.9 million 2017:130.0 million.
Significant restrictions As is typical for a large group of companies, there are restrictions on the ability of the group to obtain distributions of capital, access the assets or repay the liabilities of members of the group due to the statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements of its subsidiaries.
These are considered below: Regulatory requirements Subsidiary companies are subject to prudential regulation and regulatory capital requirements in the countries in which they are regulated.
These require entities to maintain minimum capital, leverage and exposure ratios restricting the ability of these entities to make distributions of cash or other assets to the parent company.
Regulated subsidiaries of the group are required to maintain liquidity pools to meet PRA and local regulatory requirements.
The main subsidiaries affected are: Investec Bank plc, Investec Bank Channel Islands Limited and Investec Bank Switzerland AG, which must maintain compliance with the regulatory minimum.
Capital management within the group is discussed in the risk management report on page 99.

Principal subsidiaries and associated companies Investec plc continued Statutory requirements The groups subsidiaries are subject to statutory requirements not to make distributions of capital and unrealised profits and generally maintain solvency.
These requirements restrict the ability of subsidiaries to remit dividends, except in the case of a legal capital reduction or liquidation.
Contractual requirements Asset encumbrance - the group uses its financial assets to raise finance in the form of securitisations and through the liquidity schemes of central banks.
Once encumbered, the assets are not available for transfer around the group.
The assets typically affected are disclosed in notes 19 and 57.
Structured associates The group has investments in a number of structured funds specialising in aircraft financing, where the group acts as adviser or fund manager in addition to holding units within the fund.
As a consequence of these roles and funding, the group has significant influence over the fund and therefore the funds are treated as associates.
The group applies the venture capital exemption to these holdings and, as such, the investments in the funds are accounted for at fair value and held within the investment portfolio on the balance sheet.

Unconsolidated structured entities The table below describes the types of structured entities that the group does not consolidate but in which it holds an interest and originally set up.
In making the assessment of whether to consolidate these structured entities, the group has concluded that it does not have control after consideration in line with the accounting policies as set out on pages 180 to 188.

Interests in structured entities which the group has not set up Purchased securitisation positions The group buys and sells interest in structured entities that it has not originated as part of its trading activities, e. g. residential mortgage securities, commercial mortgage securities, loans to corporates and resecuritisations.
In such cases, the group typically has no other involvement with the structured entity other than the securities it holds as part of its trading activities and its maximum exposure to loss is restricted to the carrying value of the asset.
Details of the value of these interests is included in the risk management report on page 81.
