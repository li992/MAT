NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 11.
Intangible Assets continued Impairment Testing Each individual cinema, or collection of cinemas which are strategically or operationally co-dependent, is considered to be one CGU.
However, for the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment, it is acceptable under IAS 36 to group CGUs, in order to reflect the level at which goodwill is monitored by management.
Goodwill recognised on acquisition of Regal was $4,625.8m as outlined within Note 18.
Based on the estimated synergies from the combination we have allocated this goodwill between the US CGU $4,302.8m and UK CGU $323.0m.
This represents the lowest level in which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
The ex-Cine-UK, ex-UGC including Dublin and Picturehouse businesses are now fully integrated, meaning that goodwill is now monitored on a UK-wide level 2018: $712.2m, 2017: $410.9m.
The six sites acquired from Empire Cinemas Limited are considered to have been fully integrated from the date of acquisition as there were no support functions included in either acquisition.
The acquired goodwill in respect of these transactions is therefore included within the UK CGU Group.
The recoverable amounts of US, UK and Cinema City CGU Groups have been determined based on a value in use calculation.
That calculation uses cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five year period.
Cash flows beyond the first five year period have been extrapolated using the below assumptions.
This growth rate does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the market in which the CGU Groups operate.
The US CGU has discounted forecast cash flows using a pre-tax discount rate of 12.43% being a market participants discount rate.
The UK CGU has discounted forecast cash flows using a pre-tax discount rate of 10.02% 2017: 9.9% being a market participants discount rate.
The ROW CGU Groups have discounted forecast cash flows using a pre-tax discount rates relevant to the operating territory of each CGU Group see Note 10, being a market participants discount rate.
This is considered to reflect the risks associated with the relevant cash flows for each CGU Group.
The key assumptions used in the cash flow projections for the purpose of the impairment review are as follows: United States UK & Ireland ROW Year ended Year ended Year ended Year ended Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 % % % % % % 1 1 Discount rate 12.43 10.02 9.90 N A N A EBITDA growth rate from year 5 onward 2.00 2.00 2.00 2.00 2.00 1 Individual discount rates for each operating territory have been used: a summary is disclosed in Note 10.
2019 forecast Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in Note 1, was used as the basis of the future cash flow calculation.
Management have sensitised the key assumptions in the goodwill impairment tests and under both the base case and sensitised cases no impairment exists.
The key assumptions used and sensitised were forecast cash flows and the relevant discount rate, which were selected as they are the key variable elements of the value in use.
A reduction of 10% in the forecast cash flows for each CGU or an increase in the discount rate applied to the cash flows of each CGU of 1 percentage point would not cause the carrying value to exceed its recoverable amount for any CGU.
An increase of 2percentage points would not cause the carrying value of any group of CGUs to exceed its recoverable amount, however in this scenario the carrying value for the Israel CGU would exceed its recoverable amount by $12.2m.
Amortisation Charge The amortisation of intangible assets is recognised in the following line items in the Statement of Profit or Loss: Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2018 2017 $m $m Administrative expenses 30.8 15.4 12.

NCM operates the largest digital in-theatre advertising network in North America.
The Group receives theatre access fees and mandatory distributions of excess cash from NCM.
Pursuant to a common unit adjustment agreement which Regal is party to, from time to time, common units of NCM held by Regal will be adjusted up or down through a formula primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre attendance generated by each joint venture partner.
On March 15, 2018, the Group received an additional 2,828,818 common units of NCM, each of which is convertible into one share of NCMI common stock, as a result of the annual common unit adjusment calculation.
The Group recorded the additional common units received at estimated fair value with a corresponding adjustment to deferred revenue of approximately $16.0m.
The deferred revenue will be recognised on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the ESA, which is approximately 19 years.
On July 5, 2018 the Group acquired 10,738,740 common units of NCM from AMC for $78.4m in cash.
As a result of the acquisition of these shares, the Groups ownership of NCM increased from approximately 19.4% to 26.1%.
Under the terms of the shareholder agreement between the Group and other NCM shareholders, key business decisions in respect of NCM require the unanimous approval of the shareholders.
As a consequence, the Directors of the Group do not have total management control of NCM, therefore the Groups investment is accounted for as a joint venture.

The notes bear interest at 5.0%.
Interest and principal payments are due annually in six equal instalments commencing on the first anniversary of the closing.
NCM recorded a gain of approximately $25.4 million in connection with the sale.
The Groups proportionate share of such gain approximately $1.9 million was excluded from equity earnings in NCM and recorded as a reduction in the Groups investment in AC JV.
The remaining outstanding balance of the note payable from the Group to NCM as of 31 December 2018 was $3.0m.
Since the Group does not have a controlling financial interest in AC JV, its investment in AC JV is accounted for as a joint venture.
