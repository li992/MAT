Financial Statements 188 188 Financial statements Notes to the Company Accounts Notes to the Company Accounts For the year ended 31 December 2018 For the year ended 31 December 2018 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The separate accounts of the parent Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006.
The accounts have been prepared on the going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, except for the recognition of derivative financial instruments and available-for-sale investments detailed below, and in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
The Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under FRS 100 Financial Reporting Standard 100 issued by the Financial Reporting Council.
Accordingly, these financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 101 Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework as issued by the Financial Reporting Council.
The Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under FRS 101 in relation to share-based payments, financial instruments, capital management, presentation of comparative information in respect of certain assets, presentation of a cash flow statement, standards not yet effective, impairment of assets and related party transactions.
Where required, equivalent disclosures are included within the consolidated accounts.
No profit and loss account is presented by the Company as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
The profit and loss attributable to the Company is disclosed in the footnote to the Companys balance sheet.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty The preparation of the Companys accounts in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the accounts and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
No key sources of estimation uncertainty have been identified in the year: however the following item is considered a critical accounting judgement: Pensions defined benefit assets Judgement is required regarding the application of IFRIC 14 and the extent to which the Company can recognise its defined benefit pension asset.
Changes in this judgement could significantly impact the value of the balance recognised.
Based on the terms and conditions of the scheme, and from consultation with independent advisers, the Company determined that an ultimate future economic benefit exists in the form of a refund or a reduction in future contributions.
The surplus has therefore been recognised in full.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment.
Tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Plant and equipment 3 to 5 years The carrying value of fixed assets is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the current carrying value may not be recoverable, and are written down immediately to their recoverable amount.
Repairs and maintenance are charged to the profit and loss account during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments are held at historical cost less any provision for impairment.
National Express Group PLC Annual Report 2018 STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 189 189 1 Accounting policies continued Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, net of issue costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Hedge accounting is adopted where derivatives such as fixed to floating interest rate swaps are held as fair value hedges against fixed interest rate borrowings.
Under fair value hedge accounting, fixed interest rate borrowings are revalued at each Balance Sheet date by the change in fair value attributable to the interest rate being hedged.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made.
Pensions The Company has both the National Express Group Staff Pension Fund a defined benefit scheme and a defined contribution scheme.
For the defined benefit scheme, the Balance Sheet position comprises the net of the present value of the relevant defined benefit obligation at the Balance Sheet date and the fair value of plan assets.
The trustees complete a full actuarial valuation triennially but the obligation is updated annually for financial reporting purposes by independent actuaries, using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the obligation is determined by the estimated future cash outflows discounted using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds which have terms to maturity equivalent to the terms of the related liability.
The current service cost and gains and losses on settlements and curtailments are recognised as operating costs.
Past service gains and losses are also recognised within operating costs and in the period in which the related plan amendment or curtailment occurs.
Net interest is calculated by applying a discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset and is recognised within finance costs.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to the profit and loss reserve in the period in which they arise.
For the defined contribution scheme, the amount charged to the profit and loss is the contributions payable in the year.
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the Balance Sheet.
Share-based payment The Company awards equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees, under which the Company receives services from employees as consideration for equity instruments options of the Group.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense.
The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market service and performance vesting conditions for example, profitability, sales growth targets and remaining an employee of the Company over a specified time period.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest.
The total amount expensed is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied.
At each Balance Sheet date, the Company revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the Income Statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Foreign currencies Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end.
Foreign currency transactions arising during the year are translated into Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of the transaction.
Any exchange differences so arising are dealt with through the profit and loss account.

Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences reverse based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that future taxable profits will be available against which the underlying temporary differences can be deducted.
Their carrying amount is reviewed at each Balance Sheet date on the same basis.
Derivative financial instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as interest rate derivatives, foreign currency forward exchange contracts and cross currency swaps to hedge its risks associated with interest rate fluctuations and foreign currency.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value for the reported Balance Sheet.
Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.
The fair value of the derivatives are calculated by reference to market exchange rates and interest rates at the period end.
The Companys interest rate derivatives are designated as fair value hedges.
The gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
The carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted through the Income Statement for the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, in this case movements in the risk free interest rate.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires, is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Foreign currency derivatives and cross currency swaps are used to hedge the Groups net investment in foreign currency denominated operations.
For the Company, gains and losses are recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
For the Group, to the extent that the derivatives are designated and effective as net investment hedges, they are transferred to equity on consolidation to match against foreign exchange exposure in the related assets and liabilities.
The Group also uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain transactional exposures.
These contracts are not hedge accounted and all gains and losses are taken directly to the Income Statement.

Defined benefit scheme The defined benefit scheme is now closed to all future accrual.
On 11 October 2018, the Trustees of the defined benefit scheme completed a buy-in transaction whereby the assets of the scheme were invested in a bulk annuity policy with the insurer Rothesay Life, under which the benefits payable to defined benefit members became fully insured.
The insurance policy was purchased using the existing assets of the plan.
As the buy-in transaction has resulted in the defined benefit obligations being fully insured, the Company has no obligation to make any further payments into the scheme.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company.
The valuation as at 31 December 2018 is based on the results of the 5 April 2016 actuarial valuation, which has been updated by independent professionally qualified actuaries to take account of the requirements of IAS 19.
