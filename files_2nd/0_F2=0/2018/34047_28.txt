Profit for the year Profit for the year has been arrived at after charging crediting : Exceptional and other items Underlying profit is shown before exceptional and other items on the face of the Income Statement.
Exceptional items are items which are material or non-recurring in nature, and include costs relating to acquisitions which are material to the associated business segment, costs related to strategic disposals including those previously completed and significant restructuring programmes some of which span multiple years.
This is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and reported to the Board and the Executive Committee, and assists in providing a meaningful analysis of the trading results of the Group.
Other items includes amortisation of acquired intangibles accounted for under IFRS 3.
The directors consider that this gives a useful indication of underlying performance and better visibility of Key Performance Indicators.
Exclusion of amortisation of acquired intangibles accounted for under IFRS 3 from the Groups underlying results assists with the comparability of the Groups underlying profitability with peer companies.
All Alternative Performance Measures are reconciled to IFRS measures and explained on pages 190 194.

EU State Aid The Group is monitoring developments in relation to the EU State Aid investigation including the European Commissions announcement on 26 October 2017 that it will conduct a State Aid investigation into the UKs Controlled Foreign Company CFC regime.
In common with many other UK based multinational groups whose arrangements are in line with current UK CFC legislation, the Group may be affected by the final outcome of this investigation.
We have calculated our maximum potential liability to be approximately $110 million.
We do not consider that any provision is required based on our current assessment of the issue.
United States tax reform On 22 December 2017, the United States enacted tax reform that implemented substantial changes to the federal tax system by reducing the headline federal tax rate from 35% to 21% and limiting interest deductions to a maximum of 30% of US EBITDA.
The reduction in the headline rate of tax resulted in a revaluation of US deferred tax balances in 2017 amounting to a credit of $59.3 million.
Additionally, the Grouphas re-measured a deferred tax asset relating to financing costs from prior years amounting to a charge of $54.5 million together witha2017 charge of $22.3 million.
Finally, the tax reform introduced a tax on repatriation of profits of overseas subsidiaries resulting inacharge of $3million.
The net impact of this tax reform in 2017 $20.5m charge was reflected in the continuing exceptional and other items tax result soastoreflect the underlying effective tax rate on a consistent basis to other periods.

116 Notes to the Consolidated The Group has determined the recoverable amount of each CGU from value-in-use calculations.
The value-in-use calculations are based Financial Statements on cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent budgets and detailed financial projections for the next five years, as approved by 171 Company Balance Sheet management, with a terminal growth rate after five years.
The resultant cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate appropriate 172 Company Statement for the relevant CGU.
ofChanges in Equity Key assumptions 173 Accounting Policies The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are as follows.
oftheCompany Sales volumes, selling prices and cost increases over the five years covered by managements detailed plans 175 Notes to the Company Financial Statements Sales volumes are based on industry forecasts and management estimates for the businesses in which each CGU operates, including forecasts for Business & General Aviation B&GA flying hours, aircraft engine cycles and military spending.
Selling prices and cost increases 182 Subsidiaries and Related Undertakings are based on past experience and management expectations of future changes in the market.
The extent to which these assumptions affect each principal CGU with a significant level of goodwill are described below.
189 Five Year Summary Signature 190 Alternative Performance Measures Signature operates in the B&GA market.
Signature Flight Support is the worlds largest and market-leading Fixed Base Operation FBO network for business aviation providing full services support for B&GA travel, focused on passenger handling and customer amenities such 195 Shareholder Information as refuelling, hangar and office rentals, and other technical services.
In B&GA, growth is measured principally in relation to B&GA flying hours.
Over the longer term, the key drivers for B&GA remain intact continued growth in GDP and total wealth, the increasing value of peoples time, corporate confidence and corporate activity levels all point to improving sentiment.
The political environment in the USA could also be positive in the short and medium term, with commentators speculating that the current US tax policy could be marginally beneficial to jet purchases.
Ontic Ontic operates in the military and commercial sectors and is the leading provider of high-quality, cost-effective solutions in the continuing support of maturing aerospace platforms to the major aerospace OEMs and airframe operators.
Trends in military aviation are likely to improve as the global defence market recovers after years of pressure due to budget retrenchment.
The perceived and continuing threat environment and regional tensions are expected to be the biggest driver of spending.
US defence spending represents approximately 35% of global spending, and approximately 3.1% c$686 billion of the countrys national GDP.
The US militaries fleet also accounts for 30% of the global military aviation fleet c15,700, a large proportion of the military installed base.
Driven by the National Defence Strategy, the new administrations focus remains on strengthening and sustaining its domestic militaries through delivering consistent multi-year investment plans.
To ensure capacity levels remain, the US Department of Defence arefocusing aproportion of the spend directly to service life extension programs and modernisation efforts, realising that fleet readiness and the use oflegacy aircraft remain an important factor in maintaining its global military strength and competitiveness.
Life extension programmes continue to be important as the US military aircraft ages.
Military legacy aircraft life extensions of between seven and ten years on platforms such as the C-130, AV-8B, F-15, CH-53 and AH-64 and delays on new aircraft, such as the F-35 and A400M, are key drivers for our Ontic business.
The current US Air Force fleet is more than 25 years old on average, with some platforms significantly older.
Average age is expected to continue to rise despite the large defence budget increases.

Intangible assets continued Growth rates used for the periods beyond those covered by managements detailed plans Growth rates are derived from managements estimates, which take into account the long-term nature of the industry in which each CGU operates, external industry forecasts of long-term growth in the aerospace and defence sectors, the maturity of the platforms supplied bythe CGU and the technological content of the CGUs products.
Signature For the purpose of impairment testing, a conservative approach has been used and where the derived rate is higher than the long-term GDP growth rates for the countries in which the CGU operates, the latter has been used.
As a result, an estimated long-term growth rate of 1.9% 2017: 2.0% has been used for Signature which reflects forecast long-term US GDP growth.
Ontic For the purpose of impairment testing in Ontic and in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets an approach required by the accounting standard has been applied which assumes no licence acquisitions or other acquisition of businesses.
As a result, no long-term growth rate has been applied for Ontic.
Discount rates applied to future cash flows The Groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital WACC has been used as the foundation for determining the discount rates to be applied.
The WACC has then been adjusted to reflect risks specific to the CGU not already reflected in the future cash flows for that CGU.
Signature The discount rate used for the impairment review of Signature was 9.0% 2017: 7.5%.
Ontic The discount rate used for the impairment review of Ontic was 11.5% to 11.7% 2017: 9.9% to 10.0%.
Sensitivity analysis In relation to Signature and Ontic, management has concluded that for these CGUs no reasonably foreseeable change in the key assumptions used in the impairment model would result in a significant impairment charge being recorded in the financial statements.

The new RCF includes the ability to extend the duration for an additional year at the first anniversary of the RCF and again at the second anniversary.
These two extension options are at the lenders option.
As part of this refinancing exercise, BBA U. S. Holdings Inc. has been added as an additional borrower and guarantor under the RCF and Facility C of the acquisition bank term loan due to expire in September 2020.
As at 31 December 2018, $122 million 2017: $115 million in the name of BBA Aviation plc was drawn under the RCF in the name of BBA U. S. Holdings Inc. and the term debt drawn under Facility C remains in the name of BBA Aviation plc.
In addition, BBA U. S. Holdings Inc. has been added as an additional guarantor under the US private placement senior notes.
As at 31 December 2018, the Group had $380 million 2017: $500 million of US private placement senior notes outstanding with $280 million 2017: $400 million accounted for at fair value through profit and loss as the fair value interest rate risk has been hedged from fixed to floating rates.
The remainder is accounted for at amortised cost.
As at 31 December 2018, the Group also had $500 million 2017: $nil of US senior notes outstanding with $250 million accounted for at fair value through profit and loss as the fair value interest rate risk has been hedged from fixed to floating rates.

These notes were issued by BBA U. S. Holdings Inc.
The Group excludes the fair value movement on its loan notes from its definition of net debt refer to Alternative Performance Measures on pages 190 194, as this movement is offset by the change in fair value of the underlying interest rate swaps.
The fair value gain on its USprivate placement senior notes at 31 December 2018 was $2.1 million 2017: $3.5 million loss.
The fair value loss on its US senior notes at31 December 2018 was $4.0 million.

These companies are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Group and premiums paid are held to meet future claims.
The cash balances held by these companies are reported on the balance sheet within cash and cash equivalents.
As is usual practice for captive insurance companies, some of this cash is used as collateral against contingent liabilities standby letters of credit that have been provided to certain external insurance companies.
The table below details the contractual amount of the cash balances that have been pledged as collateral for these contingent liabilities, allofwhich are current: 2018 2017 US dollar Sterling Total US dollar Sterling Total $m $m $m $m $m $m BBA Aviation Insurances Limited 0.7 0.7 1.4 0.7 0.8 1.5 BBA Aviation Insurances Vermont Inc 7.4 7.4 9.3 9.3 Total 8.1 0.7 8.8 10.0 0.8 10.8 BBA Aviation Annual Report 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements 141 17.
Financial instruments continued The standby letters of credit have been issued via bank facilities and the amount of these facilities corresponds to the amounts pledged as detailed in the table above.
The amounts pledged are usually for less than one year, and are secured by a legal charge to the bank providing the letters of credit over the cash balances of these companies corresponding to the amount of the standby letters of credit.
Financial risk factors Our activities expose us to a variety of financial risks: market risk including currency risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Overall our risk management policies and procedures focus on the uncertainty of financial markets and seek to manage and minimise potential financial risks through the use of derivative financial instruments.
The Group does not undertake speculative transactions for whichthere is no underlying financial exposure.
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the Board of Directors of BBA Aviation plc.
Thisdepartment identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with Group subsidiary companies.
The treasury policies cover specific areas such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and the investment of excess liquidity.
These policies are outlined on page 40.. Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt to equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent comprising capital, reserves and retained earnings.
The Groups policy is to borrow centrally to meet anticipated funding requirements.
These borrowings, together with cash generated from the operations, are on-lent or contributed as equity to subsidiaries at market-based interest rates and on commercial terms and conditions.
The Group is subject to two financial covenant requirements within its borrowing facilities: maximum net debt to underlying EBITDA of 3.5 times and minimum net interest cover of 3.0 times based on EBITDA.
The Group complied with these covenants during the year.
Following the refinancing of the RCF in March 2018, the group retained the use of an acquisition spike which allows for the net debt to EBITDA covenant to be 4.0 times for two test periods following the activation of the acquisition spike.
The Facility C term debt does not permit a further acquisition spike as this was utilised at the time of the Landmark Aviation acquisition in 2016.
The US private placement senior notes also permit the use of an acquisition spike.
The US senior notes do not include any financial covenants.
Market risk Market risk is the risk of adverse financial impact due to changes in fair values or future cash flows of financial instruments from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group has well defined policies for the management of these risks which includes the use of derivative financial instruments.
i Foreign exchange risk a Foreign exchange transaction risk The Group manages its transactional foreign currency risk by hedging significant currency exposures in accordance with foreign exchange policies that our subsidiaries have in place which have been pre-agreed between Group Treasury and the subsidiary.
Each foreign exchange policy is individually tailored to the foreign exchange exposures within the relevant subsidiary.
Transaction currency risk is managed using spot and forward foreign exchange contracts.
All committed exposures are fully hedged 100% and where significant foreign currency exposures exist then generally a percentage of the projected foreign currency flows are covered depending on the certainty of these cashflows.
The transaction foreign exchange risk is measured by each subsidiary submitting regular reports to Group Treasury which detail the foreign currency exposure reported on the balance sheet as committed exposures and, for those subsidiaries with significant foreign exchange transaction exposures, an additional report detailing the future projected foreign currency cash flows over the life of the policy.
The predetermined policy margin is shown against the projected exposures to determine whether there is a net exposure which needs to be hedged.
If this is the case, then foreign exchange spot or forward contract s will be undertaken by Group Treasury on behalf of the relevant subsidiary with the Groups relationship banks.
For the hedges of highly probable forecast sales and purchases, as the critical terms of the foreign exchange contracts and their corresponding hedged items are the same, the Group performs a qualitative assessment of effectiveness and it is expected that the value of the foreign exchange forward contracts and the value of the corresponding hedged items will systematically change in the opposite direction in response to movements in the underlying exchange rates.
The main sources of ineffectiveness in these hedging relationships is the impact on the fair value of the foreign exchange contracts from a change in timing of the receipt of the hedged items compared to the timing of the hedging instruments, changes in the notional amount of the hedged items compared to the notional amount of the hedging instruments, a change in the credit risk of the relevant subsidiary entering into the foreign exchange contracts and changes in fair value of the hedged item and the hedging instrument attributable to changes in the interest differential within the forward foreign exchange rate.

A gain of $1.0 million 2017: gain of $2.2 million has been transferred to the Income Statement.
Foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as cash flow hedges are used to hedge foreign currency flows through the BBA Aviation plc company bank accounts and to ensure that the Group is not exposed to foreign exchange risk through the management ofitsinternational cash pooling structure.
Changes in the fair value of foreign exchange contracts which have not been designated as cash flow hedges amounting to $2.3 million 2017: $11.1 million have been transferred to administrative expenses in the Income Statement in the year.
The net impact on the Groups result for the period is immaterial, since the balances which these contracts relate to have had a similar but opposite effect on administrative expenses.
b Foreign exchange translation risk The Group has significant overseas businesses whose revenues, cash flows, assets and liabilities are mainly denominated in the currency inwhich the operations are located.
The Groups policy in relation to foreign exchange translation risk is not to hedge the Income Statement since such hedges only have a temporary effect.
In relation to the balance sheet, the Group seeks to denominate the currency of its borrowings in US dollars in order to match the currency of its cash flows, earnings and assets which are principally denominated in US dollars.
The Group does not undertake derivative transactions to hedge foreign exchange translation exposures.
The US dollar borrowings in the parent company, BBA Aviation plc, are designated as net investment hedges, as the parent companys functional currency is GBP.
The Group does not undertake derivative transactions to hedge the foreign currency translation exposures.
The Group analyses the US dollar net assets by subsidiary and the foreign currency borrowings in the name of BBA Aviation plc are allocated against certain tranches of net assets for a specific subsidiary.
Therefore, the critical terms of the US dollar borrowings and theircorresponding hedged items are the same.
The Group performs a qualitative assessment of effectiveness and it is expected that the value of the US dollar borrowings in GBP and the value of the corresponding hedged items in GBP will systematically change in opposite direction in response to movements in the underlying exchange rates.
The main source of ineffectiveness in these hedging relationships is the impact of a decline in the carrying value of the hedged item compared to the US dollar borrowings with the result that the value of the hedged item is less than the value of hedging instrument.
Foreign currency revaluation on the US dollar borrowings in the name of BBA Aviation plc are recorded in other comprehensive income and deferred in the foreign currency translation reserve on the balance sheet as long as the hedge is effective.
Any ineffectiveness is recognised in the Income Statement for that year.
During 2018, the Group added BBA U. S. Holdings Inc as an additional borrower and guarantor under the Groups bank facilities.
As at 31December 2018, $122 million 2017: $115 million in the name of BBA Aviation plc was drawn under the Groups $650 million revolving credit facility in the name of BBA U. S. Holdings Inc and the acquisition term debt under Facility C remains in the name of BBA Aviation plc.
Inaddition, BBA U. S. Holdings Inc was added as an additional guarantor under the US private placement senior notes.
During 2018, BBA U. S. Holdings issued $500m 5.375% US senior notes due 2026.

The net carrying value as at 2018 was $494.2 million 2017: $nil.
182 Subsidiaries and Related ii Interest rate risk Undertakings The Groups borrowings are funded through a combination of bank debt and capital markets borrowings.
The Groups bank debt is funded 189 Five Year Summary through floating rate debt which exposes the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The Groups capital markets borrowings are financed through US private placement fixed rate debt and US senior notes which exposes the Group to changes in the fair value of the fixed rate debt 190 Alternative Performance due to changes in interest rates.
The Groups policy in relation to interest rate risk specifies the portion of its debt obligations, which should Measures be fixed through the use of fixed rate debt and or interest rate swaps, in order to protect the interest cover covenant.
195 Shareholder Information As the critical terms of the interest rate swap contracts and their corresponding hedged items are the same, the Group performs a qualitative assessment of effectiveness and it is expected that the value of the interest rate swap contracts and the value of the corresponding hedged items will systematically change in the opposite direction in response to movements in the underlying rates.
Themain source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedge relationships is the effect of the counterparty and the Groups own credit risk on the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts, which is not reflected in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the change ininterest rates.

The following analysis is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the derivative portfolio and the proportion of derivatives hedging foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk are all constant and on the basis of hedge designations in place at 31 December 2018 and 2017 respectively.
As a consequence, this sensitivity analysis relates to the position at these dates and is not representative of the year thenended.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: fair value interest rate swaps are assumed to be fully effective and therefore there is no impact on the Income Statement or balance sheet from changes in interest rates: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges or net investment hedges are assumed to be recorded fully within other comprehensive income: the sensitivity of accrued interest to movements in interest rates is calculated on net floating rate exposures on debt, cash and derivative instruments: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments not in hedging relationships only affect the Income Statement: all other changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges are fully effective with no impact ontheIncome Statement: the floating rate leg of any swap or any floating rate debt is treated as not having any interest rate already set, therefore a change intheinterest rate affects a full 12-month period for the accrued interest portion of the sensitivity calculations: the sensitivity of foreign exchange rates only looks at the outstanding foreign exchange forward book and the currency bank account balances of the Company only as at the balance sheet date and assumes this is the position for a full 12-month period: the sensitivity of a 10% movement in foreign exchange rates has been used due to the fact that historically rates can move byapproximately 10% per annum: and the sensitivity of a 1% movement in interest rates has been used due to the fact that historically floating US dollar interest rates have moved by on average 1% per annum.

Provisions continued Insurance provisions relate to the Groups captive insurance companies.
The Groups captive insurance companies retain a portion of the exposure they insure on behalf of the remainder of the Group.
Currently the Group retains all or a portion of the risk in relation to its Aviation, Workers Compensation, Automobile and Property damage insurances.
Significant delays occur in the notification and or settlement of claims and judgements involved in assessing outstanding liabilities, the ultimate cost and timing of which cannot be known with certainty at the balance sheet date.
The insurance provisions are based on information currently available, however, it is inherent in the nature of the business that ultimate liabilities may vary.
Provisions for outstanding claims are estimated to cover the outstanding expected liability as well as claims incurred but not yet reported.
The liabilities have an expected life of up to ten years 2017: ten years.
Provisions in respect of discontinued operations represent a provision for environmental and other liabilities relating to businesses that have been disposed of by the Group in prior years.
The provision of $12.4 million 2017: $12.0 million is partially offset by expected recoveries from third parties of $5.7 million 2017: $5.7 million, which are included within trade and other receivables dueafter one year of $5.0 million, 2017: $5.0 million and trade and other receivables due within one year of $0.7million 2017:$0.7million in note 12.
Theliabilities have an expected life of up to 50 years 2017: 50 years.
Also in relation to discontinued operations that have been disposed of by the Group there are open matters with regard to warranties and indemnities for which we have no specific provision as we do not consider we have a present obligation or material exposure in respect of such matters.
Environmental provisions relate to environmental liabilities within continuing operations of the Group.
The liabilities have an expected life ofup to ten years 2017: ten years.
Warranty provisions relate to warranties issued in the Ontic division.
Other provisions relate to other trading matters from the acquisition of Landmark Aviation in the prior year, and acquisitions including EPIC and Firstmark in the current year.
The trading matters included onerous leases, liabilities for indirect taxes and property dilapidation provisions.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits The Group has adopted IAS 19 Employee Benefits for the year ended 31 December 2018.
The Group operates a number of plans worldwide, of both the funded defined benefit type and the defined contribution type.
The normal pension cost for the Group was $10.1 million 2017: $9.7 million of which $7.9 million 2017: $6.2million was in respect of schemes outside ofthe United Kingdom.
This includes $9.9 million 2017 $8.9 million relating to defined contribution schemes.
The pension costs and defined benefit obligation are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries.
The Groups main UK pension commitments are contained within a final salary defined benefit scheme, the BBA Income and Protection Plan IPP, with assets held in a separate trustee administered fund.
Contributions to the IPP are made and the pension cost is assessed using the projected unit method.
As required by UK pension law, there is a Trustee that, together with the Group, is responsible for governance of the IPP.
During 2008, the Trustee of the UK IPP purchased from Legal & General Group plc an annuity to match the liabilities associated with pensioner members.
Since the initial buy-in, further tranches of annuities have been purchased periodically in respect of new pensioner liabilities, although there have been no new bulk tranches purchased during 2018.
The annuity is an investment of the IPP, and all pension liabilities and responsibility for future pension payments remain with the IPP.
The income from the annuity matches the payments to be made to thepensioner members it covers and removes mortality risk in relation to those members which are the subject of the annuity purchase.
The Company closed the IPP to future accrual with effect from 31 May 2016 after consultation with members.
The US Minimum Funding actuarial valuation for the BBA retirement plan as at 1 January 2018 indicated a funding deficit of $4.9 million 2017: $3.2 million.
As required by US law, BBA will make contribution payments that are in excess of the minimum required contribution amounts.
The next actuarial valuation is due as at 1 January 2019.
The actuarial valuation of the UK IPP as at 31 March 2015 indicated a funding deficit of 44.5 million $66 million at rate as at 31 March 2015.
As agreed with the Trustee of the IPP, BBA will make deficit contribution payments to the IPP of 0.3 million per annum until 2020 in addition to the Asset-Backed Funding payments set out below to meet the costs of running the IPP.
The actuarial valuation due as at 31 March 2018 is currently in progress.

Pensions and other post-retirement benefits continued 103 Consolidated Income During the first half of 2014, the Group agreed a new long-term funding package with the Trustee of the IPP, following the sale of APPH Statement Limited.
As part of this funding package, an Asset-Backed Funding ABF structure was put in place, which entitles the Trustee to receive 104 Consolidated Statement payments of 2.7 million each year until 2034.
In addition, the Group made an additional payment of 4.2 million by 31 January 2015. ofComprehensive Income The ABF structure consists of a Scottish Limited Partnership SLP, formed between two newly incorporated subsidiaries of the Group 105 Consolidated Balance Sheet and the Trustee of the IPP.
The SLP has a long-term inter-company loan receivable due from Ontic Engineering & Manufacturing UK Limited Ontic UK, on which annual interest payments of 2.7 million are due over the term of the loan.
The SLP will make quarterly profit 106 Consolidated Cash Flow distributions of the interest payments received from Ontic UK to the IPP, totalling 2.7 million per annum.
The Trustee of the IPP acquired Statement itsinterest in the SLP via an in-specie contribution from BBA.
107 Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity The ABF structure has been established so that the three newly created entities are consolidated into the Groups financial statements.
Inaddition, the interest in the SLP held by the IPP is not treated as an asset under IAS 19, and therefore is not included as part of the Groups 108 Accounting Policies oftheGroup pensions disclosures under IAS 19.
Instead, the payments due to the IPP are treated as a series of payments which the Group has committed to make.
116 Notes to the Consolidated The split of the defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2018 is approximately 35% in respect of deferred members and 65% in respect Financial Statements ofpensioner members.
The weighted average duration of the IPPs liabilities is approximately 15 years.

The following weighted average financial assumptions 182 Subsidiaries and Related havebeen adopted: Undertakings United Kingdom North America 189 Five Year Summary 2018 2017 2018 2017 190 Alternative Performance Per annum % Measures Discount rate 2.75 2.35 4.16 3.50 195 Shareholder Information Price inflation 3.15 3.10 2.30 2.30 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 3.05 3.00 2.30 2.30 IAS 19 requires that the discount rate used to discount the liability be determined by reference to market yields at the reporting date on high-quality corporate bond investments.
The currency and terms of these should be consistent with the currency and estimated term of the post-employment obligations.
The discount rate for the UK Plans has been derived using a yield curve approach.
The yield curve is based onthe yield available on Sterling AA rated corporate bonds of a term similar to the liabilities.
The RPI assumption for the IPP allows for the shape of the inflation spot curve and the duration of the IPP liabilities.
A deduction of 30 basis points has been made to the breakeven inflation assumption to allow for an inflation risk premium.
For the IPP, the mortality assumptions are based on the outcome of a recent mortality investigation undertaken for the 2018 actuarial valuation, and a best estimate view of future mortality improvements.
The life expectancy assumptions applying to the IPP as at 31December 2018 are as follows: 2018 2017 Male Female Male Female Life expectancy for a current 65-year-old years 22.0 24.0 22.0 24.1 Life expectancy for a 65-year-old in 15 years years 22.3 25.2 23.2 25.7 For the US post-retirement medical plan, the immediate trend rate for medical benefits was 8.0% which is assumed to reduce by 0.5% per annum to 4.5% in 2026 onwards.

Under the Rules of the IPP, a minimum funding liability does not need to be recognised as at 31 December 2018, as the Company can offset a surplus against future contributions to the defined contribution section.
The funding policy for the UK Plans and the majority of the North American schemes is reviewed on a systematic basis in consultation with the independent scheme actuary in order to ensure that the funding contributions from sponsoring employers are appropriate to meet the liabilities of the schemes over the long term.
Included within other receivables in the balance sheet are $2.4 million 2017: $2.6 million of listed investments which are held in trust for the benefit of members of the deferred compensation plan in North America.
These amounts are not included within the assets shown in the table above as they are not controlled by the plan in question.
The High Court ruled on 26 October 2018 in the landmark Lloyds Banking Group case on Guaranteed Minimum Pensions GMPs.
The judgment requires equalisation between men and women for the effect of unequal GMPs accrued between 1990 and 1997 i. e. for defined benefit pension schemes that were contracted out between May 1990 and April 1997 and describes the applicable ways in which the benefit entitlements should be equalised.
The ruling means the IPP recognised a $11.1 million increase to the defined benefit obligation DBO as a past service cost and this has been recognised within exceptional and other items.

The value of these annuities has been calculated as being equivalent to the value of the pensioner liabilities which they match, using the same actuarial assumptions used to calculate the corresponding element of the DBO.
The purpose of the annuity is to help reduce asset liability mismatch risk.
The remainder of the assets of the IPP are invested in a range of funds with different risk and return profiles, with equities being the next largest asset class held after the insurance contract.
The objective of the remainder of the portfolio is to generate excess returns, in order to partially fund the IPP through asset performance.
To the extent that actual investment returns achieved are lower than those assumed, then this may result in a worsening of the funding position and higher future cash contributions required for the Group.
This is particularly the case in respect of the proportion of the assets held within equity instruments.
The assets of the US Plans are invested in a range of funds with different risks and return profiles.
The risks inherent in the investment strategy for these Plans is similar to the risks posed by the investment strategy for the IPP, albeit they are smaller in magnitude given the size of the US Plans relative to the IPP.

The analysis also makes no allowance for the impact of changes in gilt and corporate bond yields on asset values.
The methodology applied is consistent to that used to determine the defined benefit obligation.

Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: 2018 2017 $m $m Deferred tax liabilities 162.8 137.8 Deferred tax assets 0.1 162.8 137.7 BBA Aviation Annual Report 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements 157 20.
Deferred tax continued At the balance sheet date, the Group has gross temporary differences and tax losses of $1.2billion 2017: $1.6 billion available for offset against future profits for which deferred tax has not been recognised.
These assets have not been recognised as the precise incidence of future profits in the relevant countries and legal entities cannot be accurately predicted at this time.
There are no unrecognised gross temporary differences relating to losses that will expire by 2023.
Other losses may be carried forward indefinitely under current tax legislation.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities could arise but have not been recognised is $40.8 million 2017: $40.6 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and itisprobable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures are insignificant.
US tax reforms On 22 December 2017, the United States enacted tax reform that implemented substantial changes to the federal tax system reducing the headline federal tax rate from 35% to 21% and limiting interest deductions to a maximum of 30% of US EBITDA.
The impact of the tax reform meant a re-measurement of a deferred tax asset related to financing costs from prior years amounting to a charge of $54.5 million reflected in continuing operations in 2017, whilst additionally the reduction in the headline rate of tax resulted in a revaluation of US deferred tax attributes amounting to a credit of $58.1 million.
The net impact of this tax reform in 2017 $3.6 million credit was reflected in the exceptional and other items tax result continuing $4.8million credit and discontinued $1.2 million charge.
