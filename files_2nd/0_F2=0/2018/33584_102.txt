Kleinkopje and Landau operate under an integrated management structure, forming Khwezela Colliery.
1 Estimated Mineral Resources are presented on an exclusive basis, i. e. Mineral Resources are reported as additional to Ore Reserves unless otherwise stated.
Please refer to the detailed Mineral Resource estimates tables in the AA plc R&R Report forthe detailed Measured, Indicated and Inferred Resource estimates.
The Mineral Resource estimates are reported in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves The JORC Code, 2012 as a minimum standard.
TheMineral Resource estimates for operations in South Africa are reported in accordance with The South African Code for the Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves The SAMREC Code, 2016.
The figures reported represent 100% of the Mineral Resources.
AngloAmerican plc ownership is stated separately.
Rounding of figures may cause computational discrepancies.
2 Total Inferred is the sum of Inferred in LOM Plan, the Inferred Resources within the scheduled Life of Mine Plan LOM Plan and Inferred ex.
LOM Plan, the portion of Inferred Resources with reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction not considered in the Life of Mine Plan LOM Plan as relevant.
Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to some Inferred Resources, it cannot be assumed that all or part of an Inferred Resource will necessarily be upgraded to an Indicated or Measured Resource after continued exploration.
3 DBCi fide Beers Canada, DBCM fide Beers Consolidated Mines, Debswana Debswana Diamond Company, Namdeb Namdeb Holdings.
Estimated Diamond Resources are presented on an exclusive basis, i. e. Diamond Resources are quoted as additional to Diamond Reserves.
Reported Diamond Resources are based on a Bottom Cut-off BCO which refers to the bottom screen size aperture and varies between 1.00mm and 3.00mm nominal square mesh.
Specific BCOs applied to derive estimates are included in the detailed Diamond Resource tables in the AA plc R&R Report.
4 Details of the individual AngloAmerican Platinum Limited managed and Non-Managed operations appear in the AA plc R&RReport.
Ownership percentage for Non-Managed is weighted by Contained Metal 4E Moz contributions from each operation.
Merensky Reef, UG2 Reef and Main Sulphide Zone Mineral Resources are estimated over a Resource Cut which takes cognisance of the mining method, potential economic viability and geotechnical aspects in the hangingwall or footwall of the reef.
5 Iron Ore Brazil Mineral Resource tonnes and grade are reported on a dry basis.
6 Coal Resources are quoted on a Mineable Tonnes In Situ MTIS basis in million tonnes, which are in addition to those Coal Resources that have been modified toproduce the reported Coal Reserves.
Coal Resources are reported on an in situ moisture basis.
The coal quality for Coal Resources is quoted on an in situ heat content askilocalories per kilogram kcal kg, representing Calorific Value CV on a Gross As Received GAR basis.
CV is rounded to the nearest 10 kcal kg 7 Manganese Mineral Resources are quoted on an inclusive basis and must not be added to the Ore Reserves.
8 GEMCO ROM Mineral Resource tonnes are stated as in situ, manganese grades are given as per washed ore samples and should be read together with their respective mass yields, ROM: 48%.
