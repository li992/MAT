b Adjusting items included in net finance costs Adjusting items are significant items in net finance costs which individually or, if of a similar type, in aggregate, are relevant to an understanding of the Groups underlying financial performance.
In 2018, the Group incurred interest on adjusting tax payables of 41 million 2017: 43 million: 2016: 25 million.
This included interest of 25 million 2017: 25 million: 2016: 25 million in relation to the Franked Investment Income Group Litigation Order FII GLO note 6 b and interest of 12 million in relation to retrospective guidance by a tax authority on overseas withholding tax.
Also in 2018, the Group recognised a monetary gain of 45 million related to the application of hyperinflationary accounting in Venezuela note3 h. In 2017, the Group incurred pre-financing costs related to the acquisition of RAI of 153 million.
Also in 2017, the Group realised a 9 million charge in relation to the reversal of a gain recognised in 2016, related to hedge ineffectiveness on external swaps following the referendum regarding Brexit.
The gain in 2016 of 18 million was deemed to be adjusting as it is not representative of the underlying performance of the business and so the partial reversal has also been deemed as an adjusting item.
In 2016, the Group redeemed a US$700 million bond, prior to its original maturity date of 15 November 2018.
This led to a loss of US$130 million 101 million, which has been treated as an adjusting item.
