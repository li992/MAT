11.16 Pensions 11.16.1 Defined benefit schemes: summary and description The Company operates two defined benefit retirement schemes together the Schemes providing benefits based on a benefit formula that depends on factors including the employees age and number of years of service.
The Morrison Scheme provides pension benefits based on either the employees compensation package or career average revalued earnings CARE the CARE Scheme.
The CARE Scheme is no longer open to new members and was closed to future accrual in July 2015.
The RSP is a cash balance scheme, which provides a lump sum benefit based upon a defined proportion of an employees annual earnings, which is revalued each year in line with inflation subject to a cap.
The position of each scheme at the balance sheet date is as follows: 2018 2017 m m CARE Scheme 230 120 RSP 18 21 Net pension asset 212 99 2018 2018 2017 2017 CARE RSP CARE RSP Balance sheet: m m m m Fair value of scheme assets 1,249 315 1,222 219 Present value of obligations 1,019 333 1,102 240 Net pension asset liability 230 18 120 21 2018 2018 2017 2017 CARE RSP CARE RSP Statement of comprehensive income m m m m Current service cost recognised in cost of sales 60 42 Current service cost recognised in administrative expenses 31 29 Administrative costs paid by Schemes recognised in administrative expenses 1 1 2 1 Settlement and curtailment gain 9 Net interest on net pension asset finance income 3 2 2 Total expense charged to income statement 11 92 70 Statement of other comprehensive income: Remeasurements in other comprehensive income credit charge 99 28 57 15 116 Strategic report Governance Financial Statements Investor information 11 Company financial statements continued 11.16 Pensions continued 11.16.1 Defined benefit schemes: summary and description continued The Schemes are registered schemes under the provisions of Schedule 36 of the Finance Act 2004 and the assets are held in legally separate, trustee-administered funds.
The Board of each Scheme is required by law to act in the best interests of the Scheme participants within the context of administering the Scheme in accordance with the purpose for which the trust was created, and is responsible for setting the investment, funding and governance policies of the fund.
A representative of the Group attends Trustee Investment Committee meetings in order to provide the Groups view on investment strategy, but the ultimate power lies with the Trustees.
The Deed and Rules of the Morrison Scheme gives the Trustees the power to set contributions, while in the RSP this power is given to the Group, subject to regulatory override.
Settlement and curtailment gains in the 53 weeks ended 4 February 2018 include 8m relating to the settlement of retirement benefits resulting from actions taken to further fide-risk the Companys pension schemes.
11.16.2 Scheme assets Assets of the Schemes generate returns and ultimately cash that is used to satisfy the Schemes obligations.
They are not necessarily intended to be realised in the short term.
The Trustees of each Scheme invest in different categories of asset and with different allocations amongst those categories, according to the investment principles of that Scheme.
Currently, the investment strategy of the CARE Scheme is to maintain a balance of growth assets equities and diversified growth funds, income assets comprising credit investments, corporate bonds and absolute return bonds and protection assets comprising a liability driven instruments LDI portfolio, with a weighting towards protection assets.
There are no direct investments in the Groups own shares or property occupied by any member of the Group.

In January 2013, the Company made a contribution to the CARE Scheme of 30m.
On the same day, the CARE Scheme invested 30m in the Wm Morrison Property Partnership SLP as a limited partner.
The SLP holds properties which have been leased back to the Company in return for rental income payments.
The Group retains control over these properties, including the flexibility to substitute alternative properties.
As a partner in the SLP, the CARE Scheme is entitled to receive a fixed distribution of 2.2m p. a. from the profits of the SLP for 20 years from 2013, subject to certain conditions.
In July 2015, the SLP was amended to enhance the security provided to the Schemes by including additional properties.
The terms of these additional properties are such that the CARE Scheme has no entitlement to receive a distribution.
The CARE Schemes interests in the SLP increases the net pension asset on an IAS 19 accounting basis because the investments held by the CARE Scheme qualify as an asset for Company IAS 19 purposes.
11.16.3 Present value of obligations The movement in the defined benefit obligation over the period was as follows: 2018 2018 2017 2017 CARE RSP CARE RSP m m m m Defined benefit obligation at start of period 1,102 240 986 130 Current service cost 91 71 Interest expense 31 7 36 5 Actuarial gain demographic assumptions 36 Actuarial gain loss financial assumptions 42 4 232 40 Actuarial loss gain experience 1 82 5 Settlement and curtailment gain 46 Employee contributions 3 3 Benefits paid 26 5 34 4 Defined benefit obligation at end of period 1,019 333 1,102 240 The durations of the defined benefit obligations at the end of the 2018 reporting period are: RSP 20 years: CARE 26 years.
The weighted average duration of the Schemes is 25 years.
11.16.4 Significant actuarial assumptions The following are the principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting date expressed as weighted averages : 2018 2018 2017 2017 Financial assumptions CARE RSP CARE RSP Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities % p. a.

The Company believes that this revised approach better reflects expected yields on high quality corporate bonds over the duration of the Companys pension schemes, as required by IAS 19.
The previous methodology estimated the discount rate with reference to both corporate bond and gilt yields.
The new method uses high quality corporate bond yields where available.
At very long durations, where there are no high quality corporate bonds, the yield curve is extrapolated based on available corporate bond yields of mid to long duration.
This change reduced the value placed on the IAS 19 pensions liabilities of the Company by 81m and improved the pre-tax balance sheet position by 81m.

Following analysis completed as part of the 2016 actuarial valuation, the 2017 year end mortality tables used have been updated to the S2PMA S2PFA-Heavy tables males females based on year of birth with a scaling factor of 110% applied to the mortality rates in the CARE Scheme, with CMI 2015 projections and a long-term rate of improvement of 1.5% p. a.

In practice any movement in assumptions could be accompanied by a partially offsetting change in asset values, and the corresponding overall impact on the net asset liability is therefore likely to be lower than the amounts below in a number of scenarios.
Extrapolation of the sensitivities shown may not be appropriate.

The Company along with other subsidiaries of the Group participate in the RSP.
There is no contractual agreement or stated policy for charging the net defined benefit cost between the Company and its subsidiaries.
The contribution of each participating subsidiary to the RSP is currently calculated in proportion to the number of employees that are members of the RSP.
The latest full actuarial valuations were carried out as at 5 April 2016 for the Morrison Scheme and the RSP.
The valuations indicated that, on the agreed funding basis, the Morrison and RSP Schemes had surpluses of 1m and 10m respectively.
As a result of these funding positions there are currently no deficit contributions payable.
As such there is no minimum funding requirement in force.
The results of the 2016 actuarial valuations for the CARE Scheme has been used and updated for IAS 19 Employee benefits purposes for the period to 4 February 2018 by a qualified independent actuary.
For the RSP an actuarial valuation for the purposes of IAS 19, based on member data as at 31 December 2017, has been completed and updated to 4 February 2018 by a qualified independent actuary.
The Schemes expose the Company to inflation risk, interest rate risk and market investment risk.
In addition, the CARE Scheme exposes the Company to longevity risk.
At 4 February 2018, schemes in surplus have been disclosed within the assets on the balance sheet.
The Company has taken legal advice with regard to the recognition of a pension surplus and also recognition of a minimum funding requirement under IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirement and their interaction.
This advice concluded that recognition of a surplus is appropriate on the basis that the Company has an unconditional right to a refund of a surplus.
In respect of the RSP, this is on the basis that paragraph 11 a of IFRIC 14 applies enabling a refund of surplus during the life of the RSP.
In respect of the Morrison Scheme, it is on the basis that paragraph 11 b or 11 c of IFRIC 14 applies enabling a refund of surplus assuming the gradual settlement of the scheme liabilities over time until all members have left the scheme or the full settlement of the Schemes liabilities in a single event i. e. as a scheme wind up.
Amendments to the current version of IFRIC 14 are currently being considered.
The legal advice received by the Company has considered the proposed new wording to paragraph 12 A of IFRIC 14 concerning whether other parties have a unilateral power to use a schemes surplus to settle in full the schemes liabilities and has concluded that the above accounting treatment should not be affected by the current exposure draft, including the planned revised wording, to IFRIC 14.
The current best estimate of Company contributions to be paid to the defined benefit schemes for the accounting period commencing 4 February 2018 is 67m 2017: 68m.
This estimate includes amounts payable from the SLP and salary sacrificed contributions from employees.
