Gain at fair value through the income statement, includes 18.3m gain on foreign exchange translation offset by 17.9m loss on 400m bond hedge ineffectiveness.
On 22 November 2017 the Group issued a new 400m bond at a coupon of 0.95% under its EMTN Programme.
Part of the proceeds were swapped into USD for floating interest rate in the first year.
The swaps did not qualify for hedge accounting in its first year therefore the movement was reported to the P&L giving rise to a loss of 17.9m.
The loss from the hedge was offset by 18.3m gain on retranslation of intercompany loans.
