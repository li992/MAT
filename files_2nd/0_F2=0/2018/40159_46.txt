Derivative financial instruments Accounting policy Accounting for derivatives: Derivatives are financial instruments that derive their value in response to changes in interest rates, financial instrument prices, commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, credit risk and indices.
Derivatives are categorised as trading unless they are designated as hedging instruments.
Derivatives are initially recognised and subsequently measured at fair value, with revaluation gains recognised in profit or loss except where cash ow or net investment hedging has been achieved, in which case the effective portion of changes in fair value is recognised within other comprehensive income.
Fair values may be obtained from quoted market prices in active markets, recent market transactions, and valuation techniques, including discounted cash ow models and option pricing models, as appropriate.
Where the initially recognised fair value of a derivative contract is based on a valuation model that uses inputs which are not observable in the market, it follows the same initial recognition accounting policy as for other financial assets and liabilities.
All derivatives are carried as assets when fair value is positive and as liabilities when fair value is negative.
The tables below analyse the notional principal amounts and the positive and negative fair values of derivative financial instruments.
Notional principal amounts are the amounts of principal underlying the contract at the reporting date.
In line with industry practice, these are now reported on a single leg basis.
Prior year comparatives have been re-presented accordingly The Group limits exposure to credit losses in the event of default by entering into master netting agreements with certain market counterparties.
As required by IAS 32, exposures are only presented net in these accounts where they are subject to legal right of offset and intended to be settled net in the ordinary course of business.
The Derivatives and Hedging sections of the Risk review and Capital review page 169 explain the Groups risk management of derivative contracts and application of hedging.

Derivative financial instruments continued Derivatives held for hedging Hedge accounting: The method of recognising the resulting fair value gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
The Group designates certain derivatives as either: a Hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or rm commitments fair value hedge b Hedges of highly probable future cash ows attributable to a recognised asset or liability, or a forecasted transaction cash ow hedge c Hedges of the net investment of a foreign operation net investment hedges Hedge accounting is used for derivatives designated in this way, provided certain criteria are met.
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash ows of hedged items.
Expected effectiveness should be close to 100 per cent and actual results of the hedge using regression analysis, are expected to be within a range of 80-125 per cent.
The Group may enter into economic hedges that do not qualify for IAS 39 hedge accounting treatment.
Where these economic hedges use derivatives to offset risk, the derivatives are fair valued, with fair value changes recognised in profit or loss.
Fair value hedge: Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedging instruments are recorded in the income statement, within trading income, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the effective interest method is used is amortised to the income statement over the period to maturity or derecognition.
The Groups approach to managing market risk, including interest rate and currency risk is discussed in Market risk page 181.

Derivative financial instruments continued Fair value hedges The Group uses interest rate swaps to exchange xed rates for oating rates on funding to match oating rates received on assets, or exchange xed rates on assets to match oating rates paid on funding.
These include xed rate issued notes, loans and advances to customer and debt securities and other eligible bills.
For qualifying hedges, the fair value changes of the derivative are substantially matched by corresponding fair value changes of the hedged item, both of which are recognised in profit or loss.
All qualifying hedges were effective.
Included in net losses and net gains below is an adjustment in respect of hedge ineffectiveness.
The main source of hedge ineffectiveness is due to basis risk on hedged currencies.
At 31 December 2018 the Group held the following interest rate swaps as hedging instruments in fair value hedges of interest risk.

It also uses foreign exchange contracts and currency swaps to manage the variability in future exchange rates on its assets and liabilities and costs in foreign currencies.
Gains and losses arising on the effective portion of the hedges are deferred in equity until the variability on the cash ow affects profit or loss, at which time the gains or losses are transferred to profit or loss.

This risk arises from the uctuation in spot exchange rates between the functional currency of the subsidiaries and the Groups functional currency, which causes the amount of the investment to vary.
The Group uses a combination of foreign exchange contracts and non-derivative financial assets to manage the variability in future exchange rates on its net investments in foreign currencies.
Gains and losses arising on the effective portion of the hedges are deferred in equity until the net investment is disposed of.
