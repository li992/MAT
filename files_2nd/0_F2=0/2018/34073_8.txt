The Total Remuneration Cap covers Salary, Bonus: Pension: and LTIP options.
The LTIP Cap covers the value at vesting of LTIP options and is a separate 20.0% 50% 0% 25% 30% 35% 40% 45% 50% cap within the overall Total Remuneration Cap.
In the operation of the LTIP Cap where shares have vested as a result of the performance conditions being met but the value is capped in a given year, the balance of the shares will be banked and carried forward.
This banked balance will still be subject to 21.5% 60% 0% 30% 36% 42% 48% 54% 60% continued employment but will become exercisable at the next vesting date provided the Caps are not exceeded.
This process will continue until 2023 at which point any banked shares which have not become exercisable will lapse.
The Remuneration Committee has extended the period over which banked 23.0% 70% 0% 35% 42% 49% 56% 63% 70% shares become exercisable to 2023 to provide a longer lock-in of participants.
The LTIP Cap provides an extension of two years from when the 2011 LTIP was originally due to finish in 2021.
From 1 May 2017, the Remuneration Committee determined under the Remuneration Policy that the only remuneration payable to the Chairman is a fixed fee of 200,000 p. a. other than the award that was granted to him under the 2011 LTIP, which will be subject to the new remuneration caps, and the 26.0% 90% 0% 45% 54% 63% 72% 81% 90% earned balance in his Bonus Plan account which will continue to pay out in line with the rules of the Plan.
There will be no entitlement to other salary, pension or bonus.
The Remuneration Committee believes that the Chairman should primarily be rewarded through the equity incentives which reflect 27.5% 100% 0% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% both the historic value he has helped create and his ongoing strategic role with the Company to ensure an alignment of his interests with shareholders.
The Committee when setting the Group performance conditions follows the approach agreed with shareholders as part of the approval non-executive Directors of the Bonus Plan.
The Committee committed to setting performance conditions to ensure that, over the six year plan period, the The following table sets out the fee rates for the Non-executive Directors in the year ended 30 April 2018 and those rates which will average ROE and NAV growth targets were in the following ranges: apply in the year ending 30 April 2019: ROE range 20% to 25% p. a. : nOn-exeCutive 2017 18 2018 19 NAV Growth range 0% to 5% p. a.
DiReCtOR 000 000 % ChAnGe The Committee believes that taking into account the market faced by the Company and the strategy set that the above targets are Deputy Chairman and SID fees 116.0 119.5 3.0% suitably challenging given the incentive opportunity that can be earned.
The ROE targets reflect the Companys expectations on 1 Basic Fee 64.0 66.0 3.1% performance over the next period in the context of the prevailing market uncertainty and risk.
The Company noted in last years report that profitability would normalise from 2018 19, following the delivery of exceptional profits generated from investment made at the end Additional fee for chairmanship of Committee 13.0 13.0 of the Financial Crisis which has seen annualised ROE of approximately 35% over the first three years of the six year Bonus Plan.
The Notes targets set for 2018 19, at 20% to 27.5% are above the long-term average set for the Plan and reflect the beginning of this transition.
The fee for Sir John Armitt, the outgoing SID and Deputy Chairman, has been set at 80,000, reflecting his experience and pre-eminent standing in construction and infrastructure, and the value he continues to add to the Board.
The NAV Growth condition remains the same as the Committee believes this together with the ROE condition provide the appropriate dynamic tension with the requirement to pay dividends whilst maintaining the Companys asset base.
Whilst the bonus payable for all the Executive Directors will be determined by the satisfaction of the Group targets, the divisional performance continues to be an important part of the Committees assessment.
At the discretion of the Committee the failure of a particular Division to meet its individual targets may result in a reduction to the bonus amount paid to the relevant Divisional Director.
Long term incentives: The current Executive Directors will not be granted additional options under the 2011 LTIP.
