The Group holds 90% of the equity and voting rights in Inter City Railways Limited, which in turn holds 100% of the equity and voting rights in East Coast Main Line Company Limited, which traded as Virgin Trains East Coast.
Both Inter City Railways Limited and East Coast Main Line Company Limited are incorporated in the UK.
The Virgin Group of companies holds the other 10% of the equity and voting rights of Inter City Railways Limited and previously received a royalty fee from East Coast Main Line Company Limited that varied depending on the revenue and profit of that company.
The Group has contractual arrangements with the Virgin Group in respect of the business.
However, the Group may appoint a majority of the directors of Inter City Railways Limited and appoint the executive management of East Coast Main Line Company Limited.
Also, the Group is responsible for the day-to-day management of the company, and has the power to direct its activities.
The Group therefore accounts for Inter City Railways Limited and East Coast Main Line Company Limited as subsidiaries.
The loss for the year ended 28 April 2018 allocated to the non-controlling interest is shown on the consolidated income statement.
The accumulated non-controlling interest as at 28 April 2018 is shown on the consolidated balance sheet and the movement in that interest in the year is shown in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
At least 75% of the distributable profit of Inter City Railways Limited should be distributed to its shareholders within four months of each financial yearend subject to retaining sufficient cash to meet any obligations under rail franchise agreements.
Both shareholders in Inter City Railways Limited need to agree to any changes to or deviations from that dividend policy.
The consolidated balance sheet of Inter City Railways Limited as at 28 April 2018 and its financial performance for the year ended 28 April 2018 are summarised below.
The amounts shown below are determined in accordance with the Groups accounting policies before inter-company eliminations.

The Virgin Trains East Coast rail franchise agreement was terminated on 24 June 2018 and its business, together with certain assets and liabilities, were transferred to a public sector company.
The decision is consistent with the Secretary of State for Transports statement in the House of Commons on 5 February 2018, where he intimated that he was considering two options for the continued operation of the InterCity East Coast services.
An onerous contract provision in respect of Virgin Trains East Coast was first recognised in the consolidated balance sheet as at 29 April 2017, when the Group determined that losses at Virgin Trains East Coast would not be fully recovered over the original franchise term unless new commercial terms were agreed with the Department for Transport.
The provision of 84.1m at 29 April 2017 was determined based on the Group's forecast of the extent to which the unavoidable costs under the franchise would exceed the future economic benefits to be derived from the franchise.
While the Group expected to conclude new commercial terms with the Department, the existing franchise was considered to be onerous as defined in International Accounting Standard 37 IAS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
The onerous contract provision as at 29 April 2017 was estimated on the assumption that Stagecoach Group plc, the parent company, would fund its entire 165.0m loan commitment to Virgin Trains East Coast and that no amount of that loan would be recovered.
The estimate of the onerous contract provision has been updated as at 28 April 2018 to take account of actual losses arising since 29 April 2017 and forecast to arise after 28 April 2018.
The 59.1m onerous contract provision as at 28 April 2018 has been determined based on the amount by which the forecast unavoidable costs from 29 April 2018 of meeting the obligations under the contracts i. e. the Virgin Trains East Coast franchise agreement and related contracts exceed the expected economic benefits to be received.
This has resulted in an additional expense included in the exceptional items shown in note 4.
The Department for Transport notified Virgin Trains East Coast prior to 28 April 2018 that it was in default of its franchise agreement.
Accordingly, the onerous contract provision of 59.1m as at 28 April 2018 includes an amount of 21.0m that the Group expects to pay in respect of the Virgin Trains East Coast performance bond.
The Group has also reviewed the carrying values of Virgin Trains East Coast's other assets and liabilities as at 28 April 2018 including taking account of the estimated amounts payable and receivable to the public sector company in respect of the transfer of assets and liabilities under the agreed terms of the transfer of the business and made appropriate adjustments to those carrying values.
The effect of those adjustments on profit is in the exceptional items shown in note 4.
Provision has also been made as at 28 April 2018 for the amount of the Virgin Trains East Coast performance bond, given that the Department for Transport had notified Virgin Trains East Coast prior to 28 April 2018 that Virgin Trains East Coast was in default of its rail franchise agreement.
The effect of that on profit is in the exceptional items shown in note 4.
While the terms of the transfer of the business, as well as certain assets and liabilities, to the public sector company have been agreed, the transfer values have not yet been agreed for all of the individual items.
Estimating the amount of the onerous contract provision, and the carrying values of assets and liabilities, therefore involves some judgement.
However, based on its agreements with the Department for Transport and the new operator, the Group does not currently expect a material change to arise in respect of that in the year ending 27 April 2019.
Under the terms agreed for the transfer of the business, as well as certain assets and liabilities, any residual net assets of Virgin Trains East Coast are payable to the Department for Transport, consistent with the Groups accounting for Virgin Trains East Coast as at 28 April 2018.
As explained in note 29, no additional liability has been recorded as at 28 April 2018 in respect of possible further claims by the Department against Virgin Trains East Coast on the basis that the Directors consider the likelihood of such claims to be remote and all Virgin Train East Coasts residual net assets are assumed to be payable to the Department in any event.
As explained in notes 30 b and 30 c, lease commitments and Network Rail commitments of Virgin Trains East Coast were assumed by the new operator with effect from 24 June 2018 and Virgin Trains East Coast has no further such commitments from that date.
A potential tax asset of 33.8m has not been recognised in respect of accumulated tax losses relating to Virgin Trains East Coast as at 28 April 2018 because the contractual arrangements with government in relation to Virgin Trains East Coast give rise to significant doubt over the Groups ability to access and utilise these losses.
