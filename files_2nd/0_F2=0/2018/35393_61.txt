This amount was held in other comprehensive income to be recycled to the income statement once the hedged item impacts the profit and loss.
Foreign exchange forward contracts designated at fair value through profit or loss offsetting these derivatives were entered into at the point of fide-designation and as such derivatives held at fair value through profit and loss on the statement of financial position at 30 September 2017 was a total net liability of 4.6 million.
As at 30 September 2018 the fair value of these trades remaining totalled a net liability of 0.4 million on the statement of financial position.
2 Included within derivative amounts classified as being held in a cash flow hedge are foreign exchange forward contracts never designated in a hedge relationship and measured at fair value through profit and loss.
As at 30 September 2018 these amounts totalled a net liability value of 1.0 million on the statement of financial position.
3 In February 2016, easyJet Plc issued a 500 million bond under the 3,000 million Euro Medium Term Note Programme guaranteed by easyJet Airline Company Limited.
The Eurobond pays an annual fixed coupon of 1.750%.
At the same time the Group entered into three cross-currency interest rate swaps to convert the entire 500 million fixed rate Eurobond to a Sterling floating rate exposure.
All three swaps pay floating interest three-month LIBOR plus a margin quarterly, receive fixed interest annually, and have maturities matching the Eurobond.
The Group designated all three cross-currency interest rate swaps as a fair value hedge of the interest rate and currency risks on the 500 million Eurobond.
The swaps are measured at fair value through profit or loss with any gains or losses being taken immediately to the income statement.
The carrying value of the Eurobond is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risks being to the risks being hedged.
This net carrying value differs to the swaps fair value depending on movements in the Group's credit risk and cross-currency basis.
The fair value of the Eurobond represents the quoted market price of the Eurobond as at 30 September 2018.
The carrying value of the fixed rate Eurobond net of the cross-currency interest rate swap at 30 September 2018 was 378 million.
4 In October 2016 easyJet plc issued 500 million bond under the 3,000 million Euro Medium Term Note Programme guaranteed by easyJet Airline Company Limited.
The Eurobond pays an annual fixed coupon of 1.125%.
Shortly after the issuance of the 500 million bond the Group entered into three cross-currency interest rate swaps to convert the entire 500 million fixed rate Eurobond to a Sterling fixed rate exposure.
The cross-currency interest rate swaps were executed on 8 November 2016 with settlement and notional exchange occurring on 14 November 2016.
All three swaps pay fixed interest semi-annually, receive fixed interest annually, and have maturities matching the Eurobond.
The Group designated all three cross-currency interest rate swaps as a cash flow hedge of the currency risk on the 500 million Eurobond.
The cross-currency interest rate swaps are measured at fair value with the effective portion taken through the statement of comprehensive income.
The element of the fair value generated by the change in the spot rate is recycled to the income statement from the statement of comprehensive income to offset the revaluation of the Eurobond.
The carrying value of the fixed rate Eurobond net of the cross-currency interest rate swap at 30 September 2018 was 445 million.
5 Amounts disclosed in the Other column are items that do not meet the definition of a financial instrument.
They are disclosed to facilitate reconciliation of the carrying values of financial instruments to line items presented in the statement of financial position.
The fair values of both Eurobonds are classified as level 1 of the IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement fair value hierarchy.
The remaining financial instruments for which fair value is disclosed in the table above, and derivative financial instruments, are classified as level 2.
The fair value measurement hierarchy levels have been defined as follows: Level 1, fair value of financial instruments based on quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2, fair value of financial instruments in an active market for example, over the counter derivatives which are determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.
Level 3, fair value of financial instruments that are not based on observable market data i. e. unobservable inputs.
Fair value calculation methodology The fair values of derivatives and financial instruments have been determined by reference to observable market prices where the instruments are traded, where available.
Where market prices are not available, the fair value has been estimated by discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates and by applying year end exchange rates.

The cross-currency interest rate swap contracts are represented at the Sterling notional.
For jet fuel forward contracts, quantity represents contracted metric tonnes.
The majority of hedged foreign exchange and jet fuel transactions are expected to occur on various dates within the next 24 months.
The foreign exchange and jet fuel contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and the accumulated gains or losses deferred in the hedging reserve will be recognised in the income statement in the periods that the hedged transaction affects the income statement.
Where the gain or loss is included in the initial amount recognised for the purchase of an aircraft, recognition in the income statement will be over a period of up to 23 years in the form of depreciation of the purchased asset.
The Group maintains cross-currency interest rate swap contracts on fixed rate debt issuance as part of its approach to currency and interest rate risk management.
The cross-currency interest rate swap contracts are designated and qualify as either fair value or cash flow hedges to minimise volatility in the income statement.
