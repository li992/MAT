Financial statements Notes to the financial statements 1.
Basis of preparation General information Victrex plc the Company is a limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The address of its registered office is Victrex Technology Centre, Hillhouse International, Thornton Cleveleys, Lancashire FY5 4QD, United Kingdom.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 30 September 2018 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The Company is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
These consolidated financial statements have been approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 4 December 2018.
Basis of preparation Both the consolidated and Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU endorsed IFRS and with the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments, defined benefit pension scheme assets and investments which are measured at their fair value.
The Groups business activities, together with factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are set out in the Strategic report on pages 1 to 39.
In addition, note 14 on financial risk management details the Groups exposure to a variety of financial risks, including currency and credit risk.
The Group has significant positive cash balances and has a multi-currency revolving credit facility of 40m 20m committed and 20m accordion which expires in June 2022.
This facility was undrawn at 30 September 2018 and remained undrawn at 4 December 2018 whenthese consolidated financial statements were approved for issue by the Board of Directors.
The Directors have performed a robust assessment, including a review of the budget for the year ending 30 September 2019 and longer-term strategic forecasts and plans including consideration of the principal risks faced by the Company, as detailed on pages 23 to 27.
Following this review the Directors are satisfied that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue to operate and meet their liabilities as they fall due for a period of at least twelve months from the date of signing these financial statements.
For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis for preparing the financial statements.
Details of the Groups policy on liquidity risk and capital management are included in note 14 to the financial statements.
On publishing the Company financial statements here together with the consolidated financial statements, the Company is taking advantage of section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and related notes that form part of the approved financial statements.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with endorsed IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates andassociated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewedon an ongoing basis.
Details of significant estimates and assumptions are set out in note 21.
The accounting policies set out in these notes have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
The accounting policies have been consistently applied by Group entities.
A number of new standards and amendments to existing standards were effective for the financial year ended 30 September 2018, whichincluded: u Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses Amendments to IAS 12 u Annual Improvements to IFRSs 20142016 Cycle u Disclosure Initiative Amendments to IAS 7 None of these have had a material impact to the Groups consolidated result or financial position.
A number of standards, amendments and interpretations have been issued and endorsed by the EU but are not yet effective and, accordingly, the Group has not yet adopted them.
These include: u IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: this standard is effective from 1 January 2018 and will be adopted by the Group on 1 October 2018.
Thisstandard replaces IAS 39 Recognition and Measurement.
The main changes the new standard introduces are: u new requirement for the classification and measurement of financial assets: u a new impairment model for financial assets held at amortised cost based on expected credit losses: and u changes to hedge accounting by aligning hedge accounting more closely to an entitys risk management objectives.
Annual Report 2018 Victrex plc 85 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 1.
Basis of preparation continued Basis of preparation continued The Group has performed a detailed assessment of the three areas of the new standard.
The main impacts are assessed as: 1 T he Groups approach to currency hedging meets the criteria to be net hedged under IFRS 9.
In accordance with IFRS 9, this will result ina presentational change on the face of the income statement for the year ended 30 September 2019, with the fair value gains and losses recognised on cash flow hedges being disclosed separately within gross margin, rather than included within the line item of the underlying hedged transaction.
Revenue, cost of sales and sales, marketing and administration expenses will, therefore, be recognised at the average exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction.
The revised presentation will potentially result in an increase in gross margin percentage volatility.
T he Group will apply this change prospectively and will use the practical expedient allowed to fide-designate the old IAS 39 hedging relationships in existence on 1 October 2018 and start a new hedging relationship under the new IFRS 9 model.
2 R evision of the Groups existing incurred loss provisioning model for its trade receivables to the required expected credit loss model.
Theresulting reassessment of existing provisions will be immaterial on the net assets of the Group.
As such any impact will be included in the income statement for the year ending 30 September 2019, with no modified retrospective adjustment recognised totheopening balance sheet as at 1 October 2018.
There will be no significant changes required in classification or measurement base in the transition to IFRS 9 for Victrexs financial assets.
See note 14 for further details.
u IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: this standard is effective from 1 January 2018 and will be adopted by the Group on1October 2018.
IFRS 15 provides a principles-based approach for revenue recognition.
T he Directors have now completed the detailed assessment for the expected impact of IFRS 15.
Consistent with the preliminary analysis performed, there will be no impact on the timing and recognition of revenue for the sale of goods, which are recognised in line with Incoterms either on dispatch or delivery.
IFRS 15 does result in an element of variable consideration in relation to Medical Unit Payments MUP, which is determined and contingent on onward sale of a medical device, made from Group material, by the customer.
Under IAS 18 MUP revenue is typically recognised in the period the customer confirms the onward sale.
However under IFRS 15 the Group must now recognise when the performance obligation is satisfied.
Revenue recognition will be accelerated from the point when onward sale is confirmed by the customer, to the point when the material is sold by the Group.
T he material to which the MUP relates is not disclosed by the customer until there is an onward sale, making any assessment of the value of revenue to accelerate on adoption judgemental.
The Directors have performed a detailed assessment and concluded that, based on the judgements made, the amount which would be accelerated is not material and therefore for existing MUP contracts no modified retrospective adjustment to the opening balance sheet as at 1October 2018 will be made and no revenue will be accelerated.
u IFRS 16 Leases: the standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and will be adopted by the Group on 1 October 2019.
The Directors have assessed the likely impact on the reported results and financial position of the Group onthe basis that it will use the modified retrospective approach.
This will result in the recognition of an asset and liability at the present value of remaining lease payments, discounted using the incremental borrowing rate at the date of adoption.
The existing obligations under operating lease agreements at 30 September 2018 are 7.6m, which primarily relate to buildings.
If the Company were to adopt IFRS 16 on 1 October 2018, anasset and corresponding lease liability of approximately 6.5m would be recognised.
The income statement for the year ending 30September 2019 would be adversely impacted at a profit before tax level of approximately 0.1m.
Further details of the Groups current lease arrangements are included in note 8.
The cumulative impact of the adoption of all other standards is not expected to be significant.
Segment reporting The Group complies with IFRS 8 Operating Segments, which requires operating segments to be identified and reported upon that areconsistent with the level at which results are regularly reviewed by the entitys chief operating decision maker.
The chief operating decision maker for the Group is the Victrex plc Board.
Information on the business units is the primary basis of information reported tothe Victrex plc Board.
The performance of the business units is assessed based on segmental gross profit.
Management of sales, marketing and administration functions servicing both business units is consolidated and reported at a Group level.
The Groups business is strategically organised as two business units operating segments : Industrial, which focuses on our Automotive, Aerospace, Electronics and Energy markets: and Medical, which focuses on providing specialist solutions for medical device manufacturers.

Segment reporting continued Entity-wide disclosures Revenue recognition Revenue comprises the amounts receivable for the sale of goods, net of value added tax, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, which is when the goods are dispatched or delivered in line with Incoterms.
Medical Unit Payments, contingent on onward sale, are recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group.
This is typically the period the customer confirms the onward sale and the amount can be measured reliably.
No revenue is recognised if there is significant uncertainty regarding recovery of the consideration due or associated costs.
Volume rebates are recognised as a deduction from gross sales as qualifying sales are made throughout the period.
These rebates are accrued based on the maximum amount due to customers based on annualised sales, unless it is clear that maximum rebate conditions will not be met in a particular period.
Information about products The Group derives its revenue from the sale of high performance thermoplastic polymers.
Information about geographical areas The Groups country of domicile is the United Kingdom.

Income tax expense Income tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except totheextent that it relates to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income or equity as appropriate.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the current and prior years, using tax rates and tax laws enacted orsubstantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Provisions are recognised for uncertain tax positions when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and management judge that it is probable that there will be a future outflow of economic benefits from the Group.
Provisions are measured using managements estimate of the most likely outcome.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for:goodwill not deductible for tax purposes: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries except to the extent that they will probably reverse in the foreseeable future.
Theamount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets andliabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

Acquisitions The acquisition method is used to account for business combinations.
Goodwill represents the difference between the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree if any and the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired, including intangibles, and liabilities assumed, including contingent liabilities as required by IFRS 3.
In the event that this difference is negative, the amount is recognised directly in the Consolidated income statement.
The value of non-controlling interests at the acquisition date is measured as the non-controlling interests proportionate share of net assets of the acquiree or at fair value.
The choice of measurement basis is determined on an  basis as permitted by IFRS 3.
Financial derivatives in place over the remaining equity of an entity are taken into account when calculating the proportionate share of the non-controlling interest.
Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are recognised in the Consolidated income statement.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt, that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.
Prior year investment in joint ventures and acquisitions TxV Aerospace Composites TxV On 10 January 2017 Victrex established a joint venture with Tri-Mack Plastics.
The results and financial position of TxV are consolidated intothe Group income statement and Group balance sheet respectively based on the level of control Victrex exerts over TxV.
Victrexs investment in TxV amounts to $14m.
Under the terms of the Joint Venture Agreement both parties have access to financial derivatives via put or call options over the equity of TxV.
The nature of these derivatives provides Victrex with the potential to increase its level of ownership.
Where this is not under Victrexs control the exercise price of the derivative is recognised as a financial liability as required by IAS 32 Financial Instruments Disclosure.
Thevalue of this liability as at30 September 2018 is $4m 3.1m.
Acquisition of Zyex Group Limited Zyex On 3 April 2017, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Zyex, and its two subsidiary undertakings, Zyex Limited and ZyexReclaim Limited, for a cash consideration of 9.9m.
The net identifiable assets on acquisition of 7.3m include intangible assets of 2.4m, representing the fair value of the Zyex brand name and customer relationships, property, plant and equipment of 3.5m, net working capital of 2.0m and cash of 0.9m.
A deferred tax liability of 0.8m has also been recognised in relation to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.
The Board considers that the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of 2.6m is goodwill on acquisition representing employee expertise and anticipated future operating synergies.
See note 9 for further details.
None of the goodwill recognised isexpected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
The measurement period concluded in the year ended 30 September 2018, with no measurement adjustments being made to the fair values in this period.
Property, plant and equipment Owned assets All owned items of property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and provision for impairment.
The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other repairs and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful economic lives as follows: Buildings 3050 years Plant and machinery 1030 years Fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment 510 years Computers and motor vehicles 35 years Freehold land is not depreciated.
The residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed annually for continued appropriateness and indications of impairment, andadjusted if appropriate.
Depreciation on assets classified as in the course of construction commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount.
These are included in the income statement.

Annual Report 2018 Victrex plc 91 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 9.
Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill arising on the acquisition of business is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
Anyimpairment provisions that arose during impairment testing would not be reversed.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 October 2004, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the net amount recorded previously under UK GAAP.
In respect of acquisitions that have occurred since 1 October 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment by reference to the estimated future cash flows of the relevant CGU, discounted to their present value using risk-adjusted discount factors to give its value in use.
A CGU is the smallest identifiable asset group that generates cash flows that are largely independent from other assets and groups.
Impairment losses are recognised if the carrying amount of the CGU to which goodwill has been allocated exceeds its recoverable value the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell andare recognised in the income statement.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any provisions for impairment.
Other intangibles are assessed for impairment only when there is an indication that they might be impaired.
The estimated useful life andamortisation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted foron a prospective basis.
Intangible assets not yet ready for use are not amortised, but are subject to annual impairment reviews.
Other intangible assets are amortised from the time they are first ready for use.
Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement over the estimated useful economic lives as follows: Computer software 57 years straight line Customer relationships 10 years systematic Brand name 5 years systematic Amortisation on assets classified as in the course of construction commences when the assets are ready for their intended use, thepointat which they are reclassified from assets in course of construction, on the same basis as other assets of that class.
Intangible assets continued Goodwill recognised is measured against discounted future cash flow projections for the relevant CGU.
Management has prepared cash flow projections for a five-year period derived from the approved budget for the 2019 financial year and the five-year strategy.
These forecasts include assumptions around volumes and sales prices, costs of manufacture, operating costs, working capital movements and capital expenditure.
The Group has two cash-generating units, Industrial and Medical, which are the smallest identifiable independent groups of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
Where assets and costs are shared between the two cash-generating units a reasonable apportionment of these are made for the purpose of the impairment calculation.
The goodwill and other intangible assets all relate to the Industrial cash-generating unit, into which Kleiss Gears, Zyexand TxV have been fully integrated.
These businesses are employed to generate revenue across all industrial geographies and markets.
The long-term average growth rate used was 2.0% 2017: 2.0% and the risk-adjusted pre-tax discount rate was 9.6% 2017: 9.6%.
The impairment test results in more than 100% headroom and so it is unlikely that a reasonably possible change in a key assumption would result in an impairment of goodwill or other intangibles.
Research & Development Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, isrecognised within the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred unless it meets all the criteria to be capitalised under IAS 38 Intangible Assets.
Research & Development expenditure of 17.4m 2017: 14.5m was expensed to the income statement in the year within sales, marketing and administrative expenses.
No development expenditure met the criteria to be capitalised 2017: same.
Investments Investments In the Companys financial statements, investments are stated at cost less any impairment in the value of the investment.
In the Groups financial statements accounting for investments is driven by the level of control that can be exerted.
An investor controls aninvestee when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
Where there is deemed to be an ability to affect the return, investments are consolidated from the date that ability commences until the date that it ceases.
Where there is not deemed to be an ability to affect the return, investments are held at fair value.
The initial fair value is deemed to be cost where transactions are at arms length.
For investments in unquoted companies, cost will continue to be used as a proxy for fair value unless, at the balance sheet date, there is an identified change in value, which could beillustrated by significant performance variations to plan or the value implied by subsequent funding rounds or other equity transactions.
Interests in joint arrangements A joint arrangement is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject tojoint control.
Joint arrangements are either joint operations or joint ventures.
Joint operations A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control have the rights to the assets, and obligations fortheliabilities, relating to the arrangement or other facts and circumstances indicate that this is the case.
The Groups share of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows are combined with the equivalent items in the financial statements on a line-by-line basis.
Joint ventures A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control have the rights to the net assets of the arrangement.
The results and assets and liabilities of joint ventures are incorporated in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns through its power over the entity.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from thedate on which control commences until the date on which control ceases.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are distinguished from the equity attributable to holders of the Parent.
The value of non-controlling interests comprises the value of non-controlling interests on the date control commences adjusted forthe non-controlling interests share of any subsequent changes in equity.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated inpreparing the consolidated financial statements.

No deferred tax has been recognised on unremitted earnings on the basis that UK legislation largely exempts overseas dividends remitted from UK tax.
Deferred tax is provided where there is an intention to distribute earnings and a tax liability arises.
It is impractical to estimate the amount of unrecognised deferred tax liabilities in respect of the unremitted earnings.
Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost of inventories is based on the first-in, first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition.
The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production overheads allocated based onnormal operating capacity.
Cost is calculated using the standard cost method.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price inthe ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
Further details on inventory valuation andprovisions are included in note 21.

Financial risk management Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities Derivative financial instruments are used by the Group to manage its exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates relating to overseas sales and purchases.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
The Group hedges a proportion of its forecast sales, purchases and capital expenditure which are denominated in a foreign currency cash flow hedge using forward exchange contracts.
The Board is responsible for setting the hedging policy which is detailed above.
These foreign exchange contracts are initially recognised at fair value, with most having maturities of less than one year after the balancesheet date.
The method of recognising any gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value depends on whether or not the derivative is designated asahedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
Cash flow hedges At the inception of the transaction, the Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items.
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective portion of changes in fair value is recognised in equity via the statement of comprehensive income.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at the time when the forecast transaction occurs, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, is recognised in the income statement in the corresponding line that the hedged item goes through being revenue, cost of sales or sales, marketing and administrative expenses.
The timing of the gain or loss impacting the income statement isaligned to the timing of the hedged transaction impacting the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected tooccur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Other derivative financial instruments For financial instruments not designated in hedge accounting relationships or that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, thegain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Other financial derivatives are stated at the present value of the exercise price which is based on the expected cash payment associated with the arrangement and are included as a liability in the Groups balance sheet.
Subsequent changes in the value of the liability to fairvalue are recognised in the income statement.
If the financial derivative expires unexercised, the liability is derecognised and a corresponding non-controlling interest is recognised, withany difference being recognised in equity.

Financial risk management continued Group Currency risk Currently, the Group exports 98% of sales from the UK and also makes raw material purchases overseas.
Currency risk is managed by the Currency Committee, which is chaired by the Group Finance Director and comprises the Chief Executive Officer and senior finance executives.
It meets monthly to review and manage the Groups currency hedging activities, in line with the hedging policy approved by the Board.
Group hedging policy is to defer the impact on profits of currency movements by hedging: u a minimum of 90% and a maximum of 100% of projected transaction exposures arising from trading in the forthcoming six-month period: and u a minimum of 75% and a maximum of 100% of projected transaction exposures arising in the following six-month period.
Profitability can vary due to the impact of fluctuating exchange rates on the unhedged portion of the transaction exposures and from revised forecasts of future trading, which can lead to an adjustment of currency cover in place.
In addition, the Group includes a number of foreign subsidiaries.
As a result of these factors, the Groups financial statements are exposed to currency fluctuations.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US Dollar, Euro and Yen.
The impact of a 5% movement in the average Sterling US Dollar, Sterling Euro and Sterling Yen rates on profit for 2018 is 6.5m, 4.9m and 1.2m 2017: 5.9m, 4.5m and 1.0m respectively.
The impact of a 5% movement in the average Sterling US Dollar, Sterling Euro andSterling Yen rates on equity for 2018 is 3.6m, 0.3m and 0.5m 2017: 2.6m, 0.3m and 0.3m respectively.
The notional contract amount, carrying amount and fair value of the Groups forward exchange contracts and swaps are as follows: As at 30 September 2018 As at 30 September 2017 Notional Carrying Notional Carrying contract amount and contract amount and amount fair value amount fair value m m m m Current assets 39.0 1.1 181.2 7.6 Current liabilities 180.5 6.2 18.0 1.2 219.5 5.1 199.2 6.4 The fair values have been calculated by applying where relevant, for equivalent maturity profiles, the rate at which forward currency contracts with the same principal amounts could be acquired at the balance sheet date.
These are categorised as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7.
The following table indicates the periods in which cash flows associated with the maturity date of the forward foreign exchange contracts for which hedge accounting is applied are expected to occur: As at 30 September 2018 As at 30 September 2017 Expected Expected cash 6 months 6 to 12 12 to 18 cash 6 months 6 to 12 12 to 18 flows or less months months flows or less months months m m m m m m m m Forward exchange contracts: Assets 39.0 8.2 20.9 9.9 181.2 95.9 84.2 1.1 Liabilities 180.5 92.9 73.4 14.2 18.0 7.8 3.5 6.7 219.5 101.1 94.3 24.1 199.2 103.7 87.7 7.8 Gains and losses deferred in the hedging reserve in equity on forward foreign exchange contracts at 30 September 2018 will be recognised in the income statement during the period in which the hedged forecast transaction affects the income statement, which is typically 12 months prior to the cash flow occurring.
At 30 September 2018, there are a number of hedged foreign currency transactions which are expected to occur at various dates during the next twelve months.
During the year, losses of 0.9m 2017: gains of 1.7m relating to forward exchange contracts on the balance sheet at 30 September 2018 were released to the income statement.
Gains and losses recognised in the income statement on contracts which are yet to settle are adjusted as a non-cash movement on the Cash flow statements.
This equated to a loss of 2.6m in the year 2017: gain of 7.5m.

Financial risk management continued Group continued Credit risk The Group manages exposure to credit risk at many levels ranging from Executive Leadership Team approval being required for the credit limits of larger customers, to the use of letters of credit and cash in advance where appropriate.
Internal procedures require regular consideration of credit ratings, payment history, aged items and proactive debt collection.
All customers are assigned a credit limit which issubject to annual review.
Trade receivables can be analysed as follows: 2018 2017 As at 30 September m m Amounts neither past due nor impaired 29.9 26.0 Amounts past due but not impaired: Less than 30 days 3.6 2.8 3060 days 0.1 1.5 More than 60 days 2.1 Total past due but not impaired 3.7 6.4 Amounts impaired 0.7 0.5 Impairment allowances 0.7 0.5 Carrying amount of impaired receivables Trade receivables net of allowances 33.6 32.4 Trade receivables are considered to be impaired when the amount is in dispute, when customers are believed to be in financial difficulty orif any other reason exists which implies that there is a doubt over the recoverability of the debt.
No provision has been made in respect of the amounts shown as past due but not impaired as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable in full.
Movements in the allowance for impairments were: 2018 2017 m m At beginning of year 0.5 0.5 Charge in the year 0.3 Release of allowance 0.1 At end of year 0.7 0.5 The credit risk in respect of cash and cash equivalents, other financial assets and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties with significant balances are established international banks whose credit ratings are monitored on an ongoing basis.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances, call deposits and other short-term deposits with original maturities typically ofthreemonths or less.
Other financial assets Cash invested in term deposits greater than three months in duration does not meet the criteria to be classified as cash and cash equivalents.
Accordingly, these deposits have been presented within Other financial assets and are classified as Loans and receivables inaccordance with IAS 39.
As at 30 September 2018, the maximum exposure with a single bank for deposits cash and cash equivalents and other financial assets was41.7m 2017: 31.1m for the Group.
As at 30September 2018, the largest mark to market exposure for gains on forward foreign exchange contracts to a single bank was 0.8m 2017: 3.0m.
The amounts on deposit at the year end represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk on cash and deposits.
Liquidity risk The Groups objective in terms of funding capacity is to ensure that it always has sufficient short-term and long-term funding available, either in the form of the Groups cash resources or committed bank facilities.
The Group has sufficient funds available to meet its current funding requirements for both revenue and capital expenditure.
In order to further manage liquidity risk to an acceptable level, the Group has a bank facility of 40m 20m committed and 20m accordion, which expires in June 2022, all of which was undrawn at the year end.
As at 30 September 2018, the Group had a cash and cash equivalents balance of 71.2m.
In addition, cash of 73.2m was invested interm deposit accounts being accounts with a maturity date of greater than three months when invested.
The maximum deposit length utilised by the Group when cash is invested both during the year ended 30 September 2018 and up to the date of this report is six months.

Financial risk management continued Group continued Price risk The Groups products contain a number of key raw materials and its operations require energy, notably electricity and natural gas.
Anyincrease or volatility in prices and any significant decrease in the availability of raw materials or energy could affect the Groups results.
Victrex strives to obtain the best prices and uses contractual means to benefit where appropriate and possible.
The Group has a significant degree of control over its supply chain which enables it to effectively manage the risk in this area.
Capital management The Group defines the capital that it manages as the Groups total equity.
The Groups policy for managing capital is to maintain a strong balance sheet with the objective of maintaining customer, supplier and investor confidence in the business and to ensure that the Group has sufficient resources to be able to invest in future development and growth of the business.
The Board does not expect to make significant share repurchases in 2019, although there is a resolution proposed at each AGM to authorise the Company to make one or more market purchases of its ordinary shares up to a maximum number of shares equal to 10% of its issued ordinary share capital as at the date of the AGM Notice.

All financial assets and liabilities are categorised as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7, with the exception of investments inunquoted companies which are categorised as Level 3.
The maturity profiles of the derivative instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships and trade receivables are given on page 97.
For trade and other payables there are no amounts due after one year, the majority falling due in 30 days or less.

Under IFRS 9 these will be classified as Amortised cost.
Annual Report 2018 Victrex plc 99 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 15.
Retirement benefit obligations Employee benefits Defined contribution pension schemes Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Defined benefit pension schemes The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension schemes recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of the future benefits that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, less the fair value of plan assets.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and have terms to maturity approximating to the terms ofthe related pension liability.
When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the total of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
In order to calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any minimum funding requirements that apply.
An economic benefit is available to the Group if it is realisable during the life of the plan or on settlement of the plan liabilities.
When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised in profit or loss onastraight line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
To the extent that the benefits vest immediately, theexpense is recognised in profit or loss.
Actuarial gains and losses are immediately recognised in full through the statement of comprehensive income.
The Group operates a number of pension schemes for its employees throughout the world.
Outside the UK, the Company operates defined contribution pension schemes.
The principal scheme operated by the Group is a funded UK pension scheme in which employees of UK subsidiary undertakings participate.
The scheme has two sections.
One section provides benefits on a defined benefit basis with benefits related to final pensionable pay.
The defined benefit section was closed to new members from 31 December 2001.
From this date new employees have been invited to join the second section that provides benefits on a defined contribution basis.
The defined benefit scheme closed on 31 March 2016, with employees in the scheme eligible to join the defined contribution scheme.
The latest triennial valuation was performed to 31 March 2016 and showed a scheme surplus of 773,000.
The surplus position means theCompany has no current obligation to make further contributions to the scheme, although this may change following future valuations.
Additional contributions of 3.9m were made during the year as part of an ongoing programme with the Trustees to work towards self-sufficiency.
Where the IAS 19 valuation shows scheme assets in excess of scheme liabilities, an asset is recognised based on the fact that under the terms ofthe Trust Deed agreement, the sponsoring Company is entitled to any assets that remain in the scheme after the settlement ofallpension liabilities.
On 26 October 2018, the High Court handed down its judgment in the Lloyds Banking Group case relating to equalisation of member benefits for the gender effects of Guaranteed Minimum Pensions GMP equalisation.
This addressed a long-standing legal uncertainty for Defined Benefit pension schemes, and will result in an increase in scheme liabilities.
GMP equalisation represents a scheme amendment, where an additional past service cost is chargeable, due to a change in the benefits payable and will be recognised in full in the Groups financial statements in the year ended 30 September 2019.
The impact is expected to be in the range of 1m2m.
This High Court judgment represents a condition that arose after the balance sheet date and has therefore been treated as a non-adjusting post balance sheet event in accordance with IAS 10 for the year ended 30 September 2018.

Retirement benefit obligations continued Principal actuarial assumptions continued The average duration of the benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period is 23 years 2017: 23 years.
Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount rate and inflation rate.
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on reasonably possible changes in the assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period assuming that all other assumptions are held constant: Increase in fund deficit as at Increase in fund deficit as at Change in assumption 30 September 2018 30 September 2017 Reduce discount rate by 1% p. a.
17.1m 18.4m Increase inflation expectations by 1% p. a.
12.5m 15.2m Increase life expectancy by 1 year 2.1m 2.2m In reality one might expect interrelationships between the assumptions, especially between discount rate and expected inflation rates.
The above analysis does not take the effect of these interrelationships into account.

Share-based payments Share-based payment transactions and employee share ownership trusts ESOT The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
Share-based payment transactions are recharged from the Company to those subsidiaries benefiting from the service ofthe employees to whom options are granted.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest and include employee service periods and performance targets which are not related to the Companys share price, such as earnings per share growth.
The fair value of the options is measured by the Stochastic model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
At each balance sheet date the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement andacorresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.
Any failure to meet market conditions, which include performance targets such as share price or total shareholder return, would not result in a reversal of original estimates in the income statement and any remaining charges would be accelerated.
The proceeds received, net of any directly attributable costs, are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium when the options are exercised.
The Group and Company provide finance to the ESOT to purchase Company shares in the open market.
Costs of running the ESOT are charged to the income statement.
The cost of shares held by the ESOT are deducted in arriving at equity until they are exercised by employees.
All share-based payment costs are recharged to the trading entities.

The terms and conditions of all the grants are as follows: Victrex 2005 2015 Executive Share Option Plan ESOP All employees are eligible to participate.
The Remuneration Committee currently excludes executive Directors from participating in this plan.
Option awards are based on a percentage of basic salary, not exceeding 100% of salary in each financial year.
The exercise price of the options isequal to the market price of the shares on the date of grant.
ESOP options are conditional on the employee completing three years service thevesting period and achieving the performance condition where applicable.
The level of awards vesting will vary depending on EPS growth.
Inorder for awards to reach the threshold level of vesting, the EPS growth of the Group must exceed 2% per annum with some awards requiring this growth to be above the Retail Price Index.
For awards over 33% of salary, the threshold increases to 3%, and then to 4% for awards over 66%.
Straight line vesting will occur to the extent that EPS growth falls between these annual EPS growth targets.

Critical judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The following are the critical judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty that the Directors have made in the process of applying theGroups accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Management has discussed these with the Audit Committee.
These should be read in conjunction with the significant accounting policies provided in thenotes to the financial statements.
Judgements made in applying accounting policies Other than judgements involving the use of estimates, the Directors do not consider there are any judgements made in applying the Groups significant accounting policies which would have a material impact on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Sources of estimation uncertainty The Group uses estimates and assumptions in applying the critical accounting policies to value balances and transactions recorded in the financial statements.
The estimates and assumptions that, if revised, would have a significant risk of a material impact on the valuation ofassets and liabilities within the next financial year are as follows: Inventory valuation The valuation of inventory, detailed in note 12, requires the use of estimates, with judgement required both in identification of directly attributable costs, to be absorbed into inventory valuation, and the level of normal production over which these costs are absorbed.
The estimation of normal production considers current year actual, prior period actual and budgeted production when concluding on the appropriate level over which to absorb production costs.
Similarly judgement is used in determining which costs are considered to be directly attributable to the production of inventory.
Management use their detailed experience in this process in forming their view on the adjustment required to record inventory of cost.
Inventory provisions are put in place for slow moving and potentially obsolete inventory as well as damaged and or out of specification product where cost is considered to be higher than net realisable value.
The level of provisioning is an estimate, with judgement required on ageing, customer order profiles, alternative routes to market and the option to re-process.
Pension scheme The valuation of pension scheme liabilities is calculated in accordance with Group policy.
The valuation is prepared by independent qualified actuaries but significant estimates are required in relation to the assumptions for pension increases, inflation, the discount rate applied, investment returns and member longevity, which underpin the valuations.
Note 15 contains information about the assumptions relating to retirement benefit obligations and also the sensitivity of the pension liability to movements in these assumptions.
Tax provisioning The Group operates in a number of geographies and different tax jurisdictions.
There is an inherent ambiguity in some of these jurisdictions with the tax calculation involving estimation in respect of matters where the tax impact is only known when a conclusion is reached with the relevant tax authority.
Management use their experience of each geography along with that of their advisors in estimating the tax charge for the period and any provision required for previous periods.
Based on recently granted UK patents and following discussions with Her Majestys Revenue & Customs HMRC about the UKs Patent Box legislation, management included an estimation of the benefit in the prior year and current year tax charge.
As shown in note 5, the cumulative benefit recognised in relation to Patent Box is 19.9m 2017: 11.9m.
Management will reassess this position if there are any changes in the legislation and or further discussions are held with HMRC.

Exchange rates Foreign currency translation Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operated the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentation currency.
Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the retranslation to balance sheet date exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges.
In addition, where an exchange difference arises on an intragroup monetary item that, insubstance, forms part of the entitys net investment in a foreign operation, these differences are recognised in other comprehensive income in the consolidated financial statements and accumulated in equity until the disposal of the foreign operation.
Group companies The results and financial position of all the Group entities none of which have the currency of a hyperinflationary economy that have afunctional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet: u income and expenses for each income statement are translated at weighted average exchange rates: and u all resulting exchange differences, from 1 October 2004, are recognised as a separate component of equity.
u The most significant Sterling exchange rates used in the financial statements under the Groups accounting policies are: 2018 2017 Average Closing Average Closing US Dollar 1.30 1.30 1.37 1.34 Euro 1.13 1.11 1.23 1.14 Yen 144 149 150 151 The average exchange rates in the above table take into account the impact of gains and losses on foreign currency contracts.
These rates are referred to elsewhere in the Annual Report as the effective rates for the period.
Events after the reporting period On 26 October 2018, the High Court handed down its judgment in the Lloyds Banking Group case relating to equalisation of member benefits for the gender effects of Guaranteed Minimum Pensions GMP equalisation.
