The financial statements of the Company have been prepared on an historical cost basis.
The financial statements are presented in US dollars US$ and all monetary amounts are rounded to the nearest thousand $000 except when otherwise indicated.

As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own profit and loss account.
d Judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty Certain amounts included in the financial statements such as the impairment in subsidiaries involve the use of judgement and or estimation.
These judgements and estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, having regard to prior experience, but actual results may differ from the amounts included in the financial statements.
Information about such judgements and estimation is contained in the accounting policies and or the notes to the financial statements.
e Changes in accounting policy and disclosures The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statement for the year ended 31 December 2018.
Amendments to standards and interpretations which came into force during the year did not have a significant impact on the financial statements.
f Currency translation The functional currency of the Company is the US dollar and is determined by the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company are initially recorded in the functional currency using the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured at the rate of exchange ruling at the statement of financial position date.
Exchange gains and losses on settlement of foreign currency transactions which are translated at the rate prevailing at the date of the transactions, or on the translation of monetary assets and liabilities which are translated at period-end exchange rates, are taken to the income statement.
Nonmonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at historical cost are translated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction.
g Investments in subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities over which the Company controls operating and financial policies, generally by owning more than 50% of voting rights.
Investments in subsidiaries are recognised at acquisition cost less any provision for impairment.
The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable.
If any such indication of impairment exists, the Company makes an estimate of its recoverable amount.
Where the carrying amount of an investment exceeds its recoverable amount, the investment is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
If, in subsequent periods, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed.
Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the profit and loss account, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date.
h Dividends receivable Dividends are recognised when the Companys right to receive payments is established.
Dividends received are recorded in the income statement.
154 Hochschild Mining PLC NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018 2 Significant accounting policies continued i Other receivables Current trade receivables are carried at the original invoice amount less provision made for impairment of these receivables.
Non-current receivables are stated at amortised cost.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established using the expected credit loss impairment model according to IFRS 9.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount and this difference is recognised in the income statement.
j Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the statement of financial position at cost.
For the purposes of the statement of financial position, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and deposits held with banks that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash within three months or less and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents as defined above are shown net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
k Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Any excess above the par value of shares received upon issuance of those shares is classified as share premium.
In the case the excess above par value is available for distribution, it is classified as merger reserve and then transferred to retained earnings.
l Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
m Share-based payments Cash-settled transactions The fair value of cash-settled share plans is recognised as a liability over the vesting period of the awards.
Movements in that liability between reporting dates are recognised as personnel expenses.
The fair value of the awards is taken to be the market value of the shares at the date of award adjusted by a factor for anticipated relative TSR performance.
Fair values are subsequently remeasured at each reporting date to reflect the number of awards expected to vest based on the current and anticipated TSR performance.
Equity-settled transactions The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in other reserves in equity, over the period in which the performance and or service conditions are fulfilled.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Companys best estimate of the number of equity instruments that vest.
The income statement expense for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period and is recognised in personnel expenses.
n Finance income and costs Finance income and costs mainly comprise interest income on funds invested, interest expense on borrowings, foreign exchange gains and losses, gains and losses from the change in fair value of derivative instruments and gains and losses on the disposal of available-for-sale investments.
Interest income and costs are recognised as they accrue, taking into account the effective yield on the asset and liability, respectively.
o Income tax Income tax for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax expense is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted at the statement of financial position date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes with the following exemptions: where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss: in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled based on the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Annual Report & Accounts 2018 155 p Financial instruments Financial assets Initial recognition and measurement Financial assets are classified, at initial recognition, as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income OCI, and fair value through profit or loss.
The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial assets contractual cash flow characteristics and the Groups business model for managing them.
The Groups business model for managing financial assets refers to how it manages its financial assets in order to generate cash flows.
The business model determines whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash flows, selling the financial assets, or both.
Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place regular way trades are recognised on the trade date, i. e. the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Subsequent measurement For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories: Financial assets at amortised cost debt instruments The Group measures financial assets at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met: The asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows, and The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest EIR method and are subject to impairment.
Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised, modified or impaired.
The Groups financial assets at amortised cost includes trade receivables.
Financial assets at fair value through OCI debt instruments The Group measures debt instruments at fair value through OCI if both of the following conditions are met: The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective of both holding to collect contractual cash flows and selling, and The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
For debt instruments at fair value through OCI, interest income, foreign exchange revaluation and impairment losses or reversals are recognised in the statement of profit or loss and computed in the same manner as for financial assets measured at amortised cost.
The remaining fair value changes are recognised in OCI.
Upon derecognition, the cumulative fair value change recognised in OCI is recycled to profit or loss.
The Groups does not have debt instruments at fair value through OCI.
- Financial assets designated at fair value through OCI equity instruments Upon initial recognition, the Group can elect to classify irrevocably its equity investments as equity instruments designated at fair value through OCI when they meet the definition of equity under IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and are not held for trading.
The classification is determined on an  basis.
Gains and losses on these financial assets are never recycled to profit or loss.
Dividends are recognised as other income in the statement of profit or loss when the right of payment has been established, except when the Group benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the financial asset, in which case, such gains are recorded in OCI.
Equity instruments designated at fair value through OCI are not subject to impairment assessment.
The Group elected to classify irrevocably its listed and non-listed equity investments under this category.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for trading, financial assets designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss, or financial assets mandatorily required to be measured at fair value.
Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term.
Derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives, are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.
Financial assets with cash flows that are not solely payments of principal and interest are classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss, irrespective of the business model.
Notwithstanding the criteria for debt instruments to be classified at amortised cost or at fair value through OCI, as described above, debt instruments may be designated at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition if doing so eliminates, or significantly reduces, an accounting mismatch.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value with net changes in fair value recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
This category includes derivative instruments.
Dividends on listed equity investments are also recognised as other income in the statement of profit or loss when the right of payment has been established.
156 Hochschild Mining PLC NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018 2 Significant accounting policies continued Derecognition A financial asset or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets is primarily derecognised i. e. removed from the Groups consolidated statement of financial position when: The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a pass-through arrangement: and either a the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or b the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
When the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if, and to what extent, it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership.
When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Group continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of its continuing involvement.
In that case, the Group also recognises an associated liability.
The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Group has retained.
Impairment of financial assets The Group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses ECLs for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss.
ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate.
The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms.
Financial liabilities Initial recognition and measurement Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.
The Groups financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts, and derivative financial instruments.
Subsequent measurement The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below: Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term.
This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Group that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by IFRS 9.
Separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.
Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are designated at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in IFRS 9 are satisfied.
The Group has not designated any financial liability as at fair value through profit or loss.
Loans and borrowings This is the category most relevant to the Group.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method.
Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR.
The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the statement of profit or loss.
This category generally applies to interest-bearing loans and borrowings.
Derecognition A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability.
The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Annual Report & Accounts 2018 157 Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the consolidated statement of financial position if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes party to the contracts that give rise to them and are classified as financial assets measured at amortised cost, debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income or financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss.
A detailed description of the Companys policies in respect of financial instruments is included in the Groups financial statements note 2 u. q Dividends distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Companys financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
3 Profit and loss account The Company made a loss attributable to equity shareholders of US$686,831,000 2017: gain of US$487,315,000.
4 Property, plant and equipment At 31 December 2018 and 2017 the Company has property, plant and equipment with cost of equipment of US$265,000 which is fully depreciated.
There were no additions during 2017 and 2018.

As a result of this test, the Company recognised an impairment of the investment in Hochschild Mining Holdings Ltd of US$687,553,000.
In 2017, the Company tested its investment in subsidiary for impairment in light of increases in the prices of gold and silver, as well as increases in the Companys publicly listed share price.
As a result of this test, the Company recognised an impairment reversal of the investment in Hochschild Mining Holdings Ltd of US$491,285,000.
The recoverable value of the investment in Hochschild Mining Holdings Limited was determined using a fair value less costs of disposal.
The fair value less costs of disposal was determined with reference to the market capitalisation of the Group at 31 December 2017 translated from Pounds Sterling into US Dollars using the year-end exchange rate both Level 1 inputs, to which a control premium was added based on recent market transactions a Level 2 input, and subsequently adjusted for the net debt held directly by the Company.
A Level 1 input refers to quoted prices in active markets, while a Level 2 input corresponds to other information that can be observed directly or indirectly.
Any positive variation in the key assumptions would not have an impact on the impairment reversal recognised.
Therefore, an adverse change of 10% of the market capitalisation would result in a reduction of the reversal of impairment by US$86,048,000.
