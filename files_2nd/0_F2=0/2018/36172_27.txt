Reporting entity Genus plc the Company is a public company limited by shares and incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006.
Its registered office is Matrix House, Basing View, Basingstoke, Hampshire, RG21 4DZ.
The Group Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2018 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
We have used the equity method to account for the Groups interests in joint ventures and associates.
Our business model on pages 6 and 7 explains the Groups operations and principal activities.
Basis of preparation We have prepared the Group Financial Statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Unless otherwise stated, we have consistently applied the significant accounting policies set out below to all periods presented in these Group Financial Statements.
The going concern statement has been included in the Strategic Report on page 14 and forms part of these statements.
In note 5, we have reclassified the comparative period to reflect changes between current and non-current assets in our porcine biological assets.
In note 15, we have reclassified the comparative period to reflect a change in the classification in our porcine biological assets between current and non-current assets.
Functional and presentation currency We present the Group Financial Statements in Sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentational currency.
Allfinancial information presented in Sterling has been rounded to the nearest 0.1m.
Use of estimates Preparing financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect our application of accounting policies and our reported assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Our actual results may differ from these estimates.
We review our estimates and underlying assumptions on an ongoing basis, and recognise revisions to accounting estimates in the period in which we revise the estimate and in any future periods affected.
Note 4 provides information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and the critical judgements we made in applying accounting policies that have the most effect on the amounts we recognised in the financial statements.
Alternative performance measures In reporting financial information, the Group presents alternative performance measures, APMs, which are not dened or specified under the requirements of IFRS.
The Group believes that these APMs, which are not considered to be a substitute for or superior to IFRS measures, provide stakeholders with additional helpful information on the performance of the business.
The APMs are consistent with how we plan our business performance and report on it in our internal management reporting to the Board and the executive leadership team.
Some of these measures are also used to set remuneration targets.
The key APMs that the Group uses include: adjusted operating profit, adjusted profit before tax from continuing operations, adjusted earnings per share, net debt and adjusted EBITDA as calculated under our financing facilities and includes cash received from joint ventures and historical cost depreciation of biological assets.
The Group reports some financial measures on both a reported and constant currency basis.
The constant currency basis, which is an APM, retranslates the current years results at the average actual periodic exchange rates used in the previous financial year.
This measure eliminates the effects of exchange rate uctuations on the year-on-year reported results.
The Group makes certain adjustments to the statutory profit measures in order to derive many of these APMs.
The Groups policy is to exclude items that are considered to be significant in nature and or quantum and where treatment as an adjusted item provides stakeholders with additional useful information to assess the Groups year-on-year trading performance.
On this basis, the following were included within adjusted items for the year ended 30 June 2018: net IAS 41 valuation movements on biological assets movements can be materially volatile and do not directly correlate to the underlying trading performance in the period.
Furthermore, the movement is non-cash related and many assumptions used in the valuation model are based on projections rather than current trading: amortisation of acquired intangible assets excluding this improves the comparability between acquired and organically grown operations, as the latter cannot recognise internally generated intangible assets.
Adjusting for amortisation provides a more consistent basis for comparison between the two: share-based payments this expense is considered to be relatively volatile and not fully reflective of the current period trading, as the performance criteria are based on EPS performance over a three-year period and include estimates of future performance: and exceptional items these are items which due to either their size or their nature are excluded to improve the understanding of the Groups underlying performance.
See note 7 for further details.
The reconciliation between operating profit from continuing operations and adjusted operating profit from continuing operations is shown on the face of the Group Income Statement.
All other reconciliations are included within the Financial Review section.
Genus plc | Annual Report 2018 104 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2018 3.
Significant accounting policies applied in the current reporting period that relate to the Financial Statements as awhole This section sets out our significant accounting policies that relate to the Financial Statements as a whole.
Where an accounting policy is generally applicable to a specific note to the Financial Statements, the policy has been described in that note.
We have also detailed below the new accounting pronouncements that we will adopt in future years and our current view of the impact they will have on our financial reporting.
Accounting convention We prepare the Group Financial Statements under the historical cost convention, except for our biological assets, share-based payment expense, pension liabilities and derivative financial instruments.
In accordance with IFRS, we measure: biological assets at fair value less point-of-sale costs, which represent distribution costs and selling expenses, share-based payment expense, pension liabilities, and certain financial instruments at fair value.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are entities the Group controls.
We have control of an entity when we are exposed, or have the rights, to variable returns from the entity and have the ability to affect the returns through power over the entity.
In assessing control, we take into account potential voting rights that we can currently exercise or convert.
We fully consolidate the results of subsidiaries we acquire from the date that control transfers to the Group.
We cease consolidating the results of subsidiaries that we cease to control from the date that control passes.
In preparing the Group Financial Statements, we eliminate intra-Group balances and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-Group transactions.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity accounted investees are eliminated against the investment, to the extent of our interest in the investee.
We eliminate unrealised losses in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Foreign currencies We record foreign currency transactions in the relevant Group entitys functional currency, at the exchange rate on the transaction date.
At each balance sheet date, we retranslate monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date.
We recognise the foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation in the Group Income Statement.
When non-monetary assets and liabilities are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency, we translate them at the exchange rate at the transaction date.
When non-monetary assets and liabilities are stated at fair value in a foreign currency, wetranslate them at the prevailing exchange rate on the date we determined the fair value.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill arising on consolidation, are translated into Sterling at the prevailing exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
We translate these operations revenues and expenses using an average rate for the period.
When exchange differences arise from translating foreign operations into Sterling, or from the fair value movement of related effective hedges, we take them to the foreign currency translation reserve.
When we dispose of a foreign operation, we release these differences to the income statement.
Exchange movements on inter-Company loans designated as long-term funding are taken to the foreign currency translation reserve, together with any related taxation.
The principal components of the Groups revenue and their respective accounting treatments are: Revenue from the sale of bovine and porcine semen, porcine breeding animals, embryos and ancillary products, which we recognise when risks and rewards transfer to the customer or distributor.
This is either when we ship to customers or on delivery, depending on the terms of sale.
Royalties, which we recognise when receivable.
We receive royalty payments from certain porcine customers based on key performance variables, such as the number of pigs born per litter, the number of litters born per sow and the average slaughter weight of the animals born.
This amount is confirmed directly to Genus by the customer.

Significant accounting policies applied in the current reporting period that relate to the Financial Statements as awhole continued Revenue from consulting, which represent the amounts we charged for services we provided during the year, including recoverable expenses but excluding value added tax.
We recognise services provided but not yet billed as revenue, based on a fair value assessment of the work we have delivered and our contractual right to receive payment.
Where unbilled revenue is contingent on a future event, we do not recognise any revenue until the event occurs.
Revenue from a contract to provide services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract.
The stage of completion of the contract is determined based on the fair value of services provided to date.
Revenue from the slaughter of porcine animals, which we recognise when the risks and rewards transfer to the slaughterhouse.
Research and development We undertake research with the aim of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge, and recognise this expenditure in the income statement as we incur it.
The Group constantly monitors its research activities.
When research projects achieve technical feasibility and are commercially viable, our policy is to capitalise further development costs within intangible assets, in accordance with IAS 38.
Our development activities include developing and maintaining our porcine genetic nucleus herd and our bovine pre-stud herds.
We do not capitalise development expenditure separately for these herds, as their fair value is included in the fair value of the Groups biological assets, in accordance with IAS 41.
We disclose the costs of research and herd development activities, as required by IAS 38.
New standards and interpretations In the current year, the Group has applied a number of amendments to IFRSs issued by the International Accounting Standards Board that are mandatorily effective for an accounting period that begins after 1 January 2017.
Their addition has not had any material impact on the disclosures or the amounts reported in the Group Financial Statements.
Amendments to IAS 7 Disclosure Initiative: Amendments to IAS 12 Recognition of Deferred tax Assets for Unrealised Losses: and Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014 -2016.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted At the date of the annual report, the following standards and interpretations which have not been applied in the report were in issue but not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: IFRS 16 Leases: Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payments Transactions: IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration: and IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and therefore will be effective in the Group financial statements for the year ending 30 June 2019.
The standard establishes a principles-based approach for revenue recognition and is based on the concept of recognising revenue for performance obligations only when they are satisfied and the control of goods or services is transferred.
In doing so, the standard applies a five-step approach to the timing of revenue recognition and applies to all contracts with customers, except those in the scope of other standards.
It replaces the separate models for goods, services and construction contracts under the current accounting standards.
The Group has reviewed the impact of IFRS 15 on a sample of the contracts that it enters into with its customers.
Following this review, we determined that there are no material impacts to the revenue recognised in the results for the year ended 30 June 2018.
Consequently, no restatement will be made to the comparatives presented in this report and no adjustment is required to the reserves.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
The standard is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and therefore will be effective in the Group Financial Statements for the year ending 30 June 2019.
The standard introduces changes to three key areas: new requirements for the classification and measurement of financial instruments: a new impairment model, based on expected credit losses for recognising provisions: and simplified hedge accounting, through closer alignment with an entitys risk management methodology.
The Group has completed an initial assessment of the impact of IFRS 9 and has concluded that adoption will not have a material impact on either the Consolidated Income Statement or the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The Group will apply all aspects of the new standard at the transition date of 1 July 2018, by adjusting opening retained earnings in the balance sheet.
However, a restatement of the comparative periods is not expected.
Genus plc | Annual Report 2018 106 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2018 3.
Significant accounting policies applied in the current reporting period that relate to the Financial Statements as awhole continued IFRS 16 Leases is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and therefore will be effective in the Group Financial Statements for the year ending 30 June 2020.
The Group will transition to IFRS 16 on 1 June 2019.
The standard introduces a comprehensive model for identifying lease arrangements and accounting treatments for both lessors and lessees and will replace the current lease accounting requirements including IAS 17 Leases and the related interpretations.
For lessees, IFRS 16 removes distinctions between operating leases and finance leases.
These are replaced by a model where a right of use asset and a corresponding liability are recognised for all leases except for short-term leases and low value assets.
In contrast to lessee accounting, IFRS 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in IAS 17, andcontinues to require a lessor to classify a lease either as an operating lease or a finance lease.
From the undiscounted lease commitments presented in note 31, we anticipate that implementing the new standard will have asignificant impact on the Groups reported assets and liabilities.
In addition, the implementation of the standard will affect the Consolidated Income Statement and classification of cash flows.
A reliable estimate of the financial impact on the Groups consolidated results depends on a number of unresolved areas, including: choice of transition option, approach to determining discount rates, estimates of lease-term for leases with options to break and renew and conclusion of data collection.
In addition, the financial impact depends on the facts and circumstances at the time of transition.
For these reasons, it is not yet practicable to determine a reliable estimate of the financial impact on the Group.
The Group is currently assessing the impact of the other new pronouncements on its results, financial position and cash flows.
It is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed review has been completed.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In applying the Groups accounting policies, which are described in note 3 or in the specific note the policy relates to, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods, if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Estimates and key sources of estimation uncertainty Determination of the fair value of biological assets note 15 Determining the fair values of our bovine and porcine biological assets requires significant estimates and assumptions.
Below is a list of these significant estimates and assumptions, showing whether we consider them to be observable or unobservable inputs to the fair value determination.
In addition, we identify those inputs that are readily obtainable transactional data or open market prices.
Observable Significant estimates and assumptions Unobservable Bovine Long-term dairy volume growth rate Unobservable n a Short-term dairy volume growth rate Unobservable n a Value at point of production Unobservable n a Unit prices Observable readily obtainable Animals useful lifespan Observable readily obtainable Percentage of volume from dairy bulls to be produced internally Unobservable n a Risk-adjusted discount rate Unobservable n a Porcine Animals useful lifespan Observable readily obtainable general The proportion of animals that go to slaughter Observable readily obtainable The mix of boars and gilts Observable readily obtainable Discount rate Unobservable n a Porcine pure Number of future generations attributable to the current herds Observable readily obtainable line herds Fair value prices achieved on sales Observable open market prices Animals expected useful lifespan and productivity Observable readily obtainable Risk-adjusted discount rate Unobservable n a Genus plc | Annual Report 2018 S TR ATE G I C C OR P OR AT E F I NAN C I AL AD D I T I O final 107 R E P OR T G O V E R NAN C E S TAT EM EN T S IN F OR M AT I ON 4.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued Impairment of Bovine goodwill and related intangible assets note 14 Determining whether bovine goodwill and related intangible assets are impaired requires us to consider any specific impairment indicators and to estimate the value in use of the cash-generating units to which we have allocated goodwill and intangible tangible assets.
The value in use calculation requires us to estimate the future cash flows arising from the cash-generating unit CGU, the appropriate discount rate and the growth rates, in order to calculate present value.
Segmental information IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Group Chief Executive and the Board to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
The Groups operating and reporting structure comprises of three operating segments: Genus PIC, Genus ABS and Research and Development.
These segments are the basis on which the Group reports its segmental information.
The principal activities of each segment are as follows: Genus PIC our global porcine sales business: Genus ABS our global bovine sales business: and Research and Development our global spend on research and development.
A segmental analysis of revenue, operating profit, depreciation, amortisation, non-current asset additions and segment assets and liabilities is provided below.
We do not include our adjusting items in the segments, as we believe these do not reflect the underlying progress of the segments.
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Groups accounting policies, as described in the Financial Statements.

However, in the prior year these assets were included within Bovine Product Development, as the technology had not yet commercialised globally.
Exceptional items of 5.9m expense 2017: 2.5m expense, relate to Genus ABS 5.0m expense, Genus PIC 0.4m expense and our central segment 0.5m expense.

Exceptional items Accounting policy We present exceptional items separately, as we believe it helps to improve the understanding of the Groups underlying performance.
In determining whether an item should be presented as exceptional, we consider items which are material either because of their size or their nature, and those which are non-recurring.
For an item to be considered as exceptional, it must initially meet at least one of the following criteria: it is a one-off material item: it has been directly incurred as the result of either an acquisition, integration or other major restructuring programme: it has been previously classified as an exceptional item, and as such consistent accounting treatment is being applied: or it is unusual in nature e. g. outside the normal course of business.
If an item meets at least one of the criteria, we then exercise judgement as to whether the item should be classified as exceptional.
The tax impact of the exceptional items is disclosed in note 11.

ABS and Inguran, LLC aka Sexing Technologies or STGenetics ST. On 14 July 2014, ABS launched a legal action against ST in the US District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin alleging, among other matters, that ST: i has a monopoly in the processing of sexed bovine semen in the US: and ii unlawfully maintains this monopoly through anticompetitive conduct.
The legal action aimed to remove these barriers and allow free and fair competition in the sexed bovine semen processing market ABS Action.
In parallel with the ABS Action, ABS also filed InterPartes Review applications IPR before the US Patent Office challenging the validity of several of STs group patents, which ST later claimed were infringed by ABS.
Genus plc | Annual Report 2018 110 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2018 7.
Exceptional items continued On 11 January and 15 April 2016, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board PTAB ruled that US Patent No.
7,195,920 the 920 patent and US Patent No.
ST appealed these decisions, and the appeal was heard by a federal court of appeals on 5 December 2017.
On 23 May 2018, the federal court of appeals confirmed that the 920 and 425 patents were unpatentable.
On 14 July 2015 and 2 October 2017, PTAB declined to revoke US Patent No.
8,206,987 the 987 patent and US Patent No.
ABS has appealed the 092 patent decision and the validity of the 987 patent will be considered as part of the ABS Action appeal.
On 31 March 2017, the Court entered a judgment in the ABS Action which confirmed: i the Company and ABS had proved that ST had wilfully maintained a monopoly in the market for sexed bovine semen processing in the US since July 2012, and awarded a permanent injunction against ST which, among other matters, relieved ABS of certain research, marketing and other noncompete restrictions contained in the 2012 semen sorting agreement between the parties: ii STs 987 and 092 patents were valid and infringed: and iii that ABS had materially breached the confidentiality obligations under the 2012 semen sorting agreement.
The Court also confirmed that: i the Company and ABS should pay ST an upfront amount of US$750,000 and an ongoing royalty of US$1.25 per straw on commercialisation of the Genus Sexed Semen technology for the use of STs 987 patent in the US: ii the Company and ABS should pay ST an up-front payment of US$500,000 and an ongoing royalty of US$0.50 per straw for the use of STs 092 patent in the US: iii ABS should pay XY, LLC damages of US$750,000 for the use of certain XY trade secrets: and iv ABS had breached the confidentiality obligations under the 2012 semen sorting agreement.
ABS and the Company appealed the 987 patent and the breach of contract decisions and the appeal hearing was heard on 20 February 2018.
The parties await the Court of Appeals decision.
Damages of US$1,250,000 were paid by ABS to ST shortly after the Courts decision in the ABS Action, and ABS has subsequently amended its technology such that it does not infringe the 092 patent claims.
ABS has informed ST that it does not intend to pay the US$0.50 royalty going forward.
Claims for legal costs and post judgement interest already incurred in connection with the ABS Action have been filed by both parties.
ABS has sought approximately US$5.4m in legal fees and costs already charged to the income statement and ST has sought approximately US$280,000 in legal costs excluding fees.
Both parties await the Courts decision.
On 7 June 2017, ST, XY LLC and Cytonome ST, LLC filed proceedings against ABS, the Company and Premium Genetics UK Limited PG in the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin New Litigation.
The New Litigation alleges that ABS and the Company infringe seven further patents and asserts trade secret and breach of contract claims.
ABS and the Company have filed an Answer and Counterclaim confirming that they do not infringe any valid patent, and alleging among other things that: i ST has breached its 2012 semen sorting agreement with ABS by failing to produce sorted semen that complies with the contractual specifications: and ii ST has obtained certain patents through inequitable conduct.
In addition, ABS has filed six IPRs seeking to revoke the additional patents raised in the New Litigation.
PTAB instituted hearings in relation to two IPRs, refused to institute hearings on two other IPRs, and the parties await a decision on another IPR.
In relation to the final IPR, relating to U. S. Patent No.
7,208,265 265 patent, ST requested an adverse judgment.
ST has subsequently dismissed its 265 patent infringement claim from the New Litigation and ABS has also dismissed its anti-trust and unfair competition counter claims.
ABS filed Motions for Rehearing in relation to the IPRs that were not instituted.
The hearing date for the New Litigation has been set for 1 April 2019, and the Company and ABS intend to pursue vigorously their counterclaims and defend the patent infringement and other claims.
Acquisitions and integration During the year, 1.2m of expenses were incurred, with 0.8m of expenses in relation to acquisitions and integration, principally of Mllevang see note 36.
Other including restructuring Included within Other there is a credit of 0.3m which principally relates to an insurance receipt from a legacy environmental claim.
Pension related During the prior year, National Milk Records plc NMR withdrew from the Mandatory Provident Fund MPF under a Flexible Apportionment Arrangement between NMR, Genus and the Trustees of the MPF.
In return for the right to withdraw from the MPF, NMR made a one-off, lump sum cash payment of 10.1m to the MPF, equivalent to the undiscounted value of all NMRs future payments under the existing MPF recovery plan, which extends to March 2026.
NMR also made a payment to Genus of 4.7m, with 1.4m being satisfied by the issue of NMR shares.
As a result of the NMR withdrawal, Genus recognised in the prior year 5.7m as an exceptional credit in the year ended 30 June 2017, with 4.5m 4.7m payment, net of fees being received directly from NMR, and 1.2m from the MPF pension scheme reflecting the impact of NMR paying undiscounted amounts into the scheme.

Taxation and deferred taxation This note explains how our Group tax charge arises.
The deferred tax section of the note also provides information on our expected future tax charges and sets out the tax assets and liabilities held across the Group, together with our view on whether or not we expect to be able to make use of them in the future.
Accounting policies Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
We recognise tax in the income statement, unless: it relates to items we have recognised directly in equity, in which case we recognise it in equity: or it arises as a fair value adjustment in a business combination.
We provide for current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, at the amounts we expect to pay or recover, using the tax rates and the laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, together with any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is tax we expect to pay or recover due to differences between the carrying amounts of our assets and liabilities in our Financial Statements and the corresponding tax bases used in calculating our taxable profit.
We account for deferred tax using the balance sheet liability method.
We generally recognise deferred tax liabilities for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets to the extent that we will probably have taxable profits to utilise deductible temporary differences against.
We do not recognise these assets and liabilities if the temporary difference arises from: our initial recognition of goodwill: or our initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction other than a business combination that affects neither our taxable profit nor our accounting profit.
We recognise deferred tax liabilities for taxable temporary differences arising on our investments in subsidiaries, and interests in joint ventures and associates, except where we can control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that it will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
We calculate deferred tax at the tax rates we expect to apply in the period when we settle the liability or realise the asset.
We charge or credit deferred tax in the income statement, except when it relates to items we have charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.

Tax is calculated using prevailing tax legislation, reliefs, and existing interpretations and practice.
The effective tax rate of 347.3 % is lower than the UK corporation tax rate of 19% primarily due to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act US Tax Reform, enacted on 22 December 2017, which reduced the US Federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%.
This has resulted in a one-off non-cash tax credit of 32.5m, as a result of the remeasurement of the Groups US deferred tax liabilities in the current period.
The Groups future tax charge and effective tax rate could be affected by factors such as countries reforming their tax legislation to implement the OECDs BEPS recommendations and by European Commission initiatives, including State Aid investigations.
In October 2017, the European Commission announced that it would be conducting a State Aid investigation into the Group Financing Partial Exemption contained within the UKs controlled foreign company CFC legislation.
Similar to other UK-based international companies, the Group may be affected by the final outcome of this investigation.
There is considerable uncertainty as to both the final outcome of this investigation and any corresponding liability, but the Group has calculated that the maximum potential exposure would be 3.3 million if the European Commission were to conclude that the Group Financing Partial Exemption was in contravention of the EUs State Aid rules.
In view of the uncertainty as to the final outcome of this investigation, the Group does not consider that a provision is required at this current time.
The tax credit attributable to exceptional items is 1.6m 2017: credit of 1.5m.

Taxation and deferred taxation continued Unrecognised deferred tax assets and liabilities At the balance sheet date, the Group had unused tax losses which were available for offset against future profits, with a potential tax benefit of 14.5m 2017: 15.6m.
We have recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of 2.2m 2017: 2.4m of these benefits, as we expect these losses to be offset against future profits of the relevant jurisdictions in the near term.
We have not recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of the remaining 12.3m 2017: 13.2m, due to uncertainty about the availability of future taxable profits in the relevant jurisdictions.
At 30 June 2018, the expiry dates of deferred tax assets in respect of losses available for the carry forward were as follows: Expiring within 1-10 years 11-20 years Unlimited Total m m m m Losses for which a deferred tax asset is recognised 0.1 2.1 2.2 Losses for which no deferred tax asset is recognised 12.3 12.3 0.1 14.4 14.5 At 30 June 2017, the expiry dates of deferred tax assets in respect of losses available for the carry forward were as follows: Expiring within 1-10 years 11-20 years Unlimited Total m m m m Losses for which a deferred tax asset is recognised 0.2 2.2 2.4 Losses for which no deferred tax asset is recognised 13.2 13.2 0.2 15.4 15.6 The gross value of losses for which deferred tax assets are recognised is 12.7m 2017: 12.9m.
The gross value of losses for which deferred tax assets are not recognised is 42.3m 2017: 44.9m.
We have not recognised deferred tax liabilities totalling 2.0m 2017: 4.5m for the withholding tax and other taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain overseas subsidiaries.
This is because we can control the timing and reversal of these differences and it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities We have offset deferred tax assets and liabilities above, to the extent that they arise in the same tax jurisdiction.

Intangible assets Our Group Balance Sheet contains significant intangible assets, mainly in relation to goodwill, acquired technology, customer relationships and our IntelliGen previously known as Genus Sexed Semen development project.
Accounting policies Identifiable intangible assets are recognised when the Group controls the asset, it is probable that future economic benefits attributed to the asset will flow to the Group and the cost of the asset can be reliably measured.
Goodwill When we acquire a subsidiary, associate or joint venture, the goodwill arising is the excess of the acquisition cost, excluding transaction costs, over our interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities.
Identifiable assets include intangible assets which could be sold separately or which arise from legal rights, regardless of whether those rights are separable.
We state goodwill at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
We allocate goodwill to CGUs, which are the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
We do not amortise goodwill but we do test it annually for impairment.
IAS 21 requires us to treat the following as assets and liabilities of the acquired entity, rather than of the acquiring entity: goodwill arising on acquisition of a foreign operation: and any fair value adjustments we make on acquisition to the carrying amounts of the acquirees assets and liabilities.
We therefore express them in the foreign operations functional currency and retranslate them at the balance sheet date.

Intangible assets continued Intangible assets Intangible assets that we have acquired in a business combination since 1 April 2005 are identified and recognised separately from goodwill, where they meet the definition of an intangible asset and we can reliably measure their fair values.
Their cost is their fair value at the acquisition date.
After their initial recognition, we report these intangible assets at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
This is the same basis as for intangible assets acquired separately.
The estimated useful lives for intangible assets are as follows: Porcine and bovine genetics technology 20 years Multiplier contracts 15 years Customer relationships 10 to 17 years IntelliGen 10 years Patents and licences term of agreement 4 years Software 2 to 10 years Intangible assets acquired separately We carry intangible assets acquired other than through a business combination at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment loss.
We charge amortisation on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, and review the useful life and amortisation method at the end of each financial year, accounting for the effect of any changes in estimate on a prospective basis.
Impairment We recognise that accounting for intangible assets is an area which includes critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty.
We review the carrying amounts of our tangible and intangible assets at each balance sheet date, to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any indication exists, we estimate the assets recoverable amount.
For goodwill, and tangible and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, we estimate the recoverable amount at each balance sheet date.
The recoverable amount is the greater of their net selling price and value in use.
In assessing value in use, we discount the estimated future cash flows to their present value, using a pre-tax discount rate of 10.4% 2017: 10.7%, which is derived from the Groups weighted average cost of capital WACC.
For some countries we add a premium to this rate, to reflect the risk attributable to that country.
If the asset does not generate largely independent cash inflows, we determine the recoverable amount for the cash-generating units CGUs that the asset belongs to.
We recognise an impairment loss in the income statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.
When we recognise an impairment loss in respect of a CGU, we first allocate it to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to CGUs, and then apply any remaining loss to reduce the carrying amount of the units other assets on a pro rata basis.
Reversals of impairment We reverse an impairment loss in respect of assets other than goodwill when the impairment loss may no longer exist and we have changed the estimates we used to determine the recoverable amount.
We only reverse an impairment loss to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount it would have had, net of depreciation or amortisation, if we had not recognised the impairment loss.

Intangible assets continued Impairment testing for CGUs containing goodwill To test impairment, we allocate goodwill to our CGUs which are in line with our operating segments.
These are the lowest level within the Group at which we monitor goodwill for internal management purposes.
The aggregate carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to each operating segment are as follows: 2018 2017 m m Genus PIC 70.8 72.3 Genus ABS 31.2 32.4 102.0 104.7 We test goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
We determine the recoverable amount of our CGUs by using value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for these calculations relate to discount rates, growth rates, expected changes to selling prices, direct costs and the cost saving derived from the use of IntelliGen technology.
We have estimated the pre-tax discount rate using the Groups WACC.
We risk-adjusted the discount rate for risks specific to each market, adding between nil and 10% to the WACC as appropriate.
The post-tax WACC of 8.0% 2017: 8.0% we applied to our cash flow projections equates to a pre-tax rate of approximately 10.4% 2017: 10.7%.
Our estimates of changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past experience and our expectations of future changes in the market.
The annual impairment test is performed immediately before year end.
It is based on cash flows derived from our most recent financial and strategic plans approved by management.
A growth rate of 2.5% 2017: 2.5% has been used to extrapolate cash flows beyond this period.
Short-term profitability and growth rates are based on past experience, current trading conditions and our expectations of future changes in the market.
The Genus PIC and Genus ABS CGUs are deemed to be significant.
The individual country assumptions used to determine value in use for these CGUs are: Risk premium used to Short-term growth rates adjust discount rate CAGR Long-term growth rates 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 Genus PIC nil-10% nil-14% 6-23% 6-24% 2.5% 2.5% Genus ABS nil-10% nil-14% 8-20% 1-26% 2.5% 2.5% Weighted average Weighted average short-term growth rates risk-adjusted discount rate CAGR 2018 2017 2018 2017 Genus PIC 9% 9% 10% 11% Genus ABS 9% 9% 11% 8% The rates towards the higher end of the range above represent those which are applied to our smaller entities and those in emerging markets and hence appear high relative to others.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions Management has performed sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions with other variables held constant, with other variables simultaneously changed and incorporating the potential impact of the principal risk and uncertainties outlined on pages 12 and 13, in particular the impacts of biosecurity, market downturns, continuity of supply and increased competition taking into account the likely degree of available mitigating actions.
Management has concluded that there are no reasonably possible changes in any one of the key assumptions that would cause the carrying amounts of goodwill to exceed the value in use of PIC and ABS.
Management has identified the following assumptions as key sources of estimation uncertainty within the ABS CGU see note 4.
2018 2017 Sensitivity Weighted average risk-adjusted discount 9% 9% Increase of 1% in the discount rate would decrease rate the recoverable amount by 52.8m Weighted average short-term growth rates 11% 8% Decrease of 1% in the CAGR would decrease the CAGR recoverable amount by 20.5m Long-term growth rate 2.5% 2.5% Decrease of 1% in the long-term growth rate would decrease the recoverable amount by 43.4m Genus plc | Annual Report 2018 122 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2018 15.
Biological assets The Group applies quantitative genetics and biotechnology to animal breeding.
We use these techniques to identify and select animals with the genes responsible for superior milk and meat, high health and performance traits.
We sell breeding animals and semen to customers, who use them to produce offspring which yield greater production efficiency, milk and meat quality, for the global dairy and meat supply chain.
We recognise that accounting for biological assets is an area which includes critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty.
Accounting policies Biological assets and inventories In bovine, we use research and development to identify genetically superior bulls in a number of breeds, primarily the Holstein dairy breed.
Each selected bull has its performance measured against its peers, by using genomic evaluations and progeny testing of its daughters performance.
We collect and freeze semen from the best bulls, to satisfy our customers demand.
Farmers use semen from dairy breeds to breed replacement milking stock.
They use the semen we sell from beef breeds in either specialist beef breeding herds, for multiplying breeding bulls for use in natural service, or on dairy cows to produce animals to be reared for meat.
Our research and development also enables us to produce and select our own genetically superior females from which we will breed future bulls.
We hold our bovine biological assets for long-term internal use and classify them as non-current assets.
We transfer bull semen to inventory at its fair value at the point of harvest, which becomes its deemed cost under IAS 2.
We state our inventories at the lower of this deemed cost and net realisable value.
Sorting semen is a production process rather than a biological process.
As a result, we transfer semen inventory into sexed semen production at its fair value at the point of harvest, less the cost to sell, and it becomes a component of the production process.
We carry sexed semen in finished goods at production cost.
In porcine, we maintain and develop a central breeding stock the nucleus herd, to provide genetically superior animals.
These genetics help make farmers and food processors more profitable, by increasing their output of consistently high-quality products, which yield higher value.
So we can capitalise on our intellectual property, we outsource the vast majority of our pig production to our global multiplier network.
We also sell the offspring or semen we obtain from animals in the nucleus herd to customers for use in commercial farming.
Pig sales generally occur in one of two ways: upfront and royalty.
Under upfront sales, we receive the full fair value of the animal at the point we transfer it to the customer.
Under royalty sales, the pig is regarded as comprising two separately identifiable components: its carcass and its genetic potential.
We receive the initial consideration, which is approximately the animals carcass value, at the point we transfer the pig to the customer.
We retain our interest in the pigs genetic potential and receive royalties for the customers use of this genetic potential.
The breeding animal biological assets we own, and our retained interest in the biological assets we have sold under royalty contracts, are recognised and measured at fair value at each balance sheet date.
We recognise changes in fair value in the income statement, within operating profit for the period.
We classify the porcine biological assets we are using as breeding animals as non-current assets and carry them at fair value.
The porcine biological assets we are holding for resale, which are the offspring of the breeding herd, are carried at fair value and classified as current assets.
In the current year, we have refined certain aspects of our IAS 41 accounting policy, specifically in respect of the balance sheet presentation of our retained interest in the genetics from royalty sales.
Having considered the principles of control as part of our assessment of the impact of adoption of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and applying these to the nature of the asset that corresponds to our retained interest, we have concluded that the most appropriate presentation of these retained interests is as non-current assets.
They continue to be carried at fair value.
In accordance with IAS 8 Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimate and errors, this change in presentation has been applied retrospectively.
The change of 30.1m from current to non-current biological assets does not affect prior year earnings per share or earnings.
Determination of fair values biological assets IAS 41 Agriculture requires us to show the carrying value of biological assets in the Group Balance Sheet.
We determine this carrying value according to IAS 41s provisions and show the net valuation movement in the income statement.
There are important differences in how we value our bovine and porcine assets, as explained below.
Bovine we base the fair value of all bulls on the net cash flows we expect to receive from selling their semen, discounted at a current risk-adjusted market-determined pre-tax rate.
The significant assumptions determining the fair values are the expected future demand for semen, the estimated biological value and the marketable life of bulls.
The biological value is the estimated value at the point of production.
We adjust the fair value of the bovine herd and semen inventory where a third party has a royalty from semen sales from a particular bull.
Females are valued by reference to market prices and published independent genetic evaluations.

Biological assets continued Porcine the fair value of porcine biological assets includes the animals we own entirely and our retained interest in the genetics of animals we have sold under royalty arrangements.
The fair value of animals we own is calculated using the animals average live weights, plus a premium where we believe that their genetics make them saleable.
We base the live weight value and the genetic premium on recent transaction prices we have achieved.
The significant assumptions in determining fair values are the breeding animals expected life, the percentage of production animals that are saleable as breeding animals and the expected sales prices.
For our retained interest in the genetics of animals sold under royalty contracts, we base the initial fair value on the fair values we achieved in recent direct sales of similar animals, less the amount we received upfront for the carcass element.
We then remeasure the fair value of our retained interest at each reporting date.
The significant assumption in determining the fair value of the retained interest is the animals expected life.
We value the pigs in our pure line herds, which are the repository of our proprietary genetics, as a single unit of account.
We do this using a discounted cash flow model, applied to the herds future outputs at current prices.
The significant assumptions we make are the number of future generations attributable to the current herds, the fair value prices we achieve on sales, the animals expected useful lifespan and productivity, and the discount rate.
Non-recognition of porcine multiplier contracts where no contractual interest is retained by the Group To manage commercial risk, a very large part of our porcine business model involves selling pigs to farmers multipliers who produce piglets on farms we neither manage nor control.
We have the option, but not the obligation, to buy the offspring at slaughter market value plus a premium.
Because the offspring have superior genetics, we can then sell them to other farmers at a premium.
We do not recognise the right to purchase offspring on the balance sheet, as we enter into the contracts and continue to hold them for the purpose of receiving non-financial items the offspring, in accordance with our expected purchase requirements.
This means the option is outside the scope of IAS 39.
We do not recognise the offspring as biological assets under IAS 41, as we do not own or control them.

Biological assets continued Bovine biological assets include 6.7m 2017: 6.9m representing the fair value of bulls owned by third parties but managed by the Group, net of expected future payments to such third parties, which are therefore treated as assets held under finance leases.
There were no movements in the carrying value of the bovine biological assets in respect of sales or other changes during the year.
The current market-determined post-tax rate used to discount expected future net cash flows from the sale of bull semen is the Groups weighted risk-adjusted cost of capital.
Decreases due to harvest represent the semen extracted from the biological assets.
Inventories of such semen are shown as biological asset harvest in note 19.
Included in increases due to purchases is the aggregate increase arising during the year on initial recognition of biological assets in respect of multiplier purchases, other than parent gilts, of 47.7m 2017: 87.0m.
Decreases attributable to sales during the year of 194.7m 2017: 197.8m include 71.9m 2017: 66.6m in respect of the reduction in fair value of the retained interest in the genetics of animals, other than parent gilts, transferred under royalty contracts.
Also included is 88.2m 2017: 111.0m relating to the fair value of the retained interest in the genetics in respect of animals, other than parent gilts, sold to customers under royalty contracts in the year.
Total revenue in the year, including parent gilts, includes 157.2m 2017: 159.5m in respect of these contracts, comprising 48.9m 2017: 54.0m on initial transfer of animals to customers and 108.3m 2017: 105.5m in respect of royalties received.
For pure line porcine herds, the net cash flows from the expected output of the herds are discounted at the Groups required rate of return, adjusted for the greater risk implicit in including output from future generations.
This adjusted rate has been assessed as 11.0% 2017: 11.0%.
The number of future generations which have been taken into account is seven 2017: seven and their estimated useful lifespan is 1.4 years 2017: 1.4 years.

Equity accounted investees We hold interests in several joint ventures and associates where we have significant influence.
Accounting policies Joint ventures are entities over whose activities we have joint control, under a contractual agreement.
The Group Financial Statements include the Groups share of profit or loss arising from joint ventures.
Associates are entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
The Group Financial Statements include the Groups share of the total recognised income and expense of associates on an equity accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date it ceases.
When our share of losses exceeds our interest in an associate, we reduce the carrying amount to nil and stop recognising further losses, except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on an associates behalf.
Under the equity method, investments in joint ventures or associates are initially recognised in the Group Balance Sheet at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognised the Groups share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the joint ventures and associates.
Related party transactions with the Groups joint ventures and associates primarily comprise products and services.
As each arrangement is a separate legal entity and control rights are substantially equal with the other parties, no significant judgements are required.
The Groups share of profit after tax in its equity accounted investees for the year was 4.2m 2017: 6.2m.

Provisions A provision is a liability recorded in the balance sheet, where there is uncertainty over the timing or amount that will be paid, and is therefore estimated.
The main provisions we hold relate to contingent deferred consideration and share forfeiture.
Accounting policies We recognise a provision in the balance sheet when an event results in the Group having a current legal or constructive obligation, and it is probable that we will have to settle the obligation through an outflow of economic benefits.

Financial instruments This note details our treasury management and financial risk management objectives and policies, as well as the Groups exposure and sensitivity to credit, liquidity, interest and foreign exchange rate risk, and the policies in place to monitor and manage these risks.
Financial risk management objectives The Groups Corporate Treasury function provides services to the business, coordinates our access to domestic and international financial markets, and monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the Groups operations, through internal risk reports that analyse exposures by degree and magnitude of risks.
These risks include market risk including currency risk, fair value interest rate risk and price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk.
We seek to minimise the effects of these risks by hedging them using derivative financial instruments.
Our use of financial derivatives is governed by policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity.
The Board of Directors regularly reviews our compliance with policies and exposure limits.
The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
Key financial risks and exposures are monitored through a monthly report to the Board of Directors, together with an annual Board review of corporate treasury matters.

Financial instruments continued Financial risk The principal financial risks our activities expose us to are the risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices.
We use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate, foreign currency and commodity price risks, including: forward foreign exchange contracts, to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on the sale of goods and purchase of supplies in foreign currencies: interest rate swaps, to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates: and forward commodity contracts, to hedge commodity price risk.
Accounting policies Financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities, in respect of financial instruments are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the instruments contractual provisions.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.
An equity instrument is any contract that provides a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities and includes no obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets.
The accounting policies adopted for specific financial liabilities and equity instruments are set out below.
Put option arrangements over non-controlling interest The potential cash payments related to put options issued by the Group over the equity of subsidiary companies are accounted for as financial liabilities, when such options may only be settled by exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial asset for a fixed number of shares in the subsidiary.
The amount that may become payable under the option on exercise is initially recognised at present value within borrowings, with a corresponding charge directly to equity.
The charge to equity is recognised separately as written put options over noncontrolling interest, adjacent to non-controlling interest in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries.
Such options are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method, in order to accrete the liability up to the amount payable under the option at the date at which it first becomes exercisable.
The charge arising is recorded as a financing cost.
If the option expires unexercised, the liability is derecognised, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that we would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
The fair values of forward exchange contracts and forward commodity contracts are their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, which is the present value of the quoted forward price.
Cash flow hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as hedging the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, we recognise the effective part of any gain or loss on the instrument directly in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income.
We recognise any ineffective portion of the hedge immediately in the Group Income Statement.
If we hedge a forecast transaction that subsequently results in our recognising a financial asset or liability, we recycle in the Group Income Statement the associated gains and losses that we had recognised in equity.
We do this in the same period or periods that the asset or liability affects the Group Income Statement, which are the periods when we recognise the interest income or expense.
If we expect a hedged forecast transaction to occur but the hedging instrument has expired, been sold, terminated or exercised, or we have revoked the designation of the hedge relationship, then the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and we recognise it in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs.
If we no longer expect the hedged transaction to take place, we immediately recognise in the Group Income Statement the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised inequity.
Net investment hedges Where we have designated a derivative financial instrument as hedging the variability of the net assets of an overseas subsidiary, which arises from the spot or forward exchange rate translation risk associated with the subsidiarys functional currency, we recognise the effective part of any gain or loss on the instrument directly in the hedging reserve.
Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement.
Genus plc | Annual Report 2018 134 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2018 24.
Financial instruments continued When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or we revoke designation of the hedge relationship, thecumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity until we dispose of the investment it relates to.
We only apply net investment hedge accounting in the Group Financial Statements.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that Group entities can continue as going concerns, while maximising the return to shareholders by optimising our debt and equity balance.
The Groups capital structure consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 25, cash and cash equivalents, and equity attributable to equity holders of the Parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings, as disclosed in note 29.
Gearing ratio The Group keeps its capital structure under review and monitors it monthly to ensure the gearing ratio remains below 60%.
TheGroup is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
The gearing ratio at the year end was as follows: 2018 2017 m m Debt see note 25 137.6 138.1 Cash and cash equivalents see note 21 29.1 26.5 Net debt see note 30 108.5 111.6 Equity 419.1 402.1 Net debt to equity ratio 26% 28% Debt is defined as long and short-term borrowings, as detailed in note 25.
Equity includes all capital and reserves of the Group attributable to equity holders of the Parent.
Categories of financial instruments We have categorised financial instruments held at valuation into a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique in accordance with IFRS 13.
The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs Level 3.
If the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, we base the category level on the lowest priority level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument in its entirety.
We have estimated the fair values of the Groups outstanding interest rate swaps by calculating the present value of future cash flows, using appropriate market discount rates, representing Level 2 fair value measurements as defined by IFRS 13.
We have not categorised any financial instruments as Level1 or Level 3.

We manage this risk centrally, by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, using interest rate swaps.
We regularly review our hedging activities, to align with our interest rate views and defined risk appetite, thereby ensuring we apply optimal hedging strategies to minimise the adverse impact of fluctuations in interest expense through different interest rate cycles.
The Groups exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section of this note.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis We have determined the sensitivity analyses below, based on the Groups exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and non-derivative instruments, at the balance sheet date.
For floating rate liabilities, we prepared the analysis assuming the liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
A 1.0% increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management and is our assessment of a significant change in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 1.0% higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit for the year ended 30 June 2018 would have decreased or increased by 0.3m 2017: decrease increase by 0.5m.
This impact is smaller than would otherwise be the case, due to our fixed rate hedging.

Financial instruments continued Interest rate swap contracts Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts, calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
These contracts enable us to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the cash flow exposures on the variable rate debt we hold.
We determine the fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date by discounting the future cash flows, using the yield curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract.
This fair value is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.
Cash flow hedges The following table details the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts outstanding as at the reporting date: Average contract fixed interest rate Notional principal amount Fair value 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 Outstanding receive floating pay fixed contracts % % m m m m USD interest rate swaps Two to five years 1.04 1.10 83.3 84.7 2.3 1.2 GBP interest rate swaps Two to five years 0.73 0.51 35.0 20.0 0.2 0.1 The interest rate swaps settle on a quarterly basis.
The corresponding floating rate on the interest rate swaps is three-month LIBOR.
We settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis.
Interest rate swap contracts that exchange floating rate interest amounts for fixed rate interest amounts are designated as cash flow hedges, to reduce our cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on borrowings.
The interest rate swaps and the interest payments on the loan occur simultaneously and we recognise the amount deferred in equity in profit or loss, over the period that the floating rate interest payments on debt affect profit or loss.
Commodity hedges The Group hedges both feed and slaughter exposures by using the Chicago Mercantile Exchange lean hog, corn and soybean meal commodity futures.

We have a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties.
We regularly monitor our exposure and the credit ratings of our counterparties, and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties.
Credit exposure on financial instruments is controlled by counterparty limits that the Board reviews and approves annually.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas.
We carry out ongoing credit evaluation of the financial condition of accounts receivable.
Liquidity risk management The Board of Directors has ultimate responsibility for managing liquidity risk.
We manage this risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.

Genus plc | Annual Report 2018 140 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2018 26.
Finance lease liabilities A finance lease is a commitment to make a payment in the future, primarily in relation to plant and machinery and motor vehicles.
Accounting policies We classify leases as finance leases whenever the lease terms transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to us.
All other leases are operating leases.
We recognise the assets we hold under finance leases at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each of which we determine at the start of the lease.
We include our corresponding liability in the balance sheet, as a finance lease obligation.
We apportion lease payments between finance charges and a reduction in our lease obligation, so we achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining liability.
We recognise finance charges directly in the income statement, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case we capitalise them in accordance with our general policy on borrowing costs.
Finance lease liabilities are payable as follows: Minimum Minimum lease lease payments Interest Principal payments Interest Principal 2018 2018 2018 2017 2017 2017 m m m m m m Less than one year 1.4 0.1 1.5 1.4 0.1 1.5 Between one and five years 2.1 0.1 2.2 1.8 0.1 1.9 3.5 0.2 3.7 3.2 0.2 3.4 Finance lease liabilities are secured on the assets to which they relate.
There are no other restrictions imposed by the lessor.
The fair value of the leases is approximately equal to the carrying amount.
Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes covering many of its employees.
The principal funds are the Milk Pension Fund and the Dalgety Pension Fund DPF in the UK, which are defined benefit schemes.
The assets of these funds are held separately from the Groups assets and are administered by trustees and managed professionally.
Accounting policies Defined contribution pension schemes A number of our employees are members of defined contribution pension schemes.
We charge contributions to the income statement as they become payable under the scheme rules.
We show differences between the contributions payable and the amount we have paid as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
The schemes assets are held separately from those of the Group.
Defined benefit pension schemes The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes for some of its employees.
These schemes are closed to new members and to further accrual.
We calculate our net obligation separately for each scheme, by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned, in return for their service to date.
We discount that benefit to determine its present value and deduct the fair value of the plans assets at bid price.
The liability discount rate we use is the market yield at the balance sheet date on high-quality corporate bonds, with terms to maturity approximating our pension liabilities.
Qualified actuaries perform the calculations, using the projected unit method.
We recognise actuarial gains and losses in equity in the period in which they occur, through the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Actuarial gains and losses include the difference between the expected and actual return on scheme assets and experience gains and losses on scheme liabilities.
Genus and the other participating employers are jointly and severally liable for the MPFs obligations.
We account for our section of the scheme and our share of any orphan assets and liabilities, and provide for any amounts we believe we will have to pay under our joint and several liability.
The joint and several liability also means we have a contingent liability for the schemes obligations that we have not accounted for.
Under the joint and several liability, we initially recognise any changes in our share of orphan assets and liabilities in the income statement.
After this initial recognition, any actuarial gains and losses on the orphan assets and liabilities are recognised directly in equity through the Group Statement of Changes in Equity, in the period in which they occur.

The defined benefit plans are administered by Trustee boards that are legally separated from the Group.
The Trustee board of each pension fund consists of representatives who are employees, former employees or are independent from the Group.
The boards of the pension funds are required by law to act in the best interest of the plan participants and are responsible for setting certain policies, such as investment and contribution policies, and for the governance of the fund.
The defined benefit pension schemes expose the Group to actuarial risks such as greater than expected longevity of members, lower than expected return on investments and higher than expected inflation, which may increase the plans liabilities or reduce the value of their assets.
UK pensions are regulated by The Pensions Regulator, a non-departmental public body established under the Pensions Act 2004 and sponsored by the Department for Work and Pensions, operating within a legal regulatory framework set by the UK Parliament.
The Pensions Regulator has statutory objectives set out in legislation, which include promoting and improving understanding of the good administration of work-based pensions, protecting member benefits and regulating occupational defined benefit and contribution schemes.
The Pensions Regulators statutory objectives and regulatory powers are described on its website at www.
All defined benefit schemes are registered as an occupational pension plan with HMRC and are subject to UK legislation and oversight from The Pensions Regulator.
UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently and valued at least every three years.
Separate valuations are required for each scheme.
Within 15 months of each valuation date, the plan Trustees and the Group must agree any contributions required to ensure that the plan is fully funded over time, on a suitably prudent measure.
Funding plans are individually agreed with the respective Trustees for each of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes, taking into account local regulatory requirements.
The Milk Pension Fund MPF The MPF was previously operated by the Milk Marketing Board and was also open to staff working for Milk Marque Ltd the principal employer, now known as Community Foods Group Limited, National Milk Records plc, First Milk Ltd, hauliers associated to First Milk Ltd, Dairy Farmers of Britain Ltd which went into receivership in June 2009 and Milk Link Ltd. We have accounted for our section of the scheme and our share of any orphan assets and liabilities, which together represent approximately 86% of the MPF 2017: 85%.
Although the MPF is managed on a sectionalised basis, it is a last man standing scheme, which means that all participating employers are jointly and severally liable for all of the funds liabilities.
With effect from 30 June 2013, Genuss remaining active members ceased accruing benefits in the fund and became deferred pensioners.
The most recent actuarial triennial valuation of the MPF was at 31 March 2015 and was carried out by qualified actuaries.
Thevaluation has been agreed by the Trustees.
The principal actuarial assumptions adopted in the 2015 valuation were that: investment returns on existing assets would exceed fixed interest gilt yields by 1.1% per annum: Consumer Price Index CPI price inflation is expected to be 0.9% per annum lower than Retail Price Index RPI price inflation: and pensions in payment and pensions in deferment would increase in future in line with CPI price inflation, subject to various minimum and maximum increases.
At 31 March 2015, the market value of the funds assets was 403m.
This represented approximately 87% of the value of the uninsured liabilities, which were 465m at that date.

Retirement benefit obligations continued The deficit in the fund as a whole, by reference to the 31 March 2015 valuation, was 62m of which Genuss notional share was 47m.
This shortfall is being addressed by additional contributions from the participating employers.
Under the Trustee prepared schedule of contributions, Genus is required to make deficit repair contributions of 5.6m per annum commencing 31 March 2017, and rising thereafter by 3.4% per annum until 31 August 2022, in addition to funding the schemes operating expenses.
Genus has assessed its additional pension liability under IFRIC 14 by reference to this schedule of contributions, resulting in an amount of 59.5m 2017: 19.6m being recognised in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income.
In the previous year, NMR withdrew from the MPF under a Flexible Apportionment Arrangement between NMR, Genus and the Trustees of the MPF.
As a result of the NMR withdrawal, in the prior year Genus recognised 5.7m as an exceptional credit, with 4.5m 4.7m payment net of fees being received directly from NMR, and 1.2m from the MPF, reflecting the impact of NMR paying undiscounted amounts into the scheme.
Dalgety Pension Fund DPF The most recent actuarial valuation of the DPF was at 31 March 2015 and was carried out by qualified actuaries.
The principal actuarial assumptions adopted in the 2015 valuation were that investment returns on existing assets would be 4.1% per annum before retirement and 2.2% per annum after retirement and that the annual increase in pensions in payment would be 3.3% per annum.
The market value of the available assets at 31 March 2015 was 31.6m.
The value of those assets represented approximately 101% of the value of the uninsured liabilities, which were 31.3m at 31 March 2015.
Under the funding agreement, the Company will not have to make deficit repair contributions.
The disclosures required under IAS 19 have been calculated by an independent actuary, based on accurate calculations carried out as at 31 March 2015 and updated to 30 June 2018.
As at 30 June 2018, the DPF was in an overall net pension asset position of 8.2m.
However, the Group does not have the unilateral right to this surplus and, therefore, in line with IFRIC 14 the recognition of this asset is restricted.
The Trustees of the DPF hold a 20.9m reserve against future unknown liabilities materialising.
As the economic benefit to Genus of this amount is not certain, it is treated as a contingent asset.
In addition to the aggregate assets and liabilities disclosed, a bulk annuity policy was secured with an insurance company in July 1999, which matched the benefit entitlement of almost all of the funds current and deferred pension liabilities at that time.
The value of the policy and related liabilities at 30 June 2018 was 698m 2017: 708m.
Other defined benefit scheme in deficit The Group operates a closed defined benefit scheme for a small number of former employees of the National Pig Development Company Limited.
The total market value of scheme assets and liabilities at 30 June 2018, under the provisions of IAS 19, were 5.2m 2017: 5.2m and 6.3m 2017: 6.7m, respectively.
Other unfunded schemes When the Group acquired Sygen International plc, it also acquired three unfunded defined benefit schemes and an unfunded retirement health benefit plan, which it now operates for the benefit of the previous Groups senior employees and executives.
The scheme liabilities for the three unfunded defined benefit schemes amounted to 7.9m 2017: 8.1m, based on IAS 19s methods and assumptions.
This amount is included within pension liabilities in the Group Balance Sheet.
Interest on pension scheme liabilities amounted to 0.2m 2017: 0.2m.
The principal assumptions used to calculate the scheme liabilities were that the discount rate would be 2.90% 2017: 2.65% and that inflation and pension payment increases would be 3.1% per annum 2017: 3.1%.
The scheme liabilities for the unfunded retirement health benefit plan amounted to 0.7m 2017: 0.9m, based on IAS 19s methods and assumptions.
This amount is included within retirement benefit obligations in the Group Balance Sheet.
Interest on plan liabilities amounted to nil 2017: nil.
The principal assumptions used to calculate the plan liabilities were that the discount rate would be 2.90% 2017: 2.65% and that the long-term rate of medical expense inflation would be 7.1% 2017: 7.1%.

Retirement benefit obligations continued Actuarial assumptions and sensitivity analysis Principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting date expressed as weighted averages : 2018 2017 Discount rate 2.90% 2.65% CPI 1.95% 2.05% RPI 3.05% 3.15% The mortality assumptions used are consistent with those recommended by the schemes actuaries and reflect the latest available tables, adjusted for the experience of the scheme where appropriate.
For 2018, the mortality tables used are 97% of the S2NA tables, with birth year and 2017 CMI projections with a smoothing parameter of Sk 7.5, subject to a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25% for males and females 2017: the mortality tables used are 97% of the S2NA tables, with birth year and 2014 CMI projections, subject to a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25% for males and females.
The following table shows the assumptions used for all schemes and illustrates the life expectancy of an average member retiring at age 65 at the balance sheet date and a member reaching age 65 in 20 years time.
2018 2017 Years Years Retiring at balance sheet date at age 65 Male 22.4 23.0 Female 24.6 25.2 Retiring at age 65 in 20 years time Male 23.8 24.7 Female 26.1 27.0 Duration of benefit obligations The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligations at 30 June 2018 was 17.3 years 2017: 17.4 years.
Sensitivity analysis Measurement of the Groups defined benefit obligation is sensitive to changes in certain key assumptions.
The sensitivity analysis below shows how a reasonably possible increase or decrease in a particular assumption would, in isolation, result in an increase or decrease in the present value of the defined benefit obligation as at 30 June 2018.
Discount rate Rate of inflation Life expectancy Decrease Increase Decrease Increase Decrease Increase by 0.25% by 0.25% by 0.25% by 0.25% by 1 year by 1 year m m m m m m Increase decrease in present value of defined obligation 15.7 14.4 10.7 11.4 17.1 17.1 The sensitivity analysis may not be representative of an actual change in the defined benefit obligation, as it is unlikely that changes in assumptions would occur in isolation from one another.
The sensitivities assume the funds assets remain unchanged.
However, in practice changes in interest rates and inflation will also affect the value of the funds assets.
The funds investment strategy aims to hold matching assets which should move broadly in line with the liabilities of the funds, to protect partially against changes in interest rates and inflation.
This sensitivity analysis has been prepared using the same method adopted when adjusting results of the latest funding valuation to the balance sheet date.
This is the same approach adopted in previous periods.

Share-based payments We have a number of share plans used to award shares to Directors and senior management as part of their remuneration.
Torecord the cost of these, a charge is recognised over the vesting period in the Consolidated Income Statement, based on thefair value of the award on the date of grant.
Accounting policies We recognise the fair value of share awards and options granted as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity.
We measure the fair value at the grant date and spread it over the vesting period of each option.
We use a binomial valuation model to measure the fair value of options and a Black-Scholes valuation model to measure the fair value of share awards.
We adjust the amount we recognise as an expense, to reflect the estimated performance against non-market related conditions and the number of share awards and options that actually vest at the end of the vesting period.
The Group recognised a total share-based payment expense of 5.4m 2017: 4.6m, including National Insurance contributions of 0.8m 2017: 1.0m.
Share awards There were 980,421 conditional share awards outstanding at 30 June 2018.
These conditional shares were awarded to Executive Directors and senior management under the 2014 Performance Share Plan on 20 November 2014, 14 September 2015, 14 September 2016 and 13 September 2017.
In accordance with the plans terms, participants have received a conditional annual award of shares or nil cost option awards which will normally vest after three years, with the proportion of the award vesting depending on growth in the Groups adjusted earnings per share.
Further details of the plans performance conditions are given in the Directors Remuneration Report.
In the year ended 30 June 2018, 336,688 awards were granted on 13 September 2017, with an aggregate fair value of 6,522,000.
The fair value of services received in return for share awards granted is based on the fair value of share awards granted, measured using a Black-Scholes valuation model.
At the date of grant, the fair value of a share awarded was 19.37, based on an expected dividend yield of 1.19%.

Translation reserve The translation reserve comprises all foreign currency differences arising from translating the financial statements of our foreign operations.
The Group uses foreign currency denominated borrowings as a hedge against the translation exposure on the Groups net investment in overseas companies.
Where the hedge is fully effective at hedging the variability in the net assets of such companies caused by changes in exchange rates, the changes in value of the borrowings are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and accumulated in the hedging and translation reserves.
The ineffective part of any change in value caused by changes in exchange rates is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Hedging reserve The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments, net of taxation.

Capital and other commitments At 30 June 2018, outstanding contracted capital expenditure amounted to 1.8m and all related to the purchase of property, plant and equipment 2017: 4.9m.
A software agreement was signed on 23 June 2017, with a minimum five-year term, with an annual cost of 0.8m.
Contingencies and bank guarantees Contingent liabilities are potential future cash outflows, where the likelihood of payments is considered more than remote but is not considered probable or cannot be measured reliably.
The retirement benefit obligations referred to in note 27 include obligations relating to the MPF defined benefit scheme.
Genus, together with other participating employers, is joint and severally liable for the schemes obligations.
Genus has accounted for its section and its share of any orphan assets and liabilities, collectively representing approximately 86% 2017: 85% of the MPF.
As a result of the joint and several liability, Genus has a contingent liability for the schemes obligations that it has not accounted for.
The total deficit of the MPF from the most recent triennial valuation can be found in note 27.
The Groups future tax charge and effective tax rate could be affected by factors such as countries reforming their tax legislation to implement the OECDs BEPS recommendations and by European Commission initiatives including State Aid investigations.
Further information can be found in note 11.
At 30 June 2018, we had entered into bank guarantees totalling 1.0m.
