Financial Statements Notes to the Company Financial Statements C6.
Investment Property Investment property, which is property held to earn rentals, is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Investment property is depreciated over a period of 50 years on a straight line basis, with the exception of freehold land, which is not depreciated.
The Company has not elected to revalue investment property annually but to disclose the fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
An external valuation to determine the fair value is prepared every three years by persons having the appropriate professional experience.
When an external valuation is not prepared, an annual assessment is conducted using internal expertise.
