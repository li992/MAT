Principal Accounting Policies Accounting policies describe the Companys approach to recognising and measuring transactions during the year and the position of the Company at the year end.
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied during the year and the preceding year, unless otherwise stated.
a Basis of Preparation Accounting Standards applied The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts, issued by the Association of Investment Companies in November 2014, and updated in January 2017.
The financial statements are issued on a going concern basis.
As an investment fund the Company has the option, which it has taken, not to present a cash flow statement.
A cash flow statement is not required when an investment fund meets all the following conditions: substantially all investments are highly liquid and are carried at market value, and where a statement of changes in equity in these financial statements it is called the Reconciliation of Movements in Shareholders Funds is provided.
b Foreign Currency and Segmental Reporting i Functional and presentational currency The financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentational currency and the currency in which the Companys share capital and expenses, as well as the majority of its assets and liabilities, are denominated.
ii Transactions and balances Transactions in foreign currencies, whether of a revenue or capital nature, are translated to sterling at the rates of exchange ruling on the dates of such transactions.
Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated to sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Any gains or losses, whether realised or unrealised, are taken to the capital reserve or to the revenue reserve, depending on whether the gain or loss is of a capital or revenue nature.
All gains and losses are recognised in the income statement.
iii Segmental reporting The Directors are of the opinion that the Company is engaged in a single segment of business of investing in equity and debt securities, issued by companies quoted mainly on the UK or other regulated stock exchanges.
c Amounts recognised in Capital Reserves The following are included in the income statement and recognised in capital: realised gains or losses on sales of investments: realised gains or losses on foreign currency and any forward currency contracts: management fees and finance costs allocated to capital: any other capital charges: and unrealised increases or decreases in the valuation of investments at the year end including the related foreign exchange gains and losses.
d Financial Instruments The Company has chosen to apply the provisions of Section 11 and 12 of FRS102 in full in respect of the financial instruments.
i Recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities The Company recognises financial assets and financial liabilities when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Company will offset financial assets and financial liabilities if the Company has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and interests and intends to settle on a net basis.

Principal Accounting Policies continued d Financial Instruments continued ii Derecognition of financial assets The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or it transfers the right to receive the contractual cash flows on the financial asset in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred.
Any interest in the transferred financial asset that is created or retained by the Company is recognised as an asset.
iii Derecognition of financial liabilities The Company derecognises financial liabilities when its obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired.
iv Trade date accounting Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date, being the date on which the Company commits to purchase or sell the assets.
v Classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities Financial assets The Companys investments are classified as held at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value, which is taken to be their cost, with transaction costs expensed in the income statement, and are subsequently valued at fair value.
Fair value for investments that are actively traded in organised financial markets is determined by reference to stock exchange quoted bid prices at the balance sheet date.
For investments that are not actively traded or where active stock exchange quoted bid prices are not available, fair value is determined by reference to a variety of valuation techniques including broker quotes and price modelling.
Where there is no active market, unlisted illiquid investments are valued by the Directors at fair value based on recommendations from Invescos Pricing Committee, which in turn is guided by the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Association Guidelines.
The unlisted investment valuations are reviewed on a quarterly basis or at specific trigger events.
These are evaluated using valuation techniques such as earnings multiples, recent arms length transactions, net assets and milestones attained.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
e Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents may comprise cash including short term deposits which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value as well as cash equivalents, including money market funds.
Investments are regarded as cash equivalents if they meet all of the following criteria: highly liquid investments held in the Companys base currency that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash, are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value and provide a return no greater than the rate of a three-month high quality government bond.
f Derivatives Forward currency contracts may be entered into for hedging purposes and are valued at the appropriate forward exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Profits or losses on the closure or revaluation of positions are recognised in the income statement and included in capital.
44 PIGIT pp35 58. qxp 31 05 2018 10:50 Page 45 FINANCIAL g Income Dividend income arises from equity investments held and is recognised on the date investments are marked ex-dividend.
Special dividends are looked at individually to ascertain the reason behind the payment.
This will determine whether they are treated as income or capital in the income statement.
Deposit interest and underwriting commission receivable are taken into account on an accruals basis.
Interest income arising from fixed income securities is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a debt instrument and of allocating interest income over the relevant period.
h Expenses and Finance Costs Expenses are recognised on an accruals basis and finance costs are recognised using the effective interest method and held at amortised cost.
Investment management fees and finance costs are recognised on an accruals basis and are charged 70% to capital and 30% to revenue.
This is in line with the Boards expected long-term split of returns, in the form of capital gains and income respectively, from the investment portfolio of the Company.
i Taxation The liability for corporation tax is based on net revenue for the year excluding non-taxable dividends.
The tax charge is allocated between the revenue and capital account on the marginal basis whereby revenue expenses are matched first against taxable income in the revenue account.
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred.
Timing differences are differences between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements.
Deferred taxation assets are recognised where, in the opinion of the Directors, it is more likely than not that these amounts will be realised in future periods.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of surplus management expenses and losses on loan relationships, as the Company is unlikely to have sufficient future taxable revenue to offset against these.
j Dividends Dividends are not recognised in the financial statements unless there is an obligation to pay at the balance sheet date.
Dividends are recognised in the year in which they are paid to shareholders.
Income This note shows the income generated from the portfolio investment assets of the Company and income received from any other source.

Tax on ordinary activities As an investment trust the Company pays no tax on capital gains.
The Company also suffers no tax on income arising on UK and certain overseas dividends, mainly EU ones.
As a result, the Companys tax charge arises solely from irrecoverable tax on overseas dividends.
Lastly, this note clarifies the basis for the Company having no deferred tax asset or liability.

Reserves This note explains the different reserves attributable to shareholders.
The aggregate of the reserves and share capital see previous note make up total shareholders funds.
The share premium comprises the net proceeds received by the Company following the issue of shares, after deduction of the nominal amount of 10 pence and any applicable costs.
The share premium is non-distributable.
Capital investment gains and losses are shown in note 9 a and form part of the capital reserve.
The revenue reserve shows the net revenue retained after payment of any dividends.
The capital and revenue reserves are distributable by way of dividend.
Net Asset Value The Companys total net assets total assets less total liabilities are often termed shareholders funds and are converted into net asset value per ordinary share by dividing by the number of shares in issue.
The following shows the shareholders funds and net asset value NAV in pence per share, together with a reconciliation of the NAV with debt at par to NAV with debt at market value.
The difference in the NAV s arises solely from the valuation of the 4.37% senior secured loan notes 2029 Notes.

Risk Management and Financial Instruments Financial instruments comprise the Companys investment portfolio, derivative financial instruments if the Company had any, as well as any cash, borrowings, other receivables and other payables.
This note sets out risks arising from these in terms of the Companys exposure and sensitivity, and any mitigation that the Manager or Board can take.
The Companys strategy for managing investment risk is determined with regard to the Companys Investment Policy, as shown on page 10.
The management of market risk is part of the investment management process.
The Companys portfolio is managed in accordance with the internal controls and risk management systems as described in the sections thereon in the Corporate Governance Statement page 19 and in the Audit Committee Report page 20.
The overall disposition of the Companys assets is reviewed by the Board on a regular basis.
The Companys financial instruments comprise its investment portfolio as shown on pages 15 and 16 cash, borrowings including loan, overdraft and notes, debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations such as sales and purchases awaiting settlement and accrued income.
For the purpose of this note cash should be taken to comprise cash and cash equivalents.
The accounting policies in note 1 include criteria for the recognition and the basis of measurement applied for financial instruments.
Note 1 also includes the basis on which income and expenses arising from financial assets and liabilities are recognised and measured.
52 PIGIT pp35 58. qxp 31 05 2018 10:50 Page 53 FINANCIAL The principal risks that an investment company faces in its portfolio management activities are set out below: Market risk arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument because of changes in market prices.
Market risk comprises three types of risk: currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk: Currency risk arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument because of changes in foreign exchange rates: Interest rate risk arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument because of changes in market interest rates: and Other price risk arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument for reasons other than changes in foreign exchange rates or market interest rates.
Liquidity risk arising from any difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Credit risk arising from financial loss for a company where the other party to a financial instrument fails to discharge an obligation.
Risk Management Policies and Procedures The Directors have delegated to the Manager the responsibility for the day-to-day investment activities of the Company as more fully described in the Business Review.
As an investment trust the Company invests in equities and other investments for the long term so as to meet its investment objective and policies.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction of the profits available for dividends.
The risks applicable to the Company and the policies the Company used to manage these risks for the two years under review follow.
16.1 Market Risk The Companys Manager assesses the Companys direct exposure when making each investment decision, and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
The Board meets at least quarterly to assess risk and review investment performance.
No other derivative or hedging instruments are utilised to manage market risk.
Gearing is used to enhance returns, but this also increases the Companys exposure to market risk and volatility.
1 Currency risk The majority of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in sterling.
There is some exposure to Euros, Swiss francs and US dollars.
Management of the currency risk The Manager monitors the Companys direct exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the board on a regular basis.
Forward currency contracts can be used to reduce the Companys exposure to anticipated future changes in exchange rates which are used also to achieve the portfolio characteristics that assist the Company in meeting its investment objective and policies.
All contracts are limited to currencies and amounts commensurate with the asset denominated in those currencies.
During the year, no forward currency contracts were used by the Company 2017: none.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
The Company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.

Risk Management and Financial Instruments continued 16.1 Market Risk continued 16.1.
1 Currency risk continued Currency exposure The fair values of the Companys monetary items that have currency exposure at 31 March are shown below.
Where the Companys equity investments which are not monetary items are priced in a foreign currency, they have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.
31 MARCH 2018 31 MARCH 2017 SWISS US SWISS US EURO FRANC DOLLAR EURO FRANC DOLLAR 000 000 000 000 000 000 Foreign currency exposure on net monetary items 56 1,037 207 767 5,045 Investments at fair value through profit or loss that are equities 43,222 35,887 55,784 87,871 Total net foreign currency 56 44,259 36,094 56,551 92,916 The above may not be representative of the exposure to risk during the year, because the levels of foreign currency exposure may change significantly throughout the year.
Currency sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year using exchange rates for sterling to Euros, Swiss francs and US dollars.
It is based on the Companys monetary foreign currency financial instruments held at each balance sheet date and takes account of any forward foreign exchange contracts, if used, that offset the effects of changes in currency exchange rates.
The possible change in exchange rates of 2.0% 2017: n a for Euros, 2.6% 2017: 5.1% for Swiss francs and 3.4% 2017: 6.3% for US dollars has been determined based on market volatility in the year, using the standard deviation of sterlings fluctuation to the applicable foreign currency against the mean.
If sterling had strengthened, this would have had the following effect: 31 MARCH 2018 31 MARCH 2017 SWISS US SWISS US EURO FRANC DOLLAR EURO FRANC DOLLAR 000 000 000 000 000 000 Income statement loss after taxation Revenue return 1 34 34 126 125 Capital return 1,124 1,220 2,845 5,821 Total return after taxation for the year 1 1,158 1,254 2,971 5,946 If sterling had weakened against the currencies above, the effect would have been the exact opposite.
In the opinion of the Directors, the above sensitivity analysis is not representative of the year as a whole, since the level of exposure may change frequently as part of the currency risk management process of the Company.
2 Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable on cash deposits and the interest payable on variable rate borrowings.
When the Company has cash balances, they are held on variable rate bank accounts yielding rates of interest dependent on the base rate of the custodian.
At the year end the Company had bank borrowings and senior secured loan notes, details of which are shown in notes 11 and 12.
The Company uses the facilities when required at levels approved and monitored by the Board.
54 PIGIT pp35 58. qxp 31 05 2018 10:50 Page 55 FINANCIAL At the maximum overdraft and loan of 140 million, the effect of a 1% in the interest rate would result in a decrease increase to the Companys income statement of 1.4 million 2017: 1.4 million.
At the previous and current year ends the Company had no investment in, and thus exposure to, any debt securities.
3 Other price risk Other price risks i. e. changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may affect the value of the equity investments, but it is the business of the Manager to manage the portfolio to achieve the best return for an acceptable level of risk.
Management of other price risk The Directors manage the market price risks inherent in the investment portfolio by meeting regularly to monitor on a formal basis the Managers compliance with the Companys stated objectives and policies and to review investment performance.
The Companys portfolio is the result of the Managers investment process and as a result is not correlated with the Companys benchmark or the market in which the Company invests.
The value of the portfolio will not move in line with the market but will move as a result of the performance of the company shares within the portfolio.
If the value of the portfolio rose or fell by 10% at the balance sheet date, the return after tax for the year would increase or decrease by 104.8 million 2017: 116.5 million respectively.
16.2 Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is minimised as the majority of the Companys investments are readily realisable securities which can be sold to meet funding commitments as necessary.
In addition, the 140 million bank overdraft and loan facility provides for additional funding flexibility.

Risk Management and Financial Instruments continued 16.3 Credit risk Encompasses the failure by counterparties to deliver securities which the Company has paid for, or to pay for securities which the Company has delivered.
This risk is minimised by using only approved counterparties.
The Companys ability to operate in the short-term may be adversely affected if the Companys custodian suffers insolvency or other financial difficulties.
However, with the support of the depositarys restitution obligation the risk of outright credit loss on the investment portfolio is remote.
The Board reviews the custodians annual controls report and the Managers management of the relationship with the custodian.
Cash balances are limited to a maximum of 1% of net assets with any one deposit taker, with only approved deposit takers being used.
This limit is at the discretion of the Board and is reviewed on a regular basis.
The maximum credit risk exposure arises from the debtors of 8,486,000 2017: 7,939,000 shown in note 10.
Fair Value The values of the financial assets and financial liabilities are carried in the balance sheet at their fair value investments, or the balance sheet amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value amounts due from brokers, dividends receivable, accrued income, amounts due to brokers, accruals, cash and any drawings on the bank facilities or at amortised cost Notes.
Fair Value Hierarchy Disclosures Nearly all of the Companys portfolio of investments are in the Level 1 category as defined in FRS 102, as amended for fair value hierarchy disclosures March 2016.
The three levels set out in this follow.
Level 1 The unadjusted quoted price in an active market for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable ie developed using market data for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 Inputs are unobservable ie for which market data is unavailable for the asset or liability.
Categorisation within the hierarchy is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of each relevant asset liability.
The valuation techniques used by the Company are explained in the accounting policies note.
One investment is shown in Level 2 as a result of market inactivity: Barclays Bank Nuclear Power Notes 29 February 2019.
The investments in Level 3 are those shown as unquoted investments in the investment portfolio on pages 15 and 16 and are valued on the following basis as described in note 1 v : Valuation techniques used for Level 3 investments 2018 2017 000 000 Earnings multiples 9,776 Recent arm's length transaction 14,544 15,418 Net assets 159 Milestones or expected returns 9,522 13,294 34,001 28,712 56 PIGIT pp35 58. qxp 31 05 2018 10:50 Page 57 FINANCIAL 2018 LEVEL 1 LEVEL 2 LEVEL 3 TOTAL 000 000 000 000 Financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss: Quoted investments equities 1,014,173 1,014,173 Other securities 37 37 Unquoted investments 34,001 34,001 Total for financial assets 1,014,173 37 34,001 1,048,211 2017 LEVEL 1 LEVEL 2 LEVEL 3 TOTAL 000 000 000 000 Financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss: Quoted investments equities 1,136,178 1,136,178 Other securities 13 13 Unquoted investments 28,712 28,712 Total for financial assets 1,136,178 13 28,712 1,164,903 The book cost and market value fair value of the senior secured loan notes based on a comparable quoted debt security at the balance sheet date follows: 2018 2017 BOOK FAIR BOOK FAIR VALUE VALUE VALUE VALUE 000 000 000 000 4.37% senior secured loan notes 2029 60,000 69,572 60,000 71,675 Discount on issue of Notes 474 517 59,526 69,572 59,483 71,675 18.
The Companys total capital employed is managed to achieve the Companys investment objective and policy as set out on page10, including that borrowings may be used to raise equity exposure up to a maximum of 25% of net assets.
At the balance sheet date, net gearing was 13.7% 2017: 15.5%.
The Companys policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from the preceding year.
The main risks to the Companys investments are shown in the Directors Report under the Principal Risks and Uncertainties section on pages 12 to 14.
These also explain that the Company is able to gear and that gearing will amplify the effect on equity of changes in the value of the portfolio.
The Board can also manage the capital structure directly since it has taken the powers, which it is seeking to renew, to issue and buy back shares and it also determines dividend payments.
The Company is subject to externally imposed capital requirements with respect to the obligation and ability to pay dividends by Section 1159 Corporation Tax Act 2010 and by the Companies Act 2006, respectively, and with respect to the availability of the overdraft facility, by the terms imposed by the lender.
The Board regularly monitors, and has complied with, the externally imposed capital requirements.
This is unchanged from the prior year.
Current year borrowings comprise a bank overdraft, bank loan and senior secured notes, details of which are given in notes 11 and 12.
