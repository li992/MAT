Transactions with related parties and Manager The following are considered related parties: the Board of Directors the Board, the Manager and fellow members of BMO.
There are no transactions with the Board other than: aggregated remuneration for services as Directors as disclosed in the Remuneration Report on page 40, and as set out in note 5 on the accounts: and the beneficial interests of the Directors in the ordinary shares and CULS of the Company as disclosed on page 39.
There are no outstanding balances with the Board at the year end.
Transactions between the Company and the Manager are detailed in note 4 on management fees and note 13, where accrued management fees are disclosed.
Going concern The Companys investment objective, strategy and policy are subject to a process of regular Board monitoring and are designed to ensure that the Company is invested mainly in readily realisable, listed securities and that the level of borrowings is restricted.
The Company retains title to all assets held by the Custodian and agreements cover its borrowing facilities.
Cash is held with banks approved and regularly reviewed by the Manager.
The Company has net current liabilities shown on the Balance Sheet but this has no effect on its ability to continue on a going concern basis.
The Directors believe that: the Companys objective and policy continue to be relevant to investors: the Company operates within a robust regulatory environment: and the Company has sufficient resources to continue operating within its stated policy for the 12 month period commencing from the date of this report.
Accordingly, the financial statements have been drawn up on the basis that the Company is a going concern.
Financial Risk Management The Company is an investment company, listed on the London Stock Exchange, and conducts its affairs so as to qualify in the United Kingdom UK as an investment trust under the provisions of section 1158.
In so qualifying, the Company is exempted in the UK from corporation tax on capital gains on its portfolio of fixed asset investments.
The Company invests in smaller companies worldwide in order to secure a high total return.
In pursuing the objective, the Company is exposed to financial risks which could result in a reduction of either or both of the value of the net assets and the profits available for distribution by way of dividend.
These financial risks are principally related to the market currency movements, interest rate changes and security price movements, liquidity and credit.
The Board, together with the Manager, is responsible for the Companys risk management.
The Directors policies and processes for managing the financial risks are set out in a, b and c below.
The accounting policies which govern the reported Balance Sheet carrying values of the underlying financial assets and liabilities, as well as the related income and expenditure, are set out in note 2 on the accounts.
The policies are in compliance with UK accounting standards and include the valuation of financial assets and liabilities at fair value, except as noted in d below.
The Company does not make use of hedge accounting rules.
a Market risks The fair value of equity and other financial securities held in the Companys portfolio fluctuates with changes in market prices.
Prices are themselves affected by movements in currencies and interest rates and by other financial issues, including the market perception of future risks.
The Board sets policies for managing these risks within the Companys objective and meets regularly to review full, timely and relevant information on investment performance and financial results.
The Manager assesses exposure to market risks when making each investment decision and monitors ongoing market risk within the portfolio.
The Companys other assets and liabilities may be denominated in currencies other than sterling and may also be exposed to interest rate risks.
The Manager and the Board regularly monitor these risks.
The Company aims to be fully invested, only holding cash to cater for short-term trading and business requirements.
Borrowings, including CULS, are limited to amounts and currencies commensurate with the portfolios exposure to those currencies, thereby limiting the Companys exposure to future changes in exchange rates.
Gearing may be short or long-term, in sterling and foreign currencies, and enables the Company to take a long-term view of the countries and markets in which it is invested without having to be concerned about short-term volatility.
The Board regularly monitors the effects on net revenue of interest earned on deposits and paid on gearing.
Currency Exposure The principal currencies to which the Company was exposed, and the relevant exchange rates against sterling, are analysed below: 2018 2017 At 30 April Average for At 30 April Average for 2018 the year 2017 the year US dollar 1.3774 1.3421 1.2938 1.3044 Euro 1.1400 1.1358 1.1881 1.1911 68 | F&C Global Smaller Companies PLC OVER OVERVIEW VIEW CHAIRMANS ST CHAIRMANS STA ATEMENT TEMENT STRA STRATEGIC REPOR TEGIC REPORT T GOVERNANCE REPOR GOVERNANCE REPORT T AUDITORS REPOR AUDITORS REPORT T FINANCIAL REPOR FINANCIAL REPORT T NOTICE OF MEETING NOTICE OF MEETING OTHER INFORMA OTHER INFORMATION TION FINANCIAL REPOR FINANCIAL REPORT T 24.
Financial Risk Management continued Based on the financial assets and liabilities held and the exchange rates applying at the balance sheet date, a weakening or strengthening of sterling against each of the principal currencies by 10% would have the following approximate effect on returns attributable to equity shareholders and on the net asset value NAV per share: 2018 2017 US$ US$ Weakening of Sterling by 10% 000s 000s 000s 000s Net revenue return attributable to equity shareholders 324 188 326 158 Net capital return attributable to equity shareholders 42,264 7,388 38,152 7,060 Net total return attributable to equity shareholders 42,588 7,576 38,478 7,218 Net asset value per share basic pence 71.30 12.68 67.35 12.63 2018 2017 US$ US$ Strengthening of Sterling by 10% 000s 000s 000s 000s Net revenue return attributable to equity shareholders 265 154 267 130 Net capital return attributable to equity shareholders 34,580 6,044 31,215 5,777 Net total return attributable to equity shareholders 34,845 6,198 31,482 5,907 Net asset value per share basic pence 58.33 10.38 55.10 10.34 These analyses are presented in sterling and are representative of the Companys activities although the level of the Companys exposure to currencies fluctuates in accordance with the investment and risk management processes.
This level of change is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on observation of current market conditions.
Financial Risk Management continued Interest rate exposure The exposure of the financial assets and liabilities to interest rate movements at 30 April were: Within More than 2018 Within More than 2017 one year one year Net total one year one year Net total 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Exposure to floating rates cash 7,532 7,532 10,061 10,061 Exposure to fixed rates CULS 22,201 22,201 35,647 35,647 Exposure to fixed rates Loans 24,000 24,000 Net exposure 16,468 22,201 38,669 10,061 35,647 25,586 Minimum net exposure during the year 3,267 44,872 41,605 5,530 39,803 34,273 Maximum net exposure during the year 11,180 32,872 21,692 18,605 39,852 21,247 Exposures vary throughout the year as a consequence of changes in the make-up of the net assets of the Company arising out of the investment and risk management processes.
Interest received on cash balances, or paid on bank overdrafts and borrowings, is at ruling market rates.
The interest rate applying on the CULS is set out in note 14 on the accounts.
There were no material holdings in fixed interest investment securities during the year or at the year end.
The Companys total returns and net assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates on cash and borrowings, and to the ability of CULS holders to convert their holdings into ordinary shares.
Based on the financial assets and liabilities held, and the interest rates ruling, at each balance sheet date, a decrease or increase in interest rates of 2% would have the following approximate effects on the income statement revenue and capital returns after tax and on the NAV: 2018 2017 Increase Decrease Increase Decrease in rate in rate in rate in rate 000s 000s 000s 000s Revenue return 151 151 201 201 Capital return Total return 151 151 201 201 NAV per share pence 0.25 0.25 0.35 0.35 The calculations in the table above which are based on the financial assets and liabilities held at each balance sheet date and assume outstanding CULS are unconverted, are not representative of the year as a whole, nor are they reflective of future market conditions.

Financial Risk Management continued Other market risk exposures The Company did not enter into derivative transactions in managing its exposure to other market risks 2017: same.
The portfolio of investments, valued at 868,469,000 at 30 April 2018 2017: 761,269,000 is therefore exposed to market price changes.
The Manager assesses these exposures at the time of making each investment decision.
The Board reviews overall exposures at each meeting against indices and other relevant information.
An analysis of the portfolio by geographical region and major industrial sector is set out on pages 6 and 17 on the accounts.
Based on the portfolio of investments held at each balance sheet date, and assuming other factors remain constant, a decrease or increase in the fair values of the portfolio by 20% would have had the following approximate effects on the net capital return attributable to equity shareholders and on the NAV: 2018 2017 Increase Decrease Increase Decrease in value in value in value in value 000s 000s 000s 000s Capital return 173,694 173,694 152,254 152,254 NAV per share pence 290.79 290.79 266.48 266.48 This level of change is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on observation of current market conditions.
b Liquidity risk exposure The Company is required to raise funds to meet commitments associated with financial instruments and share buybacks.
These funds may be raised either through the realisation of assets or through increased borrowing.
The risk of the Company not having sufficient liquidity at any time is not considered by the Board to be significant, given: the large number of quoted investments held in the Companys portfolio, 185 at 30 April 2018 2017: 194 : the liquid nature of the portfolio of investments: and the industrial and geographical diversity of the portfolio.
Cash balances are held with reputable banks, usually on overnight deposit.
The Company does not normally invest in derivative products.
The Manager reviews liquidity at the time of making each investment decision.
The Board reviews liquidity exposure at each meeting.
The CULS is governed by a trust deed and is convertible in January and July each year at the behest of the holders, with outstanding CULS being redeemed in 2019.
The Board does not consider the repayment of the CULS as a likely short-term liquidity issue.
Financial Risk Management continued The remaining contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at each balance sheet date, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required, were as follows: More than three Three months months but less More than or less than one year one year Total 2018 000s 000s 000s 000s Current liabilities: Creditors 7,412 7,412 Bank loans 18,000 6,000 24,000 Interest payable on loans 60 38 98 CULS 22,201 22,201 Interest payable on CULS 389 389 389 1,167 25,861 6,427 22,590 54,878 More than three Three months months but less More than or less than one year one year Total 2017 000s 000s 000s 000s Current liabilities: Creditors 7,465 7,465 CULS 35,647 35,647 Interest payable on CULS 624 624 1,871 3,119 8,089 624 37,518 46,231 c Credit risk and counterparty exposure The Company is exposed to potential failure by counterparties to deliver securities for which the Company has paid, or to pay for securities which the Company has delivered.
Such transactions must be settled on the basis of delivery against payment except where local market conditions do not permit.
Responsibility for the approval, limit setting and monitoring of counterparties is delegated to the Manager.
Counterparties are selected based on a combination of criteria, including credit rating, balance sheet strength and membership of a relevant regulatory body.
The rate of default in the past has been negligible.
Cash and deposits are held with reputable banks.
The Company has an ongoing contract with its Custodian for the provision of custody services.
The contract was reviewed and updated in 2017.
Details of securities held in custody on behalf of the Company are received and reconciled monthly.
The Custodian has a lien over the securities in the account, enabling it to sell or otherwise realise the securities in satisfaction of charges due under the agreement.
The Depositary has regulatory responsibilities relating to segregation and safekeeping of the Companys financial assets, amongst other duties, as set out in the Directors Report.
The Board has direct access to the Depositary and receives regular reports from it via the Manager.
To the extent that the Manager carries out management and administrative duties or causes similar duties to be carried out by third parties on the Companys behalf, the Company is exposed to counterparty risk.
The Board assesses this risk continuously through regular meetings with the management of F&C including the Lead Manager and with F&Cs Business Risk function.
In reaching its conclusions, the Board also reviews F&Cs annual Audit and Assurance Faculty Report.
The Company had no credit-rated bonds or similar securities or derivatives in its portfolio at the year end 2017: none and does not normally invest in them.
None of the Companys financial liabilities are past their due date or impaired.

Financial Risk Management continued d Fair values of financial assets and liabilities The assets and liabilities of the Company are, in the opinion of the Directors, reflected in the Balance Sheet at fair value, or at a reasonable approximation thereof, except for the CULS, the liability component of which is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate.
The fair value of investments quoted on active markets is determined directly by reference to published price quotations in those markets.
Unquoted investments are valued based on professional assumptions and advice that is not wholly supported by prices from current market transactions or by observable market data.
The Directors make use of recognised valuation techniques and may take account of recent arms length transactions in the same or similar investments.
e Capital risk management The structure of the Companys capital is described in note 15 on page 65 and details of the Companys reserves are shown in the Statement of Changes in Equity on page 53.
The objective of the Company is stated as investing in smaller companies worldwide in order to secure a high total return.
In pursuing this long-term objective, the Board has a responsibility for ensuring the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.
It must therefore maintain an optimal capital structure through varying market conditions.
This involves the ability to: issue and buy back share capital within limits set by the shareholders in general meeting: borrow monies in the short and long term: and pay dividends to shareholders out of current year revenue earnings as well as out of brought forward revenue reserves.
The Companys objectives, policies and procedures for managing capital are unchanged from last year.
There were no breaches by the Company during the year of the financial covenants put in place in respect of the revolving credit facility provided to the Company.
These requirements are unchanged since last year and the Company has complied with them at all times.
Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive AIFMD In accordance with the AIFMD, information in relation to the Companys leverage and the remuneration of the Companys AIFM is required to be made available to investors.
Detailed regulatory disclosures including those on the AIFMs remuneration policy and costs are available on the Companys website or from F&C on request.
The Companys maximum and actual leverage levels at 30 April 2018 are shown below: Gross Commitment Leverage exposure method method Maximum permitted limit 200% 200% Actual 105% 105% The Leverage limits are set by the AIFM and approved by the Board and are in line with the maximum leverage levels permitted in the Companys Articles of Association.
The AIFM is also required to comply with the gearing parameters set by the Board in relation to borrowings.
Securities financing transactions SFT The Company has not, in the year to 30 April 2018 2017: same, participated in any: repurchase transactions: securities lending or borrowing: buy-sell back transactions: margin lending transactions: or total return swap transactions collectively called SFT.
As such, it has no disclosure to make in satisfaction of the EU regulations on transparency of SFT, issued in November 2015.
