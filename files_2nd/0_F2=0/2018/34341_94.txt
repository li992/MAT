Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information Additional disclosures on liquidity and capital resources The Groups cash inflows derive principally from its operating activities.
They are supplemented when required by cash flows from financing activities, typically to support acquisitions.
The principal sources of liquidity for the Group are cash flows generated from the operating business and proceeds from issuances of debt securities described below under capital resources.
The Board reviews and agrees the overall treasury policies and procedures, delegating appropriate oversight to the Finance Director and the treasury function.
The treasury policies include a set of financing principles and key performance indicators.
The Groups treasury position is monitored by a Corporate Finance Committee chaired by the Finance Director.
Treasury operations are subject to periodic independent reviews and audits, both internal and external.
In 2018, 2017 and 2016, all contractual borrowing covenants were met and none are expected to inhibit the Groups operations or funding plans.
Capital expenditure Gross capital expenditures include purchases of property, plant and equipment and purchases of certain intangibles.
The Groups gross capital expenditures for 2018, 2017 and 2016 were 883 million, 862 million and 652 million, respectively, representing investment in the Groups global operational infrastructure including, but not limited to, the manufacturing network, trade marketing and IT systems.
The Group expects gross capital expenditures in 2019 of approximately 872 million, representing the ongoing investment in the Groups operational infrastructure, including the continued investment into PRRPs.
This is expected to be funded by the Groups cash flows and existing facilities.
Hedging instruments As discussed in note 23 in the Notes on the Accounts, the Group hedges its exposure to interest rate movements and currency movements.
BATs cash flow hedges are principally in respect of sales or purchases of inventory and certain debt instruments.
A certain number of forward foreign currency contracts were used to manage the currency profile of external borrowings.
Interest rate swaps have been used to manage the interest rate profile of external borrowings, while cross-currency swaps have been used to manage the currency profile of external borrowings.
Capital resources Policy The Group utilises cash pooling and zero balancing bank account structures in addition to intercompany loans and borrowings to ensure that there is the maximum mobilisation of cash within the Group.
The key objectives of treasury in respect of cash and cash equivalents are to protect the principal value of the Groups cash and cash equivalents, to concentrate cash at the centre to minimise the required long-term debt issuance and to optimise the yield earned.
The amount of debt the Group issues is determined by forecasting the net debt requirement after the mobilisation of cash.
Subsidiary companies are funded by share capital and retained earnings, loans from the central finance companies on commercial terms orthrough local borrowings by the subsidiaries in appropriate currencies.
All contractual borrowing covenants have been met and none areexpected to inhibit the Groups operations or funding plans.

Operating lease obligations represent estimated lease payments primarily related to vehicles, office space, warehouse space and equipment.
See note 28 in the Notes on the Accounts.
Purchase obligations primarily include commitments to acquire tobacco leaf.
Purchase orders for the purchase of other raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table, as the Groups operating subsidiaries are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders typically represent authorisations to purchase rather than binding agreements.
The table above does not include any amounts that the Group may pay to fund its retirement benefit plans as the timing and amount of any such future funding are unknown and dependent on, among other things, the future performance of defined benefit pension plan assets, interest rate assumptions and other factors.
The net retirement benefit scheme liabilities totalled 518 million as of 31 December 2018, which is net of pension assets of 11,925 million.
The Group expects to be required to contribute 168 million to its defined benefit plans during 2019.
