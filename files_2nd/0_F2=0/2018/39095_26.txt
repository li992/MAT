Corporate information The Groups financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018 were approved by the Board of Directors on 30 January 2019 and the Group Balance Sheet was signed on the Boards behalf by the Chairman, Steven Owen.
Primary Health Properties PLC is a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales and domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The Companys Ordinary Shares are admitted to the Official List of the UK Listing Authority, a division of the Financial Conduct Authority, and traded on the London Stock Exchange.
Accounting policies 2.1 Basis of preparation The Groups financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for investment properties, including investment properties under construction and land and derivative financial instruments that have been measured at fair value.
TheGroups financial statements are prepared on the going concern basis see page 69 for further details and presented in Sterling rounded to the nearest million.
Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements for the Group have been prepared under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and applied in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
2.2 Standards adopted during the year The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year, except for the following new and amended IFRSs effective for the Group as of 1 January 2018.
Their adoption has not had any material impact on the disclosures oron the amounts reported in these financial statements: Annual improvements to IFRSs 20142016.
Amendments to: IFRS 1 First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, and IAS 28 Investments in associates and joint ventures Amendments to IAS 40 Investment property IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers IFRIC 22 Foreign currency transactions and advanced consideration IFRS 9 Financial instruments The Group has applied IFRS 9 from 1 January 2018, but will not restate comparatives on initial application.
Directors of the Group have reviewed its financial assets and liabilities and the impact from the adoption of the new standard isas follows: i Classification and measurement IFRS 9 contains three principal classification categories for financial assets: measured at amortised cost, fair value through profit and loss and fair value through other comprehensive income.
The Groups financial assets at 31 December 2018 consist primarily of trade receivables which will continue to be reflected atamortised cost.
"Trade receivables are classified as amortised cost as they meet the test of Solely Payments of Principal andInterest ""SPPI test"" as the Group's model is to collect the contracted cash flows due from tenants."
There was no impact in respect of classification and measurement of financial liabilities under IFRS 9. ii Impairment The new impairment model requires the recognition of impairment provisions based on expected credit losses rather than only on incurred losses as was the case under IAS 39.
It is therefore no longer necessary for a credit event to have occurred before credit losses are recognised.
"IFRS 9 requires a simplified approach for measuring the loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses ""ECLs"" for trade receivables without a significant financing component."

Accounting policies continued 2.2 Standards adopted during the year continued IFRS 9 Financial instruments continued ii Impairment continued The main area of focus to the Group is considered to be impairment provisioning of trade receivables.
Gross trade receivables held at 31 December 2018 were 3.0 million 2017: 2.3 million with an impairment provision recognised under IAS 39 of nil 2017: 0.1 million.
The credit risk associated with unpaid rent is deemed low.
We have performed an assessment of the impact of impairment losses recognised for trade receivables under IFRS9 at31December 2018 through estimating the expected credit loss based on actual credit loss experienced over the past threeyears and taking into consideration future expected losses.
Based on this assessment, there was no material impact ofimpairment lossesrecognised under IFRS 9.
The impact of non-substantial debt modifications has been reviewed and there is no material impact on the financial statements at transition.
iii Hedge accounting On initial application of IFRS 9, an entity may choose, as its accounting policy, to continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 instead of the hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9.
The Group will continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39.
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers The Group has applied IFRS 15 from 1 January 2018 and will adopt the modified retrospective approach without restatement ofcomparatives.
The new standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognised when control of a good or service transfers to a customer.
The majority of the Groups income is from tenant leases and there is no material impact on rental income as a result of adopting the new standard.
The main impact of IFRS 15 has been to show service charge income gross within rental income and service charge expense gross within direct property expenses.
The cumulative effect before initial application of the standard is nil.
2.3 Summary of significant accounting policies Basis of consolidation The Groups financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Primary Health Properties PLC and its wholly owned subsidiary undertakings.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtained control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.
Control comprises the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee so as to obtain benefit from its activities and is achieved through direct or indirect ownership of voting rights: currently exercisable or convertible potential voting rights: or by way of contractual agreement.
The financial statements of the subsidiary undertakings are prepared for the accounting reference period ending 31 December each year using consistent accounting policies.
All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from them, are eliminated on consolidation.
The individual financial statements of Primary Health Properties PLC and each of its subsidiary undertakings will be prepared under UK GAAP, the Board having chosen to adopt FRS 101 for the current year.
The use of IFRS at Group level does not affect thedistributable reserves available to the Group.
Segmental reporting The Directors are of the opinion that the Group is engaged in a single segment of business, being investment property in the United Kingdom and Ireland leased principally to GPs, government healthcare organisations and other associated healthcare users.
Foreign currency transactions Each Group company presents its individual financial statements in its functional currency.
The functional currency of all UK subsidiaries with the exception of PHP Euro Private Placement Limited which is Euro is Sterling and the functional currency ofPrimary Health Properties ICAV and its Irish domiciled subsidiaries is Euro.
Transactions in currencies other than an individual entitys functional currency foreign currencies are recognised at the applicable exchange rate ruling on the transaction date.
Exchange differences resulting from settling these transactions, or from retranslating monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, are included in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Primary Health Properties PLC Annual Report 2018 83 Notes to the financial statements continued 2.
Accounting policies continued 2.3 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Foreign operations In preparing the Groups consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of foreign entities are translated into Sterling at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
The income, expenses and cash flows of a foreign entity are translated at the average exchange rate for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during the period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used.
The exchange rates used to translate foreign currency amounts in 2018 are as follows: Group Balance Sheet: 1 1.1126 2017: 1.1262.
Group Statement of Comprehensive Income: 1 1.1301 2017: 1.1413.
Investment properties and investment properties under construction The Groups investment properties are held for long term investment.
Investment properties and those under construction are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties and investment properties under construction are stated at fair value based on market data and a professional valuation made as of each reporting date.
The fair value of investment property does not reflect future capital expenditure that will improve or enhance the property and does not reflect future benefits from this future expenditure.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment properties and investment properties under construction are included in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year in which they arise.
Investment properties are recognised on acquisition upon completion of contract, which is when control of the asset passes to the Group.
Investment properties cease to be recognised when control of the property passes to the purchaser, which is upon completion of the sales contract.
Any gains and losses arising are recognised in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income inthe year of disposal.
The Group may enter into a forward funding agreement with third-party developers in respect of certain properties under development.
In accordance with these agreements, the Group will make monthly stage payments to the developer based on certified works on site at that time.
Interest is charged to the developer on all stage payments made during the construction period and on the cost of the land acquired by the Group at the outset of the development and taken to the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year in which it accrues.
Property acquisitions and business combinations Where a property is acquired through the acquisition of corporate interests, the Board considers the substance of the assets andactivities of the acquired entity in determining whether the acquisition represents the acquisition of a business.
The basis ofthe judgement is set out in Note 2.3 b.
Where such acquisitions are not judged to be an acquisition of a business, they are not treated as business combinations.
Rather, the cost to acquire the corporate entity is allocated between the identifiable assets and liabilities of the entity based on their relative fair values on the acquisition date.
Accordingly, no goodwill or additional deferred taxation arises.
Gains on sale of properties Gains on sale of properties are recognised on the completion of the contract, and are calculated by reference to the carrying value at the end of the previous reporting period, adjusted for subsequent capital expenditure and sale costs.
Net rental income Rental income arising from operating leases on investment properties is accounted for on a straight line basis over the lease term.
An adjustment to rental income is recognised from the rent review date of each lease in relation to unsettled rent reviews.
Such adjustments are accrued at 100% 2017: 100% of the additional rental income that is expected to result from the review.
Forleases which contain fixed or minimum deemed uplifts, the rental income is recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Incentives for lessees to enter into lease agreements are spread evenly over the lease terms, even if the payments are not made on such a basis.
Rental income is measured at the fair value of the consideration receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, VAT and other sales taxes or duty.
Net rental income is the rental income receivable in the period after payment of direct property costs.
The Group has applied IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers from 1 January 2018.
The comparatives have not been restated as the transitional provisions within the standard have been used to retrospectively apply the cumulative nil effect before initial application of the standard being recognised at the date of initial application.
84 Primary Health Properties PLC Annual Report 2018 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Further information 2.
Accounting policies continued 2.3 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Interest income Revenue is recognised as interest accrues, using the effective interest method that is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.
Financial instruments under IFRS 9 Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised and carried at amortised cost as the Groups business model is to collect the contractual cash flows due from tenants.
Provision is made based on the expected credit loss model which reflects on the Groups historical credit loss experience over the past three years but also reflects the lifetime expected credit loss.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash and short term deposits, including any bank overdrafts, with an original maturity ofthree months or less, measured at amortised cost.
Trade and other payables Trade payables are recognised and carried at their invoiced value inclusive of any VAT that may be applicable.
Bank loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially measured at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, allinterest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.
The interest due within the next twelve months is accrued at the end of the year and presented as a current liability within trade and other payables.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs that are separately identifiable and directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the respective assets.
All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they occur.
Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs the Group incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.
Convertible bond The convertible bond is designated as at fair value through profit or loss and so is presented on the Group Balance Sheet at fair value with all gains and losses, including the write-off of issuance costs, recognised in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The fair value of the convertible bond is assessed in accordance with level 1 valuation techniques as set out within Fair value measurements within these accounting policies.
The interest charge in respect of the coupon rate on the bond has been recognised within the underlying component of net financing costs on an accruals basis.
Refer to Note 16 for further details.
The amount of the change in fair value of the financial liability designated at fair value through profit or loss that is attributable to changes in credit risk will be recognised in other comprehensive income.
This is different to IAS 39 accounting treatment where the entire change in fair value of the financial liability is recognised in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Financial instruments under IAS 39 Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling in the near term.
This category includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Group that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedging relationships as defined by IAS 39.
Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Other loans and payables Other loans and payables are non-derivative financial liabilities.
Such liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised inthe Group Statement of Comprehensive Income when the loans andpayables are fide-recognised or impaired.
Primary Health Properties PLC Annual Report 2018 85 Notes to the financial statements continued 2.
Accounting policies continued 2.3 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Financial instruments under IAS 39 continued Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income when the loans and receivables are fide-recognised or impaired.
fide-recognition of financial assets and liabilities Financial assets A financial asset or where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets is fide-recognised where: the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired: the Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material delay to a third party under a pass-through arrangement: the Group has transferred its right to receive cash flows from the asset and either a has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset: or b has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset: or when the cash flows are significantly modified.
Where the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset and has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the asset, the asset is recognised to the extent of the Groups continuing involvement in the asset.
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to repay.
Financial liabilities A financial liability is fide-recognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms ofan existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a fide-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in profit or loss.
When the exchange or modification of an existing financial liability is not accounted for as an extinguishment, any costs or fees incurred adjust the liabilitys carrying amount and are amortised over the modified liabilitys remaining term and any difference in the carrying amount after modification is recognised as a modification gain or loss.
Tax Taxation on the profit or loss for the period not exempt under UK-REIT regulations comprises current.
Taxation is recognised in theGroup Statement of Comprehensive Income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised as direct movements inequity, in which case it is also recognised as a direct movement in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on any non-REIT taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Fair value measurements The Group measures certain financial instruments such as derivatives, and non-financial assets such as investment property, at fair value at the end of each reporting period.
Also, fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed in the financial statements.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: in the principal market for the asset or liability: or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
86 Primary Health Properties PLC Annual Report 2018 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Further information 2.
Accounting policies continued 2.3 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Fair value measurements continued The Group must be able to access the principal or the most advantageous market at the measurement date.
The fair value of an asset or liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participants ability to generate economic benefits using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.
The Group uses valuation techniques at three levels that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data is available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level 1: Quoted unadjusted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly orindirectly observable.
Level 3: Valuation techniques for which the lowest input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by reassessing categorisation at the end of each reporting period.
Hedge accounting At the inception of a transaction the Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the hedging instrument meets the criteria of IAS 39 for being described as highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
i Derivative financial instruments derivatives The Group uses interest rate swaps to help manage its interest rate risk.
All interest rate derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
The fair values of the Groups interest rate swaps are calculated by JCRA, an independent specialist which provides treasury management services to the Group.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as an effective hedging instrument: where a derivative is designated as a hedge of the variability of a highly probable forecast transaction, such as an interest payment, the element of the gain or loss on the derivative that is an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity.
When the forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, the associated gains or losses that were recognised directly in the cash flow hedging reserve are reclassified into the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income in the same period or periods during which the asset acquired or liability assumed affects the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, i. e. when interest income or expense is recognised: and the gain or loss on derivatives that do not meet the strict criteria for being effective and so do not qualify for hedge accounting and the non-qualifying element of derivatives that do qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income immediately.
The treatment does not alter the fact that the derivatives are economic hedges of the underlying transaction.
For swaps that have been cancelled which previously qualified for hedge accounting, the remaining value within the cash flow hedging reserve at the date of cancellation is recycled to the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis from the date of cancellation to the original swap expiry date where the hedged transaction is still expected to occur.
If the swaps have been cancelled and the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the amount accumulated in the hedging reserve is reclassified to profit and loss immediately.
Primary Health Properties PLC Annual Report 2018 87 Notes to the financial statements continued 2.
Accounting policies continued 2.3 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Leases Group as a lessor The vast majority of the Groups properties are leased out under operating leases and are included within investment properties.
Rental income, including the effect of lease incentives, is recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Where the Group transfers substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset, the arrangement is classified as a finance lease and a receivable is recognised for the initial direct costs of the lease and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Finance income is recognised in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income so as to achieve a constant rate of return on the remaining net investment in the lease.
Interest income on finance leases is restricted to the amount of interest actually received.
2.4 Significant accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of the Group financial statements requires management to make a number of estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and may differ from future actual results.
The estimates and judgements thatare considered most critical and that have a significant inherent risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are: a Estimates Fair value of investment properties Investment properties include i completed investment properties, and ii investment properties under construction.
Completedinvestment properties comprise real estate held by the Group or leased by the Group under a finance lease inordertoearn rental income or for capital appreciation, or both.
The fair market value of a property is deemed by the independent property valuer appointed by the Group to be the estimated amount for which a property should exchange, on the date of valuation, in an arms length transaction.
Properties have been valued on an individual basis, assuming that they will be sold individually over time.
Allowances are made to reflect the purchasers costs of professional fees and stamp duty and tax.
In accordance with RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards, factors taken into account are current market conditions, annual rentals, state of repair, ground stability, contamination issues and fire, health and safety legislation.
Refer to Note 10 of the financial statements which includes further information on the fair value assumptions and sensitivities.
In determining the fair value of investment properties under construction the valuer is required to consider the significant risks which are relevant to the development process including, but not limited to, construction and letting risks.
The valuer takes into account any pre-lets and whether construction risk remains with the respective developer or contractor.
Fair value of derivatives In accordance with IFRS 9, the Group values its derivative financial instruments at fair value.
Fair value is estimated by JCRA on behalf of the Group, using a number of assumptions based upon market rates and discounted future cash flows.
The derivative financial instruments have been valued by reference to the mid-price of the yield curve prevailing on 31 December 2018.
Fair value represents the net present value of the difference between the cash flows produced by the contracted rate and the valuation rate.
Refer to Note 18 of the financial statements.
b Judgements Hedge effectiveness The Group has a number of interest rate swaps that mature after the Groups bank facilities, to which they relate, are due to expire.
In accordance with IAS 39, in order to apply hedge accounting in relation to these interest rate swaps, the Group has determined that it is highly probable that these bank facilities will be renegotiated on or before expiry and that variable interest rate debt finance will be in place until the expiry date of the swaps.
88 Primary Health Properties PLC Annual Report 2018 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Further information 2.
Accounting policies continued 2.4 Significant accounting estimates and judgements continued b Judgements continued Property acquisitions during the year The Directors have reviewed the acquisitions during the year on an individual basis in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 3 R. They consider that they all meet the criteria of asset acquisitions rather than business combinations and have accounted for them as such.
Although corporate entities were acquired, they were special purpose vehicles for holding properties rather than separate business entities.
This judgement was made due to the absence of business processes inherent in the entities acquired.
2.5 Standards issued but not yet effective At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the Group has not applied the following new and revised IFRSs that have been issued but are not yet effective and in some cases have not yet been adopted by the EU: IFRS 16 Leases Annual improvements to IFRSs 20152017 cycle Long term interests in associates and joint ventures A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, but are not yet applicable to the Group and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements.
None of these are expected to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group, except for the following set out below: IFRS 16 Leases establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases, with the objective ofensuring that lessees and lessors provide relevant information that faithfully represents those transactions.
The standard specifies how entities reporting in accordance with IFRSs will recognise, measure, present and disclose leases.
The standard provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is twelve months or less or the underlying asset has a low value.
Lessors continue to classify leases as operating or finance, with IFRS 16s approach to lessor accounting substantially unchanged from its predecessor, IAS 17 Leases.
The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and earlier application is permitted if IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers has also been applied.
As IFRS 16 does not apply to assets that meet the definition of investment property, the impact on the Group is not material.
For long leasehold properties where PHP is the lessee, the impact is expected to be immaterial in relation to ground rents.
Rental and related income Revenue comprises rental income receivable on property investments in the UK and Ireland, which is exclusive of VAT.
Revenue is derived from one reportable operating segment and 73.7 million and 5.7 million of annualised rental income is derived from the UK and Ireland respectively.
Details of the lease income are given below.
Group as a lessor a The future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases receivable by the Group are as follows: Less than One to More than one year five years five years Total m m m m 2018 78.1 307.1 627.6 1,012.8 2017 72.1 286.5 593.3 951.9 b The rental income earned on operating leases is recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term.
The Group leases medical centres to GPs, NHS organisations, the HSE in Ireland, and other healthcare users, typically on long term occupational leases which provide for regular reviews of rent on an effectively upwards-only basis.

A reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 20% to 19% was effective from 1 April 2017.
Accordingly, these rates have been applied in the measurement of the Groups tax liability at 31 December 2018. b Factors affecting the tax credit for the year The tax assessed for the year is lower than 2017: lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK.

c Basis of taxation The Group elected to be treated as a UK REIT with effect from 1 January 2007.
The UK REIT rules exempt the profits of the Groups property rental business from corporation tax.
Gains on properties are also exempt from tax, provided they are not held for trading or sold in the three years post completion of development.
The Group will otherwise be subject to corporation tax at 19% 2017: 19.25%.
Acquired companies are effectively converted to UK REIT status from the date on which they become a member of the Group.
As a UK REIT, the Company is required to pay Property Income Distributions PIDs equal to at least 90% of the Groups rental profit calculated by reference to tax rules rather than accounting standards.
To remain as a UK REIT there are a number of conditions to be met in respect of the principal company of the Group, the Groups qualifying activities and the balance of its business.
The Group remains compliant as at 31 December 2018.

In accordance with IAS 33 Earnings per share the Company is required to assess and disclose the dilutive impact of the contingently issuable shares within the convertible bond.
The impact is not recognised where it is anti-dilutive.
The dilutive impact to basic EPS of convertible bonds is represented by the accrued bond coupon which has been included in the results of the year ended 31 December 2018.
The number of dilutive shares is calculated as if the contingently issuable shares within the convertible bond had been in issue for the period from issuance of the bonds to 31 December 2018.

Investment properties and investment properties under construction Properties have been independently valued at fair value by Lambert Smith Hampton UK LSH Chartered Surveyors and Valuers, as at the balance sheet date in accordance with IAS 40 Investment property.
LSH confirms that it has valued the properties inaccordance with the Practice Statements in the RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards Red Book.
There were no changes tothe valuation techniques during the year.
The valuers are appropriately qualified and have sufficient market knowledge and relevant experience of the location and category of investment property and have had full regard to market evidence when determining the values.
The valuations reflected a 4.85% net initial yield 2017: 4.91% and a 4.99% 2017: 5.09% true equivalent yield.
Where properties have outstanding rent reviews, an estimate is made of the likely rent on review in line withmarket expectations and the knowledge of the valuer.
In accordance with IAS 40, investment properties under construction have also been valued at fair value by LSH.
In determining the fair value, the valuer is required to value development property as if complete, deduct the costs remaining to be paid to complete the development and consider the significant risks which are relevant to the development process including, but not limited to, construction and letting risks and the impact they may have on fair value.
In the case of the Groups portfolio under construction, where the sites are pre-let and construction risk remains with the builder developer, the valuer has deemed that the residual risk to the Group is minimal.
As required by the Red Book, LSH has deducted the outstanding cost to the Group through to the completion of construction of 16.0 million 2017: 5.7 million in arriving at the fair value to be included in the financial statements.
A fair value increase of nil million 2017: 0.4 million in respect of investment property under construction has been recognised in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, as part of the total net valuation gain on property portfolio in the year of 36.0 million 2017: 64.5 million.
Of the 1,502.9 million valuation, 1,419.9 million 94% relates to investment properties in the UK and 83.0 million 6% relates to investment properties in Ireland.
In line with accounting policies, the Group has treated the acquisitions during the year as asset purchases rather than business combinations as they were judged to be acquisitions of properties rather than businesses.

Fair value hierarchy All of the Groups properties are level 3, as defined by IFRS 13, in the fair value hierarchy as at 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017.
There were no transfers between levels during the year or during 2017.
Level 3 inputs used in valuing the properties are those which are unobservable, as opposed to level 1 inputs from quoted prices and level 2 observable inputs either directly, i. e. as prices, or indirectly, i. e. derived from prices.
Valuation techniques used to derive level 3 fair values The valuations have been prepared on the basis of fair market value FMV which is defined in the RICS Valuation Standards as: The estimated amount for which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arms length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.
Valuation techniques: market comparable method Under the market comparable method or market comparable approach, a propertys fair value is estimated based on comparable transactions and using certain unobservable inputs.
These inputs are detailed below.
Unobservable input: estimated rental value ERV The rent at which space could be let in the market conditions prevailing at the date of valuation.
2018 2017 ERV range of the portfolio 32,3071,273,630 32,3071,225,071 per annum per annum Unobservable input: equivalent yield The equivalent yield is defined as the internal rate of return of the cash flow from the property, assuming a rise to ERV at the next review date, but with no further rental growth.
2018 2017 True equivalent yield range of the portfolio 3.84%7.54% 4.31%7.61% Unobservable input: physical condition of the property The properties are physically inspected by the valuer on a three-year rotating basis.
Primary Health Properties PLC Annual Report 2018 95 Notes to the financial statements continued 10.
Investment properties and investment properties under construction continued Unobservable input: rental growth The estimated average increase in rent based on both market estimations and contractual situations.
Sensitivity of measurement of significant unobservable inputs A decrease in the estimated annual rent will decrease the fair value.
A decrease in the equivalent yield will increase the fair value.
A deterioration in the physical condition of the property will decrease the fair value.
An increase in the rental growth will increase the fair value.

Financial risk management In pursuing its investment objectives, the Group is exposed to a variety of risks that could impact net assets or distributable profits.
The Groups principal financial liabilities, other than interest rate swaps, are loans and borrowings hedged by these swaps.
The main purpose of the Groups loans and borrowings is to finance the acquisition and development of the Groups property portfolio.
The Group has trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and cash and short term deposits that arise directly from its operations.
A review of the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing and monitoring risk is set out in the Strategic Review.
Thisnote provides further detail on financial risk management and includes quantitative information on specific financial risks.
Financial risk factors a Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
The Groups exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Groups long term debt obligations with floating rates as the Group, generally, does not hold significant cash balances, with short term borrowings being used when required.
To manage its interest rate risk, the Group enters into interest rate swaps, in which the Group agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon principal amount.
Note 17 provides details of interest swap contracts in effect at the year end.
The sensitivity analysis below shows the impact on profit before tax and equity of reasonably possible movements in interest rates with all other variables held constant.
It should be noted that the impact of movement in the interest rate variable is not necessarily linear.
The fair value is arrived at with reference to the difference between the contracted rate of a swap and the market rate for the remaining duration at the time the valuation is performed.
As market rates increase and this difference reduces, the associated fair value also decreases.

The Group is exposed to credit risk from its principal financial assets being cash and cash equivalents, and trade and other receivables see Note 12.
Trade receivables Trade receivables, primarily tenant rentals, are recognised and carried at amortised cost and presented in the balance sheet net ofallowances for doubtful receivables and are monitored on a case-by-case basis.
Impairment losses are recognised through the expected credit loss model.
Credit risk is primarily managed by requiring tenants to pay rentals in advance.
The Group has policies in place to ensure that rental contracts are entered into only with lessees with an appropriate credit history, but the Group does not monitor the credit quality of receivables on an ongoing basis.
Banks and financial institutions One of the principal credit risks of the Group arises from financial derivative instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions.
The Board of Directors believes that the credit risk on short term deposits and interest rate swaps is limited because the counterparties are banks, which are committed lenders to the Group, with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
Primary Health Properties PLC Annual Report 2018 103 Notes to the financial statements continued 18.
Financial risk management continued Financial risk factors continued c Liquidity risk The liquidity risk is that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities as the majority of the Groups assets are property investments and are therefore not readily realisable.
The Groups objective is to maintain a mixture of available cash and committed bank facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for its operations and to fund its committed capital expenditure.

Details of the covenants are given below under e Capital risk management and are disclosed to the facility providers on a quarterly basis.
There have been no breaches during the year 2017: none.
d Market risk Market risk is the risk that fair values of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
The Board ofDirectors has identified two elements of market risk that principally affect the Group interest rate risk and price risk.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is outlined above.
The Board, with the assistance of the Adviser, assesses the exposure to other price risks when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis through a discounted cash flow analysis.
Details of this analysis can be found in the Strategic Review in the Annual Report.
Price risk The Group is exposed to price risk in respect of property price risk including property rentals risk.
The Group has no significant exposure to price risk in respect of financial instruments other than the convertible bond and interest rate derivatives see also Note 17, as it does not hold any equity securities or commodities.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate fair values: the fair values of the Groups cash and cash equivalents and trade payables and receivables are not materially different from those at which they are carried in the financial statements due to the short term nature of these instruments: the fair value of floating rate borrowings is estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates currently available for instruments with similar terms and remaining maturities.
The fair value approximates their carrying values, gross of unamortised transaction costs: the fair value of fixed rate debt is estimated using the mid yield to maturity on the reporting date.
The valuations are on a clean basis, which exclude accrued interest from the previous settlement date to the reporting date: and the fair values of the derivative interest rate swap contracts are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using market interest rates and yield curves over the remaining term of the instrument.
Fair value hierarchy The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method.
The different levels are defined as follows: Level 1: Quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: Techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.

The interest rate swaps whose fair values include the use of level 2 inputs are valued by discounting expected future cash flows using market interest rates and yield curves over the remaining term of the instrument.
The following inputs are used in arriving at the valuation: interest rates: yield curves: swaption volatility: observable credit spreads: credit default swap curve: and observable market data.

Financial risk management continued Financial risk factors continued e Capital risk management The primary objectives of the Groups capital management are to ensure that it remains a going concern, operates within its quantitative banking covenants and meets the criteria so as to continue to qualify for UK REIT status.
The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders equity and net borrowings.
The type and maturity of the Groups borrowings are analysed further in Notes 15 and 16 and the Groups equity is analysed into its various components in the Group Statement of Changes in Equity.
The Board, with the assistance of the Adviser, monitors and reviews the Groups capital so as to promote the long term success of the business, to facilitate expansion and to maintain sustainable returns for shareholders.
Under several of its debt facilities, the Group is subject to a covenant whereby consolidated Group rental income must exceed Group borrowing costs by the ratio 1.3:1 2017: 1.3:1.
No debt facility has a Group loan to value covenant.
Facility level covenants also operate with regard to specific pools of property assets provided to lenders to secure individual loan facilities.
UK REIT compliance tests include loan to property value and gearing tests.
The Group must satisfy these tests in order to continue trading as a UK REIT.
This is also an internal requirement imposed by the Articles of Association.
During the period the Group has complied with all of the requirements set out above.

It represents the share premium on the issue of the shares, net of expenses, from issues effected by way of a cash box mechanism.
A cash box raising is a mechanism for structuring a capital raising whereby the cash proceeds from investors are invested in asubsidiary company of the parent instead of the parent itself.
Use of a cash box mechanism has enabled the share premium arising from the issue of shares to be deemed to be a distributable reserve and has therefore been shown as a special reserve inthese financial statements.
Any issue costs are also deducted from the special reserve.
As the special reserve is a distributable reserve, the dividends distributed in the period have been distributed from this reserve.

As detailed in Note 8, the Company assesses the dilutive impact of the unsecured convertible bond on its net asset value per share.
With an initial conversion price of 97.5 pence 390 pence upon issue, restated to reflect the Companys four-for-one share sub-division undertaken in November 2015 and in October 2018 restated in accordance with the dividend protection rules and triggered by the Ordinary Shares trading ex-dividend, the unsecured convertible bond issued by the Group on 20 May 2014 isanti-dilutive to all measures of net asset value per share.

Capital commitments As at 31 December 2018, the Group has entered into a forward funding development agreement with a third party for the development of a primary healthcare development in Ireland.
The Group has acquired the land and advances funds to the developer as the construction progresses.
Total consideration of 16.0 million plus VAT remains to be funded with regard to this property.
At 31 December 2017 the Group had entered into a development agreement with a third party for the purchase of a primary healthcare development.
At 31 December 2017, total consideration of 4.2 million plus VAT remained to be funded with regard tothis property.
As at 31 December 2018, the Group has capital commitments totalling nil 2017: 1.5 million plus VAT being the cost to complete asset management projects on site.
Contingent liabilities An independent expert has been appointed to adjudicate on whether an adjustment to the conversion price of the convertible bond should have been made in respect of the open offer element of the equity raises in both 2016 and 2018.
If the independent expert determines an adjustment should have been made then approximately 450,000 additional ordinary shares of 12.5p will need to be issued to bond holders who have converted to date and a further 140,000 could potentially be issued over and above current bondholders entitlement, at the holders option to convert.
The results of the independent experts findings are due to be received shortly.
Related party transactions The terms and conditions of the Advisory Agreement are described in the Directors Report and the Directors Remuneration Report.
Nexus, the Adviser, is a related party due to the Managing Director being a shareholder and Director of Nexus.
Details of the amounts paid in relation to related party transactions are provided in Note 4.
Subsequent events 0n 24 January 2019 the Boards of the Company and MedicX jointly announced a proposed all-share merger to create a leading primary healthcare REIT in the UK with a portfolio of over 470 assets valued at 2.3 billion.
