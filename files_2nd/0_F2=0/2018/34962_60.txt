Financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements continued 31 December 2018 24 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS On 12 November 2018, the Board resolved to dispose of First Camp Svergie Holdings AB and on 19 January 2019 contracts were exchanged with a view to a sale in early 2019.
The operations of the First Camp sub-group, therefore, have been classified as a disposal group held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5, Non Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, and presented separately on the Group balance sheet as discontinued operations.
The proceeds of disposal are expected to be less than the book value of the related net assets and accordingly an impairment loss has been recognised on the re-classification of these operations as held for sale.
