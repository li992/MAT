Financial instruments risk management Financial risk management The Companys activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including foreign exchange and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The responsibility for monitoring the effectiveness of risk management is carried out by the Audit and Risk Committee on behalf of the Board of Directors.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices principally exchange rates and interest rates will affect the Companys income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
Foreign exchange risk The Company has no direct significant interaction with foreign currency.
Members of the Group in which the Company holds its investment operate in continental Europe, which means that through its investment the Company has some indirect exposure to foreign exchange risk.
Interest rate risk The Company has no external debt and therefore has no significant exposure to interest rate risk.
The intercompany loans within trade and other payables are at a floating interest rate.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss in the Company if a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally through receivables from Group companies and cash balances.
Cash and cash equivalents are held with reputable institutions.
All material cash amounts are deposited with one of the Groups principal bank service providers in the UK.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Companys approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Companys reputation.
The Company currently meets all liabilities from cash reserves and intercompany loans.
The Companys liability for operating expenses is monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure cash resources are adequate to meet liabilities as they fall due.
The Companys trade and other payables in the current and prior year are all due to be settled within one year and the contractual total due equals the carrying amount.
Capital risk management The aim of the Company is to maintain sufficient funds to enable it to make suitable investments and incremental acquisitions whilst minimising recourse to bankers and or shareholders.
Fair values The fair values of all financial instruments in both years are equal to their carrying values.
