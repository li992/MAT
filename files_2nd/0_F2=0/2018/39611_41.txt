All audit-related and other services are approved by the Group Audit Committee and are subject to strict controls to ensure the external auditors independence is unaffected by the provision of other services.
The Group Audit Committee recognises that for certain assignments the auditors are best placed to perform the work economically: for other work the Group selects the supplier best placed to meet its requirements.
The Groups auditors are permitted to tender for such work in competition with other firms where the work is permissible under audit independence rules.
