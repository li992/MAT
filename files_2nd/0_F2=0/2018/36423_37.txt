Greencoat UK Wind PLC Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2018 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2018 14.
Contingencies and commitments At the time of acquisition, wind farms which had less than 12 months operational data may have had a wind energy true-up applied, whereby the purchase price for these wind farms may be adjusted so that it is based on a 2 year operational record, once the operational data has become available.
The following 2 wind energy true-ups remain outstanding and the maximum adjustment under each are as follows: Clyde Extension 4,747,094: and Corriegarth 9,069,293.
The Board and the Investment Manager are of the opinion that the estimate of the energy yield utilised at acquisition for the remaining assets is the most appropriate unbiased estimate of the yield following 2 years operational data.
Any variances of actual energy production from the date of acquisition to the date of signing this report are attributable to weather uctuations and other short term operational factors rather than more fundamental factors that might inuence the long term assessment.
Therefore it is not appropriate to recognise an asset or liability in respect of these acquisitions.
