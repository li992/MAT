This is disclosed in the ABS column above Portfolio management Group sponsored entities : For the purposes of portfolio management, the Group purchased credit protection via synthetic credit default swaps from note-issuing structured entities.
The referenced assets remain on the Groups balance sheet as they are not assigned to these structured entities.
The Group continues to own or hold all of the risks and returns relating to these assets.
The credit protection obtained from the regulatory-compliant securitisation only serves to protect the Group against losses upon the occurrence of eligible credit events and the underlying assets are not derecognised from the Groups balance sheet.
