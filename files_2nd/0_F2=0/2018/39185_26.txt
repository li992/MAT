The address of the registered office is Millennium Bridge House, 2 Lambeth Hill, London EC4V 4AJ.
The Company was, until 25 June 2018, a wholly owned subsidiary of Old Mutual plc, a FTSE 100 listed group.
The Company formed part of the Old Mutual Wealth division of Old Mutual plc, for which it acted as a holding company and delivered strategic and governance oversight.
On 25 June 2018, Quilter plc was listed on the London and the Johannesburg Stock Exchanges and is no longer part of the Old Mutual plc group.
2: Basis of preparation The financial statements of Quilter plc for the year ended 31 December 2018 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as endorsed by the European Union EU, and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to those reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for common control transactions which are stated at cost less impairments in accordance with IAS 27, and have been prepared in pounds sterling.
The accounting policies adopted are the same as those set out in Note 1 of the Group financial statements.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its own income statement in these financial statements.
Going concern The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The Board has reviewed the Companys projections for the next 12 months and beyond including cash flow forecasts.
As a result, the Board has a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least 12 months from the date of approving these statements.
3: Capital and financial risk management The material risks faced by the Company are described below.
3 a : Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of adverse movements in credit spreads relative to the reference yield curve, credit ratings or default rates leading to a deterioration in the level or volatility of assets, liabilities or financial instruments resulting in loss of earnings or reduced solvency.
This includes counterparty default risk, migration risk and spread risk.
3 b : Market risk Market risk is defined as the risk that a change in the value of the Companys income from any asset is not matched by an equal change in the value of therelated liability.
Market risk arises from fluctuations in variables such as equity prices, property prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates, where assets and liabilities are not precisely matched.
The Company is subject to material market risk in the following area: 3 b i : Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is defined as the risk of a deviation of the actual interest rates from the expected interest rates, resulting in the potential for anegative impact on earnings or capital and or reduced solvency.
An exposure exists as a result of two intercompany loans see notes 5 and 10 that are linked to an underlying variable interest rate, LIBOR, and so the value of these interest payments will vary if the underlying interest rate changes.
The Company also has a subordinated debt and a loan to TA Associates see notes 5 and 10 that have fixed interest rates, where the present value of these loans would vary in the event of a change in interest rates.
The Company monitors the impact of interest rate changes on its financial position, with the risk managed in line with its Market Risk Policy.
3 c : Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that cash may not be available to pay obligations when due at a reasonable cost.
The Company manages liquidity by maintaining adequate liquidity resources and banking facilities, continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
The Company maintains and manages its local liquidity requirements according to its business needs, within the overall liquidity framework established by the Company.
Financial statements | Notes to the financial statements of the Company Quilter Annual Report 2018 191 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements of the Company continued For the year ended 31 December 2018 3: Capital and financial risk management continued 3 d : Sensitivity tests Sensitivity analysis has been performed by applying the following parameters to the statement of financial position and income statement asatthe reporting date.
Interest rate sensitivity The impact of an increase and decrease in market interest rate of 1% e. g. if the current interest rate is 5% the test allows for the effects of animmediate change to 4% and 6% is assessed.
A decrease in interest rate of 1% would have decreased profit and shareholders equity by 3 million 2017: decrease 1 million after tax: anequal change in the opposite direction would have increased profit by 4 million 2017: increase 1 million after tax.
4: Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost, less impairment in value.

2018 investment in subsidiary undertaking in relation to share-based payments Quilter plc grants rights to its equity instruments to employees of its subsidiaries under various share-based payment arrangements.
In so doing, the subsidiaries receive services from employees that are paid for by Quilter plc, thereby increasing the investment that Quilter plc holds in those subsidiaries.
Quilter plc recognises the equity-settled share-based payment in equity, with a corresponding increase in its investment in the subsidiaries.
The amount recognised as an additional investment is based on the grant-date fair value of the share-based payment, and is recognised by Quilter plc over the vesting period of the share-based payments.
During 2018 the Company increased its investments in subsidiaries in relation to share-based payments as listed below: Old Mutual Wealth Business Services Limited 17 million Quilter Cheviot Limited 12 million Intrinsic Financial Services Limited 2 million Quilter Investors Limited 2 million Other subsidiaries 2 million Total investments in subsidiaries 35 million 2018 acquisition of subsidiaries The Skandia UK Limited group of entities was acquired from Old Mutual plc on 31 January 2018 and comprises seven entities with net asset value of 591 million.

During 2008, the then Skandia Group underwent a reorganisation whereby the Company acquired 100% of the shares in Old Mutual Wealth Holdings Limited, a subsidiary undertaking and itself the parent of a number of significant trading entities within the Group.
Consideration forthe transaction was the issue of new shares at fair value.
This transaction gave rise to a merger reserve of 1,662 million in the statement offinancial position, being the difference between the nominal value of new shares issued by the Company for the acquisition of the shares ofthesubsidiary and the aggregate fair value of that subsidiary company and of its subsidiaries.
2018 Merger reserve On 31 January 2018, the Company acquired the Skandia UK Limited group of entities from its then parent company Old Mutual plc.
This comprised of seven Old Mutual plc group entities with a net asset value of 591 million.
The transfer was effected by the issue of one share with the balance giving rise to an increase in the merger reserve of 591 million in the statement of financial position, being the difference between the nominal value of the share issued by the Company for the acquisition of the shares of the subsidiaries and the subsidiaries net asset value.
