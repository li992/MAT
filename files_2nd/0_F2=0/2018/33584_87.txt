Financial statements FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GROUP STRUCTURE 35.
RELATED UNDERTAKINGS OF THE GROUP The Group consists of the Parent Company, Anglo American plc, incorporated in the United Kingdom and its subsidiaries, joint operations, joint ventures andassociates.
In accordance with Section 409 of the Companies Act 2006 a full list of related undertakings, the country of incorporation and the effective percentage of equity owned as at 31 December 2018 is disclosed below.
Unless otherwise disclosed all entities with an indirect equity holding of greater than51% are considered subsidiary undertakings.
See note 34 for the Groups principal subsidiaries, joint operations, joint ventures andassociates.
As disclosed in the Groups published tax strategy the Group does not use tax haven jurisdictions to manage taxes.
There remain a small number of undertakings in the Group which are registered in tax haven jurisdictions.
These are the result of legacy undertakings and are overridden by the Groups policyof having them be either resident in the UK for tax purposes or subject to the UK Controlled Foreign Company Rules.
The Group is well advanced in our strategy to remove these legacy undertakings from tax haven jurisdictions.
Where the tax residency of a related undertaking is different from its country of incorporation, this is referenced in the notes to the list below.
