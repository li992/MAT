Performance Share Plan This plan is the Groups current Long-Term Incentive Plan.
Awards of Performance Shares to executive directors and other selected executives and senior managers are subject to performance conditions.
These consist of the Groups underlying return on tangible equity: relative total shareholder return: and business scorecard business review scorecard targets over a three year performance period.
Typically awards vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant to the extent that the performance conditions have been met.
The Remuneration Committee may also make conditional awards of Restricted Shares to other executives and senior managers, which are not subject to performance conditions.
Additionally, the Remuneration Committee may defer a portion of an individuals gross bonus into an award over shares referred to for the purpose of the plan as Deferred Bonus Shares, which are also not subject to performance conditions.
If an employee resigns from the Group, then Performance Shares and Restricted Shares lapse at the date of leaving the Group.
Deferred Bonus Share awards are generally retained by the employee to whom the award was granted if they leave the Group, unless the employee is dismissed for cause.
Awards retained will vest on the normal vesting date.
However, the Remuneration Committee has the discretion to modify the treatment of leavers share awards that have yet to be released, based on the leaving circumstances, where this is appropriate and in shareholders interests.
Further information can be found in the Directors Remuneration Report within the Corporate Governance section.
