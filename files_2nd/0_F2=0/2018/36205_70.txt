Indefinite life brands comprise a portfolio of Consumer Healthcare products primarily acquired with the acquisitions of Sterling Winthrop, Inc. in 1994, Block Drug Company, Inc. in 2001, CNS, Inc. in 2006 and the Novartis Consumer Healthcare business in 2015, together with a number of pharmaceutical brands from the acquisition of Stiefel Laboratories, Inc. in 2009.
The book values of the major brands are as follows: 2018 2017 m m Voltaren 2,735 2,716 Otrivin 1,385 1,380 Fenistil 651 648 Theraflu 449 441 Panadol 388 386 Sensodyne 265 265 Lamisil 293 289 Breathe Right 262 236 Stiefel trade name 236 228 Excedrin 193 185 Physiogel 150 166 Polident 112 112 Others 1,613 1,686 8,732 8,738 Each of these brands is considered to have an indefinite life, given the strength and durability of the brand and the level of marketing support.
The brands are in relatively similar stable and profitable market sectors, with similar risk profiles, and their size, diversification and market shares mean that the risk of market-related factors causing a reduction in the lives of the brands is considered to be relatively low.
The Group is not aware of any material legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors which could limit their useful lives.
Accordingly, they are not amortised.
Each brand is tested annually for impairment and other amortised intangible assets are tested when indicators of impairment arise.
This testing applies a fair value less costs of disposal methodology, generally using post-tax cash flow forecasts with a terminal value calculation and a discount rate equal to the Group post-tax WACC of 7%, adjusted where appropriate for specific segment, country and currency risks.
This valuation methodology uses significant inputs which are not based on observable market data, and therefore this valuation technique is classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
The main assumptions include future sales price and volume growth, product contribution, the future expenditure required to maintain the products marketability and registration in the relevant jurisdictions and exchange rates.
These assumptions are based on past experience and are reviewed as part of managements budgeting and strategic planning cycle for changes in market conditions and sales erosion through competition.
The terminal growth rates applied of between nil% and 3% are managements estimates of future long-term average growth rates of the relevant markets.
In each case the valuations indicate sufficient headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions is unlikely to result in an impairment of these intangible assets.
