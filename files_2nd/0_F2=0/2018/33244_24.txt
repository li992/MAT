Shareholder register enquiries All administrative enquiries relating to shareholders such as queries concerning holdings, dividend payments, notification of change of address, loss of certificate or requests to be placed on a mailing list should be addressed to the Companys Registrar: Shareholder Solutions, Link AssetServices, The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, BR3 4TU.

Payment of dividends The best way to ensure that dividends are received as quickly as possible is to instruct the Companys Registrar, whose address is given above, to pay them directly into a bank account: tax vouchers are then mailed to shareholders separately.
This method also avoids the risk of dividend cheques being delayed or lost in the post.
The Company also operates a Dividend Re-investment Plan to allow shareholders to use their cash dividends to buy shares easily and at a low cost via the Companys Registrar from whom the necessary forms are available.

Beware of Share Fraud Investment scams are designed to look like genuine investment opportunities.
You might have been contacted by fraudsters if you have been contacted out of the blue, promised tempting returns and told the investment is safe, called repeatedly or told the offer is only available for a limited time.
Shareholders may receive unsolicited phone calls or correspondence concerning investment matters that imply a connection to the Company.
These may be from overseas based brokers who target UK shareholders offering to sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high risk shares.
Shareholders may also be advised that there is an imminent offer for the Company, and the caller may offer to buy shares at significantly above the market price if an administration fee is paid.
Shareholders should treat all such approaches with caution.
You can find more information about investment scams at the Financial Conduct Authority FCA website: www.

The Net Asset Value, or NAV, per Ordinary Share is calculated by dividing this amount by the total number of Ordinary Shares in issue.
Gearing represents the amount by which total investments exceed Shareholders Funds, expressed as a percentage of Shareholders Funds.
If stockmarkets rise, gearing can increase the Companys returns, but, if they fall, losses will be greater.
If the amount calculated is a negative percentage then total investments are less than Shareholders Funds.
Glossary of Alternative Performance Measures Net Asset Value per OrdinaryShare Total Return represents the theoretical return on NAV per Ordinary Share, assuming that dividends paid to shareholders were reinvested at the NAV per Ordinary Share at the close of business on the day the shares were quoted ex dividend see note 16 on page 49.
Share Price Total Return represents the theoretical return to a shareholder, on a closing market price basis, assuming that all dividends received were reinvested, without transaction costs, into the Ordinary Shares of the Company at the close of business on the day the shares were quoted ex dividend.
The share price as at 31 December 2018 was 1,138.00p 2017: 1326.00p and dividends, which went ex dividend during the year see note 8 on page 47 were 35.95p 2017: 30.55p.
The effect of reinvesting these dividends on the respective ex-dividend dates amounted to 31.91p 2017: 34.11p.
The share price total return was therefore -11.8% 2017: 22.6%, being the percentage derived from the closing share price, plus the reinvestment dividend figure, divided by the closing share price at the previous year end.
Discount is the amount by which the stockmarket price per Ordinary Share is lower than the Net Asset Value, or NAV, per Ordinary Share.
The discount is normally expressed as a percentage of the NAV per Ordinary Share.
The opposite of a discount is a premium.
Benchmark Total Return is the return on the benchmark, on a closing market price basis, assuming that all dividends received were reinvested into the shares of the underlying companies at the time their shares were quoted ex dividend.
Further information on the Companys benchmark, the Numis Smaller Companies Index excluding Investment Companies, can be found on page 4.
Performance Attribution is an analysis of how the Company achieved its performance relative to its benchmark.
Sector and stock selection measures the effect of investing in sectors and securities to a greater or lesser extent than their weighting in the benchmark.
Active share ratio is calculated by summing the absolute differences between a portfolios weight in a stock and an indexs weight in a stock for all the stocks in the portfolio or index.
The total is then divided by two to give a ratio between 0% and 100%.
Active Share is addressed in How Active Is Your Fund Manager?
Antti Petajisto and Martijn Cremers, Yale School of Management, 2009.
Ongoing Charges represent the total cost of investment management fees and other operating expenses of 10,814,000 2017: 10,391,000, as disclosed in the Income Statement, as a percentage of the average published net asset value 1,366,495,000 2017: 1,363,794,000 over the period, and are calculated in accordance with the guidelines issued by the AIC.
Leverage, for the purposes of the AIFM Directive, is any method which increases the Companys exposure to stockmarkets whether through borrowings, derivatives or any other means.
It is expressed as a ratio of the Companys exposure to its NAV.
In summary, the gross method measures the Companys exposure before applying hedging or netting arrangements.
The commitment method allows certain hedging or netting arrangements to be offset.
ASCoT has no hedging or netting arrangements.
Portfolio Turnover is calculated by dividing the lesser of purchases and sales over one year by the average portfolio value for that year.
