The Company is the parent and the ultimate parent of the Group.
The address of its registered office is Buildings 1 & 2 Trident Place, Mosquito Way, Hatfield, Hertfordshire, AL10 9UL.
The financial statements comprise the results of the Company, its subsidiaries and the Groups interest in a jointly controlled entity hereafter the Group.
The Financial Period represents the 52 weeks ended 2 December 2018.
The prior financial period represents the 53 weeks ended 3 December 2017.
The principal activities of the Group are described in the Strategic Report on pages 14 to 57.
1.2 Basis of Preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Listing Rules and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules of the UK Financial Conduct Authority where applicable, International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretation Committee IFRIC interpretations as endorsed by the European Union IFRS-EU, and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The accounting policies applied are consistent with those described in the Annual Report and Financial Statements for the 53 weeks ended 3 December 2017 of Ocado Group plc, with the exception of the early adoption of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and Clarifications to IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, rounded to the nearest hundred thousand unless otherwise stated.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of financial asset investments and certain financial assets and liabilities, which are held at fair value.
The Directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements of the Group.
New standards, amendments and interpretations issued that are effective for the current year In the current year, the Group has early adopted IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers as several Ocado Solutions contracts were signed during the year which are impacted by the adoption of IFRS 15.
The adoption has had a material impact on the disclosures and amounts reported in these financial statements.
See note 1.5 for further information.
The Group has also considered the following new standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards that are effective for the Group for the financial year beginning 4 December 2017 and concluded that they are either not relevant to the Group or that they would not have a significant impact on the Groups financial statements other than disclosures: Effective Date Various Amendments to various IFRSs and IASs including those arising from the IASBs annual improvements project 1 January 2017 IAS 7 Statement of cash flows amendments 1 January 2017 IAS 12 Income taxes amendments 1 January 2017 New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet adopted by the Group The following further new standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards and interpretations which are relevant to the Group have been issued but are not effective for the financial year beginning 4 December 2017 and have not been adopted early: Effective Date IFRS 2 Share-based payments amendments 1 January 2018 IFRS 9 Financial instruments 1 January 2018 IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019 IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements amendments Deferred IAS 28 Investments in associates and joint ventures amendments Deferred IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration 1 January 2018 IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments 1 January 2019 Various Amendments to various IFRSs and IASs including those arising from the IASBs annual improvements project Various The following new standards are not yet effective and the impact on the Group is currently under review: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, published in July 2014, replaces the existing guidance in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
IFRS 9 includes revised guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments, including a new expected credit loss model for calculating impairment on financial assets and the new general hedge accounting requirements.
It also carries forward the guidance on recognition and derecognition of financial instruments from IAS 39.
The Group is assessing the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements resulting from the application of IFRS 9.
Our review of IFRS 9 has indicated that the impact of this new standard on the Groups results is not anticipated to be material.
IFRS 16 Leases provides guidance on the classification, recognition and measurement of leases to help provide useful information to the users of financial statements.
The main aim of this standard is to ensure all leases will be reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, irrespective of substance over form.
The new standard will replace IAS 17 Leases and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 unless adopted early.
IFRS 16 is expected to have a significant impact on the amounts recognised in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
On adoption of IFRS 16 the Group will recognise within the balance sheet a right of use asset and lease liability for all applicable leases.
Within the income statement, rent expense will be replaced by depreciation and interest expense.
This will result in a decrease in operating expenses and an increase in finance costs with no net impact.

The Groups ongoing review of IFRS 16 indicates that the financial impact will result in an increase in finance leased assets of approximately 278 million, and a corresponding increase in financial liabilities of 297 million, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet based on the current portfolio at the year end.
1.3 Basis of Consolidation The consolidated Group financial statements consist of the financial statements of the Company, all entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries and the Groups share of its interests in joint ventures.
Subsidiaries The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which power over the operating and financial decisions is obtained and cease to be consolidated from the date on which power is transferred out of the Group.
Power is achieved when the Company has the ability and right, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity.
This ability enables the Company to affect the amount of economic benefit generated from the entitys activities.
This is evident for all of the Groups subsidiaries listed in note 5.1.
z o. o. has a year end of 30 November 2018, as the Poland Accounting Act requires a financial year to be 12 full calendar months from the prior year end date.
Ocado Spain S. L. U. and Ocado Bulgaria EOOD have a year end of 31 December 2018, as established in its articles of association.
There was no material movement between the reporting date of the Group and the reporting dates of these entities.
All other subsidiaries have a year end of 2 December 2018.
All intercompany balances and transactions, including recognised gains arising from inter-Group transactions, have been eliminated in full.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same manner as recognised gains except to the extent that they provide evidence of impairment.
Joint Ventures The Groups share of the results of joint ventures is included in the Consolidated Income Statement using the equity method of accounting.
Investments in joint ventures are carried in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the entity, less any impairment in value.
The carrying values of the investments in joint ventures include acquired goodwill.
If the Groups share of losses in a joint venture or associate equals or exceeds its investment in the joint venture, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations to do so or made payments on behalf of the joint venture.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the entity.
Accounting Policies The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out in the relevant notes to these financial statements.
Accounting policies not specifically attributable to a note are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented, unless otherwise stated.
Foreign Currency Translation Functional and Presentational Currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
Pound sterling is the Companys functional and the Groups presentational currency.
Transactions and Balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are remeasured.
Foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges.
Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the Consolidated Income Statement within finance income or finance costs.
All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the Consolidated Income Statement within operating profit.
Group Companies The results and financial position of all the Group entities none of which has the currency of a hyper-inflationary economy that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: a. assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet: b. income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates unless average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions : and c. all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.

Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Key estimation uncertainties are the key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting period that may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
Significant judgements are those that the Group have made in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Changes in accounting estimates may be necessary if there are changes in the circumstances on which the estimate was based or as a result of new information or more experience.
Significant accounting policies, key estimation uncertainties, and judgements are provided below.
Accounting policies that are significant due to the nature of business: Area Policy Note Revenue For Ocado Retail: revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the customer obtains controls of the goods, which is 2.1 recognition generally on delivery to the customers home for Ocado deliveries and upon transfer of goods to the courier for third party deliveries.
For Ocado Solutions: revenue from the rendering of services is recognised over the life of the contract from the date the customer benefits from those services.
Key estimation uncertainties: Area Estimate Note Cost of Sales At the period end the Group is required to estimate supplier income due from annual agreements for volume rebates, which 2.1 span across the year end date.
Confirmation of some amounts due is often only received three to six months after the period end.
These post year end amounts are further outlined in note 3.9 on page 182.
Recognition of Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against 2.9 deferred tax assets which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Recognition, therefore, involves estimates regarding the prudent forecasting of future taxable profits of the business and in applying an appropriate risk adjustment factor.
Useful economic The assessment of the useful economic life and residual value of the Groups assets involves a significant amount of 3.1 3.2 life and residual judgement based on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events which may impact value of assets their useful life, such as changes in technology.
Given the significant investment in technology and other assets, the Group undertakes a review of the remaining useful lives of assets each year and will reduce the remaining useful lives, or impair where necessary, assets that are being superceded by new technology.
Significant Judgements: Area Judgement Note Revenue from Due to the size and complexity of some of the Ocado Solutions contracts, there are significant judgements to be applied, 2.1 contracts with particularly the duration of the contract and the expected customer life as the majority of the contracts do not have a fixed customers term.
This key judgement determines the amount of deferred income released each year and impacts related balance sheet items such as accrued income and contract liabilities.
Intangible assets The cost of internally generated assets is capitalised as an intangible asset where it is determined by managements 3.1 capitalisation of judgement that the ability to develop the assets is technically feasible, will be completed, and that the asset will generate software costs economic benefit that outweighs its cost.
Provisions, A typical Solutions contract includes numerous key milestones and failure to achieve these can be subject to contractual 3.12 contingent financial penalties.
Management judgement is required to review the progress of ongoing projects and determine whether liabilities and there is a risk that the Group will not meet the agreed milestones and potentially incur a financial penalty.
contingent assets A Exceptional items The Group applies judgement in identifying the significant non-recurring items of income and expense that are recognised as 2.8 exceptional to help provide an indication of the Groups underlying business performance.
Share options When determining the fair value of equity instruments granted, the Group applies a valuation technique.
The selection of 4.10 and other equity which option pricing model is most appropriate for each scheme requires careful consideration and the Group will review instruments each schemes particular features.
Other estimates, assumptions and judgements are applied by the Group.
These include, but are not limited to, depreciation and amortisation on tangible and intangible assets respectively, and provisions.
These estimates, assumptions and judgements are also evaluated on a continual basis but are not significant.

Initial adoption of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers The standard has an effective date of 1 January 2018 but the Group has decided to early adopt this standard with a date of initial application to the Group of 4 December 2017 using the full retrospective method.
IFRS 15 replaces all existing revenue requirements in IFRS and applies to all revenue arising from contracts with customers unless the contracts are within the scope of other standards such as IAS 17 Leases.
The standard outlines the principles that entities must apply to measure and recognise revenue with the core principle being that entities should recognise revenue at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for fulfilling its performance obligations to a customer.
The principles in IFRS 15 must be applied using the following 5 step model: 1.
Identify the contract s with a customer: 2.
Identify the performance obligations in the contract: 3.
Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract: and 5.
Recognise revenue when or as the entity satisfies its performance obligations.
The standard requires entities to exercise considerable judgement taking into account all the relevant facts and circumstances when applying each step of this model to its contracts with customers.
The standard also specifies how to account for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract and the costs directly related to fulfilling a contract, as well as requirements covering matters such as licences of intellectual property, warranties, principal versus agent assessment and options to acquire additional goods or services.
The Group has applied IFRS 15 fully retrospectively in accordance with paragraph C3 a of the standard, restating the prior periods comparatives and electing to use the following practical expedient: in respect of completed contracts that have variable consideration, the Group will use the transaction price at the date the contract was completed rather than estimating variable consideration amounts in the comparative periods para.
C5 b : Details of the change in the Groups accounting policy in respect of revenue recognition are set out in note 2.1.

This note details the Groups new accounting policy for revenue and shows the impact of the adoption of IFRS 15 on the Groups primary financial statements.
Below is a description of the IFRS 15 impact on material areas requiring reclassification or restatement: Consolidated Income Statement Restatement under IFRS 15 As previously 53 Weeks reported, Ended 53 Weeks Ended 3 December 3 December 2017 2017 Impact Restated Notes m of IFRS 15 m Revenue 2.32.4 1,463.8 9.3 1,454.5 Cost of sales 959.5 959.5 Gross profit 504.3 9.3 495.0 Other income 2.5 61.0 61.0 Distribution costs 434.2 434.2 Administrative expenses 117.7 117.7 A Operating profit before result from joint venture and exceptional items 13.4 9.3 4.1 Share of result from joint venture 3.5 1.6 1.6 A Exceptional items 2.8 0.3 0.3 Operating profit 2.6 14.7 9.3 5.4 Finance income 4.5 0.2 0.2 Finance costs 4.5 13.9 13.9 Profit loss for the period 1.0 9.3 8.3 Taxation 2.9 Profit loss for the period 1.0 9.3 8.3 Earnings loss per share pence pence pence Basic and diluted earnings loss per share 2.10 0.16 1.54 1.38 Recognition of Revenue: Under the Groups previous accounting policy, revenue for certain contracts was recognised under the percentage of completion method based upon costs incurred to date as a proportion of the estimated full cost of completing the contract and applying the percentage to the total revenue expected to be earned.
Such percentage of completion accounting would typically result in higher levels of revenue recognised in the earlier stages of a contract in line with the profile of costs incurred.
Under IFRS 15 revenue is recognised once, or as, a performance obligation is fulfilled.
Typically, in an Ocado Solutions contract, revenue recognition would not commence until the date of go-live.
Previously revenue was typically recognised in the earlier development stages of a contract.
This change has resulted in a reduction of 9.3 million in revenue recognised in the period to 3 December 2017.
Under IFRS 15, revenue is now spread over the period the services are provided.
This reflects an important change in accounting policy as the Group moves from percentage of completion to a methodology that is focused on aligning revenue recognition to the delivery of their performance obligation as described in note 2.1.
The new policy results in lower levels of revenue being recognised in the early stages of a contract but higher levels towards the end of a contract.
The decrease in trade and other payables relates to the reclassification and restatement of deferred income as non-current and current contract liabilities.
Prior to adoption of IFRS 15 deferred income was classified within Trade and other payables.
The increase in property, plant and equipment relates to contributions received from a customer towards the cost of an asset.
These are within the scope of IFRS 15 and are therefore recognised as contract liabilities and released over the life of the contract but were previously offset against the cost of the asset.

There has been no change in the net increase in cash and cash equivalents as a result of these reclassifications or the restatement of these balance sheet accounts.
1.6 Going Concern Basis Accounting standards require that Directors satisfy themselves that it is reasonable for them to conclude whether it is appropriate to prepare financial statements on the going concern basis.
There has been no material uncertainty identified which would cast significant doubt upon the Groups ability to continue using the going concern basis of accounting for the 12 months following the approval of this Annual Report.
In assessing going concern, the Directors take into account the Groups cash flows, solvency and liquidity positions and borrowing facilities.
At the period A end, the Group had cash and cash equivalents of 410.8 million 2017: 150.0 million, external gross debt excluding finance leases payable to MHE JVCo of 286.1 million 2017: 283.9 million and net current assets of 247.0 million 2017: 10.3 million.
The Group has a mix of short and medium term finance arrangements and has 250 million senior secured notes due 2024 and a 100 million revolving credit facility which contains typical financial covenants and runs until June 2022.
The facility has not been drawn down to date.
The Group forecasts its liquidity requirements, working capital position and the maintenance of sufficient headroom against the financial covenants in its borrowing facilities see below.
The financial position of the Group, including information on cash flow, can be found in our Financials on pages 142 to 223.
In determining whether there are material uncertainties, the Directors consider the Groups business activities, together with factors that are likely to affect its future development and position see Our Strategy on pages 26 and 27 and the Groups principal risks and the likely effectiveness of any mitigating actions and controls available to the Directors see pages 44 to 49.
Further details of the Groups considerations are provided in the Groups Viability and Going Concern Statement on page 49.

The value recognised in any period is based on a judgement of when the customer is able to benefit from the goods or services and an assessment of the progress made towards completely satisfying each obligation.
The following provides information about the nature and timing of the satisfaction of performance obligations in our contracts and the related revenue recognition policies, categorised by reportable segments.
For information about reportable segments, see note 2.2.
Retail Segment Identification of the Performance Obligations In a typical retail contract there is one performance obligation which is to deliver goods ordered online to the retail customer at the scheduled time and to the agreed address.
Ocado Smart Pass, the Groups discounted pre-pay membership scheme, is a separate contract with a customer and has a separate single performance obligation which is to provide delivery services for an agreed period of time.
Ocado is able to apply the practical expedient allowed in the standard to apply the standard requirements to a portfolio of contracts, rather than individual contracts, as it believes the characteristics of each sale are similar and the effects on the financial statements of doing so would not differ materially from applying the standard to individual contracts.
Determining the Transaction Price Customers pay in full at point of sale.
The retail transaction price is based on the aggregation of all order values shown net of any material adjustment for expected returns or expected future redemption of marketing vouchers in accordance with IFRS 15 guidance on variable consideration.
Standard delivery charges and carrier bag receipts are included in the transaction price.
Smart Pass transaction price is as per the contracted value of the membership for the agreed period of delivery services.
Allocation of Transaction Price to the Performance Obligations Each contract has a single performance obligation and so all the transaction price is assigned to that single obligation.
At the end of each reporting period management will review and adjust for elements of variable consideration such as expected refunds or expected voucher redemptions.
Revenue Recognition Revenue from online grocery orders is recognised at a point in time when the customer obtains control of the goods, which for deliveries performed by Ocado occurs when the goods are delivered to and have been accepted at the customers home.
For goods which are delivered by third party couriers, revenue is recognised when the items have been transferred to the third party for onward delivery to the customer.
These are shown net of returns, relevant marketing vouchers offers and value added taxes.
Relevant vouchers offers include money-off coupons, conditional spend vouchers and offers such as buy three for the price of two.
Revenue from Ocado Smart Pass is recognised over the duration of the membership on a time elapsed, straight-line basis.
Solutions Segment Identification of the Performance Obligations Each Solutions contract is considered on a case by case basis.
A typical Ocado Solutions contract has a single performance obligation to enable the client to access the OSP end-to-end online grocery platform from the go-live date, with an agreed physical capacity, from a CFC for example, for the use of its retail brands.
The ability to derive independent benefit is a key determinant.
For example, there are several critical contractual milestones which occur before the service is operational such as the design of the CFC for the client or preparation of the OSP.
However, management has concluded that the customer is not able to derive any benefit from these individual elements until the service is operational and they are able to fulfil an order.
Consequently, designing the CFC or building the customer OSP is not a performance obligation and no revenue can be assigned to satisfying these aspects of the contract.
Some contracts however will have multiple components for example, the addition of Store Pick services or additional CFCs, which could lead to additional distinct performance obligations.
In these situations, management will use their judgement to determine whether there are separable performance obligations that the customer is able to benefit from independently.
Determining the Transaction Price At contract inception, the total transaction price is estimated, being the amount to which the Group expects to be entitled over the expected duration of the contract, based on the rights it has under the present contract.
Such expected amounts are only included to the extent that it is highly probable that no revenue reversal will occur.
In order to arrive at the transaction price, management are initially required to make a judgement on contract duration.
The majority of our Solutions contracts do not have a fixed contract term, but instead run for an indefinite period until cancelled.
For the purposes of applying IFRS 15, and in particular the disclosures in respect of unsatisfied performance obligations, management determines contract duration having considered the type of contract, performance against contract SLAs and termination provisions.
The point from which any termination penalties payable by the customer would no longer be considered substantive is particularly relevant.
This key judgement on contract duration defines the period for which unsatisfied and partially unsatisfied performance obligations are measured and disclosed when calculating the transaction price.

The upfront fees are one-off payments and are included in the transaction price and recognised over the expected customer life.
Expected customer life is a key judgement as it affects the amount of deferred upfront fees that are released as revenue each year and the factors considered in reaching the judgement on expected customer life include the nature of the performance obligation, the scale of current and future planned investment, performance against contract SLAs, the evolving technology and competitive landscape.
The judgements made for contract duration may be different than those judgements for expected customer life.
A Solutions contract often includes recurring fees which are repeated on an annual basis throughout the contract, which are recognised over the contract duration and are included in the estimate of total transaction price.
Variable amounts are annual fees whereby typically the variability relates to the volume of sales transactions processed or variable costs associated with providing the service to the customer.
We determine that these variable amounts should be recognised in the period in which they arise, because they relate to the services provided in that period.
In determining the total transaction price for disclosure we have estimated the amount of future variable consideration for the contract duration described above.
IFRS 15 requires estimates of future variable consideration to adopt a conservative amount that is highly probable to become due.
In respect of agreements that are already operating, we have based our constrained estimate by assuming 90% of FY18 performance.
This estimate also excludes potential benefits from both indexation and future revenue growth from capacity improvements and the continued channel shift to online in the industry.
It also considers potential risks from new entrants to the online fulfilment market as it continues to grow and the competitive nature of the grocery market itself which could have an adverse impact on volumes.
Although for most Solutions contracts there is the possibility that the customer will add capacity in the form of additional modules in existing CFCs or additional CFCs in new locations, which would lead to increased revenue, this has been excluded from the calculation of the estimated transaction price.
Taken together we therefore consider that this approach represents a suitably conservative view of future estimated revenue in the disclosures of unsatisfied obligations as required by IFRS 15.
For each Solutions contract an assessment has been made by the Group as to whether there is a significant finance benefit arising from the timing of payments required from the customer.
Judgement is required to choose an appropriate interest rate used in the assessment and to set a reasonable threshold for determining that any finance benefit is significant.
Allocation of Transaction Price to the Performance Obligations Single component contracts have a single performance obligation and all the transaction price is assigned to that single deliverable.
Multiple component contracts will have more than one obligation, each with its own contract duration as judged by management.
Each contract clearly states the fees relating to each component.
This provides management with a basis for allocation of the calculated transaction price to the performance obligations as required by the standard in proportion to their relative revenue value in the contract.
Revenue Recognition For each performance obligation and its allocated transaction price, recognition of the revenue is made from the point at which the customer starts to benefit from the services and over the period the services are provided.
The nature of the services provided, that is the ability to fulfil online grocery orders, represents equal value to the customer every day that the service is provided.
This uniformity of value to the customer over time has led the Group to the decision that the most appropriate method of measuring the satisfaction of obligations should be on a straight-line time-elapsed basis.
IFRS 15 defines this as an output method which recognises revenue by reference to the value to the customer.
Judgement is applied in relation to contract and customer lives as typically, contracts have no end date.
Depending on the expected contract life, the amount and timing of revenue recognised may be different in the relevant accounting periods.
As the Group has not yet launched a CFC internationally, the Directors have limited relevant historical information on which to base their assumptions.
Therefore, in making their judgements, the Directors have considered qualitative and quantitative reasonable and supportable information such as market evidence and certain clauses contained within Solutions contracts.
Contract Modifications The Groups contracts may be amended for changes in contract specifications and requirements.
Contract modifications exist when the amendment either creates new or changes the existing enforceable rights and obligations.
The effect of a contract modification on the transaction price and the Groups measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates, is recognised as an adjustment to revenue in one of the following ways: a. prospectively as an additional separate contract: b. prospectively as a termination of the existing contract and creation of a new contract c. as part of the original contract using a cumulative catch up: or d. as a combination of b and c Ocado Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the 52 weeks ended 2 December 2018 www.

The facts and circumstances of any contract modification are considered individually as the types of modifications will vary contract by contract and may result in different accounting outcomes.
Judgement is applied in relation to the accounting for such modifications where the final terms or legal contracts have not been agreed prior to the period end as management need to determine if a modification has been approved and if it either creates new or changes existing enforceable rights and obligations of the parties.
Depending upon the outcome of such negotiations, the timing and amount of revenue recognised may be different in the relevant accounting periods.
Modification and amendments to contracts are undertaken via an agreed formal process.
For example, if a change in scope has been approved but the corresponding change in price is still being negotiated, management use their judgement to estimate the change to the total transaction price.
Importantly any variable consideration is only recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that no revenue reversal will occur.
Contract Costs and Liabilities As a result of the contracts which the Group enters into with its clients, a number of different assets and liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet.
These include but are not limited to: Property, plant and equipment Intangible assets Costs to obtain contracts Contract liabilities Incremental Costs of Obtaining a Contract These are costs that are incurred to obtain a contract with a customer that would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained.
Costs to obtain a contract that would have been incurred regardless of whether the contract was obtained shall be recognised as an expense when incurred, unless those costs are explicitly chargeable to the customer regardless of whether the contract is obtained.
The incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer are recognised as an asset if they are expected to be recoverable.
Utilisation, Derecognition and Impairment of Costs to Obtain a Contract Incremental costs to obtain a contract shall be amortised on a basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates.
Incremental costs to obtain a contract are derecognised either when they are disposed of or when no further economic benefits are expected to flow from their use or disposal.
Management is required to determine the recoverability of contract related assets within property, plant and equipment, intangible assets as well as capitalised costs to obtain a contract, accrued income and trade receivables.
At each reporting date, the Group determines whether or not the capitalised costs to obtain a contract are impaired by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the remaining amount of consideration that the Group expects to receive less the costs that relate to providing services under the relevant contract.
In determining the estimated amount of consideration, the Group uses the same principles as it does to determine the contract transaction price, except that any constraints used to reduce the transaction price will be removed for the impairment test.
Contract Liabilities The Groups customer contracts include a diverse range of payment schedules dependent upon the nature and type of goods and services being provided.
The Group often agrees payment schedules at the inception of long-term contracts under which it receives payments throughout the term of the contracts.
These payment schedules may include performance-based payments or progress payments as well as regular monthly or quarterly payments for ongoing service delivery.
Payments for transactional goods and services may be at delivery date, in arrears or part payment in advance.
Where payments made, or when the Group has an unconditional right to payment, are greater than the revenue recognised at the period end date, the Group recognises a contract liability.
Where payments made are less than the revenue recognised at the period end date, and the Group have an unconditional right to payment, the Group recognises accrued income for this difference.
Cost of Sales Cost of sales represents the cost of groceries and other products the Group sells, any associated licence fees which are driven by the volume of sales of specific products or product groups, including the branding and sourcing fees payable to Waitrose, adjustments to inventory and charges for transportation of goods from a supplier to a CFC.
Commercial Income The Group continues to have agreements with suppliers whereby promotional allowances and volume-related rebates are received in connection with the promotion or purchase of goods for resale from those suppliers.
The allowances and rebates are included in cost of sales.
For the 52 weeks ended 2 December 2018, promotional allowances represent 80% 2017: 81% of commercial income, with volume-related rebates representing 20% 2017: 19%.

The estimates required for this source of income are limited because the time periods of promotional activity, in most cases, are less than one month and the invoicing for the activity occurs on a regular basis shortly after the promotions have ended.
Volume-Related Rebates At the period end the Group is required to estimate supplier income due from annual agreements for volume rebates, which span across the year end date.
Estimates are required due to the fact that confirmation of some amounts due is often only received three to six months after the period end.
Where estimates are required, these are based on current performance, historical data for prior years and a review of significant supplier contracts.
A material amount of this income is received from third parties via the Groups supply agreement with Waitrose.
The estimates for this income are prepared following discussions with Waitrose throughout the year and regularly reviewed by senior management.
Uncollected Commercial Income Uncollected commercial income as at the balance sheet date is classified within trade and other receivables.
Where commercial income has been earned, but not yet invoiced at the balance sheet date, the amount is recorded in accrued income.
Other Income Other income comprises the fair value of consideration received or receivable for advertising services provided by Ocado to suppliers and other third parties on the Webshop, commission income, rental income, sublease payments receivable and amounts receivable not in the ordinary course of business.
Income for advertising services is recognised over the particular time period for which the service is provided on an accruals basis.
An adjustment is made at the period end to accrue the amount of income in relation to campaigns that may span the period end: however, such adjustments are not typically material.
Employee Benefits The Group contributes to the personal pension plans of its staff through two pension plans: a defined contribution Group personal pension, which is administered by Legal & General, and a defined contribution Money Purchase Scheme administered by Peoples Pensions.
Legacy employer contributions to the schemes are calculated as a percentage of salary based on length of scheme membership.
From October 2017 new members to the scheme are enrolled into a matching contribution structure.
Contributions are charged to the income statement in the period to which they relate.
Distribution Costs Distribution costs consist of all the costs incurred, excluding product costs, to the point of sale.
In most cases, this is the customers home.
This includes the payroll-related expenses for the picking, dispatch and delivery of products sold to the point of sale, the cost of making those deliveries, including fuel, tolls, maintenance of vehicles, the operating costs of the properties required for the picking, dispatch and onward delivery operations and all associated depreciation, amortisation and impairment charges, call centre costs and payment processing charges.
This includes costs incurred on behalf of Morrisons which are subsequently recharged.
Administrative Expenses Administrative expenses consist of all IT costs, advertising and marketing expenditure excluding vouchers, share-based payments costs, employment costs of all central functions, which include board, legal, finance, human resources, marketing and procurement, rent and other property-related costs for the head office, all fees for professional services and the depreciation, amortisation and impairment associated with IT equipment, software, fixtures and fittings.
Additionally, this includes costs incurred on behalf of Morrisons which are subsequently recharged.
A Exceptional Items The Group has adopted an income statement format which seeks to highlight significant items within the Group results for the year.
The Group believes this format is useful as it highlights non-recurring items, such as material set-up costs for new fulfilment warehouses, reorganisation and restructuring A costs, profit or loss on disposal of operations, and impairment of assets.
Exceptional items, as disclosed on the face of the Consolidated Income Statement, are items that due to their material and or non-recurring nature, as determined by management, have been classified separately in order to draw them to the attention of the reader of the financial statements and to avoid distortion of underlying performance.
This facilitates comparison with prior periods to assess trends in financial performance more readily.
It is determined by management that each of these items relates to events or circumstances that are non-recurring in nature.
The Group applies judgement in identifying the significant non-recurring items of income and expense that are recognised as exceptional to help provide an indication of the Groups underlying business performance.
Examples of items that the Group considers as exceptional include, but are not limited to, material costs relating to the opening of a new warehouse, corporate reorganisations, head office relocation costs and any material costs outside of the normal course of business as determined by management.

The Group is not reliant on any major customer for 10% or more of its revenue.
In accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments, an operating segment is defined as a business activity whose operating results are reviewed by the chief operating decision-maker CODM, for which discrete information is available.
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the CODM, as required by IFRS 8.
The CODM, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Executive Directors.
During the period, the Group determined it has two reportable segments: Retail and Solutions.
The Retail segment provides online grocery and general merchandise offerings to customers within the UK.
The Solutions segment provides end-to-end online retail solutions to corporate customers within and A outside of the UK.
In order to reconcile segment revenues to the Group revenue and profit, a third category entitled Other shows unallocated costs such as central business activities.
A The Board assesses the performance of all segments on the basis of EBITDA.
EBITDA as reported internally by segment, is the key measure utilised in assessing the performance of operating segments within the Group.
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those for the Group as a whole.
Any transactions between the business segments are subject to normal commercial terms and market conditions.
Segment results and assets include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.

The amounts disclosed above in respect of unsatisfied and partially unsatisfied performance obligations do not include estimates of any amounts that will arise if the customer continues to receive services beyond our estimate of the contract term.
In addition, they are reduced, during the contract term, so as to limit our estimate of future variable amounts to a conservative amount that is highly probable.
For additional information in respect of key judgements, please refer to note 2.1.
The figures disclosed do not include any incremental amounts in relation to CFCs and other solutions to which a customer is not yet committed.
However, they do include any amounts that are payable by the customer irrespective of whether an option for future CFCs and other solutions is exercised e. g. amounts that are equivalent to a non-refundable deposit.

Tax is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.
Current Taxation Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, calculated using tax rates enacted by the balance sheet date.
Management periodically evaluate positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation.
It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred Taxation Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet liability method on temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of reversal of the temporary differences is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Recognition, therefore, involves judgement regarding the prudent risk-adjusted forecasting of future taxable profits of the business and in applying an appropriate risk adjustment factor.
The final outcome of some of these items may give rise to material profit and loss and or cash flow variances.
At the balance sheet date, management have forecast that the Group would generate future taxable profits against which existing tax losses could be relieved.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current taxation assets against current taxation liabilities and it is the intention to settle these on a net basis.
Research and Development Expenditure Credit The Group takes advantage of the incentives offered under the UKs Research and Development Expenditure Credit RDEC regime to claim a credit for the Groups significant expenditure on qualifying research and development.
As enacted in the Finance Act 2015, the credit due to the Group is equal to 11% of the Groups qualifying expenditure.
The Group continues to utilise the additional benefits from the scheme in light of the Groups commitment to its innovative technology and software.
During the year the Group claimed a credit of 3.0 million for the 53 weeks ended 3 December 2017 2016: 2.4 million for the 52 weeks ended 27 November 2016.
Future Changes to Tax Legislation The Group undertakes regular reviews in order to ensure its ongoing compliance with current and future proposed changes to UK tax legislation.
The Group has undertaken a review of the Groups activities in light of the OECDs Base Erosion and Profit Shifting BEPS publications and does not foresee any significant impact on the Groups effective tax rate resulting from the proposed changes in the short to medium term.
The Groups future tax charge, and effective tax rate, could be affected by several factors including: tax reform in countries around the world, including any arising from the OECDs or European Commissions work on the taxation of the digital economy and European Commission initiatives such as the anti tax avoidance directive.
We do not anticipate any significant impact on our future tax charge, liabilities or assets, as a result of the triggering of Article 50 2 of the Treaty on European Union but cannot rule out the possibility that, for example, a failure to reach satisfactory arrangements for the UKs future relationship with the European Union, could have an impact on such matters.
We continue to monitor developments in this area.

A deferred tax asset of 9.5 million 2017: 14.3 million has been recognised in respect of 55.9 million 2017: 84.0 million of such losses, the recovery of which is supported by the expected level of future profits of the Group.
The recognition of the deferred tax asset is based on forecast operating results calculated in approved business plans and a review of tax planning opportunities.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining losses on the basis that their future economic benefit is uncertain given the unpredictability of future profit streams.
All tax losses, both recognised and unrecognised, can be carried forward indefinitely.
Management have concluded that there is sufficient evidence for the recognition of the deferred tax asset of 16.6 million 2017: 14.3 million.
Movement in the recognised deferred tax liability is set out below: m As at 27 November 2016 6.9 Effect of change in UK corporation tax rate Recognised through the Consolidated Income Statement 0.1 As at 3 December 2017 7.0 Recognised through the Consolidated Income Statement 1.9 As at 2 December 2018 8.9 For the year ended 2 December 2018 the Group has recognised a deferred tax liability of 8.9 million 2017: 7.0 million.
Of this amount, 8.8 million 2017: 4.5 million is in respect of intangible assets that management assessed as qualifying for research and development corporation tax relief.
The timing of the tax deductions in respect of expenditure incurred on these assets differs from the amortisation profile of the assets giving rise to the deferred tax liability.
This liability will be unwound over the useful lives of the assets Ocado Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the 52 weeks ended 2 December 2018 www.

Diluted loss per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion or vesting of all dilutive potential shares.
The Company has three classes of instruments that are potentially dilutive: share options, share interests held pursuant to the Groups Joint Share Ownership scheme and shares under the Groups staff incentive plans.
There was no difference in the weighted average number of shares used for the calculation of basic and diluted loss per share as the effect of all potentially dilutive shares outstanding was anti-dilutive.

These are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any recognised impairment loss.
Other intangible assets such as externally acquired computer software and software licences are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives of three to fifteen years.
Costs relating to the development of computer software for internal use are capitalised once all the development phase recognition criteria of IAS 38 Intangible Assets are met.
When the software is available for its intended use, these costs are amortised in equal annual amounts over the estimated useful life of the software.
Amortisation and impairment of computer software or licences are charged to administrative expenses in the period in which they arise.
For the Groups impairment policy on non-financial assets see note 3.2.
Amortisation of intangible assets is calculated on a straight-line basis from the date on which they are brought into use, charged to administrative expenses, and is calculated based on the useful lives indicated below: Internally generated assets 315 years, or the lease term if shorter Other intangible assets 315 years, or the lease term if shorter Right to use land The estimated useful economic life, or the lease term if shorter Amortisation periods and methods are reviewed annually and adjusted if appropriate.
Cost Capitalisation The cost of internally generated assets is capitalised as an intangible asset where it is determined by managements judgement that the ability to develop the assets is technically feasible, will be completed, and that the asset will generate economic benefit that outweighs its cost.
This is in line with the recognition criteria as outlined in IAS 38 Intangible Assets.
Management determine whether the nature of the projects meets the recognition criteria to allow for the capitalisation of internal costs, which include the total cost of any external products or services and labour costs directly attributable to development.
During the year management have considered whether costs in relation to the time spent on specific software projects can be capitalised.
Time spent that was eligible for capitalisation included time which was intrinsic to the development of new assets, CFC and General Merchandise Distribution Centre, and the enhancement and efficiency improvements of existing warehouse system capabilities to accommodate expanding capacity and scalable opportunities.
Time has also been spent to continuously implement and integrate the functionality of the Ocado Smart Platform used by the Groups customers.
Other development costs that do not meet the above criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.
Research expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred.
These are costs that form part of the intent of gaining new knowledge, which management assess as not satisfying the capitalisation criteria per IAS 38 Intangible Assets as outlined above.
Examples of research costs include, but are not limited to, the following: salaries and benefits of employees assessing and analysing future technologies and their likely viability, and professional fees such as marketing costs and the cost of third party consultancy.
In certain circumstances, some assets are ready for use, but are not performing as intended by management.
Development costs that relate to the enhancement or modifications of existing assets are capitalised until the asset is performing as intended by management.
Management assess the capitalisation of these costs by consulting the guidance outlined in IAS 38 Intangible Assets and exercise judgement in determining the qualifying costs.
When unsure if the enhancement or modification costs relate to the development of the asset or are maintenance expenditure in nature, management treat the expenditure as if it were incurred in the research phase only in line with IAS 38 guidance.
Internally generated assets consist primarily of costs relating to intangible assets which provide economic benefit independent of other assets, and intangible assets that are utilised in the operation of property, plant and equipment.
These intangible assets are required for certain tangible assets to operate as intended by management.
Management assess each material internally generated asset addition and consider whether it is integral to the successful operation of a related item of hardware, can be used across a number of applications and therefore whether the asset should be recognised as property, plant and equipment.
If the asset could be used on other existing or future projects it will be recognised as an intangible asset.
For example, should an internally generated asset, such as the software code to enhance the operation of existing CFC equipment, be expected to form the foundation or a substantial element of future software development, it has been recognised as an intangible asset.

Estimation of Useful Life The charge in respect of periodic amortisation is derived by estimating an assets expected useful life and the expected residual value at the end of its life.
Increasing an assets expected life or its residual value would result in a reduced amortisation charge in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The useful life is determined by management at the time the software is acquired and brought into use and is regularly reviewed for appropriateness.
For computer software licences, the useful life represents managements view of the expected period over which the Group will receive benefits from the software.
For unique software products developed and controlled by the Group, the life is based on historical experience with similar products as well as anticipation of future events which may impact their useful life, such as changes in technology.
Where the right to use land has been granted, the period over which the amortisation is charged is the lower of the estimated useful economic life and the lease expiry date.

Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset, any costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use and major spares.
An item of property, plant and equipment is recognised as an asset if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the asset will flow to the entity, and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Property, plant and equipment represents 41% of the total asset base of the Group in 2018 2017: 52%.
The estimates and assumptions made to determine the carrying value of property, plant and equipment and related depreciation are important to the Groups financial position and performance.
Management assess the estimates and assumptions based on available external information and historical experience.
In determining the cost of property, plant and equipment, certain costs that relate to the intangible element of an asset are separately disclosed within Intangible assets, note 3.1.
Management exercise judgement to review each material asset addition and consider whether the intangible asset element can be used for other property, plant and equipment additions in the current or future years.
The Ocado Smart Platform has been identified as a standalone intangible asset, because it has been developed and used to deliver the Groups third and fourth CFCs in Andover and Erith, and will be used to provide part of the foundation software for future CFCs.
Similarly, the restructuring of the software which manages CFC operations to increase modularity is identified as an asset because it will improve software stability for both existing operational CFCs.
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is charged to distribution costs and administrative expenses and is calculated based on the useful lives indicated below: Freehold buildings and leasehold properties 30 years or the lease term if shorter Fixtures and fittings 510 years, or the lease term if shorter Plant and machinery 320 years, or the lease term if shorter Motor vehicles 27 years, or the lease term if shorter Land is held at cost and not depreciated.
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost less any recognised impairment loss.
Cost includes professional fees and other directly attributable costs.
Depreciation of these assets commences when the assets are ready for their intended use, on the same basis as other property assets.
Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing proceeds with the assets carrying amount and are recognised within operating profit.
For more information on the Groups policy on capitalisation of borrowings costs, see note 4.1.
Estimation of Useful Life Depreciation is provided at rates estimated to write off the cost of the relevant assets less their estimated residual values by equal annual amounts over their expected useful lives.
Residual values and expected useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is derived by estimating an assets expected useful life and the expected residual value at the end of its life.
Increasing an assets expected life or its residual value would result in a reduced depreciation charge in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The useful lives of the Groups assets are determined by management at the time the asset is acquired and reviewed at least annually for appropriateness.
Management also assess the useful lives based on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events which may impact their useful life, such as changes in technology.
A review of useful lives took place in the current year and no changes in useful lives was required.

These assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Management make an assessment based on the current usage level and condition of the assets and assess whether the asset will continue to stay in use for the remainder of its useful life.
For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash-generating units.
Non-financial assets that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at the end of each reporting period.
When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
Given the Groups current operating structure the lowest level at which cash flows can reasonably be assessed is the Retail and Solutions segments.
The Group prepares detailed forward projections which are constantly updated and refined.
Based on these projections the Board does not consider that any further impairment of assets is required, other than that recognised in the Income Statement.

Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations The non-current asset held for sale of 4.2 million represents the carrying value of a UK property that was previously used in the Groups distribution network that the Group is in the process of selling.
Sale negotiations are well advanced and the sale is expected to complete within one year of the balance sheet date.
The proceeds of disposal are expected to exceed the book value and accordingly no gain or loss was recognised on the classification of the property as held for sale.
3.4 Financial Assets Accounting Policies Financial Assets Financial assets comprise available-for-sale financial assets, prepaid fees in relation to financing activities and contribution towards dilapidations.
Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivatives that are not designated as held for trading or that are not designated as at fair value through profit and loss.
They are included in non-current assets unless the investment matures or management intend to dispose of it within 12 months of the end of the reporting period.
Management consider that the Groups investments fall within this category as explained below.
Prepaid fees in relation to financing activities are recognised when incurred.
The prepaid fees are amortised in proportion to the drawdown and utilisation of the underlying facility.
Amortisation commenced when the underlying facility was first utilised through to the earlier of the expected refinancing date or end of the term.
Any residual of the prepaid fee which is not amortised when the facility is refinanced or repaid will be charged to the Consolidated Income Statement.

If the equity instruments are not quoted in an active market and their fair value cannot be reliably measured, the available-for-sale investment is carried at cost, less accumulated impairment.
Unless the valuation falls below its original cost, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value of available-for-sale assets are recognised directly in equity.
On disposal the cumulative net gain or loss is transferred to the statement of comprehensive income.
Valuations below cost are recognised as impairment losses in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Dividends are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement when the right to receive payment is established.
The unlisted equity investment comprises a 25% interest in Paneltex Limited Paneltex, a company incorporated in the UK, which has not been treated as an associated undertaking as the Group does not have significant influence over the company.
In arriving at this decision, the Board has reviewed the conditions set out in IAS 28 Investments in Associates and concluded that despite the size of its holding it is unable to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of Paneltex due to the position of the majority shareholder as Executive Managing Director.
The relationship between the Group and the company is at arms length.
The shares of Paneltex are not quoted in an active market and their fair value cannot be reliably measured.
As such, the investment in Paneltex is measured at cost less accumulated impairment.
The Group does not intend to dispose of this investment in the foreseeable future.
Prepaid Financing Fees The prepaid financing fees are in relation to financing facilities entered into during the previous year.
The non-current portion of prepaid finance costs relates to amounts capitalised during the year which will not be amortised to the Consolidated Income Statement within the next 12 months.
Contribution Towards Dilapidations A contribution towards dilapidations is due from the former tenant of two leases entered into during the year and will be utilised when dilapidation costs are incurred at the end of the lease.
3.5 Investment in Joint Ventures Accounting Policies The Group has assessed the nature of its joint arrangement under IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements and determined it to be a joint venture.
The Groups share of the results of joint ventures is included in the Consolidated Income Statement and is accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
On transfer of land and or work-in-progress to joint ventures, the Group recognises only its share of any profits or losses, namely that proportion sold outside the Group.
If the Groups share of losses in a joint venture or associate equals or exceeds its investment in the joint venture or associate, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations to do so or made payments on behalf of the joint venture or associate.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with joint ventures and associates are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the entity.
Investment in Joint Ventures The Group has an equity interest of 52.2 million 2017: 51.0 million in MHE JVCo, a joint venture company.
MHE JVCo is incorporated in the UK, in which Morrisons and Ocado Operating Limited, a subsidiary in the Group, are the sole investors.
In the current year the Group received a dividend of nil 2017: 7.6 million from MHE JVCo.
The Group made no additional capital contributions into MHE JVCo.
The Groups share of profit after tax for the year is detailed as follows: 2 December 3 December 2018 2017 m m Group share of revenue 2.2 2.6 Group share of expenses, inclusive of tax 1.0 1.0 Group share of profit after tax 1.2 1.6 At the period end the Groups share of the net assets of MHE JVCo were valued at 52.2 million 2017: 51.0 million The principal movements during the year were the 1.2 million Group share of profit after tax and a dividend of nil paid by MHE JVCo to the Group.
For the 52 weeks ended 2 December 2018 the entity, MHE JVCo Limited, has recognised net interest income of 4.4 million 2017: 5.2 million.
Costs incurred by MHE JVCo include depreciation of 2.0 million 2017: 1.9 million and a tax charge of nil 2017: nil.
Material amounts held on its balance sheet as at 2 December 2018 include finance lease receivables of 74.5 million 2017: 94.1 million, 9.2 million 2017: 9.4 million of property, plant and equipment, 1.2 million 2017: 0.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and 3.9 million 2017: 1.7 million of trade and other payables, contributing towards net assets of 105.2 million 2017: 102.8 million.
Other than as a finance lessor to the Group, MHE JVCo has no other significant operations.
The principal place of business is the same as for Ocado Group plc, details of which are provided on page 154.

The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate fair value of the consideration given.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 Business Combinations are recognised at their fair value at the date the Group assumes control of the acquiree.
Acquisition related costs are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as incurred.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement measured at fair value at the date control is achieved.
Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments.
All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRSs.
Investments in Subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries held by the Company are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is the excess of consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
There were no significant investments in new subsidiaries during the 52 weeks to 2 December 2018.
3.7 Working Capital Accounting Policies Inventories Inventories comprise goods held for resale, fuel and other consumable goods.
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value as provided in IAS 2 Inventories.
Goods held for resale and consumables are valued using the historical cost basis.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
It also takes into account slow-moving, obsolete and defective inventory.
Fuel stocks are valued at calculated average cost.
Costs include all direct expenditure and other appropriate attributable costs incurred in bringing inventories to their present location and condition.
There has been no security granted over inventory unless stated otherwise.
The Group has a mix of grocery and general merchandise items within inventory which have different characteristics.
For example, grocery lines have high inventory turnover, while non-food lines are typically held within inventory for a longer period of time and so run a higher risk of obsolescence.
As inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value, this requires the estimation of the eventual sales price of goods to customers in the future.
Judgement is applied when estimating the impact on the carrying value of inventories such as slow-moving, obsolete and defective inventory, which includes reviewing the quantity, age and condition of inventories throughout the year.
Loans and Receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period, which are classified as non-current assets.
The Groups loans and receivables are included in Trade and other Receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Trade and Other Receivables Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are on commercial terms.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
Other receivables are non-interest bearing and are recognised initially at fair value, and subsequently at amortised cost, reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.

Any provision made against an impaired receivable is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement within administrative expenses.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against this same financial statement caption.
The outcome of an impaired receivable depends on future events which are by their nature uncertain.
In assessing the likely outcome, management base their assessment on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, demand deposits with banks and short-term deposits with a maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition.
Cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits are shown under current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates to their fair value.
They are therefore included as a component of cash and cash equivalents.
Financial Liabilities and Equity Instruments Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that gives a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Trade and Other Payables Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.

3.12 Provisions Accounting Policies Provisions are recognised in line with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
Provisions can be distinguished from other types of liability by considering the events that give rise to the obligation and the degree of uncertainty as to the amount or timing of the liability.
These are recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
The amounts recognised as a provision are managements best estimates of the expenditure to settle present obligations as at the Consolidated Balance Sheet date.
The outcome depends on future events, which are by their nature uncertain.
Any difference between expectations and the actual future liability will be accounted for in the period when this is determined.
Insurance Claims Provisions for insurance claims relate to potential motor insurance claims and potential public liability claims where accidents have occurred but a claim has yet to be made.
The provision is made based on estimates provided to Ocado by the third party manager of the Ocado Cell in Atlas Insurance PCC Limited the Ocado Cell.
Dilapidations Provisions for dilapidations are made in respect of vehicles and properties where there are obligations to return the vehicles and properties to the condition and state they were in when the Group obtained the right to use them.
These are recognised on a property-by-property basis and are based on the Groups best estimate of the likely committed cash outflow.
Where relevant, these estimated outflows are discounted to net present value.
Employee Incentive Schemes Provisions for employee incentive schemes relate to HMRC unapproved equity-settled schemes, the Beauty Management Incentive plan Beauty MIP and the Cash-Based Long-Term Incentive Plan Cash LTIP.
For all unapproved schemes and the Cash LTIP, the Group is liable to pay employers NIC upon allotment of the share awards.
Unapproved schemes are the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP, the Chairmans Share Matching Award, the Growth Incentive Plan GIP and unapproved Executive Share Ownership Scheme ESOS.
For more details on these schemes, refer to note 4.10.
In 2014, the Group established the Cash LTIP in order to incentivise selected high performing employees of the Company.
At the end of the three-year vesting period, employees will be paid a cash amount equal to the notional number of awards at the prevailing share price, adjusted for the achievement of the performance conditions.

In practice the Ocado Cell receives newly reported claims after the end of the underwriting period that have to be allocated to the year of loss i. e. the underwriting year of occurrence.
The calculation of this provision involves estimating a number of variables, principally the level of claims which may be received and the level of any compensation which may be payable.
Uncertainty associated with these factors may result in the ultimate liability being different from the reported provision.
Although it is expected that 0.1 million claims will be settled within 12 months of the balance sheet date, the exact timing of utilisation of the provision is uncertain.

The Hatfield CFC lease expires in 2032, the Dordon CFC lease expires in 2038, the Andover CFC lease expires in 2092, the Erith CFC lease expires in 2046, the GMDC leases expire between 2022 and 2037, head office leases expire between 2019 and 2028, with leases for the spokes expiring up to 2068.
Contractual amounts are due to be incurred at the end of the respective lease terms.
Leases for vehicles run for five years, with the contractual obligation per vehicle payable at the end of the five-year lease term.
If a non-contractual option to extend individual leases for a further six months is exercised by the Group, the contractual obligation remains the same but is deferred by six months.
Employee Incentive Schemes The provision consists of the Cash LTIP, the Beauty MIP and employers NIC on HMRC unapproved equity-settled schemes.
The Cash LTIP provision represents the expected cash payments to participants upon vesting of the awards.
It has been calculated using various assumptions regarding liquidity, participants retention and achievability of the performance conditions, and valued with reference to the year end share price.
If at any point following initial valuation any of these assumptions are revised, the charge will need to be amended accordingly.
In addition to the base cost, since this is a cash benefit, the Group will be liable to pay employers NIC on the value of the cash award on vesting, which is included in the above employers NIC provision.
To calculate the employers NIC provision, the applicable employers NIC rate is applied to the number of share awards which are expected to vest, valued with reference to the year end share price.
The number of share awards expected to vest is dependent on various assumptions which are determined by management: namely participants retention rate, the expectation of meeting the performance criteria, if any, and the liquidity discount.
All assumptions are supported by historical trends and internal financial forecasts, where appropriate.
For the GIP, an external valuation was carried out to determine the fair value of the awards granted see note 4.10 f. If at any point during the life of each share award, any non-market conditions are subject to change, such as the retention rate or the likelihood of the performance condition being met, the number of share awards likely to vest will need to be recalculated which will cause the value of the employers NIC provision to change accordingly.
Once the share awards under each of the schemes have vested, the provision will be utilised when they are allocated to participants.
Vesting will occur between 2019 and 2021.

Subsequent to initial recognition, interest bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being capitalised to qualifying assets or recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement over the period of the borrowings on the effective interest rate basis.
Leased Assets Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
For the Hatfield, the land and building elements are accounted for separately after determining the appropriate lease classification.
The Group follows the guidance of IAS 17 Leases to determine the classification of leases as operating leases versus finance leases.
The classification of A a lease as a finance lease as opposed to an operating lease will change EBITDA as the charge made by the lessor will pass through finance charges and depreciation will be charged on the capitalised asset.
Retained earnings may also be affected depending on the relative size of the amounts apportioned to capital repayments and depreciation.
IAS 17 Leases requires the Group to consider splitting property leases into their component parts i. e. land and building elements.
As only the building elements could be considered as a finance lease, management must make a judgement, based on advice from suitable experts, as to the relative value of the land and buildings.
Finance Leases Assets funded through finance leases are capitalised either as property, plant and equipment, or intangible assets, as appropriate, and are depreciated amortised over their estimated useful lives or the lease term, whichever is shorter.
The amount capitalised is the lower of the fair value of the asset or the present value of the minimum lease payments during the lease term, measured at the inception of the lease.
The resulting lease obligations are included in liabilities, net of attributable transaction costs.
Finance costs on finance leases are charged directly to the Consolidated Income Statement on the effective interest rate basis.
Operating Leases Assets leased under operating leases are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Rental payments are charged directly to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis.
Sale and Leaseback A sale and leaseback transaction is one where the Group sells an asset and immediately reacquires the use of the asset by entering into a lease with the buyer.
The leaseback transaction is classified as a finance lease when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group.
All other leasebacks are classified as operating leases.
For sale and finance leasebacks, any profit from the sale is deferred and amortised over the lease term.
For sale and operating leasebacks, the assets are expected to be sold at fair value, and accordingly the profit or loss from the sale is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Lease Incentives Lease incentives primarily include upfront cash payments or rent-free periods.
Lease incentives are capitalised and released against the relevant rental expense over the lease term.

4.6 Derivative Financial Instruments Accounting Policies Derivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the contract date and are subsequently measured at their fair value at each balance sheet date.
The method of recognising the resulting fair value gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and the nature of the item being hedged.
At 2 December 2018 and at 3 December 2017, the Groups derivative financial instruments consisted of commodity swap contracts which are designated as cash flow hedges of highly probable transactions.
The Group documents at the inception of the hedge the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, the risk management objectives and strategy and its assessment of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
This assessment is performed retrospectively at each financial reporting period.
Movements on the hedging reserve within shareholders equity are shown in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The full fair value of hedging derivatives is classified as current when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months.

Amounts accumulated through other comprehensive income are recycled in the Consolidated Income Statement in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss.
When the hedged forecast transaction results in the recognition of property, plant and equipment, the gains or losses previously deferred in equity are included in the initial cost of the asset and are ultimately recognised in profit or loss within the depreciation expense.
During the period all of the Groups cash flow hedges were effective and there is therefore no ineffective portion recognised in profit or loss.
Commodity Swap Contracts The notional principal amounts of the outstanding commodity swap contracts at 2 December 2018 were 11.3 million 2017: 6.9 million.
The hedged highly probable forecast transactions are expected to occur at various dates during the next 12 months.
Cumulative net gains of 1.0 million have been recognised in the hedging reserve within other comprehensive income.
These gains and losses are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects the Consolidated Income Statement.

The Group classifies its financial instruments in the following categories: available-for-sale: loans and receivables: other financial liabilities at amortised cost: and financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets and liabilities were acquired.
Management determine the classification of their financial instruments at initial recognition or in certain circumstances on modification.
Offsetting Financial Instruments Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Impairment of Financial Assets Assets Carried at Amortised Cost The Group assesses whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset is impaired at the end of each reporting period.
A financial asset is impaired and an impairment loss recognised if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of a loss event that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset and the loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
The criteria that the Group uses to determine that there is objective evidence of an impairment loss include but are not limited to: financial difficulty indicators: breach of contract such as missed payments: fraud: bankruptcy: and disappearance of an active market.

The assets carrying value is reduced and the loss recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
If, in a subsequent period, the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the reversal of the previously recognised impairment loss is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Available-For-Sale Financial Assets Equity investments classified as available-for-sale and held at cost are reviewed annually to identify if an impairment loss has occurred.
The amount of the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying value of the financial asset and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the current market rate of return for a similar financial asset.
Impairment losses recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement on equity investments are not reversed.
Financial Assets and Liabilities at Fair Value Financial instruments carried at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet comprise the derivative assets and liabilities see note 4.6.
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of these financial instruments: Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 : Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset and liability, either directly or indirectly level 2 : and Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data level 3.
The Groups derivative assets and liabilities other than the senior secured notes are all classified as level 2.
The senior secured notes are classified as level 1.

The main financial risks faced by the Group relate to the risk of default by counterparties following financial transactions, the availability of funds for the Group to meet its obligations as they fall due and fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates.
The management of these risks is set out below.
Credit Risk The Groups exposures to credit risk arise from holdings of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables excluding prepayments and derivative assets.
The carrying value of these financial assets, as set out in note 4.7, represents the maximum credit exposure.
No collateral is held as security against these assets.
Cash and Cash Equivalents The Groups exposure to credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is managed by investing in banks and financial institutions with strong credit ratings and by regular review of counterparty risk.
Trade and Other Receivables Trade and other receivables at the period end comprise mainly monies due from suppliers, which are considered of a good credit quality, as well as VAT receivables.
The Group provides for doubtful receivables in respect of monies due from suppliers.
The Group has very low retail credit risk due to transactions being principally of a high volume, low value and short maturity.
The Group has effective controls over this area.
The Group has allowed for doubtful receivables in respect of consumer sales by reviewing the ageing profile and, based on prior experience, assessing the recoverability of overdue balances.

Foreign currency trade payables arise principally on purchases of plant and equipment, primarily in relation to the euro, Polish zloty and US dollar.
Bank accounts are maintained in these foreign currencies in order to minimise the Groups exposure to fluctuations in the currency relating to current and future purchases of plant and equipment.
The Groups exposure to currency risk is based on the following amounts: 2 December 3 December 2018 2017 m m Cash and cash equivalents EUR 1.2 Cash and cash equivalents PLN 2.9 3.4 Cash and cash equivalents USD 2.9 Trade payables at period end EUR 0.4 0.1 Trade payables at period end PLN 2.1 0.1 Trade payables at period end USD 1.2 1.0 3.3 2.2 Ocado Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the 52 weeks ended 2 December 2018 www.

This analysis is based on foreign currency exchange rate variances that the Group considered to be reasonably possible at the end of the period.
The analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.
Interest Rate Risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its floating rate interest bearing borrowings and floating rate cash and cash equivalents.
The Groups interest rate risk policy seeks to minimise finance charges and volatility by structuring the interest rate profile into a diversified portfolio of fixed rate and floating rate financial assets and liabilities.
Interest rate risk on floating rate interest bearing borrowings is not significant.
At the balance sheet date, the interest rate profile of the Groups interest bearing financial instruments was: 2 December 3 December 2018 2017 m m Fixed Rate Instruments Financial assets 408.8 149.5 Financial liabilities 360.6 376.7 Variable Rate Instruments Financial assets 2.0 0.5 Financial liabilities Sensitivity Analysis An increase of 100 basis points 1.0% in interest rates would impact equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown below.
A rate of 100 basis points was assessed as being appropriate, considering the current short-term interest rate outlook.
The calculation applies the increase to average floating rate interest bearing borrowings and cash and cash equivalents existing during the period.
This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant and considers the effect on financial instruments with variable interest rates.

Share Capital and Reserves As at 2 December 2018, the number of ordinary shares available for issue under the Block Listing Facilities was 10,014,711 2017: 12,083,504.
These ordinary shares will only be issued and allotted when the shares under the relevant share incentive plan have vested or the share options under the Groups executive share ownership scheme and non-employee share options and Sharesave schemes have been exercised.
They are therefore not included in the total number of ordinary shares outstanding below.
The reclassification is correcting both the accounting for the reacquisition of bad leaver JSOS interests in 2015 and the inception to date reclassification to retained earnings of gains on disposal of JSOS interests previously recognised in the share premium reserve.
The movements in the called up share capital and share premium accounts are set out below: Ordinary Shares Number of Ordinary Share Shares Shares Premium million m m At 27 November 2016 629.2 12.6 256.9 Issues of ordinary shares 1.1 0.9 Allotted in respect of share option schemes 0.4 0.6 At 3 December 2017 630.7 12.6 258.4 Issues of ordinary shares 65.0 1.3 322.1 Allotted in respect of share option schemes 2.6 0.1 6.2 Reclassification between reserves 0.3 At 2 December 2018 698.3 14.0 587.0 Included in the total number of ordinary shares outstanding above are 6,438,706 2017: 32,803,390 ordinary shares held by the Groups employee benefit trust see note 4.10 b.
The ordinary shares held by the trustee of the Groups employee benefit trust pursuant to the JSOS are treated as treasury shares in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in accordance with IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation.
These ordinary shares have voting rights but these have been waived by the trustee although the trustee may vote in respect of shares that have vested and remain in the trust.
The number of allotted, called up and fully paid shares, excluding treasury shares, at the end of each period differs from that used in the basic loss per share calculation in note 2.10 as basic loss per share is calculated using the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding treasury shares.

Treasury shares cease to be accounted for as such when they are sold outside the Group or the interest is transferred in full to the participant pursuant to the terms of the JSOS.
Participant interests in unexercised shares held by participants are not included in the calculation of treasury shares.
See note 4.10 b for more information on the JSOS.
b Other Reserves The fair value reserve comprises gains and losses on movements in the Groups cash flow hedges, which consist of commodity swaps and foreign currency hedges.
The acquisition by the Company of the entire issued share capital in 2010 of Ocado Limited was accounted for as a reverse acquisition under IFRS 3 revised.
Consequently, the previously recognised book values and assets and liabilities have been retained and the consolidated financial information for the period to 2 December 2018 has been presented as if the Company had always been the parent company of the Group.
4.10 Share Options and Other Equity Instruments Accounting Policies Employee Benefits Employees including Directors of the Group receive part of their remuneration in the form of share-based payments, whereby, depending on the scheme, employees render services in exchange for rights over shares equity-settled transactions or entitlement to a future cash payment cash-settled transactions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured, where appropriate, with reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted.
Where options need to be valued an appropriate valuation model is applied.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The cost of cash-settled transactions is measured with reference to the fair value of the liability, which is taken to be the closing price of the Companys shares.
Until the liability is settled it is remeasured at the end of each reporting period and at the date of settlement, with any changes in the fair value being recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement for the period.
For more details please refer to note 3.12 Provisions Employee Incentive Schemes.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, along with a corresponding increase in equity, over the years in which the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award vesting date.
The cost of cash-settled transactions is recognised, along with a corresponding provision for the expected cash settlement, over the vesting period.
At each reporting date, the cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the number of awards that, in the opinion of management, will ultimately vest.
Managements estimates are based on the best available information at that date.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
The Group has exposure in respect of cash-settled share-based payment transactions and share-based payment transactions with cash alternatives as defined by IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment in respect of bad leaver provisions in the Groups JSOS, the Cash LTIP and the Beauty MIP see note 3.12 Provisions.
National insurance contribution NIC obligations arising from cash-settled schemes and HMRC unapproved equity-settled schemes are treated as if they are cash-settled, regardless of the actual cash equity determination of the scheme itself.
Share Options and Other Equity Instruments The Group operates various employee share incentive schemes, namely the Executive Share Ownership Scheme the ESOS, the Joint Share Ownership Scheme the JSOS, the Sharesave Scheme, the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, the Growth Incentive Plan GIP and the share incentive plan SIP.
The Group also operates two cash-settled incentive schemes, the Cash LTIP and the Beauty MIP.
The total expense for the period relating to employee share-based payment plans was 13.1 million 2017: 6.9 million, of which 6.1 million 2017: 5.3 million related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions and 7.0 million 2017: 1.6 million as a provision for the payment of employers NIC upon allotment of HMRC unapproved equity-settled share schemes, the Cash LTIP and the Beauty MIP see note 3.12 Provisions for further details.
a ESOS The Groups ESOS is an equity-settled share option scheme approved by HMRC.
Options have also been granted under the terms of HMRCs schedule, which is not approved.
The ESOS was established by Ocado in 2001.

The eligible employees to whom options are granted and the terms of such options will be determined by the Directors of Ocado or the trustees.
The employees who are eligible to participate in the ESOS are all Ocados Executive Directors and employees, including the employees of the Companys subsidiaries.
The exercise price of options may not be less than the market value of the Companys shares on the date of grant.
If the trustees or the Directors have determined that the exercise of an option will be satisfied by the issue of ordinary shares, the exercise price may also not be less than the nominal value of ordinary shares.
The Directors of Ocado or the trustees may impose a performance target and any further condition determined to be appropriate on the exercise of an option.
In most cases any performance target must be measured over a period of at least three years.
There are currently no options granted which are subject to performance targets that have not yet been met.
The vesting period for the ESOS is three years.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant or the employee leaves the Group, the options expire subject to a limited number of exceptions.

Prior to the Admission, the market value of the Companys shares was derived based on the market value of similar companies and by taking into account transactions with shareholders during the relevant period.
The Share Valuation Office of HMRC has confirmed in correspondence that in respect of options granted prior to Admission, the exercise price was not less than the market value of the Companys shares at each option grant date.
For exercises during the period, the weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 7.27 2017: 2.83.
In determining the fair value of the share options granted during the period, the BlackScholes Option Pricing Model was used with the following inputs: 2 December 3 December 2018 2017 Weighted average share price 6.18 2.59 Weighted average exercise price 6.18 2.59 Expected volatility 0.40 0.40 Weighted expected life years 3.00 3.00 Weighted average risk-free interest rate 1.0% 0.1% Expected dividend yield 0.0% 0.0% The expected volatility was determined by considering the historical performance of the Companys shares.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
All share awards under the ESOS are equity-settled, apart from employers NIC due on unapproved ESOS awards which is treated as cash-settled.
It is a share ownership scheme under which the Participants and Estera Trust Jersey Limited, the Employee Benefit Trust Trustee, held at the balance sheet date separate beneficial interests in 6,438,706 2017: 32,803,390 ordinary shares which represents 0.9% 2017: 5.2% of the issued share capital of the Company.
Of these ordinary shares, 4,516,292 2017: 79,032 are held by the Employee Benefit Trust on an unallocated basis.
Nature of Interests Interests take the form of a restricted interest in ordinary shares in the Company the Interest.
An Interest permits a Participant to benefit from the increase if any in the value of a number of ordinary shares in the Company Shares over specified threshold amounts.
In order to acquire an Interest, a Participant must enter into a joint share ownership agreement with the Employee Benefit Trust Trustee, under which the Participant and the Employee Benefit Trust Trustee jointly acquire the Shares and agree that once all vesting conditions have been satisfied the Participant is awarded a specific number of Shares equivalent to the benefit achieved, or at their discretion, when the Shares are sold, the Participant has a right to receive a proportion of the sale proceeds insofar as the value of the Shares exceeds the threshold amount.

In prior periods 2,953,675 Shares, in which interests of Participants have lapsed, were reallocated to the third group of Participants under the JSOS scheme JSOS3.
For JSOS1 and JSOS2 there are four tranches, each with their own hurdle price.
For JSOS3 there are two tranches, each with their own hurdle price.
For JSOS2, the price was in a range of 7.1% to 10.8%, and for JSOS3, the price was in a range of 1.47% to 1.70% of the share price at date of issue.
When an Interest vests, the Employee Benefit Trust Trustee will transfer Shares to the Participant of equal value to the Participants Interest or the Shares will be sold and the Employee Benefit Trust Trustee will account to the Participant for the balance, i. e. the difference between the sale proceeds less expenses and the hurdle price.
Vesting Conditions The vesting of the Interests granted to Participants is subject to a time vesting condition, as detailed above.
The fair value of the Interests awarded under the JSOS was determined using the BlackScholes Option Pricing Model.
As per IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment, market-based vesting conditions and the share price target conditions in the JSOS have been taken into account in establishing the fair value of the equity instruments granted.
Other non-market or performance-related conditions were not taken into account in establishing the fair value of equity instruments granted: instead, these non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments included in the measurement of the transaction amount so that ultimately the amount recognised for services received as consideration for the equity instruments granted is based on the number of equity instruments that will eventually vest.
In determining the fair value of the Interests granted, the BlackScholes Option Pricing Model was used with the following inputs: JSOS1 Tranche 1 Tranche 2 Tranche 3 Tranche 4 Weighted average share price 1.35 1.35 1.35 1.35 Weighted average exercise price 1.73 1.91 2.08 2.28 Expected volatility 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25 Weighted expected life years 0.91 1.91 2.91 3.91 Risk-free interest rate 3.5% 3.5% 3.5% 3.5% Expected dividend yield 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% JSOS2 Tranche 1 Tranche 2 Tranche 3 Tranche 4 Weighted average share price 1.70 1.70 1.70 1.70 Weighted average exercise price 1.96 2.15 2.36 2.59 Expected volatility 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25 Weighted expected life years 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 Risk-free interest rate 3.5% 3.5% 3.5% 3.5% Expected dividend yield 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% Expected volatility was determined by comparing the Company to a basket of others of a similar size or which operate in a similar industry.
As the Interests in JSOS3 were reallocated from lapsed Interests in JSOS1 and JSOS2, the fair value of those Interests had been calculated in prior periods using the inputs disclosed in the tables above.

The number of awards issued are calculated based on a percentage of the participants salaries and will vest at the end of a period of three years from the grant date.
The final number and proportion of awards expected to vest will depend on achievement of certain performance conditions.
For both the 2015 LTIP and the 2016 LTIP, there are four equally weighted performance conditions, which are operational efficiency and capital efficiency metrics related to the retail business and the platform business, the Groups retail business revenue and the Groups retail business earnings before tax for the financial year ended 3 December 2017, and financial year ending 2 December 2018 respectively.
For the 2017 LTIP, there are four equally weighted performance conditions based on performance in the 2019 financial year, which are operational efficiency related to the retail business, Ocado Smart Platform sales target, the Groups retail business revenue and the Groups retail business earnings before tax.
For the 2018 LTIP, there are four equally weighted performance conditions based on performance in the 2020 financial year, which are Ocado Smart Platform efficiency target, the Ocado Solutions revenue target, the Groups retail business revenue target and Groups retail business earnings before interest and tax.
The number of awards issued, adjusted to reflect the achievement of the performance conditions, will then vest during 2019 for the 2016 LTIP, 2020 for the 2017 LTIP and 2021 for the 2018 LTIP, with the exception of awards issued to the Executive Directors which have a two year holding period and will be released in 2023.
Full vesting will only therefore occur where exceptional performance levels have been achieved and significant shareholder value created.
An award will lapse if a participant ceases to be employed within the Group before the vesting date.
A summary of the status of the LTIP as at 2 December 2018 and changes during the year is presented below: Number Number of of Share Share Awards Awards 2 December 3 December 2018 2017 Outstanding at the beginning of the period 4,308,708 3,151,610 Granted during the period 927,102 1,829,906 Forfeited during the period 741,585 Vested during the period 247,188 672,808 Outstanding at the end of the period 4,247,037 4,308,708 There were no awards exercisable as at 2 December 2018 and as at 3 December 2017.

These awards will vest in 2019.
Performance will be assessed based on the three-month average share price of the Company and the FTSE 100 Share Index at the end of the performance period in comparison to the three-month average share price of the Company and the FTSE 100 Share Index prior to the start of the performance period.
In determining the fair value of the awards granted, a unique Monte Carlo model was used with the following inputs: Weighted average share price 3.19 Value of FTSE 100 Index 6,389.25 Expected correlation 29% Expected volatility of Company 40% Expected volatility of FTSE 100 Index 16% Weighted expected life years 5.0 Risk-free rate 1.96% Expected dividend yield 0% Valuation model Monte Carlo Pricing Expected correlation was determined with reference to the share price correlation of the shares in the Company and the FTSE 100 Index over a period commensurate with the terms of the award i. e. five years.
Expected volatility of the Company was determined by comparing the Company to others of a similar size or which operate in a similar industry.
Expected volatility of the FTSE 100 Index was determined by reference to its historical volatility over a period commensurate with the terms of the award i. e. five years.
Volatility is a key estimate in determining the fair value of the GIP award, as the overall charge is most sensitive to changes in this assumption.
Management have had regard to an appropriate range of alternative volatility assumptions, and concluded that a change in the volatility within this range would not have a material impact on the financial statements.
The use of the Monte Carlo model and calculation of the associated input parameters requires judgement.
Therefore management obtained professional advice to assist in determining the fair value of the awards granted.

This HMRC approved scheme provides all employees, including Executive Directors, the opportunity to receive and invest in Company shares.
All SIP shares are held in a SIP Trust, administered by Yorkshire Building Society.
There are two elements in the plan the Buy As You Earn BAYE arrangement and the Free Share Award.
Under the BAYE, participants can purchase shares in the Company Partnership Shares each month using contributions from pre-tax pay, subject to an upper limit.
For every seven shares purchased, the Company gifts the participant one free share Matching Shares.
Under the Free Shares Award, shares are given to eligible employees, as a proportion of their annual base pay, subject to a maximum.
Eligible employees are those with six months service as at the grant date.
For Partnership Shares, eligible employees are those with three months service.
Partnership shares can be withdrawn from the Plan Trust at any time: however, Matching Shares and Free Shares are subject to a three-year holding period, during which continuous employment within the Group is required.
The Matching Shares and Free Shares will be forfeited if any corresponding Partnership Shares are removed from the Plan Trust within this three-year period, or if the participant leaves Ocado.

A A is calculated as total debt obligations under The Board closely manages trading capital, defined as net assets plus net cash debt.
Net cash debt finance leases and borrowings as shown in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, less cash and cash equivalents.
The Groups net assets at the end of the A period were 556.6 million 2017: 247.6 million and it had net cash of 50.2 million 2017: 228.0 million net debt.
The main areas of capital management revolve around working capital management and compliance with externally imposed financial covenants.
The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern and balance the needs of the Group to grow, whilst operating with sufficient headroom within its bank covenants.
The components of working capital management include monitoring inventory turn, age of inventory, age of receivables, receivables days, payables days, balance sheet re-forecasting, period projected profit loss, weekly cash flow forecasts and daily cash balances.
Major investment decisions are based on reviewing the expected future cash flows and all major capital expenditure requires approval by the Board.
There were no changes in the Groups approach to capital management during the period.
In the current year the Group has 250 million 2017: 250 million of finance through the issue of senior secured notes with a fixed coupon rate of 4% and a maturity date of seven years.
In the prior year, the 210 million RCF was reduced to 100 million and extended by a further three years to 2022.
The funds from the senior secured notes issue have been used to pay down existing debt, including the 87.5 million previously drawn on the RCF.
The remaining funds will be used for capital expenditure to increase capacity.
Throughout the period, the Group has complied with all covenants imposed by lenders.
In addition, a key aspect of capital management was the strategic operating agreement with Morrisons and the operation of MHE JVCo, a company jointly owned with Morrisons, discussed in note 5.1.
Given the Groups commitment to expand the business and the investment required to complete future CFCs, the declaration and payment of a dividend is not part of the short-term capital management strategy of the Group.
At the Balance Sheet date, the Groups undrawn facilities and cash and cash equivalents were as follows: 2 December 3 December 2018 2017 Notes m m Total facilities available 509.4 511.5 Facilities drawn down 4.2 360.6 378.0 Undrawn facilities at end of period 148.8 133.5 Cash and cash equivalents 3.10 410.8 150.0 559.6 283.5 In the prior year, the unsecured 210 million revolving facility was reduced to 100 million and extended by three years to 2022.
The undrawn facility at the end of the period, includes transaction costs.

As at 2 December 2018 the unsecured 100 million revolving facility has not been utilised.
Transaction costs of 5.7 million 2017: 6.7 million relating to the senior secured notes have been capitalised.
