Notes to the Financial Statements 1.
Operating Segments The Group has two reportable segments, Retail and Car Servicing, which are the Groups strategic business units.
Car Servicing became a reporting segment of the Group as a result of the acquisition of Nationwide Autocentres on 17 February 2010.
The strategic business units offer different products and services, and are managed separately because they require different operational, technological and marketing strategies.
The operations of the Retail reporting segment comprise the retailing of automotive, leisure and cycling products through retail stores.
The operations of the Car Servicing reporting segment comprise car servicing and repair performed from Autocentres.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker is the Executive Directors.
Internal management reports for each of the segments are reviewed by the Executive Directors on a monthly basis.
Key measures used to evaluate performance are Revenue and Operating Profit.
Management believe that these measures are the most relevant in evaluating the performance of the segment and for making resource allocation decisions.
The following summary describes the operations in each of the Groups reportable segments.
Performance is measured based on segment operating profit, as included in the management reports that are reviewed by the Executive Directors.
These internal reports are prepared in accordance with IFRS accounting policies consistent with these Group Financial Statements.
All material operations of the reportable segments are carried out in the UK and all material non-current assets are located in the UK.
The Groups revenue is driven by the consolidation of individual small value transactions and as a result Group revenue is not reliant on a major customer or group of customers.
All revenue is from external customers.

This will reduce the Companys future current tax charge accordingly.
The deferred tax asset at 30 March 2018 has been calculated based on the rate of 17% substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The effective tax rate of 18.5% 2017: 21.0% is higher than the UK corporation tax rate principally due to the non-deductibility of depreciation charged on capital expenditure and non-deductible amortisation of intangible assets.
The tax charge for the period was 12.4m 2017: 15.0m, including a 0.8m credit 2017: 0.9m credit in respect of tax on non-recurring items.
An income tax credit of 0.2m 2017: 0.5m credit on other comprehensive income relates to the movement in fair valuing forward currency contracts outstanding at the year end.
No other items within other comprehensive income have a tax impact.
In addition to the above, a nil current tax debit 2017: 0.6m credit and a nil deferred tax credit 2017: 0.6m credit is recognised in reserves in relation to employee share options.
The Group engages openly and proactively with tax authorities both in the UK and internationally, where it trades and sources products, and is considered low risk by HM Revenue & Customs HMRC.
The Company is fully committed to complying with all of its tax payment and reporting obligations.
In this period, the Groups contribution from both taxes paid and collected exceeded 168m 2017: 160m with the main taxes including corporation tax of 16.1m 2017: 15.3m, net VAT of 67.2m 2017: 59.0m, employment taxes of 47.3m 2017: 48.3m and business rates of 37.5m 2017: 37.3m.

It will be paid on 31 August 2018 to shareholders who are on the register of members on 27 July 2018.
Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.
The weighted average number of shares excludes shares held by an Employee Benefit Trust see note 22 and has been adjusted for the issue purchase of shares during the period.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the 52 weeks to 30 March 2018.
The Group has also chosen to present an alternative earnings per share measure, underlying earnings per share, with profit adjusted for nonrecurring items because it better reflects the Groups underlying performance.
This measure is defined on page 151.

Product rights of 0.2m, which are fully amortised, have been included within brand names and trademarks.
Goodwill of 253.1m arose on the acquisition of Halfords Holdings Limited by the Company on 31 August 2002 and is allocated to the Retail segment.
The goodwill relates to a portfolio of sites within the UK which management monitors on an overall basis as a group of cashgenerating units being Retail.
Goodwill of 69.7m arose on the acquisition of Nationwide Autocentres on 17 February 2010 and is allocated to the Car Servicing segment.
The goodwill relates to a portfolio of centres within the UK which management monitors on an overall basis as a group of cash-generating units being Car Servicing.
Goodwill of 10.7m arose on the acquisition of Boardman Bikes Limited and Boardman International Limited on 4 June 2014 and is allocated to the Retail segment.
The goodwill relates to the two Boardman entities which management monitors on an overall basis as part of the Retail cash-generating unit.
Goodwill of 9.5m arose on the acquisition of Tredz Limited and Wheelies Direct Limited on 23 May 2016 and is allocated to the Retail segment.
The goodwill relates to the two entities which management monitors on an overall basis as part of the Retail cash-generating unit.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of the Nationwide Autocentres is attributable to a future income to be generated from new retail, fleet customer contracts and related relationships, b the workforce, c the value of immaterial other intangible assets, and d operating synergies.
The goodwill on acquisition of the Boardman Bikes is attributable to a operating synergies and increased control of operations, b the value of immaterial other intangible assets, and c future income to be generated from new retail customer contracts and related relationships.
The goodwill on acquisition of Tredz and Wheelies is attributable to a assembled workforce and b future expansion and growth opportunities.
The recoverable amount of goodwill is determined based on value-in-use calculations for each of the two groups of cash-generating units, being Retail and Car Servicing.
This is the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, which is not higher than the Groups operating segments as reported in Note 1.
The value-in-use of the goodwill held at 30 March 2018 and 31 March 2017 is driven by, and is most sensitive to, the key assumptions underlying the recoverable amounts of the Group cash-generating units, which are the discount rate and growth rate.
Cash flow projections are based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five-year period, which are reviewed by the board.
Budgets are based on both past performance and expectations for future market development, linked to the strategy of the Group as set out in the Strategic Report section in these financial statements.
The growth rates used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budget period, as set out in the table on the next page, do not exceed long-term industry averages and reflect the revenue growth and ongoing efficiency initiatives, and the relative maturity of the Retail and Autocentres businesses.

Intangible Assets continued The discount rate is a pre-tax rate that reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cashgenerating units.
The pre-tax discount rates used to calculate value in use are derived from the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital, as adjusted for the specific risks relating to each cash-generating unit.
The discount rates used are shown below.
Retail Car Servicing Notes 2018 2017 2018 2017 Discount rate 1 9.5% 9.1% 9.5% 9.1% Growth rate 2 0.0% 0.0% 1.0% 1.0% Notes: 1 Pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections the prior year numbers above have been updated to also show the pre-tax rate.
2 Growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the five year budget period.
Sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions in the value-in-use calculations has been undertaken, which found that there is a more than adequate amount of headroom before an impairment would be triggered.
As stated in the Audit Committee report on page 76, the key judgement relates to the Car Servicing business.
The Directors are confident that a reasonably possible change in the key assumptions, including a 1.0% change in the discount rate and a -1.0% change in the growth rate, would not cause the carrying amounts to exceed the estimated recoverable amounts.
Overall, the Directors have concluded that the recoverable value of the Groups CGUs exceeded their carrying amount.

Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures continued The fair values of each class of financial assets and liabilities is the carrying amount, based on the following assumptions: Trade receivables, trade payables and finance lease The fair value approximates to the carrying amount because of the short obligations, short-term deposits and borrowings maturity of these instruments, using an interest rate of 7.1% for long-term finance lease obligations.
Long-term borrowings The fair value of bank loans and other loans approximates to the carrying value reported in the balance sheet as the majority are floating rate where payments are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.
Forward currency contracts The fair value is determined using the market forward rates at the reporting date and the outright contract rate.
Fair Value Hierarchy Financial instruments carried at fair value are required to be measured by reference to the following levels: Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All financial instruments carried at fair value have been measured by a Level 2 valuation method, except for the investment in Tyres On The Drive, as shown in Note 13, which is valued at Level 3. c. Financial Risk Management The Group has exposure to the following risks arising from financial instruments: Credit risk Liquidity risk: and Market risk.
i Risk Management framework The Companys Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The Board of Directors are responsible for establishing the Groups risk management policies.
The Groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are regularly reviewed to reflect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to maintain a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The Group Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
The Group Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by internal audit.
Internal audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
ii Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was 55.4m 2017: 50.2m as detailed in the tables above.
Impairment losses on financial assets recognised in profit or loss were as follows: 52 weeks to 52 weeks to 30 March 31 March m 2018 2017 Impairment loss on trade and other receivables 0.5 0.3 Impairment loss on cash and cash equivalents 0.5 0.3 132 Halfords Group plc Integrated Annual Report for the period ended 30 March 2018 25675 8 June 2018 3:44 PM Proof 10 21.
Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures continued Trade receivables The Group does not have any individually significant customers and so no significant concentration of credit risk.
The majority of the Groups sales are paid in cash at point of sale which further limits the Groups exposure The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The Board of Directors has established a credit policy under which each new customer is analysed individually for creditworthiness before the Groups standard payment terms and conditions are offered.
The Group limits its exposure to credit risk from trade receivables by establishing a maximum payment period of one month for customers.
All trade receivables are based in the United Kingdom.
The Group has taken into account the historic credit losses incurred on trade receivables and adjusted it for forward looking estimates.
The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables during the year was 0.2m.
Cash and cash equivalents The Group held cash and cash equivalents of 27.0m at 30 March 2018 2017: 16.5m.
The cash and cash equivalents are held with bank and financial institution counterparties which are designated Aby Standard & Poor and Fitch and A3 by Moodys.
The Group does not consider there to be any impairment loss in respect of these balances 2017: nil.
Derivatives The derivatives are entered into with bank and financial institutions counterparties which are designated at least BBB by Standard & Poor and Fitch and Baa3 by Moodys.
iii Market risk The Groups exposure to market risk predominantly relates to interest, currency and commodity risk.
These are discussed further below.
Commodity risk is due to the Groups products being manufactured from metals and other raw materials, subject to price fluctuation.
The Group mitigates this risk through negotiating fixed purchase costs or maintaining flexibility over the specification of finished products produced by its supply chain to meet fluctuations.
Foreign currency risk The Group has a significant transaction exposure with increasing direct-sourced purchases from its suppliers in the Far East, with most of the trade being in US Dollars.
The Groups policy is to manage the foreign exchange transaction exposures of the business to ensure the actual costs do not exceed the budget costs by more than 10% excluding increases in the base cost of the product.
The Group does not hedge either economic exposure or the translation exposure arising from the profits, assets and liabilities of non-sterling businesses whilst they remain immaterial.
The Group determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of their respective cash flows.
The Group assesses whether the derivative designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be and has been effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedging item using the hypothetical derivative method.
In these hedge relationships, the main sources of ineffectiveness are: The effect of the counterparty and Groups own credit risk on the fair value of the forward exchange contracts, which is not reflected in the change in the fair value of the hedged cash flows attributable to the change in exchange rates: and Changes in the timing of the hedged item.
During the 52 weeks to 30 March 2018, the foreign exchange management policy was to hedge via forward contract purchase between 75% and 100% of the material foreign exchange transaction exposures on a rolling 18-month basis.
Hedging is performed through the use of foreign currency bank accounts and forward foreign exchange contracts.
At 30 March 2018, the Group held the following instruments to hedge exposures to changes in foreign currency: Maturity 1 6 6 12 More than Forward exchange contracts months months one year Net exposure in m 119.3 46.8 27.0 Average GBP:USD forward contract rate 1.3483 1.3647 1.3891 At 31 March 2017, the Group held the following instruments to hedge exposures to changes in foreign currency: Maturity 1 6 6 12 More than Forward exchange contracts months months one year Net exposure in m 134.9 53.3 17.5 Average GBP:USD forward contract rate 1.3095 1.2751 1.2570 STOCK CODE: HFD halfords.

Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures continued The amounts at the reporting date relating to items designated as hedged items were as follows: Balances remaining in the cash Change in value used flow hedge reserve from hedging for calculating hedge Cash flow relationships for which hedge ineffectiveness hedge reserve accounting is no longer applied Forward currency risk m m m At 30 March 2018 Inventory purchases 20.1 5.1 At 31 March 2017 Inventory purchases 21.5 3.7 The carrying amount of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date is as follows: 30 March 2018 31 March 2017 USD Other USD Other m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 0.2 0.5 4.3 0.2 Trade and other payables 23.8 0.9 27.0 0.8 23.6 0.4 22.7 0.6 The table below shows the Groups sensitivity to foreign exchange rates on its US dollar financial instruments, the major currency in which the Groups derivatives are denominated.
2018 2017 Increase Increase decrease in decrease in equity equity m m 10% appreciation of the US dollar 15.3 18.3 10% depreciation of the US dollar 12.5 14.9 A strengthening weakening of Sterling, as indicated, against the USD at 30 March 2018 would have increased decreased equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown above.
This analysis is based on foreign currency exchange rate variances that the Group considered to be reasonably possible at the end of the reporting period.
The analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.
The movements in equity relates to the fair value movements on the Groups forward contracts that are used to hedge future stock purchases.
Interest rate risk The Groups policy aims to manage the interest cost of the Group within the constraints of the Business Plan and its financial covenants.
The Groups borrowings are currently subject to floating rate interest rates and the Group will continue to monitor movements in the swap market.
If interest rates on floating rate borrowings i. e. cash and cash equivalents and bank borrowings which attract interest at floating rates were to change by or 1% the impact on the results in the Income Statement and equity would be a decrease increase of 0.6m 2017: 0.4m.
Interest rate movements on deposits, obligations under finance leases, trade payables, trade receivables, and other financial instruments do not present a material exposure to the Groups balance sheet.
Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Group manages capital by operating within a debt ratio, which is calculated as the ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA.
134 Halfords Group plc Integrated Annual Report for the period ended 30 March 2018 25675 8 June 2018 3:44 PM Proof 10 21.
Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures continued Pension liability risk The Group has no association with any defined-benefit pension scheme and therefore carries no deferred, current or future liabilities in respect of such a scheme.
The Group operates a number of Group Personal Pension Plans for colleagues.
Liquidity risk The Group ensures that it has sufficient cash or loan facilities to meet all its commitments when they fall due by ensuring that there is sufficient cash or working capital facilities to meet the cash requirements of the Group for the current Business Plan.
The minimum liquidity level is currently set at 30m, such that under Treasury Policy the maximum drawings would be 170m of the 200m available facility, to include the Overdraft Facility of 20m.
The process to manage the risk is to ensure there are contracts in place for key suppliers, detailing the payment terms, and for providers of debt, the Group ensured that such counterparties used for credit transactions held at least an Acredit rating at the time of the amend and extend agreement September 2017.
The Group may, subject to Board approval in any and every such incidence, allow a counterparty to have a credit rating of less than A but no less than investment grade at the time of signing the facilities on the basis that the counterparty only has a junior role in the debt syndicate and has zero ancillary business until if when its credit rating is designated A-.
At the year-end the senior banks within the banking group maintained a credit rating of Aor above, in line with Treasury policy, with the junior bank holding a credit rating of BB.
The counterparty credit risk is reviewed by the Chief Financial Officer regularly as part of the Treasury Committee process.
In addition, the Head of Tax & Treasury reviews credit exposure on a daily basis.
The risk is measured through review of forecast liquidity each month by the Head of Tax & Treasury to determine whether there are sufficient credit facilities to meet forecast requirements, and through monitoring covenants on a regular basis to ensure there are no significant breaches, which would lead to an Event of Default.
Calculations are submitted bi-annually to the Group banking agent.
There have been no breaches of covenants during the reported periods.
The contractual maturities of finance leases are disclosed in Note 12.
All trade and other payables are due within one year.
The contractual maturity of bank borrowings, including estimated interest payments and excluding the impact of netting agreements is shown below: 30 March 31 March 2018 2017 Bank Bank borrowings borrowings m m Due less than one year 1.1 1.1 Expiring between one and two years 1.3 1.1 Expiring between two and five years 85.0 73.7 Expiring after five years Contractual cash flows 87.4 75.9 Carrying amount 83.7 72.0 The following table provides an analysis of the anticipated contractual cash flows for the Groups forward currency contracts.

Halfords Company Share Option Scheme The CSOS was introduced in June 2004 and the Company has made annual grants up to and including the prior year.
Options were granted with a fixed exercise price equal to the market price of the shares under option at the date of grant.
The contractual life of an option is 10 years.
Options granted before August 2013 became exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to the achievement of a threeyear performance condition.
For grants up to 150% of basic salary the options can only be exercised if the increase in earnings per share EPS over the period is not less than the increase in the Retail Price Index RPI plus 3.5% per year.
In the case of grants in excess of 150% of basic salary, the excess can only be exercised in full if the increase is not less than RPI plus 10% per year.
Exercise of an option is subject to continued employment.
Changes to the performance criteria of the CSOS scheme in relation to the awards granted from August 2013 onwards were made by the Remuneration Committee.
These changes were made in order to create better alignment with Groups three-year strategic priorities following the Moving Up A Gear programme.
The awards are dependent on EBITDA performance and are only exercisable if EBITDA growth exceeds a compound annual growth rate of 2.5% over the three-year performance period, or a total growth rate of 8.4%.
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of a peer group of companies since the IPO in June 2004.
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds.
Options were valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing models.
No performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations.

Management Share plan MSP In the year the CSOS was replaced by the MSP.
Nil cost options have been granted which can be exercised on or after the third anniversary of the date on which they are granted.
The option cannot be exercised later than 10 years from the date on which it was granted.
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of a peer group of companies.
Halfords Sharesave Scheme The SAYE is open to all employees with eligible employment service.
Options may be exercised under the scheme if the option holder completes their saving contract for a period of three years and then not more than six months thereafter.
Special provisions allow early exercise in the case of death, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or because the company or business which employs the option holder is transferred out of the Group, or in the event of a change in control, reconstruction or winding up of the Company.
Performance Share Plan The introduction of a Performance Share Plan PSP was approved at the Annual General Meeting in August 2005 awarding the Executive Directors and certain senior management conditional rights to receive shares.
Annual schemes have been approved for each year from 2005.
For 2009 awards onwards, the Committee has recommended the reinvestment of dividends earned on award shares, such shares to invest in proportion to the vesting of the original award shares.
This is in line with best practice as contained in the ABI guidelines on executive remuneration.
The shares awarded under the Performance Share Plan in 2013, 2015 and 2016 earned final dividends of 11.68p per share and were reinvested in shares at a cost of 3.17 per share.
Shares awarded in 2013, 2015, 2016 and 2017 under the PSP earned interim dividends of 6.0p per share and were reinvested in shares at a cost of 3.52 per share.
The current PSP performance criteria is weighted 25% towards Group revenue growth targets and 75% towards Group EPS growth targets.
In order to focus management the awards will be underpinned by the Remuneration Committee determining whether, in its opinion, the extent to which the performance conditions have been satisfied is a genuine reflection of the Companys underlying financial performance and has generated value for Companys shareholders over the performance period, and by a net debt to EBITDA ratio no greater than 1.5x throughout the three-year performance period.
For other senior participants conditions are based on the performance of the individual business units.
The awards are weighted 37.5% towards Group EPS growth targets, 12.5% weighted towards Group revenue growth targets and 50% weighted toward EBIT of the individual business unit.
