184 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements 1 Segment reporting IFRS 8 requires segment reporting to be based on the internal financial information reported to the chief operating decision maker.
The Groups chief operating decision maker isdeemed to be the ExCo whose primary responsibility is to support the CEO in managing the Groups day-to-day operations and analyse trading performance.
The Groups segments comprise Vanquis Bank, CCD, Moneybarn and Central which are those segments reported in the Groups management accounts used by the ExCo as the primary means for analysing trading performance.
The ExCo assesses profit performance using profit before tax measured on a basis consistent with the disclosure intheGroup financial statements.

The intangible asset was calculated based on the discounted cash flows associated with Moneybarns core broker relationships and is being amortised over an estimated useful life of 10 years.
The amortisation charge in 2018 amounted to 7.5m 2017: 7.5m.
Exceptional items comprise: 2018 2017 m m CCD costs in respect of the migration to the new home credit operating model 29.9 32.5 Premium and fees on redemption of senior bond see note 3 18.5 Pension charges in respect of GMP equalisation see note 19 6.9 Estimated costs of settlement of the FCA investigation into ROP at Vanquis Bank see note 24 172.1 Estimated costs of settlement of the FCA investigation at Moneybarn see note 24 20.0 Total exceptional items 55.3 224.6 Exceptional charges of 55.3m 2017: 224.6m have been recognised in 2018 comprising: i 29.9m in respect of intangible and tangible asset write offs, redundancy and consultancy costs associated with the implementation of the home credit recovery plan following the poor execution of the migration to the new operating model in July 2017 2017: 32.5m : ii 18.5m in respect of the 8% premium and fees paid on the redemption of 89% of the 250m senior bonds maturing in October 2019 2017: nil and iii 6.9m of non-cash pension charges in respect of the equalisation of Guaranteed Minimum Pensions following the High Court judgement against Lloyds Bank PLC and others in October 2018 2017: nil.
2017 exceptional costs also included 172.1m following the resolution of the FCA investigation into ROP in Vanquis Bank and 20.0m in respect of the FCA investigation into affordability, forbearance and termination options at Moneybarn.
All of the above activities relate to continuing operations.
Revenue between business segments is not material.

Due to the significant losses incurred by CCD in 2017, CCDs statutory net assets are now considerably lower than the Groups target capital ratio.
As a result, the presentation of segment net assets has been adjusted to show the statutory assets, liabilities and netassets of each of the Groups divisions.
This results in an intra group elimination reflecting the difference between the central intra-group funding provided to the divisions andthe external funding raised centrally.
Comparatives have been restated onto a similar basis which has resulted in CCDs net assets at 31 December 2017 reducing from 180.1m to 112.6m and central net assets increasing from 16.9m to 84.4m.
Vanquis Bank segment net assets have increased due to profit generated in the year and a 50.0m increase in capital from the Company following the rights issue, partly offset bythe adoption of iFRS 9 on net assets.
CCD segment net assets have reduced due to the adoption of IFRS 9 and the loss generated in the year.
Moneybarn segment net assets have decreased due to adoption of IFRS 9 partly offset by profit generated in the year.
Central net assets have increased predominantly due to the net proceeds of the rights issue.
185 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Financial statements 1 Segment reporting continued The Groups businesses operate principally in the UK and Republic of Ireland.
The acquired intangible asset in respect of Moneybarns broker relationships is held on consolidation and, therefore, the amortisation charge has been allocated to central in the above analysis, consistent with the segment net asset analysis.
2 Revenue Revenue is recognised by applying the effective interest rate EIR to the carrying value of a loan.
The EIR is calculated at inception and represents the rate which exactly discounts the future contractual cash receipts from a loan to the amount of cash advanced under that loan, plus directly attributable issue costs e. g. aggregator broker fees.
In addition, in Moneybarn the EIR takes account of customers repaying early and in CCD customers repaying early or beyond term, but who have not defaulted.
Fee income is recognised atthetime the charges are made to the customer on the basis the performance is complete.
As a result, the introduction of IFRS 15, effective from 1 January 2018, has not had amaterial impact on the Group or Company.
Group 2018 2017 IFRS 9 IAS 39 m m Interest income 976.9 1,047.5 Fee income 147.5 148.8 Total revenue 1,124.4 1,196.3 All fee income earned relates to Vanquis Bank and Moneybarn.
Interest income relates to the interest charges on Vanquis Bank credit cards and Moneybarn conditional sale agreements together with the service charge on home credit and Satsuma loans.
Fee income relates to Vanquis Bank and Moneybarn and predominantly reflects default and over-limit fees as well as other ancillary income streams such as ROP fees within Vanquis Bank.
Interchange income is also recognised within Vanquis Bank as part of fee income on an accruals basis.
Fee income in 2018 represented 22% 2017: 23% of Vanquis Bank revenue and 1% 2017: 1% of Moneybarn revenue.
3 Finance costs Group 2018 2017 Interest payable on: m m Bank borrowings 11.0 10.7 Senior public and retail bonds 29.1 36.0 Private placement loan notes 3.7 5.0 Retail deposits 29.4 25.3 Exceptional premium and fees on redemption of senior bond note 1 18.5 Total finance costs 91.7 77.0 The Groups blended funding rate in 2018 was 4.4%, down from 4.5% in 2017.
This primarily reflects a lower average blended rate on retail deposits and the increased mix of retail deposits.
Retail deposits represent approximately 70% of the Groups funding at the end of 2018 compared with approximately 59% in 2017 as Vanquis Bank is now fully funded through retail deposits.
The all-in blended cost of taking retail deposits in 2018, after the cost of holding a liquid assets buffer and other liquid resources in adherence with the PRAs liquidity regime, and an operation buffer, was 3.3% 2017: 2.9%.
Interest cover continues to be one of the Groups banking covenants.
It is calculated as IAS 39 profit before tax and exceptional items, interest and amortisation divided by finance costs, and has a minimum requirement of 2.0 times.
Interest cover, prior to exceptional items, in 2018 was 3.2 times compared with 2.6 times in 2017.
The increase in this measure reflects the impact of the significant trading disruption within the home credit business during 2017.

The tax credit in 2017 comprised: i tax relief of 6.3m in respect of the estimated balance reductions and restitution payable to Moneybarn customers in respect of the FCA investigation and administration costs in respect of the FCA investigation into ROP in Vanquis Bank: and ii tax of 8.7m at the combined mainstream corporation tax and bank corporation tax surcharge rates of 27.25% on the 10% deemed taxable receipt on the settlements payable to customers as part of the settlement 187 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Financial statements 5 Tax charge continued of the FCA investigation into ROP in Vanquis Bank which are treated as bank compensation payments and the release of the related impairment provision.
The tax credit in respect of the amortisation of acquisition intangibles amounts to 1.3m 2017: 1.4m.
The effective tax rate for 2018, prior to the amortisation of acquisition intangibles and exceptional items, is 27.3% 2017: 15.1%.
The increase in the rate principally reflects a tax credit in 2017 in respect of prior years, including a release of part of the provision for uncertain tax liabilities.
In addition to the introduction of bank corporation tax surcharge with effect from 1 January 2016, during 2015, changes were also enacted reducing the mainstream corporation tax rate from 20% to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017 and from 19% to 18% with effect from 1 April 2020.
In 2016, a further change was enacted, which further reduced the mainstream corporation tax rate from 18% to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020.
Deferred tax balances at 31 December 2018 have been measured at 17% 2017: 17% and, in the case of Vanquis Bank, at the combined mainstream UK corporation tax and bank corporation tax surcharge rates of 25% 2017: 25% to the extent that the temporary differences on which deferred tax has been calculated are expected to reverse after 1 April 2020 2017: 1 April 2020.
In 2018, movements in deferred tax balances have been measured at the mainstream corporation tax rate for the year of 19.00% 2017: 19.25%, and, in the case of Vanquis Bank, at the combined mainstream UK corporation tax and bank corporation tax surcharge rates for the year of 27.00% 2017: 27.25%.
A tax charge of 0.6m 2017: credit of 0.6m represents the income statement adjustment to deferred tax as a result of these changes and an additional deferred tax charge of 0.7m 2017: credit of 0.3m has been taken directly to other comprehensive income in respect of items reflected directly in other comprehensive income.
Group 2018 2017 IFRS 9 IAS 39 Tax credit charge on items taken directly to other comprehensive income m m Deferred tax charge on fair value movement in investment 0.5 0.4 Deferred tax credit charge on actuarial movements on retirement benefit asset 4.1 3.4 Tax credit charge on items taken directly to other comprehensive income prior to impact of change in UK tax rate 3.6 3.8 Impact of change in UK tax rate 0.7 0.3 Total tax credit charge on items taken directly to other comprehensive income 2.9 3.5 The deferred tax charge of 0.5m 2017: 0.4m on the fair value movements in investments represents the deferred tax at the combined mainstream corporation tax and bank corporation tax surcharge rates of 27.0% 2017: 27.25% on the change in the valuation of the Visa Inc. preferred stock during the year.
The rate of tax charge on the profit 2017: loss before taxation for the year is higher than 2017: higher than the average rate of mainstream corporation tax in the UK of 19.00% 2017: 19.25%.
This can be reconciled as follows: Group 2018 2017 IFRS 9 IAS 39 m m Profit loss before taxation 90.7 123.0 Profit loss before taxation multiplied by the average rate of mainstream corporation tax in the UK of 19.00% 2017: 19.25% 17.2 23.7 Effects of: impact of lower tax rates overseas 0.4 0.1 adjustment in respect of prior years 1.2 22.5 non-deductible general expenses 0.1 0.2 impact of change in UK tax rate 0.6 0.6 tax rate difference on tax losses carried back to prior years 0.6 write off of deferred tax asset in relation to share-based payment reserve 0.9 non-deductible bank compensation expenses 35.3 additional 10% of bank compensation expenses 3.5 non-deductible fines and expenses 1.2 impact of bank corporation tax surcharge 13.3 17.8 Total tax charge 30.4 11.4 The home credit business in the Republic of Ireland is subject to tax at the Republic of Ireland statutory tax rate of 12.5% 2017: 12.5% rather than the UK statutory mainstream corporation tax rate of 19.00% 2017: 19.25%.
In 2018, the home credit business in the Republic of Ireland made a loss 2017: profit which can only be relieved against profits of the business in the Republic of Ireland at the 12.5% statutory tax rate rather than the 19.00% UK statutory tax rate.
This gives rise to an adverse impact on the Group tax charge of 0.4m 2017: beneficial impact of0.1m.
188 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 5 Tax charge continued The 1.2m credit 2017: 22.5m credit in respect of prior years represents the benefit of resolving historic tax liabilities, securing tax deductions for employee share awards which are higher than those originally anticipated and, in the case of 2017, the release of part of the provision for uncertain tax liabilities which is no longer required.
The 0.6m adverse impact 2017: 0.6m beneficial impact on the tax charge due to the change in UK tax rate arises because movements in deferred tax balances during the year have been measured at the mainstream corporation tax rate for the year of 19.0% 2017: 19.25%, and, in the case of Vanquis Bank, at the combined mainstream UK corporation tax and bank corporation tax surcharge rates for the year of 27.0% 2017: 27.25% whereas deferred tax balances at 31 December 2018 have been measured at 17% 2017: 17% and, in the case of Vanquis Bank, at the combined mainstream UK corporation tax and bank corporation tax surcharge rates of 25% 2017: 25%.
In 2017, the 0.6m impact of the change in UK tax rate on tax losses carried back represents the benefit of carrying back 2017 tax losses in CCD to 2016 when the higher mainstream corporation tax rate of 20% applied.
Deferred tax assets are typically recognised on share-based payment charges on the basis that these represent a good estimate of the tax relief that will be available when the share awards vest.
In 2017, the write off of the deferred tax asset of 0.9m 2018: nil represents the reduction in tax relief expected to arise because of the reduction in the share price, where such reduction in share price has not been reflected through the share-based payments charges.
The settlements payable to Vanquis Bank customers in 2017 following the resolution with the FCA are, in accordance with the bank compensation provisions which apply to banking companies, non-deductible in computing Vanquis Banks profits for tax purposes.
This gave rise to an adverse impact on the tax charge of 35.3m 2018: nil.
It also gives rise to an additional 10% deemed taxable receipt under the bank compensation provisions which is intended to equate to a disallowance of the administration costs associated with the compensation.
This gives rise to a further adverse impact on the tax charge for 2017 of 3.5m 2018: nil.
In 2017, the actual and estimated fines levied by the FCA and certain other expenses were not tax deductible for both Vanquis Bank and Moneybarn.
This gave rise to an adverse impact on the 2017 tax charge of 1.2m 2018: nil.
The adverse impact of the bank corporation tax surcharge amounts to 13.3m 2017: 17.8m and represents tax at the bank corporation tax surcharge rate of 8% on Vanquis Banks taxable profits in excess of 25m where taxable profits are calculated after adding back bank compensation payments, the 10% deemed taxable receipt, the FCA fine and other add backs.
6 Earnings loss per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
The weighted average number of shares in the period prior to the rights issue in April 2018 has been adjusted to take account of the bonus element of the rights issue of 1.367 in accordance with IAS 33: Earnings per share and prior year comparatives restated.
Diluted EPS calculates the effect on EPS assuming conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Dilutive potential ordinary shares are calculated as follows: i For share awards outstanding under performance-related share incentive schemes such as the Performance Share Plan PSP and the Long Term Incentive Scheme LTIS, the number of dilutive potential ordinary shares is calculated based on the number of shares which would be issuable if: i the end of the reporting period is assumed to be the end of the schemes performance period: and ii the performance targets have been met as at that date.
ii For share options outstanding under non-performance related schemes such as the Save As You Earn scheme SAYE, a calculation is performed to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value determined as the average annual market share price of the Companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share options.
The number of shares calculated is compared with the number of share options outstanding, with the difference being the dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group also presents an adjusted EPS, prior to the amortisation of acquisition intangibles and exceptional items.
Reconciliations of basic and diluted earnings loss per share are set out below: 2018 2017 restated IFRS 9 IAS 39 Weighted Weighted average average number of Per share Loss number of Per share Earnings shares amount earnings shares amount Group m m pence m m pence Basic earnings loss per share 60.3 239.5 25.2 134.4 202.5 66.4 Dilutive effect of share options and awards 0.7 0.1 Diluted earnings loss per share 60.3 240.2 25.1 134.4 202.5 66.4 Potential ordinary shares should be treated as dilutive when, and only when, their conversion to ordinary shares would decrease earnings per share or increase loss per share.
As the Group has reported a basic loss per share in 2017, the dilutive effect of share options and awards has been removed.
189 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Financial statements 6 Earnings loss per share continued The Directors have elected to show an adjusted earnings loss per share prior to the amortisation of acquisition intangibles which arose ontheacquisition of Moneybarn in August 2014 see note 11 and prior to exceptional items see note 1.

This is not a like-for-like comparison as 2018 is presented on an IFRS 9 basis and 2017 is presented on an IAS 39 basis.
Compared with unaudited pro forma IFRS 9 comparatives, adjusted basic EPS has increased by 26.6% from 36.8p to 46.6p, reflecting the increase in IFRS 9 profit before tax of 82.3% partly offset by the higher tax rate and the impact of the rights issue shares issued in April 2018.

Central employees represent corporate office employees, executive and non executive directors employed by the Company.
The 27% increase in CCD average employee numbers reflects the impact of the change in the UK operating model in July 2017 from self employed agents to an employed workforce partly offset by headcount reductions in 2018 due to the ongoing alignment of the cost base with customer numbers.
Moneybarns 23% increase in average headcount continues to reflect the resource required to support the growth of the business and strengthen the senior management team.
The 9% increase in central is due to recruitment of new central functions including Group risk, IT and HR.

The 8.6m 2017: 7.2m credit in the Company for the pension charge represents contributions received from the subsidiaries in relation to the defined benefit schemes, partly offset by the charge in relation to the defined contribution schemes.
The increase in the share-based payment credit from 2.4m in 2017 to 2.8m in 2018 primarily reflects the lower expected vesting levels across cash settled schemes in the Group.
The share-based payment credit of 2.8m 2017: 2.4m relates to equity settled schemes charges of 1.1m 2017: 3.4m credit and a cash settled schemes credit of 3.9m 2017: 1.0m charge.

The recoverable amount is determined from a value in use calculation.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculation relate to the discount rates and growth rates adopted.
Management adopt pre-tax discount rates which reflect the time value of money and the risks specific to the Moneybarn business.
The cash flow forecasts are based on the most recent financial budgets approved by the Group Board for the next fiveyears and extrapolates cash flows for the following five years using a terminal growth rate of 1.5% 2017: 1.5%.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 11% 2017: 11%, this represents the Companys risk adjusted cost of capital.
No reasonably foreseeable reduction inthe assumptions would give rise to an impairment and therefore no further sensitivity analysis has been presented.

Additions in 2018 of 50.0m represent capital injected into Vanquis Bank following receipt of the rights issue proceeds of 300.0m in April 2018.
Following the significant losses incurred in CCD during 2017, a full review was undertaken of the Companys 258.0m investment in Provident Financial Management Services Limited PFMSL the holding company within CCD and the loans of 438.0m provided to PFMSL in 2004 and 200.0m provided to Provident Personal Credit Limited in 2012.
As aresult of this review: The investment in PFMSL of 258.0m was fully impaired in the Companys income statement.
The Company released PFMSL from its obligations under the 438.0m loan and released Provident Personal Credit Limited from its obligations under the 200.0m loan.
As a result of the intercompany loan releases, an amount of 386.8m was booked as an impairment to the Companys income statement and the remaining balance of the intercompany loans of 251.2m was capitalised as an investment in PFMSL.
The investment value in PFMSL was supported by the forecast future cash flows from CCD.
The total exceptional impairment charges taken to the Companys income statement in 2017 was 644.8m.
A reserve transfer of 571.3m was made from the non-distributable reserve to retained earnings to offset the impact of the above impairment charges.
The non-distributable reserve was created on the sale of Provident Personal Credit Limited by the Company to PFMSL in 2000 see note 27.
73.5m of the impairment charges was not matched with atransfer from the non-distributable reserve as this amount represented the Companys original cost of investment in Provident Personal Credit Limited.
During 2018, a further review of the investment carrying value in PFMSL was performed and an exposure of intercompany loans.
Based on a valuation of the CCD business onaconsistent basis as 2017, using forecast future cash flows, this has resulted in an additional impairment of 62.2m to be recognised.
Of this 37.9m has been reflected against the residual non distributable reserve and the remaining 24.3m against retained earnings.
The disposals in 2018 relates to: i the elimination of dormant companies of 6.5m 2017: nil and the associated provision of 6.5m 2017: nil : and, ii 0.4m 2017: 6.4m relating to the IFRIC 11 adjustment relating to share options awards provided to subsidiary employees.
Under IFRIC 11, the fair value of the options awards issued is required tobetreated as a capital contribution and an investment in the relevant subsidiary, net of any share options award that have vested.
The impairment charge to the income statement in 2017 of 2.0m represented the impairment of investments in various dormant and non trading companies following dormant company rationalisations.

195 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Financial statements 14 Amounts receivable from customers IFRS 9: Financial Instruments was adopted from 1 January 2018.
Under IFRS 9, all receivables are recognised within stage 1 on origination.
A customer will then move to stage 2 when there has been a significant increase in credit risk either through a missed payment or an adverse change in behavioural score.
Stage 3 represents a customer in default.
Revenue recognition is recognised on the gross receivable in stage 1 and 2 and on the net receivable in stage 3.
A customer can only move to stage 3 for revenue recognition purposes at the Groups interim or year end.
Impairment provisions are recognised on inception of a loan based on the probability of default PD and the typical loss arising on default LGD : Stage 1 Accounts at initial recognition.
The expected loss is based on a 12 month PD, based on historic experience, and revenue is recognised on the gross receivable before impairment provision.
Stage 2 Accounts which have suffered a significant deterioration in credit risk but have not defaulted.
The expected loss is based on a lifetime PD, based on historic experience, and revenue is recognised on the gross receivable before impairment provision.
Stage 3 Accounts which have defaulted.
The expected loss is based on a lifetime PD, based on historic experience.
Revenue is recognised on the net receivable after impairment provision.
This stage is effectively the previous IAS 39 treatment for impairment.
Impairment provisions under IFRS 9 are calculated based on an unbiased probability-weighted outcome which takes into account historic performance and considers the outlook for macro-economic conditions.
Further details can be found on pages 174 and 175.

In consideration for Vanquis Banks interest in Visa Europe Limited, Vanquis Bank received cash consideration of15.9m 12.2m on completion, preferred stock with an approximate value of 10.7m and deferred cash consideration of 1.4m due on thethird anniversary of the completion date.
The preferred stock is convertible into Class A common stock of Visa Inc. at a future date, subject to certain conditions.
The fair value of the preferred stock in Visa Inc. held by Vanquis Bank as at 31 December 2018 of 12.1m 2017: 9.9m is held at fair value through the OCI and the fair value of the deferred cash consideration of 1.2m 2017: 1.2m is included within debtors.
The increase in the fair value of the investment during the year of 2.2m 2017: 1.9m in respect of the movement in the Visa Inc. share price and the movement in foreign exchange rates has been recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
The valuation of the preferred stock has been determined using the common stocks value as an approximation as both classes of stock have similar dividend rights.
However, adjustments have been made for: i illiquidity, as the preferred stock is not tradeable on an open market and can only be transferred to other VISA members: and ii future litigation costs which could affect the valuation of the stock prior to conversion.

The following financial assets and liabilities are held at fair value: 2018 2017 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Group m m m m m m Assets Investments held at fair value through other comprehensive income: Government gilts 35.7 35.9 Investments held at fair value through other comprehensive income: Visa Inc. shares 12.1 9.9 Total assets 35.7 12.1 35.9 9.9 Liabilities Derivatives 0.1 Total liabilities 0.1 Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
The Group holds Government gilts within level 1 as they are valued using available market prices.
Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted market prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly.
The fair value of derivatives are calculated by discounting contractual future cash flows using relative market rate yield curves and foreign exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
They are discounted using appropriate market rates and yield curves which are deemed to be observable.
Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not basedon observable market data unobservable inputs.
The Group holds Visa shares in level 3.
The valuation has been determined using acombination of observable and non-observable inputs.
As the common stock share price of Visa Inc. is readily available, this input isdeemed to be observable.
However, certain assumptions have been made in respect of the illiquidity adjustment to the share price andthelikelihood of future litigation costs.
These inputs are therefore deemed to be a significant unobservable input.
The following table sets out their movement during the year: Group 2018 2017 m m At 1 January 9.9 8.0 Gains or losses recognised in other comprehensive income 2.2 1.9 At 31 December 12.1 9.9 The illiquidity adjustment has been estimated at around 6% and the expected future litigation costs have been estimated around 15% oftheVisa Inc. share price.
202 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 16 Financial instruments continued The higher the illiquidity and future litigation costs the lower the fair value.
The sensitivity to the unobservable inputs, in isolation, is set out in the table below: Group 2018 2017 m m Illiquidity - 1% 0.2 0.2 Future litigation costs - 1% 0.2 0.2 Transfers between the different levels of the fair value hierarchy would be made when the inputs used to measure the fair value no longer satisfy the conditions required to be classified in a certain level within the hierarchy.
There have been no transfers between levels in the current or prior year.

Where there is no significant difference between carrying value and fair value no additional information has been presented.
Fair value of amounts receivable from customers has been derived by discounting expected future cash flows net of collection costs at the credit risk adjusted discount rate at the balance sheet date.
They are categorised within Level 3 as the expected future cash flows and discount rate are deemed to significant unobservable inputs.
The fair value of retail deposits have been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at the relevant market interest rate yield curves prevailing at the balance sheet date and are categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as the expected future cash flows are deemed to be significant unobservable inputs.
Within bank and other borrowings, the senior public bonds and retail bonds are classed as Level 1 as they are valued within quoted market prices.
The private placement loan notes are classed as Level 2 as their fair value has been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at the relevant market interest rate yield curves prevailing at the balance sheet date.
203 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Financial statements 17 Derivative financial instruments The derivative financial instruments previously held by the Group were interest rate swaps used to fix the interest rates paid on the Groups borrowings and foreign exchange contracts used to manage the foreign exchange risk arising on CCDs operations in the Republic of Ireland.
The contractual notional amounts and the fair values of derivative financial instruments are set out below: 2018 2017 Contractual Contractual notional notional amount Assets Liabilities amount Assets Liabilities Group m m m m m m Interest rate swaps 20.0 Foreign exchange contracts 3.2 0.1 Total Group due within one year 23.2 0.1 2018 2017 Contractual Contractual notional notional amount Assets Liabilities amount Assets Liabilities Company m m m m m m Interest rate swaps 20.0 Total Company due within one year 20.0 a Hedging reserve movements The movement in the hedging reserve within equity as a result of the changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments can be summarised as follows: Group Company 2018 2017 2018 2017 m m m m Interest rate swaps 0.1 0.1 Foreign exchange contracts 0.1 Net credit to the hedging reserve 0.2 0.1 b Income statement All cash flow hedges were deemed to be effective.
There was no impact on the income statement of the Group and the Company in the year in respect of the movement in the fair value of ineffective interest rate swaps, previously designated as cash flow hedges 2017: nil.
c Interest rate swaps The Group and Company used interest rate swaps in order to manage the interest rate risk on the Groups borrowings.
The Group entered into various interest rate swaps which were designated and effective under IAS 39 as cash flow hedges at inception.
The movement in the fair value of effective interest rate swaps during the year was as follows: Group and Company 2018 2017 m m Liability at 1 January 0.1 Credited to the hedging reserve 0.1 Liability at 31 December 204 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 17 Derivative financial instruments continued The weighted average interest rate and period to maturity of the interest rate swaps held by the Group and Company were as follows: 2018 2017 Weighted Weighted Weighted Weighted average Range of average average Range of average interest interest period to interest interest period to rate rates maturity rate rates maturity Group and Company % % years % % years Sterling 0.7 0.6 0.8 0.2 d Foreign exchange contracts The Group uses foreign exchange contracts in order to manage the foreign exchange rate risk arising from CCDs euro operations in the Republic of Ireland.
A liability of nil is held in the Group balance sheet as at 31 December 2018 in respect of foreign exchange contracts 2017: liability of 0.1m.
In 2017 the Groups foreign exchange contracts comprised forward foreign exchange contracts to buy sterling and sell euros for a total notional amount of 3.2m.
These contracts had a range of maturity dates from 16 January 2018 to 14 August 2018.
These contracts were designated as cash flow hedges and were effective under IAS 39.
Accordingly, the movement during 2017 in fair value of 0.1m was credited tothe hedging reserve within equity.
18 Trade and other receivables Company 2018 2017 Non-current assets m m Amounts owed by Group undertakings 76.9 The amounts owed by Group undertakings at the end of 2017 represented amounts owed to Vanquis Bank.
During 2018 the intercompany loan was repaid in full.
As at 31 December there were no amounts past due and there was no impairment provision held against amounts owed by Group undertakings due for repayment in more than one year 2017: nil.
The amounts owed by Group undertakings were unsecured, due for repayment in more than one year and accrued interest at rates linked to LIBOR.

There are nil amounts past due in respect of trade and other receivables due in less than one year 2017: nil.
Within the Company, an impairment provision of 122.9m 2017: 122.9m is held against amounts owed by Group undertakings due in less than one year representing the deficiency in the net assets of those Group undertakings.
There has been no charge to the Company income statement in 2018 2017: 0.4m credit in respect of the provision.
Prepayments and accrued income have increased by 3.3m due to higher deferred broker fees at Moneybarn.
Amounts owed by Group undertakings are unsecured, repayable on demand or within one year, and generally accrue interest at rates linked to LIBOR.. 205 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Financial statements 19 Retirement benefit asset a Pension schemes defined benefit The retirement benefit asset reflects the difference between the present value of the Groups obligation to current and past employees to provide a defined benefit pension and the fair value of assets held to meet that obligation.
As at 31 December 2018, the fair value of the assets exceeded the obligation and hence a net pension asset has been recorded.
The Group operates a defined benefit scheme: the Provident Financial Staff Pension Scheme.
The scheme is of the funded, defined benefit type and has been substantially closed to new members since 1 January 2003.
All future benefits in the scheme are now provided on a cash balance basis, with a defined amount being made available at retirement, based on a percentage of salary that is revalued up to retirement with reference to increases in price inflation.
This retirement account is then used to purchase an annuity on the open market.
The scheme also provides pension benefits which were accrued in the past on a final salary basis, but which are no longer linked to final salary.
The scheme also provides death benefits.
The scheme is a UK registered pension scheme under UK legislation.
The scheme is governed by a Trust Deed and Rules, with trustees responsible for the operation and the governance of the scheme.
The trustees work closely with the Group on funding and investment strategy decisions.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out as at 1 June 2015 by a qualified independent actuary.
Avaluation as at 1 June 2018 is currently in progress but is not yet finalised.
The valuation used for the purposes of IAS 19 Employee benefits has been based on the preliminary results of the 2018 valuation to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme at the balance sheet date.
Scheme assets are stated at fair value as at the balance sheet.
The Group is entitled to a refund of any surplus, subject to tax, if the scheme winds up after all benefits have been paid.
The Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are as follows: Investment risk the liabilities for IAS 19 purposes are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields.
If the assets underperform this yield a deficit will arise.
The scheme has a long-term objective to reduce the level of investment risk by investing in assets that better match liabilities: Change in bond yields a decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the liabilities, although this will be partly offset by an increase inmatching assets: Inflation risk part of the liabilities are linked to inflation.
If inflation increases then liabilities will increase, although this will be partly offset by an increase in assets.
As part of a long-term fide-risking strategy, the scheme has increased its portfolio in inflation matched assets: andLife expectancies the schemes final salary benefits provide pensions for the rest of members lives and for their spouses lives.
If members live longer than assumed, then the liabilities in respect of final salary benefits increase.
The net retirement benefit asset recognised in the balance sheet of the Group and the Company is as follows: Group and Company 2018 2017 m % m % Equities 62.6 8 68.7 8 Other diversified return seeking investments 71.5 9 75.8 9 Corporate bonds 136.0 17 141.6 17 Fixed interest gilts 177.3 22 202.9 24 Index-linked gilts 334.4 43 341.6 41 Cash and money market funds 6.5 1 4.9 1 Total fair value of scheme assets 788.3 100 835.5 100 Present value of funded defined benefit obligation 704.4 733.2 Net retirement benefit asset recognised in the balance sheet 83.9 102.3 As part of a fide-risking strategy agreed between the Company and the pension trustees to hedge the inflation and interest rate risks associated with the liabilities of the pension scheme, a substantial amount of more volatile growth funds equities were reinvested in liability protection assets fixed interest and index-linked gilts in January 2015.
Further work was undertaken to refine the liability protection assets in early 2016.
206 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 19 Retirement benefit asset continued The valuation of the pension scheme has decreased from 102.3m at 31 December 2017 to 83.9m at 31 December 2018.

The exceptional curtailment credit of 0.6m in 2018 2017: 3.9m represents the reduction in headcount following business restructuring within CCD see note 1.
The net charge credit recognised in the income statement of the Group and the Company has been included within administrative and operating costs.
Movements in the fair value of scheme assets were as follows: Group Company 2018 2017 2018 2017 m m m m Fair value of scheme assets at 1 January 835.5 830.1 835.5 830.1 Interest on scheme assets 19.9 21.1 19.9 21.1 Contributions by subsidiaries 9.2 10.1 Actuarial movement on scheme assets 31.3 18.2 31.3 18.2 Contributions by the Group Company 9.8 10.7 0.6 0.6 Net benefits paid out 45.6 44.6 45.6 44.6 Fair value of scheme assets at 31 December 788.3 835.5 788.3 835.5 The Group contributions to the defined benefit pension scheme in the year ending 31 December 2019 are expected to be approximately10m.
207 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Financial statements 19 Retirement benefit asset continued Movements in the present value of the defined benefit obligation were as follows: Group and Company 2018 2017 m m Present value of the defined benefit obligation at 1 January 733.2 757.7 Current service cost 2.7 4.2 Interest on scheme liabilities 17.4 19.1 Exceptional past service cost plan amendment note 1 6.9 Exceptional past service cost curtailment credit note 1 0.6 3.9 Actuarial movement experience 9.1 3.7 Actuarial movement demographic assumptions 31.4 21.3 Actuarial movement financial assumptions 50.1 18.3 Net benefits paid out 45.6 44.6 Present value of the defined benefit obligation at 31 December 704.4 733.2 The liabilities of the scheme are based on the current value of expected benefit payments over the next 90 years.
The weighted average duration of the scheme liabilities is approximately 17 years 2017: 19 years.
The principal actuarial assumptions used at the balance sheet date were as follows: Group and Company 2018 2017 % % Price inflation RPI 3.30 3.20 Price inflation CPI 2.20 2.10 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 3.00 2.95 Inflationary increases to pensions in deferment 2.20 2.10 Discount rate 2.80 2.40 The pension increase assumption shown above applies to pensions increasing in payment each year in line with RPI up to 5%.
Pensions accrued prior to 2000 are substantially subject to fixed 5% increases each year.
In deferment increases prior to retirement arelinkedto CPI.
The mortality assumptions are based on the self-administered pension scheme SAPS series 1 tables, with multipliers of 96% 2017: 105% and 101% 2017: 115% respectively for males and females.
The 4% downwards 2017: 5% upwards adjustment to mortality rates for males and an 1% upwards 2017: 15% adjustment for females reflects the lower life expectancies within the scheme compared toaverage pension schemes, which was concluded following a study of the schemes membership.
Future improvements in mortality are based ontheContinuous Mortality Investigation CMI 2016 model with a long-term improvement trend of 1.25% per annum.
Under these mortalityassumptions, the life expectancies of members are as follows: Male Female 2018 2017 2018 2017 Group and Company years years years years Current pensioner aged 65 22.2 21.4 23.8 22.9 Current member aged 45 from age 65 23.6 22.9 25.3 24.5 The table below shows the sensitivity on the defined benefit obligation not including any impact on assets of changes in the key assumptions.

The assets of the scheme are held separately from those ofthe Group and Company.
The Group also operates a separate pension scheme for auto-enrolment into which the Company and subsidiaries contribute a proportion of qualifying earnings of the member of 1%.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group or the Company.
The pension charge in the consolidated income statement represents contributions paid by the Group in respect of these plans and amounted to 9.3m for the year ended 31 December 2018 2017: 8.1m.
Contributions made by the Company amounted to 0.4m 2017: 0.4m.
0.6m contributions were payable to the fund at the year end 2017: 0.6m.
The Group contributed nil in 2018 into individual personal pension plans in the year 2017: less than 0.1m.
The Unfunded, Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme UURBS decreased by 1.5m in the year as amounts were withdrawn from the scheme, thebalance outstanding, for the Group at 31 December 2018 was 0.5m.
The increase of 0.2m in 2017 was a result of the transfer of Andrew Fishers scheme to a personal pension plan, and 1.6m into cash supplements 20 Deferred tax Deferred tax is a future tax liability or asset resulting from temporary differences or timing differences between the accounting value of assets and liabilities and their value for tax purposes.
Deferred tax arises primarily in respect of derivative financial instruments, the Groups pension asset, deductions for employee share awards which are recognised differently for tax purposes, property, plant and equipment which is depreciated on a different basis for tax purposes, certain cost provisions for which tax deductions are only available when the costs are paid, investments held at fair value through OCI which are taxed only on disposal and the opening balance sheet adjustments to state the IAS 39 balance sheet onto an IFRS 9 basis, for which tax deductions are available over 10 years.
The deferred tax liability recognised on the acquisition of Moneybarn relates primarily tothe intangible asset in respect of Moneybarns broker relationships which will be amortised in future periods but for which tax deductions will not be available.
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the balance sheet liability method.
During 2015, reductions in corporation tax rateswere enacted, reducing the mainstream UK corporation tax rate from 20% to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017 and from 19% to 18% with effect from 1 April 2020.
In addition, the Government introduced a bank corporation tax surcharge enacted in the 2015 Finance No2 Act which imposes, with effect from 1 January 2016, an additional 8% corporation tax on profits of Vanquis Bank over 25m.
During 2016, afurther change was enacted which further reduced the mainstream UK corporation tax rate from 18% to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020.
Deferred tax at 31 December 2018 has been measured at 17% 2017: 17% and, in the case of Vanquis Bank, at the combined mainstream UKcorporation tax and bank corporation tax surcharge rates of 25% 2017: 25% on the basis that the temporary differences on which deferred tax has been calculated are expected to reverse after 1 April 2020 2017: 1 April 2020.
The exception to this is the opening balance sheet adjustment to restate the IAS 39 balance sheet to an IFRS 9 basis where deferred tax has been measured at the mainstream UK corporation tax rate and in the case of Vanquis Bank at combined mainstream UK corporation tax and bank corporation tax surcharge rates at which the amount will be deductible over the next 10 years.
In 2018, movements in deferred tax balances were measured at the mainstream corporation tax rate for the year of 19% 2017: 19.25%, and, in the case of Vanquis Bank, at the combined mainstream corporation tax and bank corporation tax surcharge rates for the year of 27% 2017: 27.25%.

The PRA requires regulated entities to maintain a liquid assets buffer to ensure they have available funds to help protect against unforeseen circumstances.
The total liquid resources required to be held is calculated in line with the Overall Liquidity Adequacy Rule OLAR as set out in the Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process ILAAP undertaken by Vanquis Bank.
Liquid resource must be maintained based upon daily stress tests linked to the three key liquidity risks of Vanquis Bank, namely retail deposit maturities, undrawn credit lines and operating cash flows.
This results in a dynamic liquid resources requirement largely driven by retail deposits maturities in the following three months.

Historically, interest accruals on borrowings and retail deposits have been presented within trade and other payables in the balance sheet.
They have now been disclosed as part of the principal balances to which they relate within borrowings, replicating the presentation of interest on customer receivables.
Prior year comparatives have also been reclassified.

d Interest rate and currency profile of borrowings Before taking account of the various interest rate swaps and cross-currency swap arrangements entered into by the Group and Company, the interest rate and foreign exchange rate exposure on borrowings is as follows: 2018 2017 Fixed Floating Total Fixed Floating Total Group m m m m m m Sterling 1,859.4 168.0 2,027.4 1,703.0 440.9 2,143.9 Euro 28.1 28.1 49.1 49.1 Total Group 1,859.4 196.1 2,055.5 1,703.0 490.0 2,193.0 2018 2017 Fixed Floating Total Fixed Floating Total Company m m m m m m Sterling 427.7 165.3 593.0 402.0 438.1 840.1 Euro 28.1 28.1 49.1 49.1 Total Company 427.7 193.4 621.1 402.0 487.2 889.2 As detailed in note 17, the Group and the Company uses various interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate exposure on borrowings.
In 2017, after taking account of the aforementioned interest rate swaps, the Groups fixed rate borrowings were 1,707.5m and the Companys fixed rate borrowings were 415.7m.
There were no interest rate swaps in place at 31 December 2018. e Senior public bonds On 23 October 2009, the Company issued 250.0m of senior public bonds.
The bonds have an annual coupon of 8.0% and are repayable on23 October 2019.
On 4 June 2018, the Group issued 250m of five year fixed rate bonds carrying a semi-annual coupon of 7%.
The proceeds of the bond issue were used to finance the tender offer for the 250.0m existing senior bonds, maturing on 23 October 2019.
89% of the existing bonds were tendered and redeemed at an 8.0% premium on 30 May 2018.
The remaining existing senior bonds of 27.5m will mature on their original maturity date on 23 October 2019. f Private placement loan notes On 13 January 2011, the Company entered into a committed 100.0m facility agreement with the Prudential M&G Investments UK Companies Financing Fund to provide a 10-year term loan which amortises between years five and ten.
The first two repayments of 10.0m were repaid in 2016 and 2017 and the third instalment of 15.0m was paid in 2018.
A fourth instalment of 15.0m was paid on 31 January 2019.
The Company also entered into a 20m private placement loan note with a third party in March 2011, which was repaid on its contractual maturity date in March 2018, at a rate linked to LIBOR.
g Retail bonds The Company has three outstanding retail bonds issued on the Order Book for Retail Bonds ORB platform established by the London Stock Exchange as follows: Amount Rate Issue date m % Maturity date 14 April 2010 25.2 7.5% 14 April 2020 27 March 2013 65.0 6.0% 27 September 2021 9 April 2015 60.0 5.125% 9 October 2023 Total Group and Company 150.2 Represents an all-in cost of 7.5%, comprising a 7.0% interest rate payable to the bond holder and 0.5% payable to the distributor.
213 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Financial statements 22 Borrowings continued h Undrawn committed borrowing facilities The Groups funding and liquidity policy is designed to ensure that the Group is able to continue to fund the growth of the business.
The Group therefore maintains headroom onits committed borrowing facilities, together with cash held on deposit, to fund growth and contractual maturities for at least the following 12 months.
The undrawn committed borrowing facilities at 31 December were as follows: Group and Company 2018 2017 m m Expiring within one year Expiring within one to two years 327.4 Expiring in more than two years 66.2 Total undrawn committed borrowing facilities 327.4 66.2 The Group has committed borrowing facilities of 2,363.0m 2017: 2,242.0m at the end of 2018.
Headroom on the Groups committed debt facilities was 327.4m at 31 December 2018.
Together with the ongoing retail deposits programme, this is sufficient to fund contractual debt maturities and projected growth in the Group until May 2020, when the Groups syndicated revolving bank facility matures.
In order to reconcile the borrowings and the headroom on committed facilities shown, the facilities and borrowings in respect of amounts repayable on demand and interest accrued should be deducted and unamortised arrangement fees should be added back to borrowings as follows: 2018 2017 Facilities Borrowings Facilities Borrowings Group m m m m Total facilities and borrowings 2,377.5 2,055.5 2,266.5 2,193.0 Repayable on demand 14.5 7.0 24.5 3.1 Unamortised arrangement fees 4.2 4.8 Accrued interest 17.1 18.9 Total committed facilities and borrowings 2,363.0 2,035.6 2,242.0 2,175.8 Headroom on committed facilities 327.4 66.2 i Weighted average interest rates and periods to maturity Before taking account of the various interest rate swaps entered into by the Group and Company, the weighted average interest rate and the weighted average period to maturity of the Group and the Companys fixed-rate borrowings is as follows: 2018 2017 Weighted Weighted Weighted Weighted average average average average interest period to interest period to rate maturity rate maturity Group % years % years Sterling 3.20 2.4 3.36 2.31 2018 2017 Weighted Weighted Weighted Weighted average average average average interest period to interest period to rate maturity rate maturity Company % years % years Sterling 6.65 2.5 7.18 2.75 214 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued There were no interest rate swaps in place at 31 December 2018.
In 2017, after taking account of interest rate swaps, the sterling-weighted average fixed interest rate for the Group was 3.2% and 6.65% for the Company.
The sterling-weighted average period to maturity on the same basis was 2.3 years for the Group and 2.9 years for the Company.

Accruals principally relate to normal operating accruals such as rent, rates and utilities.
Historically, interest accruals on borrowings and retail deposits were presented within accruals.
They have now been disclosed as part of the principal balances to which they relate within borrowings, this replicates the presentation of interest on customer receivables.
215 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Financial statements 24 Provisions Group 2018 2017 Provisions m m At 1 January 104.6 Created in the year 104.6 Utilised in the year 62.2 Reclassification from balance reduction provisions 10.8 At 31 December 53.2 104.6 On 27 February 2018, Vanquis Bank agreed a settlement with the FCA into the investigation into ROP.
The investigation concluded that Vanquis Bank did not adequately disclose in its sales calls that the charges for ROP would be treated as a purchase transaction and therefore potentially incur interest.
The total estimated cost of settlement amounts to 172.1m and was reflected in the 2017 financial statements, of which 75.4m was reflected as a balance adjustment to receivables with the remaining 96.7m reflected as a provision.
The provision comprised: i cash settlements to customers of 51.7m: ii higher expected forward flow of ROP complaints more generally in respect of which compensation may need to be paid of 30.7m: iii administration costs of 12.3m: and iv the fine levied by the FCA of just under 2.0m.
The ROP refund programme is on-track to be substantially completed in early 2019.
Following a successful pilot during the summer, there was a significant step up in the volume of refunds being processed in the final quarter of the year and over 1 million current and former ROP customers had been refunded by the end of 2018.
As a result, 61.8m of the provision established at the end of 2017 has been used during 2018.
In addition, a reclassification of 10.8m has been made from the balance reduction provision held against receivables during 2018 which reflects an increase in the estimate of the number of customers that will receive a cash refund rather than a balance reduction.
The balance reduction provision has reduced from 75.4m at the end of 2017 to 3.7m at the end of 2018 see note 14, of which 60.9m relates to balance reductions applied to customer accounts and 10.8m relates to the reclassification to provisions.
Moneybarn continues to cooperate with the FCA with its ongoing investigation into affordability, forbearance and termination options.
Managements best estimate of the potential liability in respect of the investigation of 20.0m was reflected in the 2017 financial statements and comprised a 12.1m balance adjustment to receivables with the remaining 7.9m reflected as a provision in respect of potential cash restitution, administration costs and an FCA fine.
Moneybarn has used 0.4m of the provision in 2018 in respect of legal costs.
The balance reduction adjustment has also reduced by 10.3m from 12.1m to 1.8m during 2018 reflecting the write down of gross receivables based on the expected outcome of the termination options and forbearance parts of the FCA investigation see note 14.

Provident Financial plc sponsors the Provident Financial plc 2007 Employee Benefit Trust EBT which is a discretionary trust established for the benefit of the employees of the Group.
The Company has appointed SG Kleinwort Hambros Trust Company CI Limited to act as trustee of the EBT.
The trustee has waived the right to receive dividends on the shares it holds.
The shares have been acquired by the EBT to meet obligations under the Provident Financial Long Term Incentive Scheme 2006 and the 2013 Performance Share Plan.
216 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 26 Share-based payments The Group issues share options and awards to employees as part of its employee remuneration packages.
The Group operates three equity settled share schemes: the Long Term Incentive Scheme LTIS, employees savings-related share option schemes typically referred to as Save As You Earn schemes SAYE, and the Performance Share Plan PSP.
The Group also operates a cash-settled share incentive scheme, the Provident Financial Equity Plan PFEP for eligible employees based on a percentage of salary.
When an equity settled share option or award is granted, a fair value is calculated based on the share price at grant date, the probability of the option award vesting, the Groups recent share price volatility, and the risk associated with the option award.
A fair value is calculated based on the value of awards granted and adjusted at each balance sheet date for the probability of vesting against performance conditions.
The fair value of all options awards are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the underlying option award.
During 2018, awards options have been granted under the LTIS, SAYE and PFEP schemes 2017: awards options have been granted under the LTIS, PSP, SAYE and PFEP schemes.

The hedging reserve reflected the corresponding entry to the fair value of hedging derivatives held on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities, net of deferred tax seenote 17.
The treasury shares reserve represented shares acquired by the Company, through various trusts, both from the market and through a fresh issue to satisfy awards under theGroups various share schemes see note 26.
The cost of the shares is treated as a deduction from equity.
When the relevant awards vest, the cost of the shares provided toemployees is transferred to retained earnings.

The transaction enabled PFMSL to be established as a central service function for its subsidiaries PPC and Greenwood Personal Credit Limited and ensured that the entities forming CCD were consolidated into one sub-group which more accurately reflected the Groups structure.
The original gain on sale of 809.2m was recognised as a nondistributable reserve as the consideration provided by PFMSL comprised cash funded by the issue of debt and shares by PFMSL to the Company.
The debt was refinanced in 2004 with a new 638m term loan from the Company.
200m of the original gain was made distributable in 2005 following the settlement in cash of 200m of the 638m loan by PFMSL.
Following the significant losses incurred in CCD during 2017, a full review was undertaken of the Companys investment in PFMSL and the intercompany loans of 438m and 200m provided to PFMSL and PPC respectively.
As a result of this review, the Company released PFMSL and PPC from their obligations under the intercompany loans and impairment charges of 644.8m were taken to the Companys income statement in 2017.
571.3m of the non-distributable reserve was transferred to retained earnings to offset these impairment charges see note 13.
The remaining 73.5m of impairment charges was not matched with a transfer from the non-distributable reserve as this amount represented the Companys original cost of investment in PPC.
During 2018 a further 62.2m was recognised as impairment in PPC, of which 37.9m was reflected against the non distributable reserve and 24.3m against retained earnings.
Historically, approximately 50m of the intra-group loan receivable from PFMSL created as part of the aforementioned group reorganisation in 2000 met the criteria for qualifying consideration in accordance with Tech 02 17.
This was on the basis that the debtor was capable of settling the receivable within a reasonable period of time, there was reasonable certainty that the debtor would be capable of settling when called upon to do so, and there was an expectation that the receivable would be settled.
Based on historic dividends levels, 50m was considered to be an appropriate amount that PFMSL could settle within a year.
Accordingly, the Company had historically included 50m as part of distributable reserves for the purposes of assessing dividend distributions.
Following the significant deterioration in performance of CCD during 2017 and the subsequent release of the intra-group loan receivable, there are no longer any intra-group loan receivables capable of meeting the criteria for qualifying consideration.
The distributable reserves do not include distributable reserves held within subsidiary companies.
The rights issue was undertaken through a cash box structure which allowed merger relief to be applied to the issue of shares rather than recording share premium and thereby creating distributable reserves for the Company where capital is not injected in Vanquis Bank.
The net proceeds of the rights issue of 300m, was recorded as an increase in sharecapital and the creation of a merger reserve.
50.0m of the capital raised was injected into Vanquis Bank with the remaining 250m was retained in the Company.
For the purposes of declaring dividends distributable reserves include: i retained earnings, adjusted to reflect the unrealised gain on the retirement benefit asset: ii sharebased payment reserve net of deferred tax: iii merger reserve: iv treasury share reserve and: v an element of the intra-group loan receivable created as part of the Group reorganisation in 2000.

In 2016, Vanquis Bank and the PRA agreed a voluntary requirement for Vanquis Bank not to pay dividends to, or enter into certain transactions outside the normal course of business with, the Provident Financial Group without the PRAs consent.
The voluntary requirement remains in place.
With the consent of the PRA, Vanquis Bank has approved and paid a 59.8m dividend in March 2019.
There are no transactions with directors other than those disclosed in the directors remuneration report.
221 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Financial statements 30 Contingent liabilities A contingent liability is a liability that is not sufficiently certain to qualify for recognition as a provision where uncertainty exists regarding the outcome of future events.
a Threatened proceedings in respect of the Companys alleged failure to previously disclose certain matters contained in the Companys public announcement on 22 August 2017 On 26 January 2018, the Company received a letter on behalf of an institutional investor which has a number of subsidiary investment funds in connection with certain matters disclosed in its public announcement on 22 August 2017.
On that date, as part of a trading update, the Company announced, among other things, that Vanquis Bank was co-operating with an investigation by the FCA into ROP, had agreed with the FCA to enter into a voluntary requirement to suspend all new sales of ROP in April 2016 and had agreed with the PRA, not to pay dividends to, or enter into certain transactions outside the normal course of business with, the Group without the PRAs consent.
The institutional investor asserts that the Company is liable to compensate it and its subsidiary investment funds for losses suffered as a result of the fact that certain matters disclosed in the trading update were not publicly announced earlier or disclosed to them by the Company in investor meetings.
The institutional investor has not quantified the losses that it alleges have been incurred, although it alleges that it and its subsidiary investment funds held significant positions in the Companys shares at the time.
The institutional investor also asserts that the Companys earlier public announcements were false or misleading or, alternatively, the delay in disclosing those matters publicly was dishonest pursuant to Section 90A of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, and the Company made actionable misstatements during those investor meetings.
The Company believes the claims by the institutional investor are unmeritorious and considers the prospects of the claims being upheld to be limited.
The Company has responded to the claims and intends to defend its position vigorously and to the fullest extent possible.
In the event these claims, or claims brought by any other investors in connection with these, or other, announcements or investor meetings, were upheld, the compensation which the Company may be required to pay could have a material adverse effect on the Groups business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.
b Bank guarantees and Unfunded Unapproved Retirement Benefits Scheme UURBS The Company has a contingent liability for guarantees given in respect of borrowing facilities of certain subsidiaries to a maximum of330.2m 2017: 69.0m.
At 31 December 2018, the fixed and floating rate borrowings in respect of these guarantees amounted to 2.8m 2017: 2.8m.
No loss is expected to arise.
These guarantees are defined as financial guarantees under IFRS 9 and their fair value at31 December 2018 was not deemed to be material 2017: not material.
A floating charge is held over CCDs receivables of up to 15m in respect of the unfunded pension benefit promises made to executive directors and certain members of senior management affected by the reduced annual allowance to pension schemes introduced in 2011 under the UURBS.
c Other legal actions and regulatory matters In addition, during the ordinary course of business the Group is subject to other complaints and threatened or actual legal proceedings including class or group action claims brought by or on behalf of current or former employees, agents, customers, investors or other third parties, as well as legal and regulatory reviews, challenges, investigations and enforcement actions, both in the UK and overseas.
All such material matters are periodically reassessed, with the assistance of external professional advisers where appropriate, to determine the likelihood of the Group incurring a liability.
In those instances where it is concluded that it is more likely than not that a payment will be made, a provision is established to managements best estimate of the amount required at the relevant balance sheet date.
In some cases it will not be possible to form a view, for example because the facts are unclear or because further time is needed properly to assess the merits of the case, and no provisions are held in relation to such matters.
However, the Group does not currently expect the final outcome of any such case to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, operations or cash flows.

IFRS 9 prescribes: i Classification and measurement of financial instruments requires asset classification and measurement based upon business model: ii Hedge accounting wider eligibility criteria to hedging of financial instruments: and iii Expected loss accounting for impairment replaces an incurred loss model.
Classification and measurement Under IFRS 9, the classification of financial assets is determined by a contractual cash flows test referred to as the Solely payment of principal and interest SPPI business model test.
Financial assets are required to be measured at amortised cost if they are held as part of a business model where the objective is to hold the financial asset in order to collect contractual cash flows.
This is known as the hold to collect business model.
Financial assets are required to be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if they are held in a business model to both collect contractual cash flows and sell the financial assets.
This is known as the hold to collect and sell business model.
Financial assets that fail the SPPI test are required to be measured at fair value through the income statement.
There are no changes to the classification and measurement of the Groups financial assets as a result of the IFRS 9 SPPI test.
Hedge accounting The requirements on hedge accounting are revised under IFRS 9 but adoption is optional.
IAS 39 continues to be available.
The Group is continuing to apply the IAS 39 hedge accounting requirements but has implemented the amended IFRS 7 disclosure requirements.
223 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Financial statements 32 IFRS 9 continued Expected loss accounting The area within IFRS 9 which materially affects the Group is expected loss accounting for impairment.
Under this approach, impairment provisions are recognised on inception of a loan based on the probability of default PD and the typical loss arising on default: Stage 1 Accounts at initial recognition.
The expected loss is based on a 12-month PD, based on historic experience, and revenue isrecognised on the gross receivable before impairment provision.
The expected loss is based onalifetime PD, based on historic experience, and recognised on the gross receivable before impairment provision.
Stage 3 Accounts which have missed a payment and are in arrears.
Provisions arebased on expected losses based on historic cash flows.
This stage is effectively the current IAS 39 treatment forimpairment.
Provisions under IFRS 9 are calculated based on an unbiased probability-weighted outcome which take into account historic performance and considers the outlook for macro-economic conditions.
All credit issued is recognised within stage 1 on origination.
Revenue recognition will be recognised on a gross basis in stage 1 and 2 and on a net basis in stage 3.
The impairment approach under IFRS 9 differs from the incurred loss model under IAS 39 where impairment provisions were only reflected when there was objective evidence of impairment, typically a missed payment.
The resulting effect is that impairment provisions under IFRS 9 are recognised earlier.
This resulted in the following one-off adjustment to receivables, deferred tax and reserves on adoption as follows: IFRS 9 IAS 39 adjustment IFRS 9 m m m Receivables: Vanquis Bank 1,554.7 149.5 1,405.2 CCD 390.6 43.2 347.4 Moneybarn 364.1 45.4 318.7 Total receivables 2,309.4 238.1 2,071.3 Pension asset 102.3 102.3 Liquid assets buffer 263.4 263.4 Borrowings 2,193.0 2,193.0 Deferred tax liabilites assets 20.3 54.1 33.8 Other 73.3 73.3 Net assets 535.1 184.0 351.1 A reconciliation from the closing IAS 39 loss allowance account to opening IFRS 9 loss allowance account is shown below: Vanquis Bank Moneybarn m m At 31 December 2017 IAS 39 288.9 44.4 Stage 1 provision 12 month ECL 126.0 9.1 Stage 2 and 3 provision lifetime ECL 22.0 39.5 Macro economic provision 0.1 Other 1.4 At 1 January 2018 IFRS 9 438.4 93.0 Within CCD, under IAS 39, impairments was deducted directly from amounts receivable from customers without the use of an allowance account.
A loss allowance account was created by CCD on adoption of IFRS 9.
The Group has not restated its 2017 statutory prior year comparatives.
This is due to the IFRS 9 requirement in respect of fide-recognition of a financial asset which would require loans terminated prior to 1 January 2018 to remain under IAS 39 in the prior year which will distort comparability with the 2018 income statement and 2018 balance sheet which are on a full IFRS 9 basis.
