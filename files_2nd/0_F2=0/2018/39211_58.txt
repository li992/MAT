Purchases of client relationships in the year relate to payments made to investment managers and third parties for the introduction A 10 year extrapolation period is chosen based on the group's assessment of the likely associated duration of client relationships.

the discounted amount of estimated future cash flows expected to be paid using current market rates.
An impairment was recognised, as the recoverable amount of the CGU at 30 June 2018 was 595,000, which was lower than the carrying value of 864,000 at 31 December 2017.
The recoverable amount was calculated based on forecast earnings for 2018, extrapolated over 10 years based on a decrease in revenues of 1.0% per annum.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows was 15.0%.
The impairment was recognised in the Investment Management segment in the segmental analysis.
No further impairment was recognised at 31 December 2018.
Based on the assumptions in the table above, the calculated recoverable amount of the trust and tax CGU at 31 December 2018 was 1,729,000: this was higher than its carrying value of 595,000.
Reducing the assumed growth rate for income in the trust and tax CGU by one percentage point would reduce the calculated recoverable amount of the CGU to 828,000.
No reasonably foreseeable changes to the assumptions used in the value-in-use calculation for the investment management CGU, including managements assessment of the impact of Brexit, would result in an impairment of the goodwill allocated to it.
