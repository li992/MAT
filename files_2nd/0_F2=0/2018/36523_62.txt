144 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED for the year ended 31 December 2018 29 RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEMES Dened contribution schemes During the year the Group charged contributions of 10.3m 2017: 0.9 to the consolidated income statement in relation to the dened contribution pension schemes.
Dened benefit plans Judgement is applied, based on legal, actuarial, and accounting guidance in IFRIC 14, regarding the amounts of net pension asset that is recognised in the consolidated balance sheet.
The Group has two significant dened benefit plans, the Ladbrokes Pension Plan and the Gala Coral Pension Plan.
Both are final salary pension plans for UK employees.
These are closed to new employees and future accrual.
At retirement each members pension is related to their final pensionable salary for the Ladbrokes Pension Plan and their career average earnings for the Gala Coral Pension Plan.
The weighted average duration of the expected benefit payments from the Plan is around 17 years for Ladbrokes Pension Plan and 21 years for the Gala Coral Pension Plan.
The Plans assets are held separately from those of the Group.
The Plans are approved by HMRC for tax purposes, and are managed by an independent set of Trustees.
The Plans are subject to UK regulations, which require the Group and Trustees to agree a funding strategy and contribution schedule at least every three years.
Under the current contribution schedule in place, the Group does not pay contributions to the Ladbrokes Pension Plan or Gala Coral Pension Plan but are paying the administrative costs related to both schemes.
There is a risk to the Group that adverse circumstances could lead to a requirement for the Group to make additional contributions to recover any deficit that arises.
As at the date of signing the financial statements no such event has arisen.
The results of the formal actuarial valuation as at 30 June 2018 for the Ladbrokes Pension Plan and 30 June 2018 for the Gala Coral Pension Plan were updated to 31 December 2018 by an independent qualied actuary in accordance with IAS 19 Revised Employee Benets.
The value of the dened benefit obligation and current service cost have been measured using the projected unit credit method, as required by IAS 19 Revised.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately through other comprehensive income.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are as follows: 2018 2018 2018 2017 2017 2017 Coral Ladbrokes Total Coral Ladbrokes Total m m m m m m Present value of funded obligations 358.9 316.6 675.5 Fair value of plan assets 418.1 425.6 843.7 Net asset 59.2 109.0 168.2 Disclosed in the balance sheet as: Retirement benefit asset 59.2 109.0 168.2 The Group has considered the appropriate accounting treatment in respect of the pension plan surplus, taking into account the current agreement with the Trustees and concluded the recognition of the surplus is appropriate.

The major categories of plan assets as a percentage of total plan assets are as follows: 2018 2018 2017 2017 Coral Ladbrokes Coral Ladbrokes % % % % Equities and Diversied Growth Funds 18.4 19.8 Liability Driven Investment % 81.3 24.3 Cash 0.3 55.9 146 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED for the year ended 31 December 2018 29 RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEMES CONTINUED The Plan assets are held exclusively within instruments with quoted market prices in an active market with the exception of the holdings in an insurance policy.
At 31 December 2018, these represented c. 0.2% of the Plans total assets.
The Plan does not invest directly in property occupied by the Group or in financial securities issued by the Group.
Although, as the Plan holds pooled investment vehicles, there may at times be indirect employer related investment.
At 31 December 2018, these represented less than 0.1% of the Plans total assets.
The investment strategy is set by the Trustees of the Plans in consultation with the Group.
The current long-term strategy for the Ladbrokes Pension Plan is to invest in a matching portfolio sufficient to meet the next 15 years of cashows with the remaining assets invested in return seeking funds.
For the Gala Coral Plan the current long-term strategy is to invest in a low-risk matching bond portfolio with a relatively small investment in return seeking funds.
Principal actuarial assumptions at the balance sheet date expressed as weighted averages where appropriate : 2018 2018 2017 2017 Coral Ladbrokes Coral Ladbrokes % p. a.
Discount rate 2.8 2.7 Price ination CPI 2.2 2.2 Price ination RPI 3.2 3.2 Future pension increases LPI 5% CPI 3.1 3.1 LPI 3% RPI 2.4 2.4 LPI 2.5% CPI 2.1 2.1 For the Ladbrokes Pension Plan post-retirement mortality assumed for most members is based on the standard SAPS mortality table with the CMI 2016 projections, which takes into account future improvements, adjusted to reect plan specic experience.
The assumption used implies that the expected lifetime of members aged 65 in 2018 is 86.6 2017: n a years for males and 88.5 2017: n a years for females.
For members with large pensions a longer lifetime is assumed 89.1 2017: n a for males and 90.0 2017: n a for females.
For the Gala Coral Pension Plan post-retirement mortality assumed for most members is based on the standard SAPS mortality table with the CMI 2016 projections, which takes into account future improvements, adjusted to reect plan specic experience.
The assumption used implies that the expected lifetime of members aged 65 in 2018 is 87.2 years for males and 88.9 years for females Changes to the assumptions will impact the amounts recognised in the consolidated balance sheet and the consolidated income statement in respect of the Plan.
For the significant assumptions, the following sensitivity analysis provides an indication of the impact on the dened benefit obligation for the year ended 31 December 2018: 2018 2018 2017 2017 Coral Ladbrokes Coral Ladbrokes % % % % 0.5% p. a. decrease in the discount rate 9.7 7.9 0.5% p. a. increase in price ination 6.9 4.5 One year increase in life expectancy 3.8 3.6 These sensitivities have been calculated to show the movement in the dened benefit obligation in isolation, and assuming no other changes in market conditions at the accounting date.
This is unlikely in practice, for example, a change in discount rate is unlikely to occur without any movement in the value of the assets held by the Plan.
