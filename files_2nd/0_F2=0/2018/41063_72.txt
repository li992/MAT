The weighted average duration of all three Schemes is 24 years.
1 Significant actuarial assumptions The following are the principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting date expressed as weighted averages : 2018 2018 2017 2017 Financial assumptions CARE RSP CARE RSP Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities % p. a.

The Group believes that this revised approach better reflects expected yields on high quality corporate bonds over the duration of the Groups pension schemes, as required by IAS 19.
The previous methodology estimated the discount rate with reference to both corporate bond and gilt yields.
The new method uses high quality corporate bond yields where available.
At very long durations, where there are no high quality corporate bonds, the yield curve is extrapolated based on available corporate bond yields of mid to long duration.
This change reduced the value placed on the IAS 19 pensions liabilities of the Group by 242m and improved the pre-tax balance sheet position by 234m.
Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on actuarial advice and in accordance with published statistics.
Following analysis completed as part of the 2016 actuarial valuations, the 2017 year end mortality tables used have been updated to the S2PMA S2PFA-Heavy tables males females based on year of birth with a scaling factor of 110% 100% applied to the mortality rates in the Morrison Safeway Scheme respectively, with CMI 2015 projections and a long-term rate of improvement of 1.5% p. a.
