Provisions Provisions and contingent liabilities As disclosed below, our provisions principally relate to obligations arising from property rationalisation programmes, restructuring programmes, asset retirement obligations, network assets, insurance claims, litigation and regulatory risks.
What critical judgements have we made in accounting for provisions?
We exercise judgement in determining the timing and quantum of all provisions to be recognised.
Our assessment includes consideration of whether we have a present obligation, whether payment is probable and if so whether the amount can be estimated reliably.
As part of this assessment, we also assess the likelihood of contingent liabilities occurring in the future which are not recognised as liabilities on our balance sheet.
By their nature, contingencies will be resolved only when one or more uncertain future events occur or fail to occur.
We assess the likelihood that a potential claim or liability will arise and also quantify the possible range of financial outcomes where this can be reasonably determined.
Weve disclosed our assessment of contingent liabilities in note 29.
What other critical estimates and assumptions have we made?
Restructuring programmes involve estimation of the direct cost necessary for the restructuring and exclude items that are associated with ongoing activities.
The amounts below exclude restructuring costs for which the timing and amount are certain.
These are recognised as part of trade and other payables.
Under our property rationalisation programmes weve identified a number of surplus properties.
Although efforts are being made to sublet this space, this is not always possible.
Estimates have been made of the cost of vacant possession and of any shortfall arising from any potential sub-lease income being lower than the lease costs.
Any such shortfall is recognised as a provision.
Asset retirement obligations involve an estimate of the cost to dismantle equipment and restore sites upon vacation and the timing of the event.
The provision represents the groups best estimate of the amount that may be required to settle the obligation.
Network asset provisions represent our future operational costs and vacant site rentals arising from obligations relating to network share agreements.
Costs are expected to be incurred over a period of up to 20 years.
Our regulatory provision represents our best estimate of the cost to settle our present obligation in relation to historical regulatory matters.
The charge for the year represents the outcome of managements re-assessment of the estimates and regulatory risks across a range of issues, including price and service issues.
The prices at which certain services are charged are regulated and may be subject to retrospective adjustment by regulators.
Estimates are used in assessing the likely value of the regulatory risk.
In 2016 17 we recognised a 300m charge in relation to estimated Deemed Consent compensation payments.
The precise amount of the compensation payments will result from discussions with the affected parties and as of 31 March 2018, we still consider this estimate to be appropriate.
In 2016 17 a related fine of 42m was imposed and was recognised as a payable rather than as a provision.
The fine and associated compensation payments totaling 342m were treated as a specific item charge in last years income statement.
The remaining provision increases also reflected managements estimates of regulatory risks across a range of issues, including price and service issues.
These increased by 51m 2016 17: 126m, also treated as specific items, resulting from our reassessment of these other regulatory risks and in light of the regulatory decisions by Ofcom.
