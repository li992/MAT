Theinterest rates on some of our debt, and in the case of our main revolving credit facility, fluctuate based onthe applicable rating of senior unsecured long-term securities of Carnival Corporation or Carnival plc.
For the twelve months ended November 30,2018, wehad noborrowings and repayments of commercial paper with original maturities greater than three months.
Interest-bearing debt is recorded at initial fair value, which normally reflects the proceeds received byus, net of debt issuance costs, and is subsequently stated at amortized cost.
Debt issuance costs are generally amortized to interest expense using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method, over the term of the debt.
In addition, all debt issue discounts and premiums are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest rate method over the term of the notes.
Thefloating rate is based onLIBORor EURIBOR.
Substantially all of our fixed rate debt can be called or prepaid byincurring additional costs.
In addition, substantially all of our debt agreements, including our main revolving credit facility, contain one or more financial covenants that require us to: Maintain minimum debt service coverage Maintain minimum shareholders equity Limit our debt to capital and debt to equity ratios Limit the amounts of our secured assets as well as secured and other indebtedness Generally, if an event of default under any debt agreement occurs, then pursuant to cross default acceleration clauses, substantially all of our outstanding debt and derivative contract payables could become due, and all debt and derivative contracts could be terminated.
AtNovember 30,2018, wewere in compliance with all of our debt covenants.
