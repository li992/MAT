This made a number of changes to the US tax code including reducing the US federal tax rate from 35% to 21% from 1 January 2018.
There is minimal impact on the Group's financial statements for the year to 28 April 2018 as the US deferred tax balances requiring to be restated to the new rate are minimal.
"The mandatory deemed repatriation of certain deferred foreign earnings the ""transition tax"" arises in 2018 and those deemed earnings, provisionally estimated at US$38m, have been sheltered by losses not previously recognised in deferred tax."
Assuming the composition of the Group remains broadly unchanged and that there are no significant changes to expected corporate tax rates or laws in the UK, the US and Canada, the Group expects its future effective tax rate excluding exceptional items to be between 17% and 20%.
The areas where the Group sees uncertainty around the amount of tax that is payable relate to tax losses incurred by Virgin Trains East Coast, the financing of and transactions with overseas i. e. non-UK operations and losses incurred by overseas operations in the ordinary course of business.
In particular, a potential tax asset of 33.8m has not been recognised in respect of accumulated tax losses relating to Virgin Trains East Coast as at 28 April 2018 because the contractual arrangements with government in relation to Virgin Trains East Coast give rise to significant doubt over the Groups ability to access and utilise those losses.
In addition, potential tax assets of 106.7m as at 28 April 2018 have not been recognised in respect of accumulated losses of overseas businesses due to significant uncertainty on the extent to which sufficient taxable profits will be available against which to utilise those losses in a manner acceptable to the relevant tax authorities.
The Directors consider those to represent the most significant estimation uncertainties in respect of tax positions.
d Tax on other comprehensive income The components of tax on other comprehensive income are shown in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on page 77.
To the extent that the deferred tax balances relate to the pension deficit, any rate change impact has been recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
