Exceptional items continued Explanation of exceptional items Year to 31 May 2018 Group structure and systems project The Group has incurred exceptional costs of 11.6 m relating to the project to realign the organisation design to create a more effective operating model.
These represent a continuation of the same project on which exceptional costs were recognised in prior years and mainly consist of restructuring, advisory and IT system related costs.
Impairment of a non-operational European fixed asset A decision was made to impair a non-operational European fixed asset to its latest market value, resulting in a 3.7 m impairment loss being recognised.
Sale of land relating to redundant manufacturing site in Australia In November 2017, the Group sold land relating to a redundant manufacturing site in Australia.
Net proceeds of 10.3 m werereceived against a net book value of 2.2 m resulting in exceptional income before tax of 8.1 m. Change in Naira exchange rate for translation purposes As a result of the evolution of the foreign exchange market in Nigeria, the Group has shifted over the course of the financial year to a position where it is now predominantly accessing US Dollars at the NIFEX rate, which is one of the three official rates of exchange in existence in Nigeria.
As a result of this shift, in May 2018 the Directors reassessed the likely rate of settlement of the Groups Nigerian US Dollar monetary assets and liabilities and concluded that it is appropriate for the Group to move from translating both the Nigerian businesses US Dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities, and the Balance Sheets of its Nigerian operations, at the Central Bank of Nigeria CBN rate to the NIFEX exchange rate from May 2018 onwards.
This change ofaccounting estimate resulted in an exceptional charge of 6.3m before tax as a result of translating the year end balances at the NIFEX rate rather than the CBN rate.
Sale of Australian brand In May 2018, the Group sold a non-core Australian brand, resulting in a 2.3 m tax credit.
Year to 31 May 2017 Group structure and systems project The Group incurred exceptional costs of 6.6m relating to the project to realign the non-manufacturing organisation design to create a more effective Group operating model and to implement a new ERP system.
These costs mainly consisted ofrestructuring, advisory and IT related costs.
Partial recovery of trade receivable in Europe provided for in prior year A credit of 3.1m was recognised relating to the partial recovery of a trade receivable in Europe, which was fully provided for inthe year ended 31 May 2016.
Foreign currency devaluation in Nigeria During the first half of the year, transactional foreign exchange losses were recognised in Nigeria relating to long outstanding brought forward trade payables denominated in US Dollars that have been settled at higher exchange rates than originally recognised due to the introduction of the flexible exchange rate regime on 20 June 2016, which has resulted in a devaluation ofthe Naira of greater than 50%.
The Directors have deemed this charge to be exceptional due to the nature and magnitude ofthis effective currency devaluation.
Deferred tax benefit of reduction in UK corporation tax rate principally relating to acquired brands The UK corporation tax rate reduces to 17% from 1 April 2020.
As a result of this change, the deferred tax balances relating to UK assets and liabilities were reduced to take account of the substantively enacted rate change.
The largest single effect of the rate change was in relation to the deferred tax liabilities recognised when the Sanctuary, St. Tropez and Charles Worthington brands were acquired.
