NOTES TO THE IFRS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED E. FINANCIAL ASSETS & LIABILITIES continued E3.
Derivatives The Group purchases derivative financial instruments principally in connection with the management of its insurance contract andinvestment contract liabilities based on the principles of reduction of risk and efficient portfolio management.
The Group does not typically hold derivatives for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near-term or with the objective of generating a profit from short-term fluctuations in price or margin.
The Group also holds derivatives to hedge financial liabilities denominated in foreign currency.
Derivative financial instruments are largely classified as held for trading.
Such instruments are recognised initially at fair value and are subsequently remeasured to fair value.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Derivative financial instruments are not classified as held for trading where they are designated as a hedging instrument and where the resultant hedge is assessed as effective.
For such instruments, any gain or loss that arises onremeasurement to fair value is initially recognised in other comprehensive income and is recycled to profit or loss as the hedged item impacts the profit or loss.
See note E1 for further details of the Groups hedging accounting policy.

Under these arrangements the majority of the longevity riskhas been passed to third parties.
Derivative assets of 162 million and derivative liabilities of 96 million have been recognised as at 31 December 2018 2017: 144 million and 77 million respectively.
In addition, the Group has entered into a transaction under which it has accepted reinsurance on a portfolio of single andregular premium life insurance policies and retroceded themajority of the insurance risk.
Taken as a whole, this transaction does not give rise to the transfer of significant insurance risk to the Group and therefore does not meet the definition of an insurance contract under the Groups accounting policies.
The fair value of amounts due from the cedant are recognised within loans and deposits see note E1.
The fair value of amounts due to the retrocessionaire are recognised as a derivative liability and totalled 13 million at31 December 2018 2017: 21 million.
A loan liability hasbeen recognised in respect of financing obtained for theinitial reinsurance premium see note E5.
