122 NoTES To ThE CoNSoLIdATEd FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CoNTINuEd 4 NEw STANdArdS ANd INTErprETATIoNS NoT yET AdopTEd The following standards and interpretations, which have been issued by the IASB, become effective after the current year end and have not been early adopted by the Group: In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16 Leases.
The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and was endorsed by the European Union in November 2017.
IFRS 16 results in lessees accounting for most leases within the scope of the standard in a manner similar to the way in which finance leases are currently accounted for under IAS 17 Leases.
Lessees will recognise a right of use asset and a corresponding financial liability on the balance sheet.
The asset will be amortised over the period of the lease and the financial liability measured at amortised cost.
Lessor accounting remains substantially the same as in IAS 17.
The Group is currently in the process of collating information from various regions as part of assessing the impact the standard will have on the Groups financial statements.
As at the date of the publication of these financial statements, it is not practicable to quantify this impact.
