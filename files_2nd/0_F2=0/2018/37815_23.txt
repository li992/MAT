On 1 January 2018 we adopted IFRS 9 which replaced IAS 39.
Under IAS 39, credit impairment charges were recognised on loans and advances to customers when there was objective evidence of impairment.
Losses which may have arisen from future events were not recognised.
Charges were recognised in the income statement under line item Credit impairment charges.
Under IFRS 9, we recognise expected credit losses ECL on all financial assets.
All reasonable and supportable information, including information about past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions at the reporting date is used in measuring ECL.
Charges are recognised in the income statement under line item Expected credit loss expense.
Further details about our transition to IFRS 9 can be found in note 1.4.
A reconciliation between our statutory profit before tax of 40.6 million and our underlying profit before tax of 50.0 million can be found on page 165.
