Financial Statements NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Principal accounting policies 1.1 General information SSE plc the Company is a company domiciled in Scotland.
The address of the registered office is given on the back cover.
The Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about the Group.
1.2 Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 101 Reduced Disclosures FRS 101 and its interpretations as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and adopted by the European Union adopted IFRS.
This represents a change in accounting standards adopted as the Company previously adopted IFRS, as a result of the change no transitional adjustments were identified.
Under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own income statement and related notes.
It has also taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions available under FRS 101.
A Cash flow statement and related notes: Related party disclosures: Disclosures in respect of capital management: and The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs.
As the consolidated financial statements of SSE plc include the equivalent disclosure, the Company has also taken advantage of the exemptions, under FRS 101, available in respect of the following disclosure: Certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair value measurement and the disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial instrument disclosures.
In the prior year the Company assessed that, on the basis of materiality, the disclosures required under IFRS 2 Share-based Payment should be removed.
The Company has assessed that at 31 March 2018 these disclosures continue to be immaterial to the Companys financial statements.
Going concern The Directors consider that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The financial statements are therefore prepared on a going concern basis.
Basis of measurement The financial statements of the Company are prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments, available-for-sale financial assets and assets of the Company pension scheme which are stated at their fair value, and liabilities of the Company pension scheme which are measured using the projected unit credit method.
The directors believe the financial statements present a true and fair view.
The financial statements of the Company are presented in pounds sterling.
Critical accounting judgements and estimation uncertainty In the process of applying the Companys accounting policies, management necessarily makes judgements and estimates that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Changes in the assumptions underlying the estimates could result in a significant impact to the financial statements.
The Groups key accounting judgement and estimation areas are noted in Note 4.1 of the consolidated financial statements, with the most significant financial judgement areas as specifically discussed by the Audit Committee being highlighted separately.
Significant accounting policies The significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of these individual financial statements are set out below.

Investments In the Company, investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less any impairment charges.
Interests in joint arrangements and associates Associates are those investments over which the Company has significant influence but neither control nor joint control.
The Companys interests in its joint operations are accounted for by recognising its share of the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses of the operation.
In these arrangements, the Companys share of the revenue will be eliminated as it relates to its purchased share of the output from the arrangement.
The Companys joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting where the joint venture and associate investments are carried at historical cost plus the Companys share of post-acquisition results, less any impairment in value.
The Company recognises its share of the results of these equity-accounted operations after tax and interest in the income statement.

8.1 Borrowing facilities In September 2017, SSE issued an inaugural Green Bond an 8 year 600m Euro Bond with a coupon of 0.875% and an all in cost of 0.98%.
The total Bond will be denominated in euros to be used as a net investment hedge against the Groups assets in the Republic of Ireland.
In order to maintain the correct level of euro denominated debt against the Republic of Ireland assets, 400m of the 2% June 2020 Bond was swapped to Sterling prior to issuance of the bond which increased the all in cost of that portion of the 600m bond to 2.99%.
The Company has an established 1.5bn Euro commercial paper programme paper can be issued in a range of currencies and swapped into Sterling and as at 31 March 2018 no commercial paper was outstanding 2017: nil.
The Company has 1.5bn 2017: 1.7bn of committed credit facilities in place.
During the year to 31 March 2018 SSE exercised the second, and last, one year extension option on the 1.3bn revolving credit facility meaning this will mature in July 2022.
The 200m bilateral facility has a similar extension option, which was exercised in October 2017 meaning this will mature in November 2022.
The 200m EIB facility that was signed in March 2017 was drawn in the year and became a 10 year term loan.
Included within loans and borrowings at 31 March 2018 is 1.0bn March 2017: 1.0bn of hybrid debt securities issued on 16 March 2017 with an issuer first call date on 16 September 2022.
The dual tranche issuance comprised 300m with a coupon of 3.625% and $900m with a coupon of 4.75%.
The $900m tranche was swapped to both Euros and Sterling, bringing the all-in rate down to 2.72% and resulting in an all-in funding cost for both tranches of 3.02% per annum.
The proceeds of these instruments were used to replace SSEs hybrid equity instruments issued in 2012 at an all-in rate of 5.6% on 2 October 2017 see Note 9.
Due to the instruments having a fixed redemption date, they have been accounted for as debt and are included within loans and borrowings.
This is in contrast to the previous hybrid issues which have had no fixed redemption date and were accounted for as equity.

Retirement benefit obligations Defined benefit scheme The Company has a funded final salary pension scheme which provides defined benefits based on final pensionable pay.
The scheme is subject to an independent valuation at least every three years.
The future benefit obligations are valued by actuarial methods on the basis of an appropriate assessment of the relevant parameters.
The scheme operated by the Company the Scottish Hydro Electric scheme.

This amendment presented a change in circumstance meaning the Company believes that it is no longer required to apply IFRIC 14 to the Scottish Hydro Electric pension scheme surplus or liability.
This had the effect of no longer restricting the pension scheme assets from the prior financial year onwards.
The net pension asset of the Scottish Hydro Electric Scheme at 31 March 2018 was equal to 572.1m 2017: net asset of 525.4m presented after an IFRIC 14 minimum funding requirement of 262.7m.

Commitments and contingencies Guarantees, indemnities and other contingent liabilities SSE plc has provided guarantees on behalf of subsidiary, joint venture and associated undertakings as follows: 2018 2017 SSE on behalf of SSE on behalf of Joint Operations SSE on Behalf of Subsidiary and Ventures Partnerships Total Total m m m m m Bank Borrowing 754.6 754.6 654.4 Performance of contracts 1,506.6 422.0 0.7 1,929.3 1,785.3 Purchase of Gas 10.0 Subsidiaries have provided guarantees on behalf of the Company as follows: 2018 2017 m m Bank borrowing 1,862.8 1,773.9 During the year, SSE plc provided a 300m guarantee in favour of SSE Generation Ltd and a 1.5bn guarantee in favour of SSE Energy Supply Ltd.
Both guarantees are required to support a Moodys requirement to maintain the standalone credit rating of the SSE Subsidiaries.
The guarantees are available on sse.
In the prior year to 31 March 2017, the Group had drawn down 50m from its European Investment Bank facility.
SSE plc had entered into a guarantee with the European Investment Bank in relation to this facility to guarantee the obligations of Scottish Hydro Electric Transmission Plc.
In relation to bank borrowings the guarantee amounts outlined include accrued interest Unlimited guarantees have been provided on behalf of subsidiary undertakings in relation to eight contracts in respect of performance of work and any liabilities arising.
SSE Services Plc, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, has provided a guarantee to Group Trustee Independent Trustees in respect of Southern Electric Group of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme in respect of funding required by the Scheme.
SSE Contracting Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary, has provided a guarantee to Tay Street Lighting Leeds Ltd, Tay Valley Lighting Newcastle & North Tayside Ltd and Tay Valley Lighting Stroke on Trent Ltd in respect of provision and maintenance of public street lighting and illuminated traffic signage.

Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee indebtedness of the other companies within its group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make payment under the guarantee.
Post balance sheet events On 1 April 2018, the Group undertook a reorganisation of the existing combined domestic and business energy supply businesses to create a new GB domestic energy supply and services sub-group headed by SSE Energy Services Group Limited, in advance of the proposed demerger.
Through this reorganisation, various customers, employees, businesses and individual assets or liabilities were transferred between subsidiaries of SSE plc.
Initial consideration for the transfers has been set, with final transfer values to be agreed once completion adjustments finalised.
Whilst there is no consolidated impact from this internal reorganisation, SSE plc expects to recognise within its individual financial statements an undistributable gain on sale between 700m and 900m.
