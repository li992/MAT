Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information 131 Notes to the Financial Statements The Groups tax charge and ETR will be influenced by the global mix and level of profits, changes in future tax rates and other tax legislation, the utilisation of brought forward tax losses on which no deferred tax asset has been recognised, the resolution of open issues with various tax authorities, the ability to benefit from existing financing arrangements, acquisitions, and disposals.
In the longer term the Groups adjusted ETR is likely to be similar to the blended tax rate once there is no further benefit from tax losses on which no deferred tax asset is currently recognised as their recoverability is not considered probable, but may become probable in the future.
The blended tax rate is expected to increase to 23% in 2019 due to a change in the global mix of profits.
Current tax liabilities The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions.
The Group is subject to various uncertainties relating to the determination of its tax liabilities where the ultimate tax liability cannot be known until a resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority, or the issue becomes time barred.
Issues can take many years to resolve and therefore assumptions on the likely outcome have to be made by management.
Where considered appropriate, management establishes provisions for uncertain tax positions on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
The Groups current tax liabilities reflect managements best estimate of the future amounts of corporation tax that will be settled.
Total tax provisions and accruals including interest thereon amounted to 59.7m as at 31 December 2018 2017: 59.9m.
Tax accruals can be built up over a number of years but in the year of resolution there could be adjustments to these accruals which could have a material positive or negative impact on the tax charge for a particular year.
The settlement of a significant issue could also have a material impact on the amount of cash tax payable in any one year.
Significant judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes particularly in relation to the pricing of intra-group goods and services as well as debt financing.
The majority of the tax provisions relate to transfer pricing exposures where the Group faces a number of risks in jurisdictions around the world, and is subject to audits by tax authorities in the territories in which it operates.
Apart from transfer pricing issues the largest single provision relates to a financing structure where the amount provided is now 16.0m.
This is a legacy issue going back to the years 2002 to 2005.
The Group is fully provided for the potential tax and interest payable so there is not expected to be an adverse impact on the income statement.
It is unclear when this issue will be resolved.
On 24 November 2017 the European Commission published an opening decision that the group finance partial exemption in the UKs controlled foreign company rules constitutes State Aid.
A final decision is still awaited and may, in any event, be challenged by the UK tax authorities.
Along with many other UK-based international companies the Group has relied upon the finance company exemption and therefore there is a risk that the benefits may be clawed back, together with interest.
The Group is monitoring developments but does not currently consider that any provision is needed in relation to EU State Aid.
The estimated maximum potential tax liability is approximately 14.0m.
Deferred income tax Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in transactions other than a business combination that at the time of the transactions affect neither the accounting nor taxable profit or loss: and, differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
In recognising the deferred tax asset in respect of UK losses, management have estimated the quantum of future UK taxable profits over the next three years.
The movement on the deferred income tax account is as follows: 2018 2017 m m At 1 January 105.9 110.8 Exchange differences 1.9 1.5 Acquisition of companies and businesses 20.1 5.1 Net impact of disposals 0.7 Credited to the income statement 61.3 13.4 Charged to equity of which 15.7m is related to the adjustment on initial application of IFRS 15 25.9 5.6 At 31 December 92.5 105.9 Deferred taxation has been presented on the balance sheet as follows: Deferred tax asset within non-current assets 3.5 3.4 Deferred tax liability within non-current liabilities 96.0 109.3 92.5 105.9 1.
Deferred taxation credited to the income statement includes 66.0 m 2017: nil relating to the pension settlement.
Rentokil Initial plc Annual Report 2018 132 Notes to the Financial Statements The major components of deferred tax assets and liabilities at the year end without taking into consideration the offsetting of balances within the same tax jurisdiction are as follows: Unremitted Customer Accelerated earnings lists tax Retirement from Tax Share-based intangibles depreciation benefits subsidiaries losses payments Other Total m m m m m m m m At 1 January 2018 60.8 42.5 48.0 3.4 31.0 3.4 14.4 105.9 Exchange differences 2.1 0.9 0.1 0.2 0.8 1.9 Recognised in income statement 3.7 6.5 64.1 0.6 8.0 1.0 7.6 61.3 Recognised in other comprehensive income 15.7 2.6 12.8 25.9 Acquired in business combinations 19.4 0.7 20.1 At 31 December 2018 78.6 50.6 0.5 4.0 23.2 7.0 10.0 92.5 A deferred tax asset of 6.7m 2017: 12.3m has been recognised in respect of UK losses carried forward at 31 December 2018.
This amount has been calculated by estimating the future UK taxable profits, against which the UK tax losses will be utilised, and applying the tax rates substantively enacted as at the balance sheet date applicable for each year.
Remaining UK tax losses of 151.8m have not been recognised as at 31 December 2018.
The reduction in the deferred tax asset recognised on the UK tax losses is due to a decline in inter-group income earned in the UK post the transfer of certain overseas subsidiaries to the joint venture with CWS-boco.
At the balance sheet date the Group has tax losses of 216.3m 2017: 206.0m on which no deferred tax asset is recognised.
Of the losses 19.2m 2017: 23.2m will expire at various dates between 2019 and 2037.
In addition, there are capital losses carried forward of 276.9m 2017: 276.9m on which no deferred tax asset is recognised.
Other deferred tax assets relating to gross temporary timing differences of 2.7m 2017: 6.7m have not been recognised due to the uncertainty regarding their utilisation.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
