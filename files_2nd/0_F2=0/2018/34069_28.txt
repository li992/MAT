Notes to the Accounts Accounts 1 Segmental analysis The executive Board the Chief Operating Decision Maker as defined in IFRS 8 regularly reviews the Groups performance and balance sheet position at both a consolidated and divisional level.
Each division is an operating segment as defined by IFRS 8 in that the executive Board assess performance and allocates resources at this level.
All of the divisions have been aggregated in to one reporting segment on the basis that they share similar economic characteristics, including: national supply agreements are in place for key inputs including materials.
debt is raised centrally and the cost of capital is the same at each division.
sales demand at each division is subject to the same macroeconomic factors, such as mortgage availability and government policy.
Additional information on average selling prices and the unit sales split between north, south, private and social has been included in the Operating Review on pages 28 to 31.
The Board does not, however, consider these categories to be separate reportable segments as they review the entire operations at a consolidated and divisional level when assessing performance and making decisions about the allocation of resources.

The deferred tax assets liabilities held by the Group at the start of the comparative year that were expected to be realised after 31 March 2020 were revalued at 17%, the substantively enacted corporation tax rate that will be effective when they are expected to be realised.
Bellway p. l. c. 98 Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Accounts 5 Income tax expense continued The effective income tax expense is 18.9% of profit before taxation 2017 19.0% and compares favourably to the Groups standard tax rate for the year of 19.0% 2017 19.7%.
The lower effective tax rate in the current year is principally due to enhanced tax deductions received by the Group in relation to land remediation relief and a credit following the finalisation of the prior year corporation tax returns.

7 Earnings per ordinary share Basic earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing earnings by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding the weighted average number of ordinary shares held by the Trust which are treated as cancelled.
Diluted earnings per ordinary share uses the same earnings figure as the basic calculation.
The weighted average number of shares has been adjusted to reflect the dilutive effect of outstanding share options allocated under employee share schemes where the market value exceeds the option price.
Diluted earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing earnings by the diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares.

In each case their principal activity is related to housebuilding.
The Group is made up of 59 subsidiaries and 8 joint arrangements.
Further details are included in note 25.
Where Bellway owns 100% of the voting rights of a business, the company is considered to be controlled by Bellway and is treated as a subsidiary.
North Solihull Partnership LP, Cramlington Developments Limited and Leebell Developments Limited are classified as joint operations as the shareholders have substantially all of the economic benefit of the assets and fund the liabilities of the entities.
Ponton Road LLP and Fradley Residential LLP are classified as joint ventures as the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangements rather than the individual assets and liabilities.
The movement on the investment in the joint ventures during the year is as follows: 2018 2017 000 000 At the start of the year 34,345 4,550 Net increase in loans 7,320 29,383 Share of result 1,798 412 At the end of the year 43,463 34,345 The Groups share of the joint ventures net assets liabilities, income and expenses is made up as follows: 2018 2017 000 000 Non-current assets 14 19 Current assets 48,678 40,046 Current liabilities 44,971 36,832 Non-current liabilities 1,518 2,828 Share of net assets liabilities of joint ventures 2,203 405 Revenue 8,401 2,623 Costs 6,510 2,055 Operating profit 1,891 568 Interest 93 156 Share of result of joint ventures 1,798 412 Guarantees relating to the overdrafts of the joint ventures have been given by the Company see note 21.

Land with a carrying value of 217.0 million 2017 202.0 million was used as security for land payables see note 15.
The directors consider all inventories to be essentially current in nature although the Groups operational cycle is such that a proportion of inventories will not be realised within 12 months.
It is not possible to determine with accuracy when specific inventory will be realised as this is subject to a number of factors including consumer demand and planning permission delays.
The Company has no inventory.

Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2018 103 Notes to the Accounts continued 16 Financial instruments Land purchased on deferred terms The Group sometimes acquires land on deferred payment terms.
In accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, the creditor is initially recorded at fair value, being the price paid for the land discounted to present day, and subsequently at amortised cost.
The difference between the nominal value and the initial fair value is amortised over the deferred term to finance expenses, increasing the land creditor to its full cash settlement value on the payment date.
The maturity profile of the total contracted cash payments in respect of amounts due on land creditors at the balance sheet date is as follows: Balance Total Within 1 12 years 25 years More than at 31 July contracted year or on 5 years cash payment demand 000 000 000 000 000 000 At 31 July 2018 365,375 371,950 287,414 57,549 26,987 At 31 July 2017 366,773 373,574 256,832 82,953 33,789 The maturity profile of the total contracted payments in respect of financial liabilities excluding amounts due on land creditors shown separately above is as follows: Balance Total Within 1 12 years 25 years More than at 31 July contracted year or on 5 years cash payment demand 000 000 000 000 000 000 Bank loans floating rates Trade and other payables 324,336 324,336 322,398 1,938 At 31 July 2018 324,336 324,336 322,398 1,938 Bank loans floating rates 30,000 30,012 30,012 Trade and other payables 282,551 282,551 280,558 1,993 At 31 July 2017 312,551 312,563 310,570 1,993 The imputed interest rate on land payables reflects market interest rates available to the Group on floating rate bank loans at the time of acquiring the land.

Cash and cash equivalents This comprises cash held by the Group and short-term bank deposits with a maturity date of less than one month.
The amounts of cash and cash equivalents for the years ended 31 July 2018 and 31 July 2017 for both the Group and the Company are shown in note 20.
At 31 July 2018 the average interest rate earned on the temporary closing cash balance, excluding joint ventures, was 0.36% 2017 0.24%.

23 Employee benefits a Retirement benefit assets obligations The Group sponsors the Bellway plc 1972 Pension Scheme the Scheme which has a funded defined benefit arrangement which is closed to new members and to future service accrual.
The Group also sponsors the Bellway plc 2008 Group Self Invested Personal Pension Plan GSIPP which is a defined contribution contract-based arrangement.
Contributions of 5.092 million 2017 4.068 million were charged to the income statement for the GSIPP.
Defined contributions have been excluded from the assets and liabilities.
Role of Trustees The Scheme is managed by the Trustees, who are appointed by either the Company or the members.
The role of the Trustees is to manage the Scheme in line with the Scheme trust deed and rules, to act prudently, responsibly, honestly, impartially and in the interests of all beneficiaries.
The main responsibilities of the Trustees are to agree with the employer the level of contributions to the Scheme, to make sure these contributions are paid, to decide how the Schemes assets are invested so the Scheme is able to meet its liabilities and to oversee that the payment of benefits, record keeping and administration of the Scheme complies with the Scheme trust deed and rules and legislation.
Funding UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently i. e. to a level in excess of the current expected cost of providing benefits.
The last full actuarial valuation of the Scheme was carried out by a qualified independent actuary as at 31 July 2017 and updated on an approximate basis to 31 July 2018.
With regard to the Scheme, regular contributions made by the employer over the financial year were nil 2017 nil.
The employer paid no special contributions 2017 nil and reimbursed the pension fund 0.37 million 2017 0.40 million for expenses incurred by the fund.
The Group is expected to make no regular contributions during the year ending 31 July 2019.
Regulation The UK pensions market is regulated by the Pensions Regulator whose key statutory objectives in relation to UK defined benefit plans are: to protect the benefits of members of occupational pension schemes: to promote, and to improve understanding of the good administration of work-based pension schemes: to reduce the risk of situations arising which may lead to compensation being payable from the Pension Protection Fund: and to maximise employer compliance with employer duties and the employment safeguards introduced by the Pensions Act 2008.
Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2018 107 Notes to the Accounts continued 23 Employee benefits continued Risk The Scheme exposes the Group to a number of risks, the most significant are: Risk Description Asset volatility The Schemes defined benefit obligation is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields.
However, a significant proportion of the Schemes assets are invested in growth assets, such as equities, that would be expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term but create volatility and risk in the short-term.
Inflation risk A significant proportion of the Schemes defined benefit obligation is linked to inflation, with higher inflation increasing the liabilities.
However, there are caps of either a 3% or 5% p. a. increase in place to limit the effect of higher inflation.
Life expectancy The majority of the Schemes liabilities are to provide a pension for the life of the member, with any increase in life expectancy also increasing the Schemes defined benefit obligation.

Bellway p. l. c. 108 Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Accounts 23 Employee benefits continued Actuarial assumptions The following are the principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting date: 2018 2017 % per annum % per annum Discount rate 2.65 2.55 Future salary increases 3.70 3.70 Allowance for pension in payment increases of RPI or 5% p. a. if less 3.10 3.10 Allowance for deferred pension increases of CPI or 5% p. a. if less 2.20 2.20 Allowance for commutation of pension for cash at retirement 50% of maximum 50% of maximum The mortality assumptions adopted at 31 July 2018 are based on the S2PxA tables and allow for future improvement in mortality.
The tables used imply the following life expectancies at age 65: Male retiring at age 65 in 2018 22.7 years Female retiring at age 65 in 2018 24.6 years Male retiring at age 65 in 2038 24.1 years Female retiring at age 65 in 2038 26.2 years Sensitivities The calculation of the defined benefit obligation is sensitive to the assumptions set out above.
The following table summarises the effect on the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period if different assumptions were used: Assumption Change in assumption Change in liabilities % Discount rate -0.25% p. a.
Increase by 4.4% Future salary increases 0.25% p. a.
Increase by 0.3% Inflation RPI 0.25% p. a.
Increase by 3.0% Mortality 1 year life expectancy Increase by 3.1% The calculations for the sensitivity analysis are not as accurate as a full valuation carried out using these assumptions.
Each assumption change is considered in isolation, which in practice is unlikely to occur, as changes in some of the assumptions are correlated.
b Share-based payments The Group operates a long-term incentive plan LTIP, a share matching plan SMP, deferred bonus plans DBP and 2003 DBP, an employee share option scheme and Savings Related Share Option Schemes SRSOS, all of which are detailed below.
Awards under the LTIP and SMP have been made to executive directors, the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, and senior employees, with awards under the 2003 DBP also made to senior employees.
The awards take the form of ordinary shares in the Company.
The Bellway p. l. c. 2014 Employee Share Option Scheme 2014 ESOS is an approved discretionary scheme which provides for the grant of options over ordinary shares to employees and executive directors.
It is, however, the current intention that no executive directors of the Company should be granted options under this scheme.
Awards will be available to vest after three years, subject to objective performance targets.
As at 31 July 2018 no options had been granted under this scheme.
Options issued under the SRSOS are offered to all employees including the executive directors.
An outline of the performance conditions in relation to the LTIP and the SMP is detailed under the long-term incentive scheme section on pages 70 to 75 within the Remuneration Report.
No awards have been made under the SMP since 2014 and there are no awards outstanding under the SMP as at 31 July 2018.
Various small share option awards have been made to employees at divisional management level under the terms of the 2003 DBP.
There are no DBP awards outstanding.
Share-based payments have been valued by an external third party using various models detailed below, based on publicly available market data at the time of the grant, which the directors consider to be the most appropriate method of determining their fair value.
Bellway p. l. c.

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was 3,291.7p 2017 2,530.3p.
Valuation methodology For LTIP options, half of the performance criteria is based on TSR against comparator companies with the other half based on TSR measured against the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts and financial service companies.
A simplified Monte Carlo simulation method has been used to determine the Groups TSR performance against the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts and financial service companies.
In the case of the 2003 DBP, there are no market-related performance conditions and awards will be eligible to vest upon reaching a date set out in the Deed of the award.
As dividends are not reinvested, the fair value of these awards is equal to the share price at the date of the grant.
The Black Scholes method is used for the SRSOS due to the relatively short exercise window of six months.
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted is measured by reference to the fair value of the share options granted.
