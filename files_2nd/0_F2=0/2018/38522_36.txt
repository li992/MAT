Pantheon International Plc 112 Annual Report and Accounts 2018 AIFMD Disclosures The Company is an alternative investment fund AIF for the purposes of the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive Directive 2011 61 EU AIFMD and the Manager was appointed as its alternative investment fund manager AIFM for the purposes of the AIFMD with effect from 21 July 2014.
The manager is a full scope AIFM for the purposes of the AIFMD.
The AIFMD requires certain disclosures to be made in the Annual Report of the Company.
Many of these disclosures were already required by the listing rules and or United Kingdom Accounting Standards and these continue to be presented in other sections of the Annual Report, principally the Strategic Report pages 1 to 23, the Managers Review pages 24 to 57 and the financial statements pages 86 to 109.
This section completes the disclosures required by the AIFMD.
Assets subject to special arrangements The Company holds no assets subject to special arrangements arising from their illiquid nature.

The total remuneration paid by the Manager and its affiliates to staff of the Manager in respect of the financial year ended 31 May 2018 attributable to work relating to the Company was as follows: Twelve months to 31 May 2018 Eleven months to 31 May 2017 Fixed Variable Total Fixed Variable Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Senior Management 542 674 1,216 497 547 1,044 Staff 1,028 662 1,690 849 486 1,335 Total Staff 1,570 1,336 2,906 1,346 1,033 2,379 Identified Staff 325 464 790 271 347 618 No carried interest was paid in respect of the Company during the year.
The above disclosures reflect only that element of the individuals remuneration which is attributable to the activities of the Manager relating to the Company.
It is not possible to attribute remuneration paid to individual staff directly to income received from any fund and hence the above figures represent a notional approximation only calculated by reference to the assets under management of the Company as a proportion of the total assets under management of the Pantheon Group.
In determining the remuneration paid to its staff, the Manager takes into account a number of factors including the performance of the company, the Manager, and each individual member of staff.
These factors are considered over a multi-year framework and include whether staff have met the Managers compliance standards.
In addition, the manager seeks to ensure that its remuneration policies and practices align financial incentives for staff with the risks undertaken and results achieved by investors, for example by ensuring that a proportion of the variable income received by Identified Staff is deferred for a period of at least three years.
