Distinctions of operating and finance leases, the Directors of the Company do not anticipate that leases off balance sheet and finance leases on balance sheet are removed the application of IFRS 16 will have a significant impact on the amounts for lessee accounting and are replaced by a model where a right-of-use asset recognised in the Groups consolidated financial statements.

These include: The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost and subsequently The assessment of how reasonably certain it is considered to be that measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, a lease option extension, termination or purchase will be exercised: adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability.

Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Financial Statements J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2018 109 5 Operating profit Accounting policies Revenue Revenue consists of sales through retail outlets and online and, in the case of Financial Services, interest receivable, fees and commissions and excludes Value Added Tax.
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of goods and services have been passed to the buyer and it can be measured reliably.
a Retail sale of goods Sales through retail outlets are shown net of returns, colleague discounts, vouchers and sales made on an agency basis.
Commission income is recognised in revenue based on the terms of the contract.
Prior to the acquisition of Nectar UK, revenue was also shown net of the cost of Nectar reward points issued and redeemed.
Prior to acquisition, the Groups accounting policy for Nectar points was to recognise sales net of the cost of Nectar points issued and redeemed, based on agreed rates with Aimia UK.
Since acquisition, any points issued and redeemed in Sainsburys and Argos are accounted for in line with IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes.
Under IFRIC 13, on issuance of Nectar points within the Group, a portion of the transaction price is allocated to the loyalty programme using the fair value of points issued and corresponding deferred revenue recognised in relation to points issued but not yet redeemed.
The deferral is treated as a deduction from revenue.
The fair value of the points awarded is determined with reference to the fair value to the customer and considers factors such as breakage and the money off that each point entitles a customer to.
Deferred revenue is subsequently recognised when Nectar points are redeemed.
Sales of in-store goods are generally recognised at the point of cash receipt.
For delivered goods, sales are recognised when the goods have been delivered.
b Other income Other income generally consists of profits and losses on disposal of assets.
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Nectar revenue earned from non-Sainsburys redemption partners is included within other income and recognised once points have been redeemed.
c Financial Services interest receivable Interest income is recognised in the income statement for all instruments measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
This calculation takes into account all amounts that are integral to the yield as well as incremental transaction costs.
The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the expected future cash flows over the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability at initial recognition.
d Financial Services fees and commissions Fees and commissions that are not integral to the effective interest rate calculation relate primarily to certain credit card and storecard fees, ATM interchange fees, insurance introduction commission and warranty commission receivable.
These are recognised in the income statement on an accruals basis as services are provided.
Where in the case of insurance commissions the income comprises an initial commission and profit share, both are recognised on completion of the service to the extent reliably measurable.
Where there is a risk of potential claw back, an appropriate element of the commission receivable is deferred and amortised over the clawback period.
Where the relevant contract requires Financial Services to perform future services in respect of the income receivable, initial commission is recognised on completion of the service provided, with an element deferred to reflect services yet to be performed in future periods.
e Financial Services other operating income Margin from the sale of travel money, representing the difference between the cost price and the selling price, is recognised when the sale to the customer takes place within other operating income.
Cost of sales Cost of sales consists of all costs that are directly attributable to the point of sale including warehouse, transportation costs and all the costs of operating retail outlets.
In the case of Financial Services, cost of sales includes interest expense on operating activities, calculated using the effective interest method.
Operating profit is stated after charging crediting the following items: 2018 2017 m m Employee costs note 28 3,134 2,878 1 Depreciation expense note 10 659 600 2 Amortisation expense note 11 72 28 Profit on disposal of properties note 3 11 101 Operating lease rentals land and buildings 706 625 other leases 90 80 sublease payments receivable 54 53 Foreign exchange losses gains 22 7 Impairment losses on loans and advances 68 33 3 Impairment and onerous contract charges note 3 37 IT write-offs note 3 57 1 Depreciation expense includes 18 million 2017: 6 million in relation to the unwind of acquisition adjustments.

6 Finance income and finance costs Accounting policies Finance income and costs, excluding those arising from Financial Services, are recognised in the income statement for financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
For Financial Services, finance income and finance costs are recognised in revenue and cost of sales.
Interest paid and interest received for the purpose of the cash flow statement relates to Retail only, with Financial Services interest paid and interest received included in the net operating cash flow.
The coupons on the perpetual capital securities and perpetual convertible bonds are accounted for as dividends in accordance with IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and hence are not a finance cost.

Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Financial Statements J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2018 111 7 Taxation Accounting policies Current tax Current tax is accounted for on the basis of tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Current tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity or other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is accounted for on the basis of temporary differences arising from differences between the tax base and accounting base of assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax is recognised for all temporary differences, except to the extent where it arises from the initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit.
It is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity or other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches and joint ventures except where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

114 Financial Statements J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2018 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 8 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan Trusts note 22, which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the earnings attributable to the ordinary shareholders are adjusted by the interest on the senior convertible bonds net of tax and by the coupons on the perpetual subordinated convertible bonds net of tax.
The weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year and the number of shares that would be issued if all senior convertible bonds and perpetual subordinated convertible bonds are assumed to be converted.
Underlying earnings per share is provided by excluding the effect of any non-underlying items as defined in note 3.
This alternative measure of earnings per share is presented to reflect the Groups underlying trading performance.
All operations are continuing for the periods presented.
2018 2017 million million Weighted average number of shares in issue 2,186.2 2,049.0 Weighted average number of dilutive share options 21.8 18.2 Weighted average number of dilutive senior convertible bonds 143.5 137.7 Weighted average number of dilutive subordinated perpetual convertible bonds 78.3 75.1 Total number of shares for calculating diluted earnings per share 2,429.8 2,280.0 m m Profit for the financial year net of tax 309 377 Less profit attributable to: Holders of perpetual capital securities 12 12 Holders of perpetual convertible bonds 6 6 Profit for the financial year attributable to ordinary shareholders 291 359 m m Profit for the financial year attributable to ordinary shareholders 291 359 Add interest on senior convertible bonds net of tax 12 12 Add coupon on subordinated perpetual convertible bonds net of tax 6 6 Diluted earnings for calculating diluted earnings per share 309 377 m m Profit for the financial year attributable to ordinary shareholders of the parent 291 359 Adjusted for non-underlying items note 3 180 78 Tax on non-underlying items 42 9 1 Add back coupons on perpetual securities net of tax 18 18 Underlying profit after tax attributable to ordinary shareholders of the parent 447 446 Add interest on convertible bonds net of tax 12 12 Add coupon on subordinated perpetual convertible bonds net of tax 6 6 Diluted underlying profit after tax attributable to ordinary shareholders of the parent 465 464 Pence Pence per per share share Basic earnings 13.3 17.5 Diluted earnings 12.7 16.5 Underlying basic earnings 20.4 21.8 Underlying diluted earnings 19.1 20.4 1 Underlying earnings per share calculation is based on underlying profit after tax attributable to ordinary shareholders.

This results in a total final proposed dividend of 156 million 2017: 144 million, an increase of 8.3 per cent on the previous year.
Subject to shareholders approval at the Annual General Meeting, the dividend will be paid on 13 July 2018 to the shareholders on the register at 8 June 2018.
The proposed final dividend has not been included as a liability at 10 March 2018.
10 Property, plant and equipment Accounting policies a Land and buildings Land and buildings are held at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised provision for impairment.
Capital work in progress is held at cost less any recognised provision for impairment.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs to bringing the asset to its working condition for intended use.
This includes capitalised borrowing costs.
b Fixtures and equipment Fixtures, equipment and vehicles are held at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised provision for impairment.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition and its intended use.
c Depreciation Depreciation is calculated to write down the cost of the assets to their residual values, on a straight-line basis, using the following rates: Freehold buildings and leasehold properties 50 years, or the lease term if shorter Fixtures, equipment and vehicles three to 15 years Freehold land is not depreciated Capital work in progress is not depreciated.
Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing proceeds less any associated costs of disposal with the assets carrying amount and are recognised within operating profit.
The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
Impairment of non-financial assets At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset, being the higher of its fair value less costs to dispose and its value in use, is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit CGU to which the asset belongs.
For Retail property, plant and equipment, the CGU is deemed to be each trading store, store pipeline development site or in the case of Argos a cluster of stores.
Non-store assets, including depots and IT assets, are reviewed separately, whilst Financial Services is deemed a separate CGU.
Any impairment loss is recognised in the income statement in the year in which it occurs.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses due to a change in the original estimate, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, or its original carrying value less notional accumulated depreciation if lower.
Capitalisation of interest Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets are capitalised to the cost of the asset, gross of tax relief.
Leased assets Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
For property leases, the land and building elements are treated separately to determine the appropriate lease classification.
a Finance leases Assets funded through finance leases are capitalised as property, plant and equipment and depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the lease term.
The amount capitalised is the lower of the fair value of the asset or the present value of the minimum lease payments during the lease term.
The resulting lease obligations are included in liabilities net of finance charges.
Finance costs on finance leases are charged directly to the income statement.
b Lease incentives Lease incentives primarily include up-front cash payments or rent-free periods.
Lease incentives are capitalised and spread over the period of the lease term.

Goodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful life.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and again whenever indicators of impairment are detected and is carried at cost less any provision for impairment.
b Computer software Computer software is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any provision for impairment.
Externally acquired computer software and software licences are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives of five to fifteen years.
Costs relating to development of computer software for internal use are capitalised once the recognition criteria of IAS 38 Intangible Assets are met.
Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are expensed as incurred.
When the software is available for its intended use, these costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives of five to fifteen years within administrative expenses.
c Acquired intangible assets Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Intangible assets with finite useful economic lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any provision for impairment and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives, ranging from three to ten years, within administrative expenses.
Impairment of non-financial assets At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
Where an impairment loss, other than an impairment loss on goodwill, subsequently reverses due to a change in the original estimate, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, or its original carrying value less notional accumulated depreciation if lower.

The CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated and the level at which it is monitored in the Retail segment are deemed to be the respective acquired retail chains of stores, whilst Financial Services is a separate CGU.
The value of the goodwill was tested for impairment during the current financial year by means of comparing the recoverable amount of each CGU or group of CGUs with the carrying value of its goodwill.
The calculation of the Retail CGUs value in use is calculated on the cash flows expected to be generated by the stores using the latest budget and forecast data.
Estimates of sales and costs are based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market.
Board approved cash flow projections for five years are used and then extrapolated out assuming flat cash flows and discounted at a pre-tax rate of nine per cent 2017: nine per cent over the earlier of a 25-year period being the estimated average remaining useful life of a freehold store or lease length for leasehold stores.
Financial Services CGUs value in use is calculated using Board approved cash flows discounted at a pre-tax rate of nine per cent 2017: nine per cent over a five-year period with a terminal value.
Home Retail Group acquisition of the Argos brand is considered a separate CGU.
Total value in use for Argos is calculated using total Board approved cash flows for the Argos business as a whole over a five-year period and then into perpetuity and discounted at a pre-tax rate of nine per cent.
Goodwill arising on the purchase of Nectar has been allocated to the Groups Retail segment.
Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Financial Statements J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2018 119 11 Intangible assets continued Based on the operating performance of the CGUs, an impairment of goodwill of nil was identified in the current financial year 2017: nil.
The valuations indicate sufficient headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions would not result in any impairment of goodwill.
Sensitivity analysis on the impairment tests for each group of CGU to which goodwill has been allocated has been performed.
Management are satisfied that there are no changes to assumptions that would lead to impairment.
Additions to acquired brands and customer relationships in the current year arose from the acquisition of Nectar UK.
The brand is amortised over five years whilst the customer relationships are amortised between one and five years.
Additions to acquired brands in the prior year arose from the acquisition of HRG and relates to the Argos brand.
This is being amortised over ten years.
12 Investments in joint ventures and associates Accounting policies The Group applies IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements to all joint arrangements.
Under IFRS 11, investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor.
The Group has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements and determined them to be joint ventures.
The Groups share of the post-tax results of its joint ventures and associates is included in the income statement using the equity method of accounting.
Where the Group transacts with a joint venture or associate, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the joint venture or associate.
Investments in joint ventures and associates are carried in the Group balance sheet at historical cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of net assets of the entity, less any provision for impairment.
The Groups principal joint venture is: Share of ordinary Country of Statutory allotted registration or year-end capital incorporation BL Sainsbury Superstores Limited British Land property investment 31 March 50% England A full list of the Groups joint ventures is included in note 38.

They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Subsequent to initial recognition at fair value plus transaction costs, these assets are recorded at fair value at each period end with the movements recognised in other comprehensive income until derecognition or impaired at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income reserves is recognised in the income statement.
Dividends on available-for-sale equity instruments are recognised in the income statement when the entitys right to receive payment is established.
Interest on available-for-sale debt instruments is recognised using the effective interest method.

In the current year there was a 1.6 million disposal of an available-for-sale financial asset 2017: nil.
There were no impairment provisions in either the current or the previous financial year.
14 Inventories Accounting policies Inventories comprise goods held for resale and properties held for resale or in the course of development and are valued on a weighted average cost basis and carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Cost includes all direct expenditure and other appropriate attributable costs incurred in bringing inventories to their present location and condition.

Other receivables have both non-interest and interest bearing receivables.
Trade and other receivables are stated at their carrying amounts and are written off when management deems them uncollectable or forgiven.
2018 2017 m m Non-current Other receivables 35 59 Prepayments and accrued income 9 10 44 69 Current Trade receivables 117 106 Other receivables 470 312 587 418 Prepayments and accrued income 157 156 744 574 Current other receivables of 470 million 2017: 312 million, which include 213 million 2017: 165 million of bank funds in the course of settlement, are generally non-interest bearing.
The carrying amounts of trade and other receivables are denominated in sterling.
The Groups exposure to credit risk arising from its retail operations is minimal given that the customer base is large and unrelated and that the overwhelming majority of customer transactions are settled through cash or secure electronic means.
New parties wishing to obtain credit terms with the Group are credit checked prior to invoices being raised and credit limits are determined on an individual basis.
b Amounts due from Financial Services customers Accounting policies Loans and advances are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently held at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment and recognised on the balance sheet when cash is advanced.
For the Financial Services portfolios of loans, such as credit card lending and personal loans, impairment provisions are calculated for groups of assets, otherwise impairment is identified at a counterparty specific level following objective evidence that a financial asset is impaired.
Such evidence may include a missed interest or principal payment or the breach of a banking covenant.
Provisioning on unsecured balances identified as being in arrears is calculated based on past experience, with regularly updated assumptions.
The present value of estimated cash flows recoverable is determined after taking into account any security held.
The amount of impairment is calculated by comparing the present value of the cash flows discounted at the loans original effective interest rate with the balance sheet carrying value.
If impaired, the carrying value is adjusted and the difference charged to the income statement and a provision recognised in the balance sheet.
The written down value of the impaired loan is compounded back to the net realisable balance over time using the effective interest rate.
This is reported through revenue within the income statement and represents the unwinding of the discount.
A write-off is made when all or part of a loan or advance is deemed uncollectable or forgiven.
Write-offs are charged against previously established provisions for impairment or directly to the income statement.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts written off decrease the charge for loan impairment in the income statement.
Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Financial Statements J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2018 123 15 Receivables continued An allowance for impairment losses is also maintained in respect of assets which are impaired at the balance sheet date but which have not been identified as such, based on historical loss experience and other relevant factors.
This includes analysis of the likelihood of a particular balance to move into an arrears status within a defined period of time and application of an appropriate loss rate.
The emergence period into an arrears state represents the average time elapsed between the loss trigger event and default.
The methodology and assumptions used are regularly reviewed to reduce any differences between estimates and actual results.

124 Financial Statements J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2018 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 16 Assets and liabilities held for sale Accounting policies Assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable within one year from the date of classification and the assets and liabilities are available-for-sale in their present condition.
Assets held for sale are stated at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less costs to dispose.

Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Financial Statements J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2018 125 18 Provisions Accounting policies Provisions are recognised when there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, for which it is probable that an outflow of economic benefit will be required to settle the obligation and where the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.
The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense.
The need for provisions for onerous leases, measured net of expected rental income, is assessed when the leased property becomes vacant and is no longer used in the operations of the business or when the leased property relates to an unprofitable trading store.
Provisions for dilapidation costs are recognised on a lease-by-lease basis.
Provisions for onerous contracts are recognised where expected cash outflows exceed the anticipated future benefits.
The amounts provided are based on the Groups best estimate of the likely committed outflow net of anticipated future benefits and after any impairment of pipeline development site assets where applicable.
A restructuring provision is recognised when the Group has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main features to those affected by it.
The measurement of a restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring.

Provisions for onerous leases are recognised where expected cash outflows exceed the anticipated future benefits.
The amounts provided are based on the Groups best estimate of the likely committed outflow, net of anticipated future benefits and after any impairment of pipeline development site assets where applicable.
The onerous lease provision covers residual lease commitments of up to an average of 34 years 2017: 32 years, after allowance for existing or anticipated sublet rental income.
Insurance provisions The provision relates to the Groups outstanding insurance claims liabilities in relation to public and employers liability claims, and third party motor claims.
Claims provisions are based on assumptions regarding past claims experience and on assessments by an independent actuary and are intended to provide a best estimate of the most likely or expected outcome.
Restructuring provisions A restructuring provision is recognised when the Group has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main features to those affected by it.
The charge for the year is driven by the announced transformational changes to the Groups in-store operating model, responding to changing customer shopping habits and reducing costs throughout the store estate.
Financial Services related provisions Financial Services related provisions are primarily in relation to Argos Financial Services customers in respect of potential redress payable arising from the historic sales of Payment Protection Insurance PPI, and in respect of potential customer redress payable in relation to other customer conduct issues arising from a review of the governance and risk management framework.
Other provisions Provisions for warranties and long service awards have been included within other provisions.

128 Financial Statements J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2018 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 21 Perpetual securities Accounting policies and key information Perpetual securities perpetual capital securities and perpetual convertible bonds are issued securities that qualify for recognition as equity.
Accordingly any periodic returns are accounted for as dividends and recognised directly in equity and as a liability at the time it becomes obligated to pay the periodic return.
Any associated tax impacts are recognised directly in equity.
On 30 July 2015 the Group issued 250 million of perpetual subordinated capital securities and 250 million of perpetual subordinated convertible bonds, collectively known as perpetual securities.
Costs directly associated with the issue of 6 million were offset against the value of the proceeds.
The securities are perpetual with no fixed redemption date.
Holders of the perpetual securities do not benefit from any put option rights however the Group does have the right to call the perpetual subordinated capital securities at their principal amount on 30 July 2020, and the perpetual subordinated convertible bonds on 30 July 2021.
The perpetual subordinated convertible bonds may be converted into ordinary shares of the Company at the option of the holders at any time up to 23 July 2021 at a conversion price of 315.0195 pence.
The Group has the right to defer coupons on the perpetual securities on any coupon payment date where the Company has not either paid a dividend on its ordinary shares or bought back ordinary shares excluding shares bought to satisfy employee share schemes within the previous 12 month period.
The coupon rate on the perpetual subordinated capital securities increases after the fifth anniversary and for the perpetual subordinated convertible bonds after the sixth anniversary.
The next coupon date on the perpetual securities is 30 July 2018.
As the Company paid a dividend to ordinary shareholders in the 12 months prior to this date in January 2018, the periodic distributions of 7 million 2017: 7 million for the perpetual subordinated capital securities and 16 million 2017: 16 million for the perpetual subordinated convertible bonds have been recognised in the financial year.

130 Financial Statements J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2018 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 23 Financial risk management The principal financial risks faced by the Group relate to liquidity risk, counterparty credit risk, foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, commodity risk and capital risk.
Financial risk management is managed by a central treasury department in accordance with policies and guidelines which are reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors.
The risk management policies are designed to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance by identifying financial exposures and setting appropriate risk limits and controls.
The risk management policies also ensure sufficient liquidity is available to the Group to meet foreseeable financial obligations and that cash assets are invested safely.
Financial risk management with respect to Financial Services is separately managed within the Financial Services governance structure.
The risks are more fully described in the Financial Services section below.
The Group uses forward contracts to hedge foreign exchange and commodity exposures, and cross currency swap contracts and interest rate swap contracts to hedge interest rate exposures.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by Board approved policies which prohibit the use of derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group could be unable to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The principal operational cash flow of the Group is largely stable and predictable reflecting the low business risk profile of the food retail sector and the cyclical profile of the non-food retail sector.
Cash flow forecasts are produced to assist management in identifying future liquidity requirements.
The Groups liquidity policy sets a minimum funding headroom of 400 million in excess of forecast net debt over a rolling 12 month time horizon.
The Group manages its liquidity risk by maintaining a core of long-dated borrowings, pre-funding future cash flow commitments and holding contingent committed credit facilities.
On 17 October 2017 the Group refinanced its syndicated committed revolving credit facility.
The 1,450 million facility is split into two facilities, a 300 million Facility A maturing in April 2023 and a 1,150 million Facility B consisting of three tranches: a 300 million tranche A maturing in October 2020, a 400 million tranche B maturing in October 2021 and a 450 million tranche C maturing in October 2022.

Further information relating to liquidity risk in Financial Services is more fully described in the separate section on Financial Services financial risk factors below.
Counterparty credit risk Counterparty credit risk is the risk of a financial loss arising from counterparty default or non-performance in respect of the Groups holdings of cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial assets, deposits with banks, investments in marketable securities, trade and other receivables and loans and advances to customers.
The Group considers its maximum credit risk to be 8,980 million 2017: 6,967 million, equivalent to the Groups total financial assets and commitments, and of this amount 7,798 million relates to Financial Services 2017: 5,620 million.
The Group excluding Financial Services sets counterparty limits for each of its banking and investment counterparties based on their credit ratings.
The minimum unsecured long-term credit rating accepted by the Group is BBBStandard & Poors and Fitch or Baa3 Moodys or, in the case of sterling liquidity funds, AAA or Aaa MR1 from Moodys.
In the event of a split credit rating, the lower rating applies.

Financial Services has derivatives that are governed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association and their associated credit support annex bilateral agreements whereby if the fair value exceeds a pre-agreed level, cash collateral is exchanged.
As at 10 March 2018, Financial Services and its subsidiary undertakings had received collateral of 8 million 2017: provided collateral of 19 million against the derivatives.
The Group also operates a cash pooling arrangement and collective net overdraft facility with its main clearing bank.
As at 10 March 2018, the Group had 2 million 2017: 6 million under this facility.
Foreign currency risk Currency risk is the risk of increased costs arising from unexpected movements in exchange rates impacting the Groups foreign currency denominated supply contracts.
The Groups currency risk policy seeks to limit the impact of fluctuating exchange rates on the Groups income statement by requiring highly probable foreign currency cash flows to be hedged.
Highly probable future cash flows, which may be either contracted or uncontracted, are hedged on a layered basis using foreign currency forward contracts.
The Group has exposure to currency risk on balances held in foreign currency denominated bank accounts, which may arise due to short-term timing differences on maturing hedges and underlying supplier payments.
Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Financial Statements J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2018 133 23 Financial risk management continued The Group considers that a ten per cent movement in exchange rates against sterling is a reasonable measure of volatility.
The impact of a ten per cent movement in the exchange rate of US dollar and euro versus sterling as at the balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant, is summarised in the table below: 2018 2017 2018 Change in 2017 Change in Change in exchange Change in exchange exchange rate impact exchange rate impact rate impact on cash rate impact on cash on post-tax flow hedge on post-tax flow hedge profit reserve profit reserve -10% -10% -10% -10% Group m m m m USD GBP 19 19 98 119 12 15 114 139 EUR GBP 1 1 19 23 2 2 10 13 Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk of increased costs or lower income arising from unexpected movements in interest rates and inflation rates impacting on the Groups borrowing and investment portfolios.
The Groups interest rate policy seeks to limit the impact of fluctuating interest and inflation rates by maintaining a diversified mix of fixed rate, floating rate and variable capped rate liabilities.
Interest on financial instruments is classified as fixed rate if interest re-sets on the borrowings are less frequent than once every 12 months.
Interest on financial instruments is classified as floating rate if interest re-sets on the borrowings occur every 12 months or more frequently.
Floating rate instruments are considered variable capped rate if the nominal interest rate is subject to a cap.

The Boards capital objective is to maintain a strong and efficient capital base to support the Groups strategic objectives, provide optimal returns for shareholders and safeguard the Groups status as a going concern.
There has been no change to capital risk management policies during the year.
The Board monitors a broad range of financial metrics including return on capital employed, balance sheet gearing and fixed charge cover.
The Board can manage the Groups capital structure by diversifying the debt portfolio, adjusting the size and timing of dividends paid to shareholders, recycling capital through sale and leaseback transactions, issuing new shares or repurchasing shares in the open market and flexing capital expenditure.
From time-to-time the Company purchases its own shares in the market for the purpose of issuing shares under the Groups share option programmes: however the Group does not operate a defined share buy-back plan.
Part of the Groups capital risk management is to ensure compliance with the general covenants included in the Groups various borrowing facilities.
There have been no breaches of general covenants in the financial year ended 10 March 2018.

We seek to ensure that we can meet our financial obligations at all times, even under liquidity stress conditions.
The annual Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process ILAAP enables the Bank to: 1 demonstrate that it understands the liquidity risks it is running 2 assess its liquidity needs under various stress scenarios and 3 put in place appropriate controls to mitigate liquidity risks.
In meeting its internal limits as well as PRA requirements, the Bank maintains a stock of high quality liquid assets that can be readily monetised by outright sale or repurchase agreement to meet the Banks obligations to depositors and other creditors.
The Banks Liquidity Coverage Ratio LCR and Net Stable Funding Ratio NSFR are regularly monitored and forecast alongside cash flow and funding ratios.

Financial primary risk 136 Financial Statements J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2018 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 23 Financial risk management continued Market risk Market risk is the risk that the value of the Banks assets, liabilities, capital and earnings are exposed to the adverse change of the market risk drivers.
The Banks market risks include Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book IRRBB and Foreign Exchange FX Risk.
The Bank does not have a trading book.
Interest rate risk IRRBB arises from interest rate movements which impact present value and timing of future cash flows resulting in changes to the underlying value of a banks assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments and hence its economic value.
Interest rate movements also affect a banks earnings by altering interest-sensitive income and expenses, affecting its net interest income.
The main types of interest rate risk faced by the Bank are: a Re-pricing gap risk: the risk arising from timing differences in the interest rate changes of bank assets and liabilities e. g. fixed rate personal loans and instant access savings accounts.
b Yield curve risk: the risk arising from changes in the slope and shape of the yield curve.
c Basis risk: risk arising from imperfect correlation between different interest rate indices e. g. administered rate on savings products and treasury assets linked to LIBOR.
d Prepayment risk: the risk arising from the timing of customer prepayments which differ from planning and hedging assumptions.
e Pipeline risk: the risk of a customer drawing down, or not, a product at a rate which is unfavourable for the Bank.
Interest risk exposure is actively managed within limits that are aligned with the Banks risk appetite by using financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and by taking into account natural hedges between assets and liabilities.
The hedging strategies are implemented to ensure the Bank remains within its limits and that it takes advantage of natural hedging opportunities between fixed rate assets and liabilities with similar re-pricing characteristics.
In order to measure the exposure to interest rate risk under various interest rates shock scenarios, the Bank uses both economic value and earnings-based metrics: Market Value Sensitivity and Earnings at Risk.
These metrics are monthly monitored and reported to ALCO.
For interest rate risk measurement, products are allocated within re-pricing gap analysis based on their nearest re-pricing date all non-maturing deposits are assumed to re-price in month one and personal loans are allocated according to behavioural repayment profile.
Foreign exchange risk The Bank is exposed to FX risk through its holding of cash denominated in foreign currencies, primarily euro and US dollar, within its Travel Money bureaux in J Sainsburys stores.
From February 2017 onwards the FX positions are hedged on a daily basis.
Credit risk Credit risk is central to the Banks day-to-day activities and is managed in line with the Bank Board approved risk appetite.
Key developments over the course of the year have been the successful roll out of Sainsburys Bank mortgages providing our customers with a wider range of financial services to meet their needs, and the successful transition of loans applications from LBG to the New Banking Programme systems and processes.
Work continues on the transfer of the Credit Card Portfolio onto the New Banking Programme systems, with this due to complete within the 2018 19 financial year.
Retail credit risk Retail credit risk is the possibility of losses arising from a retail customer failing to meet their agreed repayment terms as they fall due.
Retail Credit utilise automated scorecards to assess the credit-worthiness and affordability criteria of new applicants and ongoing behavioural characteristics of existing customers.
The outcomes from all scorecard models are monitored utilising a set of credit quality metrics to ensure actual performance is in line with agreed expectations.
Additional expert underwriting of credit applications is undertaken by a specialist operational team where further consideration is appropriate.
The Retail Credit Risk Committee provides portfolio oversight control over credit strategy to maintain lending in line with the Board approved risk appetite, with additional oversight and control provided by the Executive Risk Committee and the Board Risk Committee.
Finally, Internal Audit provide additional assurance by undertaking regular reviews on the adequacy of credit risk policies and procedures.
Wholesale and derivative credit risk The Bank invests its liquidity resources in eligible investment securities that qualify for the regulatory Liquidity Coverage Ratio LCR and internal Operational Liquidity Pool OLP.
These investments include the Bank of Englands BoE reserve account, UK government securities gilts or Treasury bills, multilateral development bank securities, government guaranteed agency securities, UK regulated covered bond programmes and asset backed securities.
Limits are established for all counterparty and asset class exposures based on their respective credit quality and market liquidity.
Consideration is also given to geographical region and the strength of relevant sovereign credit ratings.
Derivatives are subject to the same credit risk control procedures as are applied to other wholesale market instruments and the credit risk arising from mark to market derivative valuations is mitigated by daily margin calls, posting cash collateral to cover exposures.
Daily monitoring is undertaken by the Banks Treasury department, including early warning indicators with appropriate triggers for escalation.

Financial Services capital resources unaudited The following table analyses the regulatory capital resources under CRD IV.
From a prudential perspective, the Bank is monitored and supervised on a consolidated basis with its subsidiary, Home Retail Group Card Services Limited, from the point of acquisition of Argos Financial Services in September 2016.
The Bank has obtained an individual consolidation waiver from the PRA, which allows the Bank to monitor its capital position on a consolidated basis only.
Therefore, the 2018 and 2017 capital positions shown below are on a regulatory consolidated basis.

140 Financial Statements J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2018 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 24 Financial instruments Accounting policies a Financial assets The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: fair value through profit or loss FVTPL, loans and receivables, and available-for-sale AFS.
Financial assets held at FVTPL are initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs are expensed.
AFS investments are initially measured at fair value including transaction costs and are recognised at the trade date.
Financial assets held at FVTPL include financial assets held for trading and those designated at FVTPL at inception and are recorded at fair value, with any fair value gains or losses recognised in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
AFS investments are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories.
Subsequent to initial recognition at fair value plus transaction costs, these assets are recorded at fair value at each period end with the movements recognised in other comprehensive income until derecognition, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income reserves are recycled in the income statement.
Dividends on AFS equity instruments are recognised in the income statement when the entitys right to receive payment is established.
Interest on AFS debt instruments is recognised using the effective interest method.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
The Group has no intention of trading these loans and receivables and include amounts due from Financial Services customers and amounts due from other banks.
Subsequent to initial recognition at fair value plus transaction costs, these assets are carried at amortised cost less impairment using the effective interest method.
Income from these financial assets is calculated on an effective yield basis and is recognised in the income statement.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or where the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Within Financial Services, securities sold subject to standard sale and repurchase agreements repos are not derecognised where the Bank retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership by virtue of the predetermined repurchase price.
The counterparty liability is included in other deposits.
b Impairment of financial assets An assessment of whether there is objective evidence of impairment is carried out for all financial assets or groups of financial assets at the balance sheet date.
An assessment of impairment may be of individual assets individual impairment or of a portfolio of assets collective impairment where indicators arise.
A financial asset or a group of financial assets is considered to be impaired if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset a loss event and that the loss event or events has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
For individual impairment, the principal loss event is one or more missed payments, although other loss events can also be taken into account, including arrangements in place to pay less than the contractual payments, fraud and bankruptcy or other financial difficulty indicators.
An assessment of collective impairment will be made for financial assets with similar risk characteristics.
For these assets, portfolio loss experience is used to provide objective evidence of impairment.
Where there is objective evidence that an impairment loss exists on loans and receivables, impairment provisions are made to reduce the carrying value of financial assets to the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the charge to the income statement reflects the movement in the level of provisions made, together with amounts written off net of recoveries in the year.
In the case of equity investments classified as available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the asset below its cost is considered in determining whether the asset is impaired.
If any such evidence exists for available-for-sale financial assets, the cumulative loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in the income statement on equity instruments are not reversed.
In relation to impairment losses recognised on debt instruments, if in a subsequent period, the fair value of a debt instrument classified as available-for-sale increases and can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in the income statement, the impairment loss is reversed through the income statement.
Interest will continue to accrue on all financial assets, based on the written down carrying value based on the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss.
To the extent that a provision may be increased or decreased in subsequent periods, the recognition of interest will be based on the latest balance net of provision.
c Financial Services loans and advances including impairment For Financial Services portfolios of loans, such as credit card lending, storecard lending and personal loans, impairment provisions are calculated for groups of assets, otherwise impairment is identified at a counterparty specific level following objective evidence that a financial asset is impaired.
The written down value of the impaired loan is compounded back to its net realisable balance over time using an effective interest rate.
This is reported through interest receivable within the income statement and represents the unwinding of the discount.
A write-off is made when all or part of a claim is deemed uncollectable or forgiven.
Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Financial Statements J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2018 141 24 Financial instruments continued An allowance for impairment losses is also maintained in respect of assets which are impaired at the balance sheet date but which have not been identified as such, based on historical loss experience and other relevant factors.
Interest-bearing bank loans, overdrafts, other deposits and amounts due to Sainsburys Bank customers are recorded initially at fair value, which is generally the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Subsequently, these liabilities are held at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
d Financial liabilities Financial liabilities costs, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis in the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
The fair value of the liability component of a convertible bond is determined using the market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible bond.
This amount is recorded as a liability on an amortised cost basis until extinguished on conversion or maturity of the bonds.
The remainder of the proceeds are allocated to the conversion option which is recognised in shareholders equity, net of income tax effects and is not subsequently remeasured.
Issue costs are apportioned between the liability and the equity components of the convertible bonds based on their carrying amounts at the date of issue.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
e Fair value estimation The methods and assumptions applied in determining the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are disclosed below in the financial disclosure section.
f Offsetting financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the company or the counterparty.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity risks.
All derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are also measured at fair value at subsequent reporting dates.
Where derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, any changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument are recognised in the income statement as finance income or costs as they arise.
To qualify for hedge accounting, the Group documents, at the inception of the hedge, the hedging risk management strategy, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risks being hedged and an assessment of the effectiveness of the hedging relationship to ensure it is highly effective on an ongoing basis.
Where a derivative does qualify for hedge accounting, any changes in fair value are recognised depending on the nature of the hedge relationship and the item being hedged as follows: a Cash flow hedges Hedge relationships are classified as cash flow hedges where the derivative financial instruments hedge the Groups exposure to variability in cash flows resulting from a highly probable forecasted transaction.
These include the exchange rate risk of inventory purchases denominated in foreign currency, as well as the commodity risk on purchases of power and fuel.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
If a cash flow hedge is hedging a firm commitment or forecast transaction that results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
b Fair value hedges Hedge relationships are classified as fair value hedges where the derivative financial instruments hedge the change in the fair value of a financial asset or liability due to movements in interest rates.
The changes in fair value of the hedging instrument are recognised in the income statement.
The hedged item is also adjusted for changes in fair value with the corresponding adjustment made in the income statement.
c Portfolio fair value hedging During the period Sainsburys Bank used portfolio fair value hedging as a risk management tool for hedging interest rate risk on the personal loans portfolio.
Portfolio fair value hedging allows the designation of the whole or part of a portfolio of assets or liabilities with similar risk exposures.
The hedged item can be designated based on expected maturities to match the hedging derivative maturity.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in other comprehensive income is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to the income statement for the period.

Fair value Set out below is a comparison of the carrying amount and the fair value of financial instruments that are carried in the financial statements at a value other than fair value.
The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are based on prices available from the market on which the instruments are traded.
Where market values are not available, the fair values of financial assets and liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The fair values of short-term deposits, trade receivables, other receivables, overdrafts and payables are assumed to approximate to their book values.

The fair value of financial liabilities was 9,033 million 2017: 7,508 million of which 452 million 2017: 473 million has been determined using market values and is within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
The remaining 8,581 million 2017: 7,035 million has been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates and is within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Fair value measurements recognised in the balance sheet The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are recognised at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are derived from quoted market prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the balance sheet date.
This level includes listed equity securities and debt instrument on public exchanges: Level 2 fair value measurements are derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
The fair value of financial instruments is determined by discounting expected cash flows at prevailing interest rates: and Level 3 fair value measurements are derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.

These transactions have been accounted for as fair value hedges note 24.
In previous years, 572 million of fixed to floating rate swaps accounted for as fair value hedges were fide-designated from their fair value hedging relationship.
The fair value adjustment of the debt previously hedged by these swaps will be amortised over the remaining life of the loans, resulting in an amortisation charge to the income statement in the current financial year of 1 million 2017: 1 million.
The Group has entered into inflation swaps to convert 590 million 2017: 400 million of the 712 million 2017: 743 million loan due 2031 from RPI linked interest to fixed rate interest for periods maturing April 2018 to April 2019.

150 Financial Statements J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2018 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 29 Retirement benefit obligations Accounting policies In respect of defined benefit pension schemes, the surplus or deficit recognised in the balance sheet represents the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date.
The defined benefit obligation is actuarially calculated on an annual basis using the projected unit credit method.
Plan assets are recorded at fair value.
Actuarial gains and losses are reported in the statement of other comprehensive income as incurred, and comprise both the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments arising because of differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred.
The income statement charge consists of a financing charge, which is the net of interest cost on pension scheme liabilities and interest income on plan assets and defined benefit pension scheme expenses.
The financing charge is determined by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation to the pension scheme liabilities and plan assets at the beginning of the financial year.
The Group contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the income statement as incurred.
Any contributions unpaid at the balance sheet date are included as an accrual as at that date.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
Background At 10 March 2018, retirement benefit obligations related to two defined benefit schemes, the Sainsburys Pension Scheme and, from 2 September 2016, the Home Retail Group Pension Scheme the Schemes as well as two unfunded pension liabilities relating to senior former employees of Sainsburys and Home Retail Group.
The retirement benefit obligations at the year-end have been calculated by KPMG, as actuarial advisers to the Group, using the projected unit credit method and based on adjusting the position at the date of the previous triennial valuations see below for known events and changes in market conditions as allowed under IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
Sainsburys Pension Scheme The Scheme has three different benefit categories: Final Salary, Career Average and Cash Balance.
For Final Salary and Career Average members, benefits at retirement are determined by length of service and salary.
For Cash Balance members, benefits are determined by the accrued retirement account credits.
The Scheme was closed to new employees on 31 January 2002 and closed to future benefit accrual on 28 September 2013.
The Scheme is also used to pay life assurance benefits to current including new colleagues.
The assets of the Scheme are valued at bid price and are held separately from the Groups assets.
The Scheme was subject to a triennial actuarial valuation, carried out by Willis Towers Watson for the Trustee, as at 14 March 2015 on the projected unit basis.
On the basis of the assumptions agreed, the actuarial deficit at 14 March 2015 was 740 million, an increase of 148 million from the March 2012 deficit of 592 million.
A Recovery Plan was agreed in September 2016 which included: Two special contributions of 125 million paid in August 2015 and August 2016.
Deficit contributions increasing to 65 million a year until March 2021.
The interest in the property partnership to continue, of up to 600 million payable in 2030 if there is a deficit at that time.
The Scheme continues to receive annual coupons from the property partnership which are based on the average weighted discount rate used in the triennial valuation and so are effectively reset every three years.
These coupons reduced from 2017 18 to 19 million a year.
The Scheme has a well-defined investment strategy that has been agreed with the Company.
This aims for the Scheme to be funded on a low risk basis by 2023 referencing investment returns by asset class based on forward looking assumptions.
A new investment strategy will be agreed as the current funding target is approached.
Home Retail Group Pension Scheme The Scheme was closed to new employees in 2009 and closed to future benefit accrual in January 2013.
The Scheme is used to pay life assurance benefits only to current including new colleagues.
Pension benefits were based on service and final salary.
The Home Retail Group defined benefit pension scheme was subject to a Trustees triennial valuation as at 31 March 2015.
This was carried out by Willis Towers Watson for the Trustee.
On the basis of the assumptions agreed, the actuarial deficit as at 31 March 2015 was 315 million, an increase of 157 million from the March 2012 deficit of 158 million.
A Recovery Plan was agreed and implemented on acquisition which included: An immediate payment on acquisition by Sainsburys of 50 million.
Deficit contributions of 40 million a year, 10 million payable each quarter, until October 2021.
Security over 80 million of freehold property.
A parent guarantee of 470 million which reduces over time in line with deficit contributions paid and will be reset following triennial valuations.
An additional payment of 50 million on the sale of Homebase by Home Retail Group.
Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Financial Statements J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2018 151 29 Retirement benefit obligations continued Scheme merger agreement On 20 March 2018, subsequent to year-end, the HRG Pension Scheme was merged into the Sainsburys Pension Scheme.
The merger is on a segregated basis with two sections the Argos section and the Sainsburys section.
There is no change to members benefits and each sections assets are ring-fenced for the benefit of the members of that section.
As part of the merger agreement, the merged Schemes year end has been moved to 30 September which better fits the triennial valuation process.
The Merged Schemes Trustee has directors from both the Sainsburys Pension Scheme and the HRG Pension Scheme.
There are currently 11 directors but this will reduce to nine once the 2018 triennial valuation is complete.
The current chair of the merged Schemes Trustee is retiring in June 2018 and will be replaced by a new independent chair.
This is a Company appointment in consultation with the Trustee.
The investment strategy of the Argos section is being developed following the merger with the Sainsburys Pension Scheme.
A date by which a low risk funding level is to be achieved by reference to a forward looking asset return assumption will be agreed with the Trustee board.
The assets and liabilities of the HRG Scheme form a separate section in the Sainsburys Pension Scheme.
As part of the merger agreement, eligible pension scheme members were offered the opportunity to take a Winding Up Lump Sum.
These will be paid to those members who accepted in May 2018 when the HRG Pension Scheme will be wound up.
All other assets and liabilities have been transferred to the Argos section of the Sainsburys Pension Scheme.
The next triennial valuation is due as at 10 March 2018.
Unfunded pension liabilities The unfunded pension liabilities are unwound when each employee reaches retirement and takes their pension from the Group payroll or is crystallised in the event of an employee leaving or retiring and choosing to take the provision as a one-off cash payment.
IFRIC 14 IFRIC 14 is the interpretation that details when a company can recognise any pension surplus that exists.
Furthermore, if the company has a funding commitment in excess of the IAS 19 deficit, then IFRIC 14 requires recognition of this excess in those circumstances when the surplus that would result on fulfilling that commitment cannot be recognised.
A surplus may be recognised either because of an unconditional right to a refund to the company, or on grounds of a future contribution reduction where schemes are still open to future accrual.
For the Sainsburys Pension Scheme, management is of the view that it has an unconditional right to a refund of surplus under IFRIC 14.
As such no adjustment has been made for potential additional liabilities.
Based on the net deficit of the Home Retail Group Pension Scheme as at 10 March 2018 and the committed payments under the Schedule of Contributions signed on 2 September 2016, there is a notional surplus of 78 million.
Management is of the view that, based on the scheme rules, it does not have an unconditional right to a refund of surplus under IFRIC 14, and therefore an additional balance sheet liability in respect of a minimum funding requirement of 78 million has been recognised.

d Assumptions The principal actuarial assumptions used at the balance sheet date are as follows: 2018 2017 % % Discount rate 2.80 2.70 Inflation rate RPI 3.15 3.30 Inflation rate CPI 2.15 2.30 Future pension increases 1.90 3.00 2.00 3.15 During the financial year the Group has changed the model used for deriving the discount rate assumption for valuing the Schemes liabilities under IAS 19 to use an approach that the Group believes better reflects expected yields on high quality corporate bonds over the duration of the Groups pension schemes.
For long duration liabilities there exists limited data.
Under the old model the extrapolation for long duration liabilities projected in line with a risk-free curve, whereas the new method extrapolates the available corporate bond data at a credit spread above gilt rates.
In addition, in order to broaden the corporate bond dataset, we have assumed that high quality corporate bonds are those which at least one of the main ratings agencies considers to be at least AA or equivalent, whereas in previous years we required that the majority of the rating agencies rated a bond as AA.
The resulting gain recognised in other comprehensive income is included within the 495 million of actuarial gains due to changes in financial assumptions as disclosed in Section b above.
The base mortality assumptions are based on the SAPS S2 tables, with adjustments to reflect the Schemes population.
Future mortality improvements have been updated from CMI 2015 projections at 2017 year-end to CMI 2017 projections with a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25 per cent p. a. at 10 March 2018.

The sensitivities are calculated using the same methodology used to calculate the retirement benefit obligation, by considering the change in the retirement benefit obligation for a given change in assumption.
The net retirement benefit obligation is the difference between the retirement benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets.
Changes in the assumptions may occur at the same time as changes in the fair value of plan assets.
There has been no change in the calculation methodology since the prior period.

f Future benefit payments The Groups expected contributions to the defined benefit scheme for the next financial year ending 9 March 2019 are 91 million for Sainsburys and 40 million for HRG.
Details of future committed payments are included in the Background section at the beginning of this note.
The duration of the plan liabilities is around 22 years for Sainsburys and 25 years for HRG.
The following table provides information on the timing of benefit payments amounts undiscounted : 2018 m Within the next 12 months next annual reporting period 224 Between 2 and 5 years 998 Between 6 and 15 years 3,468 Between 16 and 25 years 4,580 Beyond 25 years 9,918 Total expected payments 19,188 30 Share-based payments Accounting policies The Group provides benefits to employees including Directors of the Group in the form of equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares, rights over shares or the value of those shares in cash terms.
For equity-settled share-based payments, the fair value of the employee services rendered is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares awarded or options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
All share options are valued using an option-pricing model Black-Scholes or Monte Carlo.
This fair value is charged to the income statement over the vesting period of the share-based payment scheme.
For cash-settled share-based payments, the fair value of the employee services rendered is determined at each balance sheet date and the charge recognised through the income statement over the vesting period of the share-based payment scheme, with the corresponding increase in accruals.
The value of the charge is adjusted in the income statement over the remainder of the vesting period to reflect expected and actual levels of options vesting, with the corresponding adjustments made in equity and accruals.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as a capital contribution.
The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised over the vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity.
The Group recognised 33 million 2017: 32 million of employee costs note 28 related to share-based payment transactions made during the financial year.
Of these, nil 2017: nil were cash-settled.
156 Financial Statements J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2018 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 30 Share-based payments continued The Group operates a number of share-based payment schemes as set out below: a Savings-Related Share Option Scheme Sharesave The Group operates a Savings-Related Share Option Scheme, which is open to all UK employees with more than three months continuous service.
This is an approved HMRC scheme and was established in 1980.
Under Sharesave, participants remaining in the Groups employment at the end of the three-year or five-year savings period are entitled to use their savings to purchase shares in the Company at a stated exercise price.
Employees leaving for certain reasons are able to use their savings to purchase shares within six months of their leaving.
A reconciliation of Sharesave option movements is shown below: 2018 Weighted 2017 2018 average 2017 Weighted Number of exercise Number of average options price options exercise price million pence million pence Outstanding at the beginning of the year 66.5 210 59.0 234 Granted 23.7 184 27.1 184 Forfeited 15.8 230 16.7 249 Exercised 5.9 207 2.6 249 Expired 0.3 208 Outstanding at the end of the year 68.5 196 66.5 210 Exercisable at the end of the year 6.4 228 5.7 301 Exercisable price range 184 to 332 185 to 332 The weighted average share price for options exercised over the year was 257 pence 2017: 269 pence.
The weighted average remaining contractual life of options outstanding at 10 March 2018 was 2.3 years 2017: 2.4 years.
Options granted during the year were valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
No performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations.
The fair value per option granted during the year and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows: 2018 2017 Share price at grant date pence 238 231 Exercise price pence 184 185 Expected volatility 3 year period % 27.2 29.9 5 year period % 26.0 25.5 Option life 3 year period years 3.2 3.2 5 year period years 5.2 5.2 Expected dividends expressed as dividend yield % 4.8 4.9 Risk-free interest rate 3 year period % 0.8 0.8 5 year period % 1.3 1.6 Fair value per option 3 year period pence 51 49 5 year period pence 49 45 The expected volatility is based on the standard deviation of the Groups share price for the period immediately prior to the date of grant of award, over the period identical to the vesting period of the award, adjusted for managements view of future volatility of the share price.
As part of the prior year acquisition of Home Retail Group plc HRG colleagues had the option to roll over their HRG Save As You Earn SAYE options to a J Sainsbury plc SAYE option or let their HRG options vest.
Therefore the above outstanding SAYE options include the rollover options.
The calculation of the fair value per option rolled over has not been included within the table above.
b Long-Term Incentive Plan Under the Long-Term Incentive Plan, shares are conditionally awarded to the senior managers in the Company.
The core awards are calculated as a percentage of the participants salaries and scaled according to grades.
Performance is measured at the end of the three-year performance period.
If the required performance conditions have been met, the awards vest and 50 per cent of the award will be released.
Subject to participants remaining in employment for a further year, the balance will then be released one year after the vesting date.
Options granted to acquire the award of shares will expire two years from the vesting date.
Dividends will accrue on the shares that vest in the form of additional shares.
The core award can grow by up to four times, dependent on the level of performance.
Straight-line vesting will apply if performance falls between two points.
Awards are structured as nil cost options.

c Deferred Share Award The Deferred Share Award targets a diverse range of financial and strategic scorecard measures.
These are intended to reward the top managers in the Company, including Executive Directors, for driving the short-term objectives that will directly lead to building the sustainable, long-term growth of the Company.
Share-based awards are made to participants subject to performance against a basket of measures.
At least 50 per cent of the awards are based on the delivery of financial performance and returns to shareholders.
The balance is based on measures which will assess the Companys performance relative to its competitors as well as key strategic goals.
Performance against the target is measured over one financial year.
Any shares awarded are deferred for a further two years to ensure that managements interests continue to be aligned with those of shareholders.
The shares are subject to forfeiture if the participant resigns or is dismissed.
Dividends accrue on the shares that vest in the form of additional shares.

31 Acquisition of subsidiaries Accounting policies for business combinations The Group applies the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations.
The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of identifiable assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group at the acquisition date.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
Acquisition of Nectar loyalty scheme On 1 February 2018, the Group acquired 100 per cent of the share capital of Nectar Loyalty Holding Limited, a United Kingdom registered private company which owns the Nectar UK loyalty scheme as well as the remaining 50 per cent share of the Groups joint venture Insight 2 Communication LLP.
The acquisition enables the full and independent operation of the Nectar loyalty programme in the UK.
Consideration fair value at acquisition date Form of consideration m Cash 33 Acquisition-date fair value of the previously held equity interest 6 Total 39 None of the goodwill recognised of 147 million is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
The goodwill was calculated as the difference between the fair value of consideration paid and the fair value of net assets acquired as set out in the following table.
Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Financial Statements J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2018 159 31 Acquisition of subsidiaries continued The provisional assets and liabilities recognised as a result of the acquisition are as follows: Fair value of net assets acquired provisional m Fixed assets 3 Intangible assets 57 Trade and other receivables 141 Deferred tax assets 19 Cash and cash equivalents 168 Total assets acquired 388 Trade and other payables 228 Deferred revenue 268 Total liabilities acquired 496 Net identifiable assets acquired at fair value 108 Goodwill arising on acquisition 147 Purchase consideration transferred 39 In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, the acquisition accounting will be finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date of 1 February 2018.
Intangible assets Intangible assets of 57 million relate to the Nectar brand, customer relationships and reacquired rights in relation to existing contractual relationships with Sainsburys, as well as acquired software assets.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables of 141 million includes nil of provisions for doubtful debts.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash acquired included cash left in the business to settle accounts payable balances owed to the Group.
Deferred revenue 265 million of the deferred revenue relates to points issued by issuance partners including Sainsburys but not yet redeemed and has been included within trade and other payables within the Group balance sheet.
Revenue and profit contribution Prior to acquisition, the Groups accounting policy for Nectar points was to recognise sales net of the cost of Nectar points issued and redeemed, based on agreed rates with Aimia UK.
Under IFRIC 13, on issuance of Nectar points within the Group, a portion of the transaction price is allocated to the loyalty programme using the fair value of points issued and corresponding deferred revenue recognised in relation to points issued but not yet redeemed or expired.
Deferred revenue is then recognised as points are redeemed.

32 Operating lease commitments Accounting policies Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group.
a Operating leases Assets leased under operating leases are charged directly to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
b Sale and leaseback A sale and leaseback transaction is one where a vendor sells an asset and immediately reacquires the use of that asset by entering into a lease with the buyer.
For sale and finance leasebacks, any apparent profit or loss from the sale is deferred and amortised over the lease term.
For sale and operating leasebacks, generally the assets are sold at fair value, and the profit or loss from the sale is recognised immediately in the income statement.
d Operating lease income Operating lease income consists of rentals from sub-tenant agreements and is recognised as earned on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The Group leases various retail stores, offices, depots and equipment under non-cancellable operating leases.
The leases have varying terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights.
The table below sets out the Groups reasonably certain future lease payments: 2018 2017 m m Aggregate future minimum lease payments: Within one year 743 760 In the second to fifth years inclusive 2,565 2,615 After five years 6,711 7,117 10,019 10,492 Further analysis of the Groups future minimum lease payments after five years is as follows: 2018 2017 m m Aggregate future minimum lease payments: Greater than five years but less than ten years 2,073 1,924 Greater than ten years but less than 15 years 1,396 1,253 After 15 years 3,242 3,940 6,711 7,117 162 Financial Statements J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2018 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 32 Operating lease commitments continued The commercial terms of the Groups operating leases vary, however they commonly include either a market rent review or an index linked rent review with a cap and collar.
The timing of when rent reviews take place differs for each lease.
The Group has pre-emption rights over a minor number of properties, which provides the Group with the right of first refusal to purchase the property in the event the landlord chooses to sell.
The option price payable for the asset in each instance is normally referenced to current market value prevailing at the point of pre-emption.
The Group sublets certain leased properties: 2018 2017 m m Aggregate future minimum lease receipts: Within one year 41 39 In the second to fifth years inclusive 113 119 After five years 119 116 273 274 33 Capital commitments At 10 March 2018, capital commitments contracted, but not provided for by the Group, amounted to 103 million 11 March 2017: 118 million.
34 Financial commitments Sainsburys Bank has off balance sheet commitments to extend credit to customers of 267 million 2017: 98 million.
35 Contingent liabilities The Group has a number of contingent liabilities in respect of historic lease guarantees, particularly in relation to the disposal of assets, which if the current tenant and their ultimate parents become insolvent, may expose the Group to a material liability.
This is not expected to materialise.
The Company is currently subject to claims brought by approximately 1,000 employees in the Employment Tribunal for equal pay under the Equality Act 2010 and or the Equal Pay Act 1970.
The claimants, who are predominantly female store employees, allege that their pay should be equal to that of the Companys predominantly male depot warehouse employees on the basis that their work is of equal value to that of their depot comparators and that any disparity in pay between these different job positions is not objectively justified.
A number of other grocery and other retailers are subject to similar claims.
Typically, claims of this nature can take many years to be determined.
Given that the claims against the Company are at an early stage and are currently stayed, the outcome of such claims is highly uncertain at this stage and, at present, it is not possible to predict the number of such claims that may be filed or reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings were the claims to be upheld.
The Company believes that it has strong legal and factual defences to the claims.
