Major restructuring costs Within the Pharmaceuticals sector, the highly regulated manufacturing operations and supply chains and long lifecycle of the business mean that restructuring programmes, particularly those that involve the rationalisation or closure of manufacturing or R&D sites, are likely to take several years to complete.
Major restructuring costs are those related to specific Board approved Major restructuring programmes, including integration costs following material acquisitions, which are structural and are of a significant scale where the costs of individual or related projects exceed 25 million.
The existing Combined restructuring and integration programme incorporates the previous Major Change programme, the Pharmaceuticals restructuring programme and the restructuring and integration programme following the Novartis transaction in 2015.
In July 2018, the Board approved a new Major restructuring programme, which is designed to significantly improve the competitiveness and efficiency of the Groups cost base with savings delivered primarily through supply chain optimisation and reductions in administrative costs.
