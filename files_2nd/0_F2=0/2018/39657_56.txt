NET DEBT AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE CONTINUED 14 Financial instruments This note shows details of the fair value and carrying value of short and long-term borrowings, trade and other payables, trade and other receivables, short-term bank deposits and cash at bank and in hand.
These items are all classified as financial instruments under accounting standards.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
In order to assist users of these financial statements in making an assessment of any risks relating to financial instruments, this note also shows the ageing of these items and analyses their sensitivity to changes in key inputs, such as interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
An explanation of the Groups exposure to and management of capital, liquidity, credit, interest rate and foreign currency risk is set out in the financial risk management section at the end of this note.
Accounting policy Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or when the Group has transferred those rights and either has also transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset or has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset but no longer has control of the asset.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.
14.1 Fair values of financial instruments The carrying amounts of the following financial assets and liabilities approximate to their fair values: trade and other payables excluding tax and social security, trade and other receivables excluding prepayments and accrued income, short-term bank deposits and cash at bank and in hand.
The fair value of borrowings is determined by reference to interest rate movements on the US $ private placement market and therefore can be considered as a level 2 fair value as defined within IFRS 13.

The Group has a US$ fixed asset investment in an unquoted equity instrument which is classified as an available-for-sale financial asset and carried at its fair value of 17m 2017: 15m.
The fair value of the investment has been determined using a discounted cash flow valuation technique.
The main inputs to the calculation for which assumptions have been made are the discount rate, the timing of future cash flows and the period over which the investment will continue to be held.
The gain on revaluation of 1m 2017: nil is recognised in other comprehensive income.
The remaining movement is due to foreign currency exchange.
This is a level 3 fair value as defined within IFRS 13.

14.4 Market risk sensitivity analysis Financial instruments affected by market risks include borrowings and deposits.
The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being sterling, US Dollar and Euro interest rates, and sterling US Dollar and sterling Euro exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis assumes reasonable movements in foreign exchange and interest rates before the effect of tax.
The Group considers a reasonable interest rate movement in LIBOR to be 1%, based on interest rate history.
Similarly, sensitivity to movements in sterling US Dollar and sterling Euro exchange rates of 10% are shown, reflecting changes of reasonable proportion in the context of movement in those currency pairs over the last year.
Using the above assumptions, the following table shows the illustrative effect on the consolidated income statement and equity.
