Directors remuneration The aggregate remuneration of the Directors for the year to 31 December 2018 was 261,462 2017: 215,500.
Further information on the Directors remuneration is disclosed in the Directors remuneration report on pages 119 and 120.
Taxation In the opinion of the Directors, the Company has complied with the requirements of Section 1158 and Section 1159 of the CTA 2010 and will therefore be exempt from corporation tax on any capital gains reported in the capital return during the year.
To the extent possible, the Company will elect to designate all of the proposed dividend see note 11 as an interest distribution to its shareholders.
This distribution is treated as a tax deduction against taxable income in the revenue return and results in a reduction of corporation tax being payable by the Company at 31 December 2018.

Taxation continued The rate of corporation tax in the UK for a company was 19% during the year 2017: effective tax rate of 19.25%.
However, the tax charge in the current and prior year was lower than the standard and effective tax rate, largely due to the reduction in corporation tax from the interest distribution noted above.
The effect of this and other items affecting the tax charge is shown in note 9 b below.
