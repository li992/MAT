No changes to previously published accounting policies or other adjustments were required on the adoption of these amendments.
A number of new standards and amendments have been published that are mandatory for future accounting periods: IFRS 16, Leases The Group will adopt IFRS 16, Leases, with effect from 1 January 2019.
It will result in almost all leases being recognised on the Balance Sheet by lessees, as the distinction between operating and finance leases is removed.
Under the newstandard, an asset the right to use the leased item and a financial liability to pay rentals are recognised.
The only exceptions are short term andlow value leases.
The Group intends to take the fully retrospective approach and restate its Balance Sheet and Income Statement as if the new standard had always been applied.
A detailed review of all lease arrangements has been undertaken.
The Group expects to recognise right-of-use assets of approximately 100m on 1 January 2019 and lease liabilities of approximately 140m.
The Group expects that profit before tax and EPS for 2018 will not change significantly as a result of adopting the new rules.
Underlying operating profit used to measure segment results is expected to increase by approximately 7m.
Previously the operating lease payments were included in underlying operating profit.
Going forward only the amortisation of the right-of-use assets will be included whereas interest on the lease liability is excluded from this measure.
Total cash flows are not impacted.
104 Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial Statements Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 2.
Impact of new accounting standards As previously identified, the Group adopted IFRS 9, Financial Instruments and IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, on 1 January 2018.
IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised over time for contracts where there is no alternate use for the product and there is a right to payment at all times throughout the contract.
A number of long term development programmes, notably within the Mission Systems Sector, meet these criteria.
Revenue is also recognised over time for contracts where control transfers as the product is being manufactured.
This occurs on some contracts directly with government bodies, most notably in the Advanced Electronic Solutions Sector.
On both types of contract, where revenue is now recognised over time, the amounts previously included within inventories as work in progress or finished goods are now recognised, including margin, as a contract asset described as unbilled receivables.
Under IAS 18 it was appropriate, in certain situations, to combine related contracts.
Under IFRS 15 the circumstances where this is allowed are more clearly defined and therefore some customer delivery obligations have been treated as separate obligations which impacts the timing of revenue and profit recognition.
On transition to IFRS 15, in addition to the matters described above, the balance sheet presentation has changed in a number of areas.
Where there has been no change to the revenue recognition basis arising from IFRS 15, any remaining accrued income balances that were previously included within trade and other receivables are now shown as a contract asset described as unbilled receivables.
Deferred income where the customer has paid upfront but revenue has not yet been recognised was previously included in trade and other payables and is now recognised separately as a contract liability described as advance payments from customers.
Costs to fulfil a contract were previously included within inventories as work in progress.
IFRS 15 has been applied retrospectively and therefore comparative information presented in these financial statements has been restated as disclosed in the tables below.
A summary of the impact of adopting IFRS 15, as described above, is as follows: m Total equity At 31 December 2016 as originally stated 489.9 Adjustments to retained earnings on adoption of IFRS 15 0.2 At 1 January 2017 restated 489.7 At 31 December 2017 as originally stated 1,028.3 Contracts where revenue is recognised over time rather than at a point in time 18.4 Contracts where performance obligations are now accounted for separately 11.4 Deferred tax impact 2.9 Adjustments to retained earnings on adoption of IFRS 15 4.1 At 31 December 2017 restated 1,032.4 The full impact on the Balance Sheets as at 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2017 and on the Income Statement for the year ended 31 December 2017 are asbelow: Impact on Balance Sheet at 1 January 2017 As originally IFRS 15 m stated adjustments Restated Assets Inventories 405.3 121.3 284.0 Contract assets 173.0 173.0 Trade and other receivables 475.8 75.5 400.3 Other assets 1,913.5 1,913.5 2,794.6 23.8 2,770.8 Liabilities Contract liabilities 104.3 104.3 Trade and other payables 471.8 108.2 363.6 Provisions 237.9 25.7 212.2 Deferred tax 27.6 6.0 33.6 Other liabilities 1,567.4 1,567.4 2,304.7 23.6 2,281.1 Net assets 489.9 0.2 489.7 105 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued Impact on Balance Sheet at 31 December 2017 As originally IFRS 15 m stated adjustments Restated Assets Inventories 389.4 135.2 254.2 Contract assets 190.2 190.2 Trade and other receivables 393.5 71.2 322.3 Other assets 2,010.5 1.3 2,011.8 2,793.4 14.9 2,778.5 Liabilities Contract liabilities 105.2 105.2 Trade and other payables 484.3 124.9 359.4 Provisions 155.8 3.5 152.3 Deferred tax 2.1 4.2 6.3 Other liabilities 1,122.9 1,122.9 1,765.1 19.0 1,746.1 Net assets 1,028.3 4.1 1,032.4 Impact on Income Statement for the year ended 31 December 2017 As originally IFRS 15 m stated adjustments Restated Revenue 2,052.5 39.1 2,091.6 Cost of sales 1,457.9 36.9 1,494.8 Gross profit 594.6 2.2 596.8 Operating costs 491.6 0.6 491.0 Profit on divestments 1.1 1.1 Operating profit 104.1 2.8 106.9 Finance income 6.1 6.1 Finance costs 43.3 43.3 Profit before taxation 66.9 2.8 69.7 Taxation 11.9 2.5 14.4 Profit after taxation for the year 78.8 5.3 84.1 Attributable to: Owners of the parent 78.6 5.3 83.9 Non-controlling interests 0.2 0.2 78.8 5.3 84.1 Earnings per ordinary share Basic 3.5p 3.7p Diluted 3.5p 3.7p IFRS 9, Financial Instruments Following the adoption of IFRS 9, the accounting policies for financial instruments applied during the year ended 31 December 2017 are, on a practical level, largely unchanged.
Retained earnings and other financial assets at 1 January 2018 have been restated by 39.0m as a result of the transition to this new standard.
There was, however no impact on the consolidated income statement, other balance sheet line items or the consolidated cash flows of the Group, nor on EPS.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, comparative figures have not been restated.
The restatement relates to Cobham plcs minority shareholdings in equity investments which were accounted for as trade investments and categorised as available for sale under IAS 39.
Under IFRS 9, these investments are held at fair value, using a present value methodology.
The Company has elected to present movements in fair value in OCI.

Underlying measures, EPS and specific adjusting items Use of underlying measures To assist with the understanding of earnings trends, the Group has included within its published financial statements non-GAAP alternative performance measures including underlying operating profit and underlying profit.
The non-GAAP measures used are not defined terms under IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies.
They are not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP measures.
Management use underlying measures to assess the operating performance of the Group, having adjusted for specific items as defined below.
They form the basis of internal management accounts and are used for decision making including capital allocation, and a subset also forms the basis of internal incentive arrangements.
By using underlying measures in our segmental reporting, this further ensures readers of the financial statements can recognise how incentive performance is targeted.
Underlying measures are also presented in this report because the Directors believe they provide additional useful information to shareholders on comparative trends over time.
Finally, this presentation allows for separate disclosure and specific narrative to be included concerning the adjusting items: this helps to ensure performance in any one year can be more clearly understood by users of the financial statements.
In 2016, certain exceptional items were adjusted for and excluded from underlying measures due to their unusual size and incidence.
These arose from theJanuary 2017 Balance Sheet review and included revisions to the carrying value of assets, additional contract loss provisions, and legal and other provisions.
Where relevant, updates to, and the final outcome of, these items are presented consistently with this treatment as exceptional charges or creditsas appropriate.
Definitions of underlying measures All underlying measures include the operational results of all businesses including those held for sale until the point of sale.
These definitions are applied consistently on a year to year basis.
Underlying operating profit Underlying operating profit has been defined as operating profit from continuing operations excluding the impacts of business acquisition and divestment related activity and prior periods business restructuring costs as detailed below.
Also excluded are changes in the marking to market of non-hedge accounted derivative financial instruments, gains and losses arising on dividend related foreign exchange contracts and other items deemed by the Directors to be of a non-operating nature including the impairment of intangible assets.
Changes in items previously treated as exceptional in 2016 will also be adjusted.
Underlying profit Underlying profit before taxation is defined as underlying operating profit less net underlying finance costs, which exclude business acquisition and divestment related items and specific finance costs.

108 Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial Statements Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Details of specific adjusting items The specific adjusting items excluded from underlying profit can be analysed as follows: m Note 2018 2017 Cost of sales Estimates of fixed price contract profitability 200.0 Operating costs Derivative financial instruments 22 19.7 28.9 Net pension adjustments 3.4 Business acquisition and divestment related items Amortisation of intangible assets arising on business combinations 10 89.8 138.9 Other M&A related costs 0.3 Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 10 33.5 Reversal of impairment of intangible assets 10 31.8 Other items provided as exceptional items at 31 December 2016 Adjustments to revisions of the carrying values of other assets 1.4 Assessment of legal and other provisions 1.7 8.0 Amounts related to prior periods restructuring programmes 4.7 111.2 107.3 Profit on divestments Profit on divestments 28 227.0 1.1 Taxation Tax credit on specific adjusting items 7 38.3 51.7 Explanation of specific adjusting items Estimates of fixed price contract profitability A charge of 200.0m has been taken against increased estimates of cost to complete and recovery on the KC-46 contract comprising 40.0m recorded in the half year and a further 160.0m recorded following the announcement on 19 February 2019.
This reflects an adjustment to an item previously disclosed as exceptional and hence it has been presented as a specific adjusting item.
The Board recognises that making estimates on complex contracts is inherently judgemental and therefore whilst it has made a best estimate of contract positions at present, the final outcome of the contracts could be more or less favourable than the position taken.
Derivative financial instruments The impact of derivative financial instruments excluded from underlying results includes changes in the marking to market of non-hedge accounted derivative financial instruments other than fair value gains or losses arising on currency swaps which offset movements in currency balances held.
These amounts relate to foreign currency exchange contracts and would not impact operating results had the Group chosen to comply with IFRS 9 requirements to enable these contracts to be hedge accounted.
These impacts are excluded as market volatility can result in material changes in fair value, both positive and negative, which distort the underlying results.
Pension adjustments In October 2018, the English High Court determined that UK defined benefit pension schemes with Guaranteed Minimum Pensions GMP must be equalised between men and women.
The impact of this ruling on the UK schemes has been estimated at 5.5m and recognised as a past service cost.
This has been calculated using the C2 method as the Companys current best estimate: the actual method of satisfying the obligations to the members of the pension plans will ultimately need to be agreed by the Company and the trustees of the pension plans.
This additional cost has been excluded from underlying measures to reflect the highly unusual nature of this cost which relates to service cost generated many years ago.
Offset against the GMP charge is a gain on curtailment of 2.1m arising from the closure of the US defined benefit pension scheme to future accrual.
While this gain arose due to management decisions in the year, such an event is also considered to be unusual and warrants separate disclosure.
109 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued Business acquisition and divestment related items The Group has been acquisitive over time and also divests businesses in accordance with its strategy.
Accounting adjustments that arise as a result of business combinations and divestments are not considered to result from the underlying business activity and have therefore been excluded from underlying measures.
These adjustments include the amortisation of intangible assets arising on business combinations, gains or losses arising on business divestments, adjustments to businesses held for sale, the writing off of the pre-acquisition profit element of inventory written up on acquisition, revaluation gains and losses arising on the original equity interests on stepped acquisitions, other direct costs associated with business combinations and terminated divestments, and adjustments to contingent consideration related to previously acquired businesses.
Amortisation of intangible assets arises as a result of the purchase price allocation on business combinations and includes customer lists, technology based assets, and order book and trade names.
It is excluded from underlying measures because it does not relate to the in year operational performance of the business, being driven by the timing and amount of investment in business combinations.
Likewise impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets arising on business combinations, together with any reversal of impairment ofintangible assets, are treated as specific adjusting items as these assets arose from business acquisitions in prior periods.
The amortisation of internally generated intangible assets such as software and development costs is included within underlying measures.
Other M&A related costs reflect the finalisation of costs related to acquisitions and divestments in prior years.
Other items The assessment of legal and other provisions of 1.7m 2017: 8.0m relates to provisions made at 31 December 2016 which have been reassessed and, in some instances, settled.
These provision releases are treated as adjusting items consistent with the treatment of the original provisions.
The 2017 adjustments to revisions of the carrying value of other assets provided at 31 December 2016 related to a provision against aged receivables which was considered doubtful at 31 December 2016 but which was subsequently recovered with only a small loss.
The release of this provision was treated as an adjusting item consistent with the treatment of the original provision.
Amounts related to prior periods restructuring programmes Amounts related to prior periods restructuring programmes were deemed as incremental to normal operations.
These costs relate to the integration of the Aeroflex businesses acquired in 2014.

Revenue and segmental information Revenue Revenue comprises income from the sale of goods and services during the year and can be analysed as follows: Communications Advanced and Mission Electronic Aviation Total m Connectivity Systems Solutions Services 2018 External revenue by market US defence security 43.1 195.0 471.6 709.7 UK, RoW defence security 109.6 162.4 31.7 171.3 475.0 Commercial 398.4 45.3 91.3 143.6 678.6 551.1 402.7 594.6 314.9 1,863.3 External revenue by customer geography USA 155.6 288.9 546.2 990.7 UK 35.2 21.5 7.7 78.5 142.9 Other EU 219.7 59.2 13.3 5.6 297.8 Australia 5.8 5.0 0.4 206.1 217.3 Asia 91.0 19.2 15.6 17.9 143.7 Rest of the world 43.8 8.9 11.4 6.8 70.9 551.1 402.7 594.6 314.9 1,863.3 External revenue by revenue recognition category Goods transferred at a point in time 485.3 346.7 339.5 1,171.5 Goods transferred over time 14.1 11.3 227.6 230.4 Services transferred over time 31.2 35.9 19.4 308.8 395.3 Services transferred at a point in time 20.5 31.4 8.1 6.1 66.1 551.1 402.7 594.6 314.9 1,863.3 As announced on 19 February 2019, agreement has been reached with Boeing to settle damages assertions, and estimates of cost to complete have been increased, on the KC-46 contract.
A further non-underlying charge of 160.0m has been taken, within the Mission Systems segment, in addition to the 40.0m recorded in the first half of the year as announced on 26 July 2018.
This agreement has reduced both the total value of the contract and the percentage of completion, resulting in a derecognition of 79.8m of revenue.
This has been accounted for in the current year as the underlying events occurred during 2018.
Whilst some of the revenue related to prior periods, our programme accounting takes into account the facts and circumstances reasonably known at the time.
Revenue by customer geography is revenue from external customers analysed by their geographic location, irrespective of the origin of the goods and services.
Revenue from customers in individual countries within the EU except the UK and the rest of the world is not considered to be individually material.

Adjustments to tax charge in respect of prior years arise from differences in the filed tax returns compared to the estimates made in December 2017.
Impact of other items primarily relates to interest taxed at a reduced rate in addition to amounts related to the KC-46 programme.
The adoption of IFRS 15 means that the restated Balance Sheet at 31 December 2017 includes the cumulative impact of earlier profit recognition on some US based contracts.
The associated deferred tax liabilities were reduced when the US tax rate change of 35% to 21% was substantially enacted in 2017.
This led to a one-time credit in 2017, which is disclosed here as part of the IFRS 15 restatement impact.
The 2017 effective tax rate charge is restated to reflect this, but that in year reduction will not be repeated in future periods.
Prior to this restatement, the 2017 underlying effective tax rate was 23%.
The UK corporation tax rate reduced from 20% to 19% on 1 April 2017.
It will reduce further to 17% from 1 April 2020.
UK deferred taxes have been calculated at 19%, or 17% where the impact is expected to crystallise after 1 April 2020.
The US corporation tax rate reduced from 35% to 21% on 1 January 2018.

Changes in tax rates, tax reliefs and tax laws, changes in practice or interpretation of the law by the relevant tax authorities, increasing challenges by relevant tax authorities on transfer pricing and other matters, or any failure to manage tax risks adequately could result in increased charges, financial loss, penalties and reputational damage, which may materially adversely affect the Groups financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, tax enforcement has become a higher priority for many tax authorities in jurisdictions in which the Group operates, which has led to an increase intax audits, enquiries and challenges, or the testing through litigation of the boundaries of the correct interpretation of legislation.
Tax authorities may also actively pursue additional taxes based on retroactive changes to tax laws and the Group may have disagreements with tax authorities which could result in amaterial restatement to the tax position.
For example, the availability of certain interest deductions on one of the Groups internal financing arrangements, principally as a result of various US acquisitions, has been under challenge for some time.
Over the life of this internal financing arrangement, the aggregate taxvalue of the interest deductions amounted to approximately 130m.
If decided adversely to the Group, this could lead to increased tax liabilities in excess of those provided in the Groups Balance Sheet, and result in a substantial tax payment becoming due.
That payment may also result in an additional interest charge from the relevant authority.
The Group is actively involved in attempting to resolve this matter ahead of a Tribunal hearing, which is scheduled for autumn 2019.
The European Commission EC has opened an investigation into the UKs controlled foreign company CFC rules.
The CFC rules levy a charge on foreign entities controlled by the UK that are subject to a lower rate of tax: however there is currently an exemption available for 75% of this charge if the activities being undertaken by the CFC relate to financing.
The EC is investigating whether this exemption is in breach of EU State Aid rules, but it is too early to assess what the conclusions of this investigation might be.
If there is an adverse final determination on the UKs CFC legislation, the Group estimates that its maximum exposure on this matter is approximately 60m.
The Group has accrued 146.8m 2017: 126.4m in respect of uncertain tax positions in the UK, US and other tax jurisdictions, together with 18.4m 2017: 10.6m related to interest on uncertain tax positions as shown in note 20.
Final resolutions will affect the amounts settled and the timing of any settlements.
Whilst resolution remains uncertain, these amounts are included in current liabilities.

Tax losses key estimation uncertainty Tax losses of 51.5m 2017: 29.6m arising in the UK and 10.5m 2017: 5.8m arising in Denmark have been recognised on the basis of UK and Danish forecasted future taxable profits, using projections prepared by management and reviewed by the Board.
The recognition of these tax losses can be sensitive to movement in these forecasted profits.
As an indication of sensitivity, a 33% reduction in the estimated profits would not impact the recognition of these tax losses.
Capital losses in the US of 10.9m were used on completion of the divestment of the AvComm business.
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused capital losses of 61.1m 2017: 85.9m potentially available for offset against future capital profits in certain circumstances.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of this amount because of the unpredictability of future qualifying profit streams.
These losses can be carried forward indefinitely.
Unremitted earnings The unprovided tax on unremitted earnings as at 31 December 2018 is considered to be immaterial.
Dividends No dividends have been paid or approved by Cobham plc during the current or prior year.
Further details of Cobham plcs dividend policy can be found in note24.
A dividend of 0.1m was paid to the holders of non-controlling interests in TEAM SA, a subsidiary of Cobham plc, during the year ended 31 December 2017.

These alternative performance measures are used in internal management accounts and for decision making including capital allocation.
In addition to underlying profit measures, underlying cash conversion is also used for internal incentive arrangements, and presenting this information allows users of the financial statements to better understand the way in which performance is targeted.
Definitions of operating cash flow measures Free cash flow Free cash flow is defined as net cash from operating activities plus dividends received from joint ventures, less cash flow related to the purchase or disposal ofproperty, plant, equipment and intangible assets but excluding payments relating to business acquisition and divestment related activities.
Operating cash flow Operating cash flow is free cash flow before payment of tax, interest and restructuring costs.

120 Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial Statements Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Goodwill Goodwill represents the premium paid on acquisitions in anticipation of future economic benefits from assets that are not capable of being separately identified and separately recognised, such as the value of the workforce, and is the only indefinite life intangible asset held by the Group.
Goodwill must be allocated to CGUs for the purposes of reporting and accounting.
CGUs are defined at the Sector level.
The carrying value of goodwill is allocated to the following Sectors: m 2018 2017 Communications and Connectivity 279.1 278.8 Mission Systems 91.5 89.8 Advanced Electronic Solutions 237.3 225.1 Aviation Services 45.3 43.3 Total 653.2 637.0 Annual impairment review key estimation uncertainty A review of the carrying value of goodwill is completed at least once a year to ensure that it is not impaired.
This requires estimation of the recoverable amounts of the CGUs to which the goodwill is allocated.
This is determined from value in use calculations unless specific conditions at a CGU dictate otherwise.
Impairment tests on other intangible assets are undertaken if events occur which may indicate that these assets may be impaired.
The carrying value of intangible assets is considered annually as part of the goodwill impairment exercise with reference to the value in use calculation of each CGU.
Estimating value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the CGUs and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
This is considered to be a source of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, which may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of intangible assets within the next financial year.
Key assumptions The calculation of recoverable value for CGUs based on value in use includes the following key assumptions: Cash flow forecasts prepared by management and reviewed by the Board covering a three year period, updated where appropriate for more recent forecasts.
These forecasts take into account the current and expected economic environment including factors such as continued uncertainty e. g. Brexit, within some markets in which we operate.
They also make assumptions about the demand for our products in our primary geographical markets, based on historic experience, available government spending and key current and future programme platforms.
These cash flow projections do not include benefits or costs expected to arise from future restructuring or initiatives to enhance performance which have not yet commenced: Growth rates assumed after this period are based on long term GDP projections of the primary market for each business.
The long term projections used are in the range 1.6% to 2.5% 2017: 1.5% to 2.5% : Cash flows are discounted using the Groups WACC, adjusted for country, cash flow and currency risks in the principal territories in which the CGU operates.
These pre-tax discount rates are within the range 8.6% to 10.7% 2017: 8.6% to 10.5% : Cash flows include the impact of working capital and fixed asset requirements: and Cash flows include management charges which allocate central overheads to the CGUs.
There were no impairments in 2018.
In 2017, 31.8m of a previous impairment of intangible assets held in the Communications and Connectivity sector was reversed with reference to the expected sale proceeds less costs to sell for the AvComm and Wireless test and measurement businesses.
An impairment of 33.5m was made in 2017 in Aviation Services driven principally from the loss of the UK Defence Helicopter Flying School contract which expired during 2018.

All inventory is expected to be realised within the normal operating cycle of the businesses.
Obsolescence provision key estimation uncertainty The nature of much of the Groups business means that inventory held can become technically obsolete.
It is also necessary to hold additional spare parts in order to support key customers and programmes.
Assessing the level of provision required for obsolete, slow moving and defective items of inventory is an area of estimation uncertainty which may have a significant effect on the carrying amount of inventory within the next financial year.
This allowance is reviewed by management on a regular basis and further amounts are provided or released as considered necessary.
The amounts are generally determined based on factors which include ageing and known demand, reflecting assumptions concerning future orders and revenue streams.
Subsequent events may give rise to these estimates being revised and, consequently, to the reversal of amounts previously provided.
During the year 14.2m 2017: 21.2m was provided, 8.7m 2017: 4.5m was utilised and 6.0m 2017: 6.2m of the allowance for obsolescence was reversed.
The amount provided in the year represents the outcome of the key sensitivity, being changes in forecast customer demand against which production has been planned or undertaken.
A 10% deterioration in the assumed immediate forecast demand would lead to an increased provision in the order of 5m 2017:4m.

Borrowings are held at amortised cost which equates to fair value except for the Groups fixed rate borrowings.
At 31 December 2018, the fair value of those borrowings was 233.6m 2017: 743.7m compared to their book value of 221.2m 2017: 686.0m.
The fair value of the fixed rate borrowings and derivative financial instruments have been determined by reference to observable market prices and rates.
Gains and losses on derivative financial assets and liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss are shown in note 22.
125 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued Offsetting financial assets and liabilities Cash and cash equivalents as shown in the Balance Sheet include overdraft balances on currency cash pooling accounts which have been offset as the accounts will be settled on a net basis as described in note 24.
Master netting agreements also cover all bank balances and derivative balances with the same counterparty.
These do not meet the criteria for offsetting because the right to offset is only enforceable on the occurrence of future events such as a default and amounts presented in the Balance Sheet are therefore presented on a gross basis.
If full offsetting by counterparty were to be applied, the resulting net amounts would be as follows: Amounts as Gross Amounts set presented Amounts not amounts off in the inthe set off in the m before set off Balance Sheet BalanceSheet Balance Sheet Net amount Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents 832.2 425.3 406.9 17.4 389.5 Derivative financial assets 24.6 24.6 24.6 Financial liabilities Bank overdrafts 435.5 425.3 10.2 10.2 Derivative financial liabilities 44.2 44.2 31.8 12.4 At 31 December 2018 377.1 377.1 377.1 Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents 943.7 491.8 451.9 3.1 448.8 Derivative financial assets 35.4 35.4 30.6 4.8 Financial liabilities Bank overdrafts 491.8 491.8 Derivative financial liabilities 39.4 39.4 33.3 6.1 At 31 December 2017 447.9 447.9 0.4 447.5 15.

Unbilled amounts arise when revenue is recognised prior to an invoice being raised to the customer: typically this arises when revenue is recognised over time as payments often have milestone payments conditional on customer acceptances on progress.
During the year 114.3m 2017: 82.5m of the opening contract asset was transferred to trade receivables: additional amounts of 103.8m were recognised as a contract asset during the year 2017: 111.3m as a result of changes in the measure of progress of the satisfaction of performance obligations.
Costs to fulfill a contract relate to costs incurred in advance of the commencement of delivering performance obligations to the customer, principally in respect of certain air-to-air refuelling contracts and additional provisioning on service delivery contracts.

Where there has been a significant increase in the risk that amounts past due will not be paid, full provision for additional credit losses is made.
The Group has limited exposure to credit risk and has not experienced significant levels of credit losses during the current or previous years.
At 31 December 2018, provisions for expected credit losses were required for only 3% 2017: 3% of gross trade receivables.
Information concerning management of credit risk is shown in note 24.
A significant proportion of the Groups business is directly with government agencies or in respect of large government funded military programmes, where credit risk is considered to remain low.
Trade receivables at 31 December 2018 do not include any amounts in respect of the KC-46 contract, which, as a result of the agreement reached with Boeing announced on 19 February 2019, are now being offset against amounts payable to Boeing in 2019.
Other classes of financial assets within trade and other receivables do not include any overdue or impaired assets.

These are minority shareholdings which are not held for trading and as such as are held at fair value.
The Group has elected to present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI.
The fair value of these assets has been assessed using a present value methodology.
The inputs to this calculation are not based on observable market data and hence they fall within level 3 of the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy.
Valuation of other financial assets key estimation uncertainty Fair value is determined based on the estimated cash flows expected to be received, discounted to present value.
The estimated cash flows are calculated using an income approach reflecting the cash flows available to the Company after repayment of debt capital and interest, taking into account operating and financing cash flows.
The most significant assumptions concern the anticipated usage of aircraft, including the number and types of sorties flown.
The fair value would decrease with lower than anticipated usage of the aircraft or a higher discount rate.
A 10% decrease in flying hours would result in a 7% reduction in fair value and a 1% increase in discount rate would reduce the fair value by 6%.
Other assumptions include interest and inflation rates, repayment of debt and the residual value of the aircraft.
Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale There were no non-current assets or disposal groups held for sale at 31 December 2018.
At 31 December 2017, the following assets and liabilities of the AvComm and Wireless test and measurement businesses were classified as held for sale.

Contract loss provisions key estimation uncertainty Contract loss provisions are recognised for onerous contracts when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group are lower than the forecasted unavoidable cost of meeting the related contractual obligations.
The assessment of the amount provided is a source of estimation uncertainty which may have a significant effect on the carrying amount of these provisions within the next financial year.
The estimated costs to complete including contingencies tocover the risks identified, the outcome of negotiations with customers, the amounts recoverable under these contracts and the risk of incurring penalties for not meeting challenging delivery schedules are all areas requiring management judgement and the Group may take account of the advice of experts in quantifying the expected costs of future adverse outcomes.
Due to the inherent uncertainty associated with such matters, the timing and determination ofthe total costs or amount of any payments under any claims could differ from the amounts provided.
These provisions are expected to be utilised within four years although, where there are uncertainties surrounding the timing of utilisation, they have been disclosed as current liabilities.
There are multiple sensitivities to be considered in assessing contract loss provisions, in particular the ability to achieve development milestone dates, the accuracy of cost estimates to complete contractual work and the ability to successfully invoice and collect cash from the end customer.
It is not considered practical to provide sensitivities for each of these items, and potentially misleading to suggest each one can be considered separately, so this risk is disclosed aspart of our contingent liabilities in note 30.
Other categories of provisions Provisions related to businesses divested relate to longer term warranties given on the divestments completed in 2005 and during the year.
Due to uncertainties surrounding the timing of settlement of these items, they have been disclosed as current liabilities.
Restructuring provisions relate to restructuring projects announced in the year together with onerous lease provisions arising from the restructuring of the Aeroflex businesses, which is now complete.
Amounts carried forward are not expected to be fully settled until 2025.
Provisions for warranty claims are expected to be utilised within three years.
Aircraft maintenance provisions relate to significant periodic maintenance costs as well as return conditions for leased aircraft and are anticipated to crystallise within five years.
Other provisions include amounts provided in respect of legal claims and environmental obligations and are mostly expected to be settled within one year.

These fair value movements are excluded from underlying measures as described in note 3, except for gains of 4.9m 2017: 11.7m gain arising from the movement in fair values of currency swaps which offset movements in currency balances held.
In 2017, gains and losses arising on foreign exchange derivatives related to dividend flows within the Group were also excluded from the underlying results.
A small number of specific foreign exchange derivatives as detailed below are designated as cash flow hedging instruments or as hedging instruments for net investment hedging purposes, and hedge accounting is applied.
The foreign currency forward contracts were fide-designated as hedging instruments during the year.
Ineffectiveness in the cash flow hedge and net investment hedge occurs when the critical terms do not match exactly with the critical terms of the hedging instrument, this is calculated using the hypothetical derivative method.
133 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued The foreign exchange derivatives which are designated as hedging instruments are included in the Balance Sheet as follows: Foreign Crosscurrency currency Crossforward swaps net currency contracts investment swaps cash cash flow m hedge flow hedge hedge Total Non-current assets 22.8 22.8 Non-current liabilities 23.4 23.4 Fair value at 31 December 2018 23.4 22.8 0.6 Non-current assets 22.1 22.1 Current assets 0.1 0.1 Non-current liabilities 22.0 22.0 Fair value at 31 December 2017 22.0 22.1 0.1 0.2 Notional amount currency DKK977.7m EUR131.0m Notional amount sterling 95.0m 94.9m There have been no changes in the cross-currency swap contracts designated as hedging instruments during the year.
The Group uses net investment hedging to manage its exposure to DKK GBP foreign exchange risk arising on its Danish kroner functional currency foreign operations.
The hedging instrument comprises cross-currency swaps pay DKK, receive GBP with the hedged item being the total Danish kroner net assets ofthe Groups operations in Denmark.
There is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedge instrument as the net investment hedge creates a translation risk that will match the foreign exchange risk on the currency borrowing.
The Group has established a hedge ratio of 1:1 as the underlying risk of the hedging instrument is broadly the same as the hedged risk component.
The Group also has in place a cash flow hedge to manage the foreign exchange risk arising out of its foreign currency borrowings.
The hedging instrument comprises a cross-currency swap pay GBP, receive EUR.
The hedge item is the 131m floating rate borrowing and the hedge ratio is 1:1.

Retirement benefit schemes m 2018 2017 Defined benefit scheme assets 746.4 816.3 Defined benefit obligations 793.0 879.5 46.6 63.2 Pension expense included in employment costs in note 5 are as follows: m 2018 2017 Defined benefit schemes 4.1 0.7 Defined contribution schemes 31.7 37.4 35.8 38.1 Within the expense amounts above, 0.5m 2017: 1.4m was outstanding in respect of defined benefit schemes but not due for payment at 31 December 2018.
In addition, 0.5m 2017: 1.1m was outstanding in respect of defined contribution schemes but not due for payment at 31 December 2018.
Defined contribution schemes The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension arrangements.
Under a defined contribution pension arrangement the Groups contribution is fixed at a set percentage of employees pay.
The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense as the employee provides service to the Group.
There is no legal or constructive obligation to pay any additional amounts into the funds.
Defined benefit schemes The Group also operates a number of funded defined benefit schemes where benefits are based on employees length of service and average final salary, themost significant being the Cobham Pension Plan CPP.
The assets of all of these schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
However, the Group is ultimately responsible for funding any shortfall in the obligations of the schemes to their members.
All defined benefit schemes have been closed to new members since 2003 and the UK schemes were closed to future accrual from 1 April 2016.
134 Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial Statements Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Events during the year During the year, there have been three major events affecting the Groups defined benefit schemes: The CPP completed its triennial valuation.
As a result, deficit contributions reduced from 17.2m to 6.0m per annum, with effect from September 2018 and payable up to March 2024: The US scheme was closed to future accrual resulting in a gain on curtailment of 2.1m.
This gain has been presented as a specific adjusting item within note3: and In October 2018, the English High Court determined that UK defined benefit pension schemes with Guaranteed Minimum Pensions GMP must be equalised between men and women.
This cost has been presented as a specific adjusting item within note 3.
Risk management The defined benefit schemes expose the Group to a number of risks, as described below: Volatility of investment returns.
If the investment return is lower then future funding obligations from the Company will increase: Inflation risk.
Deferred pensions and pensions in payment are subject to inflationary increases.
A higher inflation rate will lead to higher defined benefit obligations: Changes in bond yields.
Volatility in the financial markets can have a significant impact on corporate bond yields which are used to generate a discount rate assumption.
Lower corporate bond yields will lead to higher defined benefit obligations: and Life expectancy risk.
The schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member and therefore increases in life expectancy will lead to higher defined benefit obligations.
The trustees seek to mitigate these risks and have entered into a number of buy-in arrangements where assets are transferred to an insurance company in return for a qualifying insurance policy which provides an income stream equivalent to the obligations to pensioners covered by the arrangement.
The most significant buy-in arrangement relates to pensioners of the CPP as at 1 July 2013.
This eliminates all of the above risks in relation to these liabilities except for the credit risk related to the insurance provider.
In addition, the trustees have invested in liability driven investments that mitigate most of the remaining bond yield and inflation risks, on a technical provision basis.
This is achieved by using a portfolio of gilts and swaps supported with investment grade credit instruments.
These investments introduce the risk that a call for further investment may be made if inflation decreases or the bond yield increases, which is managed by maintaining sufficient liquid investments.
Leverage and counterparty risks are managed by the fund investment managers.
The remaining assets include significant investment in diversified growth funds which seek to manage investment risks.
Actuarial valuations Actuarial valuations of the present value of the defined benefit obligations for the CPP are carried out on a triennial basis by qualified independent actuaries: the most recent valuation was as at 1 April 2018 recording a deficit of 37.8m.
Actuarial valuations of other schemes have been carried out at regular intervals as required by the applicable country regulations.
In the UK, within 15 months of each triennial valuation, the employer and the trustees are required to agree a schedule of contributions to ensure that the plan is fully funded over time on a suitably prudent basis.
A new schedule of contributions has been agreed during the year for the CPP as explained in the events section above.
The valuation of plan liabilities for triennial valuations are on a more prudent basis than that required by IAS 19 and therefore the schedule of contributions will address a higher deficit than that recorded on an IAS 19 basis.
The Group expects to contribute 7.5m to its defined benefit pension schemes in 2019 and, under the current schedules of contributions, 7.5m each year until March 2024.
The actuarial valuations for all schemes were updated for accounting purposes to 31 December 2018 by qualified independent actuaries.
135 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued Assumptions source of estimation uncertainty A number of assumptions are made in assessing the costs and present value of the pension assets and liabilities, which include the discount rate, inflation andmortality rates.
These are considered to be major sources of estimation uncertainty as comparatively small changes in the assumptions used may have asignificant effect on the Groups financial statements within the next financial year.
The Group uses published indices and independent actuarial advice to select the values of critical assumptions.
The principal financial assumptions used for the purpose of the actuarial valuations were as follows: 2018 2017 UK USA UK USA schemes scheme schemes scheme RPI inflation assumption rate of increase in pensions in payment unless overridden by specific scheme rules 3.45% 3.00% 3.35% 3.35% CPI inflation assumption rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.45% 2.00% 2.35% 2.35% Discount rate 2.70% 4.11% 2.35% 3.47% The mortality assumptions used for the CPP are based upon actuarial tables which reflect actual recent mortality experience and also allow for future mortality improvements.
The mortality tables used to estimate life expectancy are known as SAPS CMI 17 2017: SAPS CMI 16.
In practical terms, this is demonstrated in the table below: Life Year of birth Year age 65 expectancy Male 1953 2018 87 years Female 1953 2018 89 years Male 1980 2045 90 years Female 1980 2045 91 years At 31 December 2018, it has been assumed that members will commute on average 25% 2017: 25% of their pension for cash at retirement.
Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity of scheme liabilities to changes in certain key assumptions, after adjusting for liabilities covered by insurance contracts, is provided below: Change in assumption Change in liabilities Discount rate Increase by 1.0% -10% Inflation rate both RPI and CPI Increase by 0.5% 3% Life expectancy Increase by one year 2% If the change in assumptions were in the opposite direction to that shown above, the impact would be approximately symmetrical.
136 Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial Statements Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Movements in scheme assets and scheme liabilities A summary of the movements in the net liability and the amounts recognised in the Income Statement and OCI are as follows: 2018 2017 Defined Defined Scheme benefit Scheme benefit m assets obligations Total assets obligations Total Current service cost included in administrative expenses 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.7 Past service cost included in administrative expenses 5.5 5.5 Gain on curtailment included in administrative expenses 2.1 2.1 Scheme administration expenses 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 Amounts recognised in operating profit 0.2 4.1 4.3 0.2 0.7 0.9 Net interest 19.2 20.7 1.5 20.8 23.1 2.3 Amounts credited charged to other finance expense 19.2 20.7 1.5 20.8 23.1 2.3 Actual return less interest income on pension scheme assets 63.5 63.5 31.0 31.0 Experience gains and losses arising on scheme liabilities 17.3 17.3 0.1 0.1 Actuarial gains and losses arising from changes in financial assumptions 41.4 41.4 34.8 34.8 Actuarial gains arising from changes in demographic assumptions 13.7 13.7 11.3 11.3 Amounts recognised in OCI 63.5 72.4 8.9 31.0 23.6 7.4 Employer contributions 14.4 14.4 18.2 18.2 Settlements 4.3 4.3 Benefits paid 36.5 36.5 41.8 41.8 Amounts included in Cash Flow Statement 26.4 40.8 14.4 23.6 41.8 18.2 Exchange differences 1.0 1.9 0.9 1.7 3.1 1.4 Net movement in the year 69.9 86.5 16.6 26.3 2.5 23.8 Balance at start of year 816.3 879.5 63.2 790.0 877.0 87.0 Net liability at end of year 746.4 793.0 46.6 816.3 879.5 63.2 UK schemes 731.2 764.2 33.0 796.3 844.6 48.3 US scheme 15.2 28.8 13.6 20.0 34.9 14.9 Net liability at end of year 746.4 793.0 46.6 816.3 879.5 63.2 The cumulative amount of actuarial losses recognised in OCI since transition to IFRS is 232.2m 2017: 241.4m.
Of the net actuarial gain recognised in the year, the loss from changes in financial assumptions is primarily driven by the movements in the discount rate, while the gain from changes in demographic assumptions arises from the use of the latest mortality tables.
The actual loss on scheme assets was 44.3m 2017: gain 51.8m.
The loss in 2018 reflects the use of liability driven investments which reduced significantly in value as the pension liabilities decrease, and the impact of the reduced value of the insurance contracts which are linked to the value of the underlying liabilities which are insured.
The weighted average duration of the scheme liabilities is estimated to be 17 years.
Settlements relate to the purchase of annuities for certain members of the US pension plan.
137 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued Scheme assets The fair value of major categories of scheme assets, and as a percentage of total scheme assets, is as follows: 2018 2017 m % m % UK equity instruments 11.0 1.5% 14.4 1.8% Global equities 87.3 11.7% 92.3 11.3% Liability driven investments 113.9 15.3% 149.5 18.3% Corporate bonds 76.2 10.2% 87.0 10.7% Private credit 34.2 4.6% 27.8 3.4% Diversified growth funds 119.2 15.9% 127.8 15.6% Insurance contracts 274.9 36.8% 313.7 38.4% Other assets including cash 29.7 4.0% 3.8 0.5% 746.4 100.0% 816.3 100.0% Scheme assets do not include any of the Groups own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets used by the Group.

Financial risk management The Groups multinational operations and debt financing expose it to a variety of financial risks which include the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group by using foreign currency financial instruments, debt and other instruments.
Other derivative financial instruments may be used from time to time to manage exposures such as inflation risk.
The financial risk management policies agreed by the Board have not changed during the year and are summarised below.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments.
Foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk exposure and risk management strategy The Group is based in the UK, reports in sterling and has significant investment in overseas operations in the USA, Australia and other European countries.
As a result, the Groups Balance Sheet, including the net cash debt position, can be affected by movements in these countries exchange rates.
The Groups policy is to reduce, or eliminate where practical, both structural and transactional foreign exchange risk and, consequently, the net foreign exchange gains and losses included in the Income Statement amounted to a loss of 6.6m 2017: 12.1m gain.
The Group undertakes to manage the currency mix of debt and EBITDA so that they are broadly in line to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on the net debt to EBITDA financial covenant.
All currency exposures are reviewed regularly and all significant foreign exchange transactions are approved by Cobham plc management.
The Group has the following exposure to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities in the Balance Sheet, translated into sterling at the relevant year-end exchange rates: 2018 2017 Monetary Monetary Monetary Monetary m assets liabilities assets liabilities US dollars 623.5 298.7 577.6 856.1 Euro 100.4 152.3 101.7 154.8 Australian dollars 52.0 20.0 48.7 3.6 Danish kroner 11.9 10.9 9.3 3.6 Other currencies 26.7 5.1 36.3 5.7 814.5 487.0 773.6 1,023.8 Sterling denominated monetary assets and liabilities 129.9 171.8 190.8 76.9 944.4 658.8 964.4 1,100.7 Foreign currency borrowings are used to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange differences arising from the Groups overseas net assets.
Monetary liabilities in the table above include US dollar borrowings of 253.0m 2017: 717.1m which match exposures arising from currency denominated net assets.
On consolidation, the net assets of overseas subsidiaries which include the monetary assets and liabilities shown in the table above are translated at closing exchange rates and exchange differences arising are accounted for in OCI through the translation reserve note 26.
Foreign currency derivative contracts are also used to manage exposure to currency risks as detailed below.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk in the Income Statement where individual subsidiaries hold non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities, and when an operating unit makes sales and purchases in currencies other than its own functional currency.
The Group undertakes a formal process to actively manage and mitigate this exposure through a combination of matching non-functional currency revenues and costs, matching non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities, and through the use of forward contracts.
Group policy is that at least 80% of the next 12 months forecast cash flows in non-functional currencies are covered by forward foreign exchange contracts.
For shorter cycle businesses, the profile of hedging is based on customer commitments which are subject to approval by the Group CFO.
Where forecasted currency cash flows do not arise this will result in increased income statement exposure to foreign currency exchange differences.
These are however managed at a Group level and mitigating action is taken where possible.
Hedge accounting is not applied for these forward foreign exchange contracts.
139 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued The most important exchange rates for the Group are sterling US dollar and Danish krone US dollar.
The Group has the following forward foreign currency contracts outstanding for net sales of US dollars for sterling and Danish kroner: Average US$: US$m amount exchange rate 2018 2017 2018 2017 Expiring within one year 98.9 119.4 1.37 1.37 Expiring within one to two years 28.4 85.3 1.38 1.36 Expiring after two years 25.1 29.5 1.49 1.50 US$ sterling contracts outstanding at 31 December 152.4 234.2 1.39 1.38 Average US$: DKK US$m amount exchange rate 2018 2017 2018 2017 Expiring within one year 74.7 85.5 5.93 6.34 Expiring within one to two years 0.6 0.5 6.08 6.20 Expiring after two years 0.6 1.2 5.95 6.01 US$ DKK contracts outstanding at 31 December 75.9 87.2 5.93 6.34 The latest expiry date of forward foreign currency contracts for sales of US dollars is June 2023 and it is the Groups current belief that the net dollar receipts by subsidiaries will exceed the level of the outstanding commitments.
Sensitivity analysis Financial instruments denominated in a currency other than the functional currency in which they are measured create exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk.
These financial instruments include the monetary assets and liabilities and the forward foreign currency contracts shown in the tables above.
The sensitivity arising on these financial instruments from a weakening in sterling against the respective foreign currency at the balance sheet date isset out below, with a negative number indicating a reduction in profit after taxation or total equity.

These potential changes are, however, hypothetical and actual rates in future may differ significantly as a result of developments in global financial markets.
This sensitivity analysis has been based on the assumption that all other variables, including interest rates, remain constant.
Use of hedging As detailed in note 22, the Group uses net investment hedging to manage its exposure to DKK GBP foreign exchange risk arising on its DKK functional currency foreign operations.
Exposure to foreign exchange risk arising out of the Groups foreign currency borrowings is also managed using cross-currency swaps designated as hedging instruments in a cash flow hedge.
Further details on the use of foreign exchange derivative financial instruments in hedge relationships can be found in note 22.
Interest rate risk The Group has borrowings with a range of maturities at both fixed and floating rates of interest.
In managing its borrowing costs, the Group monitors its exposure to movements in interest rates, having regard to prevailing market conditions and, where necessary, uses interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk.
At 31 December 2018, the Group does not have any interest rate swaps outstanding.

There was no material sensitivity to changes in interest rates at the year end.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy on managing liquidity risk throughout the year has been to maintain a mix of short, medium and long term borrowings with lenders.
Overdraft and revolving credit facilities provide short term flexibility whilst the revolving credit facilities provide longer term committed funding.
As shown in note 19, at 31 December 2018 undrawn committed borrowing facilities of 427.1m 2017: 404.1m were available to the Group in various currencies.
At an operating level, the Group has a positive cash flow from operating activities and where practical the funds generated by business units are managed on aregional basis.
In the UK and USA, most business units utilise local banking facilities within a UK or US group arrangement.
This allows a balance to be maintained between continuity of funding, security and flexibility.
The table below summarises the remaining contractual maturity for the Groups borrowings and other financial liabilities.
The amounts shown are the contractual undiscounted cash flows which include interest, analysed by contractual maturity.
The difference between the contractual cash flows and the carrying amount of these liabilities reflects the effects of interest not included in the carrying amount and discounting applied in assessing fair value.

141 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances, contract assets, trade and other receivables and derivative financial instruments.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The Group is exposed to credit risk on these balances through its operating activities as the counterparties involved may not meet their obligations under the contract or financial instrument, leading to a financial loss.
The Group has a conservative policy towards the credit risk related to liquid funds and derivative financial instruments with balances currently spread across arange of reputable financial institutions.
The levels of credit risk are monitored through the Groups ongoing risk management processes, which include a regular review of the banks credit ratings.
Risk in this area is limited further by setting a maximum level for term deposits with any one counterparty.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Group having a large customer base.
Customers are typically large global companies or government agencies with long term trading relationships.
The Group also has in place procedures that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales are made and any requests for extended credit are approved by senior management.
Letters of credit are obtained where necessary from reputable banks and financial institutions.
Existing customer accounts are monitored on an ongoing basis and appropriate action is taken where necessary to minimise any credit risk.
No further credit risk provision is required in excess of the provision for impaired receivables shown in note 16.
Group management monitor debtor days and the ageing of receivables which are more than one month overdue on a regular basis.
At 31 December 2018, 23.5% 2017: 23.9% of gross trade receivables were overdue including 6.8% 2017: 8.7% which were overdue by one month or more.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2018 is the fair value of financial assets as disclosed in note 14.
Finance leases totalling 12.8m 2017: 0.3m are secured against the items of property, plant and equipment that the leases are financing, as disclosed in notes 11 and 19.
Group assets have not been pledged in respect of the Groups primary borrowing facilities or other financial liabilities.
Bank term balances totalling 5.8m 2017: 7.0m have been pledged against the residual value of leased assets under an agreement which expires in 2020.
The Group has master netting arrangements in respect of bank balances in the UK.
In the normal course of business, these bank accounts are settled on a net basis within each currency and as such are presented net in the Balance Sheet as shown in note 16.
In the event of an automatic enforcement event, the bank balances are set off against each other to achieve a net position.
Derivatives can also be offset by counterparties in the event of a default: net amounts that result on this basis are also shown in note 14.
Inflation risk The Groups exposure to inflation is considered to be a general business risk which is mitigated through normal commercial activity.
The Group has previously used an inflation swap contract to manage the inherent inflation risk in a specific operational contract which was completed during 2018.
The fair value of this swap contract is included in derivative financial instruments shown in note 22.
Capital risk management Capital is defined as total equity excluding non-controlling interests and amounted to 1,190.2m at 31 December 2018 2017: 1,031.1m restated.
During 2018, Group policy was to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain shareholder confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
Subsequent to the year end, the Board has agreed a capital allocation policy for the Group which will lie at the core of a disciplined approach to investment and value creation.
Priorities for capital allocation are as follows: 1.
Investing in businesses we know and understand is the best way to deliver shareholder value.
We will invest for capability enhancement and growth, including in technology and people and on capital expenditure for equipment and infrastructure, as well as for the resolution oflegacy items: 2.
The Board intends to reinstate an ordinary dividend payment with the 2019 interim results.
It intends to follow a progressive policy which will take into consideration the profitability and underlying growth of Cobhams businesses and its capital requirements, while ensuring an appropriate level ofearnings and free cash flow cover.
It anticipates announcing a first full year dividend of 1.0p.
Approximately 40% of the full year dividend will be paid atthe interim stage: 3.
We will carefully consider bolt-on size business acquisitions and other investments where there is a strong strategic fit and management bandwidth to properly integrate: 4.
If, after such investments and distributions there is surplus capital, the Board would look to return cash to shareholders.
The Board has previously set a net debt EBITDA threshold of 1.5x following the need to strengthen the Balance Sheet through the rights issue in 2017.
This is still considered to be the appropriate target in order to maintain the strength of the Balance Sheet.

Share based payments The Group offers a number of long term incentive schemes which provide a mix of performance based incentive and retention awards as described below and in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 71.
All schemes are equity settled.
The Long Term Incentive Plan is offered to senior executives across the Group and allows for annual grants of Performance Share Plan PSP or Restricted Share Plan RSP awards.
PSP awards are conditional shares and nil-cost options with vesting conditions based on the Groups financial performance, taking into account non-market based measures such as EPS and cash conversion.
In previous years, awards have also included market based conditions such as TSR growth.
The scheme includes retention awards granted from time to time to specific personnel and buy-out awards granted to key new starters, vesting after amaximum of three years conditional only upon continued employment within the Group.
RSP awards provide conditional shares which vest solely on continued employment within the Group over a maximum of four years.
The Group also operates a Save As You Earn SAYE scheme which is open to all UK employees and has previously offered share options under the Cobham Employee Share Option Scheme ESOS which are fully vested with exercise prices in the range 1.359 to 1.826.
The total amount included in the Income Statement arising from share based payment schemes is as follows: m 2018 2017 PSP 3.2 1.4 RSP 2.0 3.4 SAYE 0.6 0.7 5.8 5.5 The number of awards outstanding at 31 December under each scheme are as follows: Number of awards thousands of shares 2018 2017 PSP 18,484 13,597 RSP 2,692 5,052 SAYE 5,388 8,372 ESOS 2,675 3,484 At 31 December 29,239 30,505 PSP Number of awards thousands of shares 2018 2017 At 1 January 13,597 9,998 Awards granted 11,918 8,405 Effect of rights issue 853 Awards forfeited or cancelled 6,274 5,487 Exercised 757 143 Expired 29 At 31 December 18,484 13,597 Weighted average share price at date of exercise 1.220 1.390 Weighted average remaining contractual life of PSP awards outstanding 1.8 years 1.7 years Number of PSP awards exercisable at 31 December thousands 34 26 Awards granted in the year under the PSP scheme were mainly granted in May 2018 with an average fair value of 1.218 2017 awards: 1.319.
There is no exercise price for these awards.
Fair values are calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The weighted average inputs into the model were asfollows: 2018 2017 Weighted average share price 1.218 1.381 Expected life 3.0 years 2.9 years Expected employee cancellation rate 5.0% 3.1% Risk free rate n a 0.3% The expected lives used in the models have been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability and behavioural considerations.
The expected employee cancellation rates are based on assessments of historic rates of voluntary cancellations of contracts by employees.
Dividend yields were nil or were not relevant to the valuation model where participants of the vested awards receive the benefit of dividend equivalent payments.

Contingent liabilities The Group makes provisions when it is probable there will be a cash outflow to settle liabilities and it can be reliably estimated.
Contingent liabilities are potential future cash outflows which are less certain or cannot be measured reliably.
The disclosure below is intended to highlight potential risks that are not provided for in the Balance Sheet.
At 31 December 2018, the Company and the Group had contingent liabilities in respect of bank and contractual performance guarantees and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business.
Where it is expected that a material liability will arise in respect of these matters, appropriate provision is made within the Group Financial Statements.
The Company and various of its subsidiaries are, from time to time, parties to various legal proceedings and claims and management do not anticipate that the outcome of these, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the Groups financial position.
The nature of much of the contracting work done by the Group means that there are reasonably frequent contractual issues, variations and renegotiations that arise in the ordinary course of business, whose resolution is uncertain and could materially impact the Groups future reported earnings.
In particular, on fixed price and fixed fee development contracts, costs incurred and anticipated can significantly exceed amounts estimated as a result of material enhancements to the specifications originally agreed under the contracts.
Also, there are onerous contract terms and challenging delivery schedules on air-to-air refuelling development contracts.
The Group may take account of the advice of experts as required in making judgements on contractual issues and whether the outcome of negotiations will result in an appropriate recovery of costs.
Judgement is therefore required as regards the estimated costs to complete, the outcome of negotiations with customers and the amounts recoverable under these contracts.
The amount recoverable may be subject to direct damages due to the customer and damages or penalties they incur from their own end users.
In the case where the Group is undertaking development activity at its own cost, including production and service readiness, and has given performance undertakings to prospective customers, then a liability for losses consequent upon the failure to meet such undertakings could exist.
The Group is subject to corporate and other tax rules in the jurisdictions where it conducts its business operations.
In addition, tax enforcement has become a higher priority for many tax authorities in jurisdictions in which the Group operates, which has led to an increase in tax audits, enquiries and challenges, or the testing through litigation of the boundaries of the correct interpretation of legislation.
Tax authorities may also actively pursue additional taxes based on retroactive changes to tax laws and the Group may have disagreements with tax authorities which could result in a material restatement to the tax position.
Over the life of this internal financing arrangement, the aggregate tax value of the interest deductions amounted to approximately 130m.
The CFC rules levy a charge on foreign entities controlled by the UK that are subject to a lower rate of tax, however there is currently an exemption available for 75% of this charge if the activities being undertaken by the CFC relate to financing.
Related party transactions During the year, 0.4m 2017: 0.4m of goods were purchased from and nil 2017: nil of goods were sold to joint ventures and associates.
There were no other material transactions between Group entities and related parties during the current or previous year.
Group policy is for all transactions with related parties to be made on an arms length basis and no guarantees have been given to, or received from, related parties.
Details of the compensation of key management personnel can be found in note 5.
The Directors of Cobham plc had no material transactions with the Company during the year, other than as a result of service agreements.
Details of Directors remuneration are disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 71 to 80.
Events after the balance sheet date On 19 February 2019, Cobham announced that it had reached an agreement with Boeing on damages assertions relating to the KC-46 Tanker programme.
Asdetailed on page 7 and in note 3, an additional non-underlying charge of 160.0m has been included in these financial statements as this agreement represents an adjusting event occurring after the balance sheet date.
147 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 33.
