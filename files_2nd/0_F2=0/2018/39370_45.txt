com Production, reserves and operations Exploration for mineral deposits is neither a matter of chance nor pure science, and to find a new mineral in such a large quantity, as we have in the Jadar Valley, is remarkable.
It is a great discovery that suggests there must be more jadarite on this planet.
Nenad Grubin Senior manager, Resource Studies One of the original team who discovered the Jadar deposit Discovering a new mineralinSerbia In 2004, we discovered a new mineral containing both borates and lithium in Serbias Jadar Valley, which we called jadarite.
After more than a decade of research and development, we have started the pre-feasibility study of our potential jadarite mine and processing facility.
The study will help us to understand the scale and quality of the mineral and develop new technology to extract and process it.
Jadar: ranked as Alongside our environmental and social impact assessment, the study one of is allowing us to explore different ways to potentially develop the project from logistics to economics, thelargest and environment to impact on local communities.
