Introduction The EPRA Best Practices Recommendations EPRA BPR were issued by EPRAs Reporting and Accounting Committee in August 2011 and the guidance was subsequently updated in November 2016.
Included within EPRA BPR are six EPRA performance measures deemed to be of key importance to investors in property companies and which aim to encourage more consistent and widespread disclosure.
The EPRA performance measures are set out below: Performance measure Definition 1 EPRA Earnings Recurring earnings from core operational activities.
This is a key measure of a companys underlying operating results providing an indication of the extent to which current dividend payments are supported by earnings.
2 EPRA NAV Net asset value adjusted to include properties and other investment interests at fair value and to exclude certain items not expected to crystallise in a long-term property business model.
This measure is consistent with NAV as defined and disclosed in the Financial review and in Note 5 to the Group financial statements.
3 EPRA NNNAV EPRA NAV adjusted to include the fair values of i financial instruments, ii debt and iii deferred taxes.
This measure is consistent with NNNAV as defined and disclosed in the Financial review and in Note 5 to the Group financial statements.
4i EPRA Net Initial Yield NIY Annualised rental income based on cash rents at the balance sheet date, less non-recoverable property expenses, divided by the market value of the property, increased with estimated purchasers costs.
4ii EPRA topped-up yield This measure incorporates an adjustment to EPRA NIY in respect of the expiration of rent free periods or other unexpired lease incentives such as discounted rent periods and step rents.
5 EPRA Vacancy Rate Estimated Market Rent Value ERV of vacant space divided by ERV of the whole portfolio.
6 EPRA Cost Ratios This measure includes all administrative and operating expenses including share of joint ventures overheads and operating expenses, net of any service fees, all divided by gross rental income.
The Group is supportive of EPRAs initiative and, in this report, is disclosing against six of the EPRA measures: EPRA Earnings, EPRA NAV, EPRA NNNAV, EPRA NIY, EPRA Vacancy Rate and EPRA Cost Ratios.
The Group is predominantly a trading company and a significant portion of its cost base is related to trading activities.
It is therefore not appropriate to eliminate profits on disposal of trading property as recognised on the consolidated income statement.
An adjustment to profits on disposal of trading property has been made with reference to trading property revaluation gains previously recognised in EPRA NAV and EPRA NNNAV.
This adjustment has been made to EPRA Earnings so that earnings are marked-to-market.
This adjustment has also been applied to adjusted EPRA cost ratio to appropriately reflect the Groups cost base.
