Statement of comprehensive income The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in the Companies Act from presenting a Company statement of comprehensive income together with related notes.
Cash flow statement The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 101 from including a cash flow statement in the financial statements on the grounds that a consolidated cash flow statement is presented in the Group financial statements of PHP.
Income Revenue is recognised in the financial statements as follows: Interest income: Revenue is recognised as interest accrues using the effective interest method, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.
Dividends: Dividend income is recognised in the period in which it received Board approval and, hence, when the Companys right to the payment is established.
Investment in subsidiaries Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.
Control comprises the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee so as to obtain benefit from its activities.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost in the Companys Statement of Financial Position less any provision forpermanent impairment in value.
The carrying values of investments are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Taxation Taxation on the profit or loss for the period not exempt under UK REIT regulations comprises current and deferred tax.
Taxation is recognised in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised as direct movements in equity, in which case it is also recognised as a direct movement in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on any non-REIT taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the application of the Companys accounting policies, which are described in Note 1, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
No revisions were recognised in the period.

Transactions in currencies other than Sterling are recognised at the applicable exchange rate ruling on the transaction date.
Exchange differences resulting from settling these transactions, or from retranslating monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, are included in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income.

Contingent liabilities The Company has guaranteed the performance of its subsidiaries in respect of development agreements totalling nil 2017:4.2million plus VAT.
An independent expert has been appointed to adjudicate on whether an adjustment to the conversion price of the convertible bond should have been made in respect of the open offer element of the equity raises in both 2016 and 2018.
If the independent expert determines an adjustment should have been made then approximately 450,000 additional ordinary shares of 12.5p will need to be issued to bond holders who have converted to date and a further 140,000 could potentially be issued over and above current bondholders entitlement, at the holders option to convert.
The results of the independent experts findings are due to be received shortly.
