The Company therefore considers that there are two distinct reporting segments, listed investments and direct property, which are used for evaluating performance and allocation of resources.
The Board, which is the principal decision maker, receives information on the two segments on a regular basis.
Whilst revenue streams and direct property costs can be attributed to the reporting segments, general administrative expenses cannot be split to allow a profit for each segment to be determined.
The assets and gross revenues for each segment are shown above.
The property costs included within note 3 are 1,947,000 2017: 2,078,000 and deducting these costs from the direct property gross revenue above would result in net income of 3,421,000 2017: 3,252,000 for the direct property reporting segment.
These comprise mainly stamp duty and commission.
1 Net additions disposals includes 930,000 2017: 1,177,000 of capital expenditure.
Net appreciation depreciation includes amounts in respect of rent free periods.
2 Gross revenue for contracts for difference relates to dividends receivable, on an ex dividend basis, on the underlying positions held.
e Substantial share interests The Group held interests in 3% or more of any class of capital in 8 companies we invest in.
None of these investments is considered significant in the context of these financial statements.

Level 3 valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.
The valuation techniques used by the Group are explained in the accounting policies in notes 1 f and 1 g. The table below sets out fair value measurements using IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy.
