estimates and assumptions regarding revenue growth, operating margins, appropriate discount rates and working capital requirements.
The key assumptions used for estimating cash flow projections in the Groups impairment testing are those relating to revenue growth and operating margin.
The key assumptions take account of the businesses expectations forthe projection period.
These expectations consider the macroeconomic environment, industry and market conditions, the units historical performance and any other circumstances particular to the unit, such as business strategy and client mix.
These estimates will likely differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows, and it is possible that these differences could be material.
In addition, judgements are applied in determining the level of cash-generating unit identified for impairment testing and the criteria used to determine which assets should be aggregated.
A difference in testing levels could affect whether an impairment is recorded and the extent of impairment loss.
For the2018 impairment review, certain assets previously aggregated with the VMLY&R cash-generating unit have been realigned to other cash-generating units as part of the overall effort to simplify operations and become more client-centric.
Changes in our business activities or structure may also result inadditional changes to the level of testing in future periods.
Further, future events could cause the Group to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with a given operation have become impaired.
Any resulting impairment loss could have a material impact on the Groups financial condition and results of operations.
Historically our impairment losses have resulted from a specific event, condition or circumstance in one of our companies, such as the loss of a significant client.
As a result, changes in the assumptions used in our impairment model have not had a significant effect on the impairment charges recognised and a reasonably possible change in assumptions would not lead to a significant impairment, except for VMLY&R as discussed above.
The carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets will continue to be reviewed at least annually for impairment and adjusted down to the recoverable amount if required.

142 WPP ANNUAL REPORT 2018 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 15.
DEFERRED TAX The Groups deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the end of each period in accordance with IAS 12 Income taxes.
The recognition of deferred tax assets is determined by reference to the Groups estimate of recoverability, using models where appropriate to forecast future taxable profits.
Deferred tax assets have only been recognised for territories where the Group considers that it is probable that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will berealised.
The main factors that we consider include: the future earnings potential determined through the use of internal the history of losses carried forward and other tax assets expiring: forecasts: the timing of future reversal of taxable temporary differences: the cumulative losses in recent years: the expiry period associated with the deferred tax assets: and the various jurisdictions in which the potential deferred tax assets arise: the nature of the income that can be used to realise the deferred tax asset.
If it is probable that some portion of these assets will not be realised, then no asset is recognised in relation to that portion.
If market conditions improve and future results of operations exceed our current expectations, our existing recognised deferred tax assets may be adjusted, resulting in future tax benefits.
Alternatively, if market conditions deteriorate further or future results of operations are less than expected, future assessmentsmay result in a determination that some or all of the deferred tax assets are not realisable.
As a result, all or a portion of the deferred tax assets mayneed to be reversed.
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset as they relate to the same tax group.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances for financial reporting purposes: As As Gross Offset reported Gross Offset reported 2018 2018 2018 2017 2017 2017 m m m m m m Deferred tax assets 412.0 259.0 153.0 411.8 251.5 160.3 Deferred tax liabilities 738.5 259.0 479.5 765.2 251.5 513.7 326.5 326.5 353.4 353.4 The following are the major gross deferred tax assets recognised by the Group and movements thereon in 2018 and 2017: Accounting Retirement Property, Other Deferred provisions benefit plant and Tax losses Share-based Restructuring temporary compensation and accruals obligations equipment and credits payments provisions differences Total m m m m m m m m m 1 January 2017 95.6 80.6 141.4 70.8 89.7 75.8 5.9 38.2 598.0 Acquisition of subsidiaries 2.6 2.6 Charge credit to income 5.5 6.6 10.2 6.9 34.4 0.4 1.5 21.7 60.2 Impact of US tax reform 30.8 8.1 29.1 6.8 23.1 10.9 1.6 1.1 62.1 Charge to other comprehensive income 20.9 20.9 Charge to equity 27.3 27.3 Exchange differences 5.8 5.8 5.6 2.5 5.7 4.2 0.2 0.1 18.3 31 December 2017 53.5 84.9 75.6 68.4 72.7 33.0 5.8 17.9 411.8 Acquisition of subsidiaries 2.0 2.0 Credit charge to income 4.7 13.0 11.2 20.6 8.9 15.3 10.7 11.0 16.6 Charge to other comprehensive income 0.2 0.2 Charge to equity 1.6 1.6 Exchange differences 3.4 3.5 4.3 0.1 3.3 0.7 0.8 0.5 16.6 31 December 2018 61.6 101.4 68.5 47.9 67.1 16.8 17.3 31.4 412.0 Other temporary differences comprise a number of items including tax deductible goodwill, none of which is individually significant to the Groups consolidated balance sheet.

Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of the tax benefit of 1,763.4 million 2017: 1,539.3 million ofsuch tax losses and other temporary differences.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 4,875.2 million 2017: 4,669.3 million of losses and other temporary differences as the Group considers that there will not be enough taxable profits in the entities concerned such that any additional asset could be considered recoverable.
Included in the total unrecognised temporary differences are losses of46.4 million 2017: 56.5 million that will expire within 110 years, and 4,572.6million 2017: 4,421.5 million of losses that may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of the temporary differences in relation to the investment in subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 1,768.5 million 2017: 3,898.0 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and the Group considers that it is probable that such differences will not reverse intheforeseeable future.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CURRENCY DERIVATIVES The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge significant future transactions and cash flows and the exchange risk arising on translation of the Groups investments in foreign operations.
The Group is a party to a variety of foreign currency derivatives in the management of its exchange rate exposures.
The instruments purchased are primarily denominated in the currencies of the Groups principal markets.
The Group designates its foreign currency-denominated debt as hedging instruments against the currency risk associated with the translation of itsforeign operations.
Contracts due in March 2025 have receipts of 500.0million and payments of 444.1 million.
At 31 December 2018, the fair value of the Groups currency derivatives is estimated to be a net asset of approximately 8.4 million 2017: nil.
These amounts are based on market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date, comprising 8.4 million 2017: nil assets included in trade and other receivables and nil 2017: nil liabilities included in trade and other payables.
The amounts taken to and deferred in equity during the year for currency derivatives that are designated and effective hedges was a charge of 17.9 million 2017: nil for cash flow hedges.
Changes in the fair value relating to the ineffective portion of the currency derivatives amounted to a loss of 11.1 million 2017: nil which is included inthe revaluation of financial instruments for the year.
This loss resulted from a6.8 million gain on hedging instruments and a 17.9 million loss on hedgeditems.
At the balance sheet date, the total nominal amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts not designated as hedges was 296.1 million 2017:177.7 million.

ACQUISITIONS The Group accounts for acquisitions in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
IFRS 3 requires the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities other than non-current assets or disposal groups held for sale to be recognised at fair value at acquisition date.
In assessing fair value at acquisition date, management make their best estimate of the likely outcome where the fair value of an asset or liability may be contingent on a future event.
In certain instances, the underlying transaction giving rise to an estimate may not be resolved until some years after the acquisition date.
IFRS 3 requires the release to profit of any acquisition reserves which subsequently become excess in the same way as any excess costs over those provided at acquisition date are charged to profit.
At each period end management assess provisions and other balances established in respect of acquisitions for their continued probability of occurrence and amend the relevant value accordingly through the consolidated income statement or as an adjustment to goodwill as appropriate under IFRS 3.
The Group acquired a number of subsidiaries in the year.
The following table sets out the book values of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired and their fair value to the Group.
The fair value adjustments for certain acquisitions have been determined provisionally at the balance sheet date.

RECONCILIATION TO NON-GAAP MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE Management includes non-GAAP measures as they consider these measures to be both useful and necessary.
They are used by management for internal performance analyses: the presentation of these measures facilitates comparability with other companies, although managements measures may not be calculated in the same way as similarly titled measures reported by other companies: and these measures are useful in connection with discussions with the investment community.

Pass-through costs comprise fees paid to external suppliers when they are engaged to perform part or all of a specific project and are charged directly to clients, predominantly media and data collection costs.
This includes the cost of media where the Groups media investment management sub-sector is buying digital media for its own account on a transparent opt-in basis and, as a result, the subsequent media pass-through costs have to be accounted for as revenue, as well as billings.
In addition, the data investment management sector, which forms a significant part of the Groups revenue and in which none of the Groups direct competitors have a significant presence, includes pass-through costs, principally for data collection.
Therefore, management considers that revenue less passthrough costs gives a reflection of top-line performance.

CONSTANT CURRENCY AND PRO FORMA LIKE-FOR-LIKE These consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling.
However, the Groups significant international operations give rise to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
To neutralise foreign exchange impact and illustrate the underlying change in revenue and profit from one year to thenext, the Group has adopted the practice of discussing results in both reportable currency local currency results translated into pounds sterling atthe prevailing foreign exchange rate and constant currency.
Management also believes that discussing pro forma or like-for-like contributes to the understanding of the Groups performance and trends because it allows for meaningful comparisons of the current year to that of prior years.
Further details of the constant currency and pro forma methods are given in the financial glossary on pages 178 and 179.
