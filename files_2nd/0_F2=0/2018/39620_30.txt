171 NOTES TO THE SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 Signi cant accounting policies RSA Insurance Group plc, the Company, incorporated in England and Wales, is the ultimate Parent Company of the RSA group of companies.
The principal activity of the Company is to hold investments in its subsidiaries and the receipt and payment of dividends.
These separate financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as endorsed by the European Union EU and the Companies Act 2006 where applicable.
Except where otherwise stated, all gures included in the separate financial statements are presented in millions of Pounds Sterling Sterling, shown as m, rounded to the nearest million.
In accordance with section 408 of Companies Act 2006, the Companys income statement and related notes have not been presented in these separate financial statements.
The accounting policies that are used in preparation of these separate financial statements are consistent with the accounting policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements of RSA Insurance Group plc as set out in those financial statements.
The additional accounting policies that are speci c to the separate financial statements of the Company are set out below.
Investment in subsidiaries The Company accounts for its investments in directly owned subsidiaries as fair value through other comprehensive income, which are included in the accounts at fair value.
Changes in the fair value of the investments in subsidiaries are recognised directly in equity in the statement of comprehensive income which is not re-classi ed through pro t or loss on fide-recognition.
Amounts owed from subsidiaries The Company accounts for amounts owed from subsidiaries at amortised cost and determines an expected credit loss based on those default events that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date, or where the credit risk has increased signi cantly since initial recognition on the basis of all possible default events over the life of debt.
Dividend income Dividend income from investments in subsidiaries is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Adoption of new and revised accounting standards IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9 Financial Instruments which replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement became effective from 1 January 2018.
This standard primarily changes the classi cation and measurement of financial assets depending on the business model under which they are held, as well as recognising expected credit losses and changes to hedge accounting requirements.
In terms of the new financial asset classi cation: the Company has elected to treat its investment in directly owned subsidiaries which are not held for trading, previously classi ed as available for sale, as fair value through other comprehensive income, the accounting policy for which is set out below: and Amounts owed by subsidiaries, which are held to collect contractual cash ows and are not designated at fair value through pro t or loss continue to be measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, consistent with their treatment as loans and receivables under IAS 39.
Neither of the above classi cations under IFRS 9 resulted in a change to the carrying value of the financial assets from would it would have been under IAS 39.
IFRS 9 also replaces the incurred loss model under IAS 39 with an expected credit loss ECL model as considered below: This is applicable to the amounts owed by subsidiaries to the Company, which it can seen from note 3 are repayable on 24 hours written notice.
As at the reporting date the credit risk on the amounts owed has not increased signi cantly since initial recognition and so the ECL was determined by considering the ECL that would occur from those default events that are possible within 12 months based on the probability of default and the expected loss given default.
Speci cally the probability of default was considered together with the expected subsequent loss.
It was concluded that the value of the ECL would be insigni cant and so no ECL has been recognised at the reporting date.
As set out above, adoption of IFRS 9 did not result in any change in the carrying value of financial assets nor recognition of an ECL and so consequently no restatement of comparatives or changes in retained earnings or reserves was necessary.
IFRS 15 Revenue Recognition IFRS 15 Revenue Recognition became effective from 1 January 2018.
The Companys principal activity of receiving dividend income from it investment in subsidiaries is outside the scope of this standard and so consequently implementing this standard has not had a signi cant impact on the Companys result for the year or its financial position.

The Companys investments are classi ed as level 2 financial assets.
Fair value of the Companys signi cant subsidiary is determined by reference to the market value derived from relevant indices of the Companys ordinary shares and loan capital instruments at the end of the reporting period, being the most transparent independent available indicator.
The market value is adjusted for the fair value of the Companys preference shares, assets and liabilities, excluding directly owned subsidiaries.
The adjusting items have been fair valued by determining the present value of future cash ow projections, using an appropriate arms length discount rate.
The remaining subsidiaries are held at fair value which has been determined to be net asset value.
The subordinated loan to a subsidiary has the same terms as the external loan capital from which the loan to the subsidiary was nanced.
The fair value of the loan is based on the quoted price for the external loan capital.
The nominal value of the loan is 32m 2017: 32m with an interest rate of 9.375%.
The Directors believe that the methodology used supports the inclusion of the investments in subsidiaries in the statement of financial position, at the fair values ascribed to them.
The market value of the Companys ordinary shares at 31 December 2018 was 513.6p.
A movement of 1% in the share price would have an impact of 53m on the fair value.
Full details of the principal subsidiaries of the Company are set out in Appendix B to the consolidated financial statements.
