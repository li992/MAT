Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2018 1.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES 1.1 Basis of preparation These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101.
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for the revaluation of financial assets classified as fair value through the profit or loss.
In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRSs, but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken.
1.2 Changes to accounting policies Two new accounting standards became effective as of 1 January 2018, IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 15 Revenue which have been adopted in these financial statements.
1 IFRS 9 The Company has adopted IFRS 9 as issued by the IASB in July 2014 with a date of transition of 1 January 2018, which has resulted in changes in the accounting policies for classification and measurement of financial assets.
There has been no adjustment to the amounts previously recognised in the financial statements or to the classification and measurement of financial liabilities.
2 IFRS 15 IFRS 15 Revenue introduces a new five-step framework for the recognition of revenue.
There is no impact on the adoption of this new standard on these financial statements due to there being no revenue in the scope of this standard.
1.3 Disclosure exemptions applied under FRS 101 The Company has taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions under FRS 101: FRS 101.8 d : the requirement of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosure to make disclosures about financial instruments: FRS 101.8 f : the requirement in paragraph 38 of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements to present comparative information in respect of: paragraph 118 3 of IAS 38 Intangible Assets: FRS 101.8 g : the requirements of paragraphs 10 d, 10 f, 16, 38A, 38B, 38C, 38D, 40A, 40B, 40C, 40D and 111 of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements to produce a cash flow statement, a third balance sheet and to make an explicit and unreserved statement of compliance with IFRSs: FRS 101.8 h : the requirements of IAS 7 Statements of Cash Flows to produce a cash flow statement: FRS 101.8 i : the requirements of paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors to include a list of new IFRSs that have been issued but that have yet to be applied: and FRS 101.8 k : the requirements in IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group, provided that any subsidiary which is a party to transaction is wholly owned by such a member.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements.
1.4 Going concern The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
In considering the appropriateness of this assumption, the Board have reviewed the Companys projections for the next twelve months and beyond, including cash flow forecasts and regulatory capital surpluses.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual financial statements.
182 Admiral Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Company Overview Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information 1.5 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In applying the Groups accounting policies as described below management has primarily applied judgement in the impairment testing of the Companys investments in group undertakings.
Management has applied judgement in determining whether the carrying value of the investment or asset may be supported by the recoverable amount calculation based on the value in use of the asset the net present value of future cash-flows arising from the asset.
In calculating the net present value of future cash-flows, management has made assumptions over the timing and amount of underlying profit projections of the relevant undertakings, long term growth rates in those projections and the discount rate applied to these projections that is appropriate to reflect the markets view of the risk of the relevant investment.
1.6 Shares in Group Undertakings Shares in Group undertakings are valued at cost less any provision for impairment in value.
The requirements of IAS 36 are applied to determine whether it is necessary to recognise any impairment loss with respect to the companys investments in subsidiaries.
When necessary, the entire carrying amount of the investment is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets as a single asset by comparing its recoverable amount higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal with its carrying amount.
Any impairment loss recognised forms part of the carrying amount of the investment.
Any reversal of that impairment loss is recognised in accordance with IAS 36 to the extent that the recoverable amount of the investment subsequently increases.
1.7 Employee share schemes The Company operates a number of share schemes for its employees.
For equity settled schemes commencing 1 January 2004 and after, the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of free shares under the schemes is recognised as an increase in equity in the Company.
1.8 Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable.
They are regarded as recoverable to the extent that, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be sufficient taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
1.9 Financial assets and liabilities From 1 January 2018, the Group has applied IFRS 9.
Under IFRS 9, classification of and subsequent measurement of financial assets depend on: The Groups business model for managing the asset: and The cashflow characteristics of the asset.
Based on these factors, the Company classifies its financial assets into one of the three categories below: Amortised cost: assets held for collection of contractual cash flows where the cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, that are not designated as FVTPL.
Fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI : Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and selling the assets, where the assets cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, and that are not designated at FVTPL.
Fair value through profit or loss FVTPL : Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI.
In line with the above: Fixed term deposits are measured at amortised cost with interest income is recognised in the Income Statement.
Gilts are measured at FVOCI.
Unrealised changes in the fair value of these assets are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income OCI.
Investments measured at FVTPL are primarily money market funds.
Interest income is recognised in the Income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits held at call with banks.
All cash and cash equivalents are measured at amortised cost.
The Companys financial liabilities comprise subordinated notes which are held at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

All investments in group undertakings are considered level 3 in the fair value hierarchy of IFRS 13.
An annual impairment review is performed over the carrying value of the investments in subsidiary undertakings, which involves comparing the carrying amount to the estimated recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the greater of the fair value of the asset less costs to sell, and the value in use of the subsidiary, calculated using cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management.
In 2018 a non-cash impairment loss of 32.9 million has been recognised by the parent company in respect of its investment in the Groups US price comparison business compare.
The impairment charge is presented within the Impairment losses line of the Parent Company Income Statement and reduces the value of the investment to its recoverable amount, being its value in use, of 32.8 million.
