The category of service contract equipment represents the pool of assets used by the Group in delivering contracted services to customers.
Land and buildings comprise mainly factories and offices.
Finance leases Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Finance leases are capitalised at the leases inception at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate on the finance balance outstanding.
The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in other payables.
The interest element of the finance cost is charged to the income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.
Property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term.
The net carrying amounts of assets held under finance leases are as follows: 2018 2017 m m Vehicles and office equipment 41.7 36.0 Total 41.7 36.0 B4.
