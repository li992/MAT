com Governance The worlds largest robot delivers iron ore AutoHaul, our first driverless heavy-haul, long-distance trains, successfully delivered iron ore from our inland mines in the Pilbara, Western Australia, to our port at Cape Lambert.
Since its first loaded run in July, we have safely and steadily increased the number of autonomous trips across our iron ore operations in Western Australia.
AutoHaul have travelled more than1.6 million kilometres in 2018.
AutoHaul improves safety by reducing risk at level crossings and through its automated responses to speed restrictions and alarms.
It also eliminates the need to transport Our autonomous trains drivers to and from trains mid-journey travelled more than saving almost 1.5 million kilometres of road travel each year.
It also improves cycle times by using 1.6 information about the train and rail network topography to calculate and deliver a safe, consistent driving strategy.
million kilometres in 2018 This is by far the most excitingproject Ive ever worked on from the perspective of innovation and world-first technology.
It is the highlight of my career.
