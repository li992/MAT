FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Year ended 31 December 2018 1.
Corporate information KAZ Minerals PLC the Company is a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales.
The Companys registered office is 6th Floor, Cardinal Place, 100 Victoria Street, London SW1E 5JL, United Kingdom.
The Group comprises the Company and its consolidated divisions as set out below.
The Group operates in the natural resources industry through five divisions, the principal activities of which during 2018 were: Principal activity Primary country of operations Operating division Bozshakol Mining and processing of copper and other metals Kazakhstan Aktogay Mining and processing of copper and other metals Kazakhstan 1 East Region Mining and processing of copper and other metals Kazakhstan 1 Bozymchak Mining and processing of copper and gold Kyrgyzstan Mining Projects Development of greenfield metal deposits and processing facilities Kazakhstan 1 The East Region and Bozymchak are separate divisions but have been combined for segmental reporting purposes.
The legal names of the constituent companies within the above divisions are shown in note 37 k. 2.
Basis of preparation The financial statements set out on pages 122 to 175 have been prepared using accounting policies consistent with IFRSs as adopted by the EU.
The Company has taken the exemption under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and has not published the Companys income statement and related notes.
a Going concern The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate committed borrowing facilities and working capital funds.
The Board monitors the net debt level and liquidity position of the Group taking into consideration the expected outlook of the Groups financial position, cash flows, future capital expenditure and debt service requirements.
At 31 December 2018, the Groups net debt was $1,986 million with gross debt of $3,453 million and gross liquid funds of $1,467 million.
The gross debt facilities, which are fully drawn, consist of: $1,345 million of the CDB-Bozshakol and Bozymchak facilities, which amortise over the period to 2025: $1,331 million of the CDB-Aktogay US dollar and Chinese yuan facilities, which amortise over the period to 2029: $500 million of the PXF facility which amortises over the period from July 2018 to June 2021: and $277 million of the DBK facility, which amortises during the period from June 2018 to June 2025.
Since year end the Group has completed the acquisition of Baimskaya comprising an initial cash payment of $386 million with a further $50 million payment expected to be made during 2019.
The Board has considered the Groups cash flow forecasts for the period to 30 March 2020 including the outlook for commodity prices, production levels from the Groups operations, its future capital requirements including the planned expansion of Aktogay and the acquisition and an initial investment in the Baimskaya project, and the principal repayments and interest due under the Groups debt facilities.
The Groups funding strategy is to obtain a new financing facility which the Groups forecasts show is required to finance the construction of the Aktogay expansion.
The Board is confident of raising additional liquidity through a combination of new sources of finance and or a refinance of debt facilities given the quality of the Groups long-term low cost assets, the low risk nature of the Aktogay expansion and the level of amortisation of existing debt facilities during the period.
The Board expects a new facility, in the region of $600 million, to be completed during the first half of 2019 to support the Aktogay expansion.
Assuming additional liquidity is committed as expected, the Board is satisfied that the Groups forecasts, taking into account reasonably possible downside scenarios, show that the Group has adequate liquidity to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
There can however be no guarantee that the new liquidity can be secured as expected.
In the unlikely event that no new additional financing can be secured, mitigating actions will be taken to defer planned capital expenditure, to ensure the Group has adequate liquidity throughout the going concern period.
In the severe downside scenarios of sustained lower than expected commodity prices with lower production: and sustained lower prices, lower production and higher operating costs, the Groups forecasts indicate that mitigating actions, including a deferral of construction of the Aktogay expansion, would be required by the end of the first half of 2019 if new financing is not obtained.
Whilst these scenarios are considered unlikely, the Board considers taking such mitigating steps to be feasible.
Accordingly, the Board is satisfied that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements.
b Basis of accounting The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments which have been measured at fair value.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars $ and all financial information has been rounded to the nearest million dollars $ million, except where otherwise indicated.
126 126 KAZ Minerals Ann KAZ Minerals Annual R ual Repor eport and Accounts 2018 t and Accounts 2018 STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS c Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements set out the Groups financial position as at 31 December 2018 and the Groups financial performance for the year ended 31 December 2018.
Subsidiaries are those enterprises controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to direct those activities of an enterprise that most significantly affect the returns the Group earns from its involvement with the enterprise.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
When the Group ceases to have control, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value, with the change in carrying amount recognised in the income statement.
The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset.
In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.
This treatment may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are recycled through the income statement.
Joint operations are those arrangements jointly controlled by the Group and one or more parties with rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement, as outlined in note 36 b.
Joint operations are proportionally consolidated from the date on which the Group obtains joint control and cease to be proportionally consolidated from the date on which the Group no longer has joint control.
The financial statements of subsidiaries and joint operations are prepared for the same reporting year as the Company, using consistent accounting policies.
All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in full.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains except that they are only eliminated to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
See note 37 k for a list of all the Companys subsidiaries and joint operations.
d Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries and joint operations have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as issued by the IASB and interpretations issued by the IFRIC of the IASB, as adopted by the EU and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. e Adoption of new standards and interpretations The following accounting standards, amendments and interpretations, which had no significant impact on these financial statements, became effective in the current reporting period on adoption by the EU through the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group EFRAG : IFRS 9 Financial Instruments was adopted on 1 January 2018, replacing IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
The new standard has been applied retrospectively but did not result in a material change to the Groups accounting policies or a restatement of prior period financial assets and liabilities.
As a result of the application of IFRS 9, trade receivables subject to provisional pricing are required to be classified and presented at fair value through profit or loss.
Most of the Groups sales contracts are based on provisional pricing which are marked to market at each period end using appropriate quoted market forward prices, with any adjustment included in revenue.
Changes in classification and measurement of the Groups financial instruments on transition to IFRS 9 are outlined in note 31 b.
The standard also outlines a new expected credit loss model, used to estimate the credit risk to the Groups financial assets measured at amortised cost.
The impact of this model was evaluated and found to be immaterial, as outlined in note 31 f, given the nature of the Groups financial assets and its credit risk management policies and procedures which control credit exposure and minimise the risk of loss.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers was adopted on 1 January 2018, replacing IAS 18 Revenue.
The new standard was applied using the modified retrospective approach, which did not result in a classification or measurement adjustment to retained earnings on transition or a restatement of comparative information.
In applying the transition requirements and provisions of the new standard, the Group reviewed its contracts and assessed the nature of its performance obligations.
Certain sales contracts, in particular those relating to copper concentrate, reflect Carriage Insurance Paid delivery terms Incoterms which require the Group to deliver the material to a specified location.
Whilst the sale and delivery of the material are regarded as two separate performance obligations for which revenue should be recognised, the delivery performance obligation was found to be wholly immaterial compared to the sales performance obligation and therefore no change to prior period revenue recognition was required.
The Group also considered the variable consideration constraint on revenue recognition imposed by the new standard in relation to post sale volume adjustments on metal concentrates.
Historically, such final volume adjustments on metal concentrates have been minimal and therefore there was no constraint imposed on revenue recognition.
IFRIC 22 Foreign currency transactions and advance considerations clarified the accounting for the receipt or payment of advance consideration in a foreign currency.
The application of this interpretation had no significant impact on the amounts reported in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
The application of a number of minor amendments, including those from the 2014-2016 annual improvement cycle which became effective on 1 January 2018, had no impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements due to the nature of its operations.
This includes Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions Amendments to IFRS 2 : Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts Amendments to IFRS 4 : Transfers of Investment Property Amendments to IAS 40 : Amendments to IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures: and Amendments to IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards.

Basis of preparation continued f New standards and interpretations not yet adopted The key new standards, interpretations and amendments, as issued by the IASB are expected to be adopted by the Group once they are effective for application in the EU.
IFRS 16 Leases: the IASB effective date is 1 January 2019 and has been endorsed by the EU.
The standard changes the identification of leases and how they will be recognised, measured and disclosed by lessees, requiring the recognition of a right-of-use asset and liability for the future lease payments on the balance sheet.
The new standard requires the right-of-use asset to be depreciated over the duration of the lease term and shown within operating profit in the income statement, with the interest cost associated with the financing of the asset included within interest expense.
The Group has reviewed its lease contracts in place at 31 December 2018, which mainly relate to leased office buildings and payments for land, and the right-of-use asset and related liability was found to be immaterial.
The net impact on profit before tax in 2019 is also expected to be immaterial.
The Group has elected to apply the modified retrospective approach requiring no restatement of comparative figures and there will be no impact on opening equity at 1 January 2019.
The new standard does not apply to leases to explore for or use natural resources, such as mining licences and rights.
IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments: the IASB effective date is 1 January 2019 and has been endorsed by the EU.
The interpretation clarifies that income tax and deferred tax assets and liabilities should be measured reflecting the uncertainty of any positions adopted under IAS 12 Income Taxes, where acceptance of such position by the tax authorities is considered as less than probable.
The Group has reviewed its income tax positions at 31 December 2018 and has not identified any material uncertain income tax positions.
Borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation Amendments to IAS 23 : the IASB effective date is 1 January 2019 and is yet to be endorsed by the EU.
The amendment requires that project specific borrowings are included as general borrowings once those assets are operating as intended and therefore the associated interest will become available for capitalisation on other qualifying assets.
In 2019, this amendment will bring the CDB Bozshakol and Bozymchak, CDB Aktogay, and DBK Aktogay loans borrowed specifically for the construction of the respective capital projects into general borrowings.
The interest on these loans will be available for capitalisation onto qualifying capital projects such as the expansion of Aktogay.
Definition of a Business Amendments to IFRS 3 : the IASB effective date is 1 January 2020 and is yet to be endorsed by the EU.
The amendment provides clearer application guidance to help companies distinguish between a business and a group of assets when applying IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
The amendment also clarifies that classification of a business would not be appropriate if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets.
This amendment is not expected to have an impact on the Group as it would not change the accounting for the Baimskaya copper project.
IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts: the IASB effective date is 1 January 2021 and is yet to be endorsed by the EU.
IFRS 17 will replace IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts and applies to all types of insurance contracts i. e. life, non-life, direct insurance and reinsurance, regardless of the type of entities that issue them, as well as to certain guarantees and financial instruments with discretionary participation features.
This standard is not expected to have an impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements due to the nature of its operations.
There are a number of other amendments, including those issued following the 2015-2017 annual improvements project, which have not yet been endorsed by the EU and are not expected to have a material impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements.
The Group has not early adopted any new standards or interpretations.
g Comparative information Where a change in the presentation format of the consolidated financial statements has been made during the year, comparative figures have been restated accordingly.

Significant accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the course of preparing these financial statements, the Directors make necessary judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Judgements are based on the Directors best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances having regard to prior experience, but actual results may differ from the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements.
Estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant, but actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions applied are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods, if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The following are the critical judgements, key assumptions and sources of estimation uncertainty concerning the future that arise mainly from the nature of the Groups mining operations and which the Directors believe are likely to have the greatest effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements.
However, the Directors do not expect a significant risk of a material change to the Groups carrying value of the assets and liabilities affected by these factors in the next 12 months, within a reasonably possible range, with the exception of Bozymchak, as discussed below.
The qualitative disclosures regarding these sources of estimation uncertainty are presented because the Directors consider these to be relevant to the mining industry and useful in understanding the financial statements of the Group.
These disclosures go beyond the minimum requirements of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements which only requires disclosure of estimation uncertainty where changes in estimates, within a reasonably possible range, could have a significant risk of a material effect, within the next 12 months, on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Impairment of assets Significant accounting judgements The Directors review the carrying value of the Groups assets to determine whether there are any indicators of impairment such that the carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable.
The assessment of whether an indicator of impairment or reversal thereof has arisen requires considerable judgement, taking account of future operational and financial plans, commodity prices, market demand and the competitive environment.
For exploration and evaluation assets held by the Group, indicators of impairment can include: a the right to explore in a specific area has expired and is not expected to be renewed b significant expenditure for further exploration or evaluation activities is not being planned c exploration and evaluation of mineral resources have not led to the discovery or confirmation of commercially viable resource, or d that sufficient data exists to indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recovered in full from development or sale.
Where such indicators exist, the carrying value of the assets of a cash generating unit or exploration and evaluation asset is compared with the recoverable amount of those assets, that is, the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and value in use, which is typically determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows.
For the purpose of assessing commodity prices for indicators of impairment, consideration was given to a range of equity analyst long-term copper prices with a median price of around $6,700 t. An assessment of the key external and internal factors affecting the Group and its cash generating units CGUs, at 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017 did not identify any indicators of impairment or reversal thereof at any of the Groups Kazakhstan CGUs.
At the Bozymchak CGU, adverse court rulings in Kyrgyzstan for the recovery of historical VAT incurred on the construction of the plant, amounting to $16 million and previously included within non-current assets, were received in the second half of 2018.
This was considered to be an impairment indicator and an impairment review was undertaken see note 6.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty The preparation of discounted future cash flows used for impairment reviews where indicators are identified, includes management estimates of commodity prices, market demand and supply, future operating costs, economic and regulatory environments, capital expenditure requirements, long-term mine plans and other factors.
Any subsequent revisions to cash flows due to changes in the factors listed above, principally commodity prices, beyond what is considered as reasonably possible, could impact the recoverable amount of the assets.
Changes to commodity prices within a reasonably possible range are not expected to significantly impact the carrying value of the Groups Kazakhstan based CGUs.
Bozymchak An impairment charge of $20 million was recognised against the Bozymchak CGU, which is included in the East Region and Bozymchak segment, following the identification of an impairment indicator.
In determining the recoverable amount of the CGU, the Directors made estimates of the future risk adjusted cash flows with the key variables being copper and gold price assumptions, operational costs, production profile, copper grades and the discount rate.
The recoverable amount of the CGU was estimated at $84 million and determined as its fair value less costs to sell see note 6. www www.

Significant accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued Non-current inventories Significant accounting judgements Mining activities may result in the stockpiling of ore.
Ore which is not expected to be processed within 12 months of the balance sheet date and is considered to fall outside of the normal operating cycle of the operation is classified as a non-current asset.
The classification of stockpiled ore between non-current and current assets is based on judgements as to the expected timing of processing and on future production plans.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty Stockpiled ore is reported at the lower of cost or net realisable value, with net realisable value subject to estimates of further processing, delivery costs and future commodity prices.
Commodity prices applied in assessing the net realisable value fall within the range of equity analyst commodity price expectations.
Changes to commodity prices in the next 12 months within a reasonably possible range are not expected to significantly impact the carrying value of non-current inventories.
Determination of ore reserves and useful lives of property, plant and equipment Key sources of estimation uncertainty Ore reserves are estimates of the amount of product that can be economically and legally extracted from the Groups mining properties.
In order to estimate reserves, assumptions are required about a range of geological, technical and economic factors, including quantities, grades, production techniques, recovery rates, production costs, transport costs, commodity demand, commodity prices and exchange rates.
The Group estimates its ore reserves and mineral resources based on information compiled and reviewed by independent competent persons as defined in accordance with the JORC Code.
In assessing the life of a mine for accounting purposes, ore reserves are taken into account where there is a high degree of confidence of economic extraction.
Since the economic assumptions used to estimate reserves change from period to period, and as additional geological data is generated during the course of operations, estimates of reserves may change from period to period.
Changes in reported reserves may affect the Groups financial results and financial position in a number of ways, including the following: asset recoverable amounts may be affected due to changes in estimated future cash flows: deferral of stripping costs which are determined using a waste to ore stripping ratio: depreciation, depletion and amortisation charged in the income statement may change where such charges are determined by the unit of production basis, or where the useful economic lives of assets change: decommissioning, site restoration and environmental provisions may change where changes in estimated reserves affect expectations about the timing or cost of these activities: and the carrying value of deferred tax assets may change due to revisions in estimates of the likely recovery of tax benefits.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating ore reserves and assumptions that are valid at the time of estimation may change significantly when new information becomes available.
Changes in the forecast prices of commodities, exchange rates, production costs or recovery rates may change the economic status of reserves and may ultimately result in reserves being revised.
The Directors do not expect significant changes in the carrying value of the Groups mining properties: property, plant and equipment: closure liabilities and deferred taxes to arise from changes in ore reserve estimates within a reasonably possible range in the next 12 months.
Revisions to ore reserve estimates in 2018 did not result in a material change to the carrying value of these assets and liabilities.
For property, plant and equipment depreciated on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life, the appropriateness of the assets useful economic life is reviewed at least annually and changes could affect prospective depreciation rates and asset carrying values.
Decommissioning and site restoration costs Significant accounting judgements The Directors use judgement and experience in determining the expected timing, closure and decommissioning methods, which can vary, in response to changes in the relevant legal requirements or decommissioning technologies.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty The ultimate cost of decommissioning and rehabilitation is uncertain and cost estimates can vary in response to many factors including the emergence of new restoration techniques and costs of materials and labour.
Therefore, the Group periodically reviews the closure cost estimate at each operation.
The expected timing and extent of expenditure can also change in response to revisions in ore reserve estimates, processing levels and commodity prices whilst future costs are discounted using expected discount rates.
Due to the relatively long life of the Groups most significant assets, changes in estimates within a reasonable possible range in the next 12 months are not expected to significantly impact the carrying value of the Groups provisions for decommissioning and site restoration costs.
130 130 KAZ Minerals Ann KAZ Minerals Annual R ual Repor eport and Accounts 2018 t and Accounts 2018 STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Taxes Significant accounting judgements The Directors make judgements in relation to the recognition of various taxes levied on the Group, which are both payable and recoverable.
Judgement applies particularly to corporate income taxes, transfer pricing, VAT and outcomes of any tax disputes which would affect the recognition of tax liabilities and deferred tax assets.
Judgement over recognition also applies to taxes which are recoverable by the Group, principally VAT paid, for which the recoverability and timing of recovery is assessed.
In making judgements related to taxes, the Directors believe that the tax positions it adopts are in line with the applicable legislation and reflect the probable outcome.
The tax obligations and receivables, upon audit by the tax authorities at a future date, may differ as a result of differing interpretations.
These interpretations may impact the expected timing and quantum of taxes payable and recoverable and are discussed further in note 32.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty Estimates may be made to determine the amount of taxes recoverable, principally VAT and deferred tax assets.
The recognition of deferred tax assets mainly relates to tax losses which may be utilised in the future, giving consideration to future profitability, estimates on commodity prices, interest rates, operating costs and any statute of limitation period.
Changes in these estimates within a reasonably possible range in the next 12 months are not expected to significantly alter the carrying value of the Groups taxes that are recoverable.
Joint operations Significant accounting judgements Joint arrangements are classified as joint operations where the Group exercises joint control and the parties have the rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement, as outlined in note 36 b. Judgement is required in determining the nature of the joint arrangement based on the particular facts and circumstances, the legal form and purpose of the joint arrangement.
Industrial Construction Group LLC ICG is a joint arrangement established to undertake the engineering and construction of the additional sulphide processing facility at Aktogay.
The Group exercises joint control as decisions require unanimous consent.
As the output of the joint arrangement is the construction of the additional processing facilities at Aktogay and thus benefits the Group, ICG is accounted for as a joint operation and is therefore proportionally consolidated.
Further details of the accounting policy for joint operations is outlined in note 36 b.
Achievement of commercial production applicable to 2017 only Significant accounting judgements Once an operation reaches the operating level intended by management and regarded to be commercial, capitalisation of development costs including borrowing costs ceases, the depreciation of capitalised costs begins and the revenues and operational costs are recorded in the income statement and not capitalised to the balance sheet.
Significant judgement is required to determine when the Groups assets achieve commercial production, including evaluation of the following factors: completion of a reasonable period of commissioning: consistent achievement of operational results at a pre-determined level of expected capacity and indicators exist that this level will continue: mineral recoveries are at or approaching expected levels: and transfer of the operation from project personnel to operational personnel.
For the Bozshakol operation, commercial production of the clay plant was determined to have been achieved on 1 July 2017.
In making this judgement, the Directors considered the performance of the plant of at least 60% of its design capacity for a three month period, which is broadly consistent with industry practice.
Revenues, production costs and interest incurred on borrowings to finance the project were recognised in the income statement and depreciation of its asset base commenced from that date.
The Aktogay sulphide plant achieved commercial production from 1 October 2017 after consistent production of at least 60% of its design capacity over a three month period.
Revenues, production costs and interest incurred on borrowings to finance the project were recognised in the income statement with the commencement of depreciation of its assets from that date.

Segment information Information provided to the Groups Board of Directors for the purposes of resource allocation and the assessment of segmental performance is prepared in accordance with the management and operational structure of the Group.
For management and operational purposes, the Group is organised into a number of businesses as shown below, according to the nature of their operations, end-products and services rendered.
Each of these business units represents an operating segment in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
The East Region and Bozymchak segments are presented on a combined basis.
The Groups operating segments are: Bozshakol The Bozshakol open pit, sulphide concentrator and clay plant located in the Pavlodar region of Kazakhstan and the associated international sales and marketing activities managed out of the UK.
The sulphide concentrator, which sells copper concentrate with gold content as a by-product, was commissioned in February 2016 and achieved commercial production on 27 October 2016, with its revenues and costs being recognised in the income statement from that date.
The clay plant, which was commissioned in the fourth quarter of 2016 and which achieved commercial production on 1 July 2017, is included in the Bozshakol operating segment due to the sharing of infrastructure and mining pit, its relatively small size and to reflect the Groups management structure.
The clay plants pre-commercial revenues and costs were recorded against property, plant and equipment until it achieved commercial production, after which depreciation of the asset base commenced and interest associated with borrowings used to finance the construction of the plant was expensed.
Aktogay The Aktogay open pit, sulphide concentrator and oxide plant located in the east of Kazakhstan and the associated international sales and marketing activities managed out of the UK.
The sulphide concentrator was commissioned in the final quarter of 2016 and achieved commercial production on 1 October 2017, with its revenues and costs being recognised in the income statement from that date.
Until commercial production was achieved, the revenues and operating costs of the sulphide concentrator were recorded against property, plant and equipment.
The oxide operation, which sells copper cathodes, reached commercial production on 1 July 2016, with its revenues and costs being recognised in the income statement from that date.
The oxide plant is included in the Aktogay operating segment due to the sharing of infrastructure, its relatively small size and to reflect the Groups management structure.
An expansion of the sulphide processing facilities at Aktogay was announced in December 2017, which is expected to double its sulphide ore processing capacity by the end of 2021.
East Region and Bozymchak The East Region and Bozymchak operations are shown as one operating segment consisting of Vostoktsvetmet LLC East Region, whose principal activity is the mining and processing of copper and other metals which are produced as by-products from three underground mines and concentrators located in the eastern region of Kazakhstan: and KAZ Minerals Bozymchak LLC Bozymchak a copper-gold open pit mine and concentrator located in western Kyrgyzstan and the associated international sales and marketing activities managed out of the UK.
Bozymchak is combined with the East Region operations, given their similar economic characteristics: similar concentrate production processes: and as their combined output is toll processed at the Balkhash smelter and subsequently sold to the Groups customers.
Mining Projects The Groups mining projects consist of companies which are responsible for the assessment and greenfield development of metal deposits and processing facilities.
The segment includes the Koksay mineral deposit.
Managing and measuring operating segments The key performance measure which the Directors use internally to assess the performance of the operating segments is EBITDA.
Refer to the APMs section on page 179 for further details.
The Treasury department manages the Groups borrowings and monitors finance income and finance costs at the Group level on a net basis, rather than by operating segment.
Segmental information is also provided in respect of revenues, by destination and by product.
Segmental information relating to employees is provided in note 8.

2 MET and royalties have been excluded from the key financial indicator of EBITDA.
The Directors believe that MET and royalties are a substitute for a tax on profits, hence their exclusion provides an informed measure of the operational performance of the Group.
In 2017, MET incurred at the Bozshakol clay and Aktogay sulphide plants during the pre-commercial production stage of $3 million and $22 million, respectively, was capitalised to property, plant and equipment.
3 During pre-commercial production, revenues and operating costs were capitalised to property, plant and equipment.
4 An impairment of $16 million arose from the decision not to continue with the smelter project and reflects costs incurred.

Segment information continued b Information in respect of revenues continued Most of the Groups sales agreements are based on provisional pricing with the final pricing usually determined by the average market price of the respective metal in the month for silver, the month following for copper cathode and zinc concentrate or the second month following for copper concentrate including by-products dispatch to the customer.
At 31 December, the Groups provisionally priced volumes and their respective average provisional price were as follows: At 31 December 2018 At 31 December 2017 Provisionally Weighted average Provisionally Weighted average priced volumes provisional price priced volumes provisional price Copper cathodes 4 kt 6,244 $ t 4 kt 6,865 $ t 1 Copper in concentrate 29 kt 5,558 $ t 22 kt 6,067 $ t 1 Zinc in concentrate 2 kt 2,102 $ t 4 kt 2,516 $ t 1 Gold in concentrate 21 koz 1,217 $ oz 19 koz 1,276 $ oz 1 Silver in concentrate 113 koz 14 $ oz 65 koz 16 $ oz 1 Payable metal in concentrate.
Typically priced after deduction of a processing charge.
The final prices for the provisionally priced volumes shown above will be determined during the quarter after the year end.
At 31 December 2018, sales contracts which had not been finally priced were marked to market to reflect the expected settlement price based on the appropriate forward metal price typically one month for copper cathode and zinc concentrate and two months for copper concentrate including by-products.
This adjustment decreased revenue by $7 million 2017: $12 million increase in Gross Revenues and revenues.
The cumulative commodity pricing adjustments recorded during 2018 between the final price and the forward price at the expected settlement date, at the time of the sale, resulted in a $17 million reduction which is included within revenue.

Bozymchak impairment charges The Bozymchak CGU was subject to an impairment review following the identification of an impairment indicator, being adverse court rulings relating to the recovery of VAT incurred on the construction of the plant.
The Bozymchak operation is reflected within the East Region and Bozymchak segment.
A total impairment of $20 million was recognised, with $16 million recorded against property, plant and equipment and $4 million against mining assets.
The impairment charge reduced the carrying value of the Bozymchak operation to its estimated recoverable amount of $84 million, which was determined as its fair value less cost to sell on a discounted cash flow basis at 31 December 2018.
The risk adjusted cash flow forecasts were discounted at a post tax nominal discount rate of 12%.
The key assumptions and estimates made in determining the cash flows were the future prices of copper and gold and the discount rate.
The price estimates used were consistent with those applied by the Directors in considering whether commodity prices were an indicator of impairment, with reference to a long term copper price of $6,700 per tonne see note 3.
The fair value less cost to sell estimate is a fair value measure that is categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
As a sensitivity, a 5% reduction in the forecast copper prices could result in a further impairment of around $9 million.
This is a simple sensitivity on copper prices in isolation and does not consider any actions which management would take to mitigate the impact of a fall in commodity prices.
Additionally, a 1% increase in the discount rate could result in a further impairment of around $3 million.
East Region impairment charges The $9 million impairment against current VAT receivable was recognised on prior period VAT claims which are approaching the statute of limitation of five years and for which recovery is regarded as less than probable.
$3 million was subsequently written off against the provision on the balance sheet.
In 2017, an impairment of $4 million was recognised against items of property, plant and equipment which were no longer expected to be utilised.
Mining Projects impairment charges In 2017, following an assessment of partnering options and a review of the project, the Group determined that it would not progress the smelter project further.
$16 million incurred on the feasibility study was impaired and comprised $15 million of impairment charges against property, plant and equipment and $1 million written off against non-current VAT receivable.

There is no time restriction on the utilisation of tax losses.
Where there is sufficient certainty that a taxable profit will arise in these companies against which the losses, or interest income can be offset, deferred tax assets are recognised.

At the closing exchange rates they are $473 million 2017: $2,422 million.
The Group has not recognised a deferred tax liability in respect of the distributable reserves of its subsidiaries, as i it controls the timing of any such distribution and the temporary differences are not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future and ii under certain conditions withholding tax may not be payable.
Management believes that following a change in legislation in Kazakhstan in 2018, a significant amount of the undistributed reserves are currently not subject to withholding tax on dividends paid.

Employee benefits Vostoktsvetmet LLC provides post-retirement benefits and other long-term benefits in Kazakhstan which are partially funded.
The largest portion of the employee benefits provision is for other long-term benefits, of which the most significant is for long-term disability allowances and which exposes the Group to actuarial risks reflected in the key assumptions below.
The other benefits provided include one-time retirement grants, financial aid, dental care, medical benefits, sanatorium visits, annual financial support to pensioners and funeral aid.
The amounts recognised in the income statements are as follows: $ million 2018 2017 Employers share of current service cost Employers share of past service cost 1 Actuarial losses recognised in the year 2 Interest cost on benefits obligation 1 2 1 3 The expense is recognised in the following line items of the income statements: $ million 2018 2017 Administrative expenses 1 Finance costs 1 2 1 3 The movement in the defined employee benefits obligation is as follows: $ million 2018 2017 At 1 January 19 19 Employers share of current service cost Employers share of past service cost 1 Actuarial losses arising in the income statement 1 3 Actuarial gain recognised in other comprehensive income 1 Interest cost on benefit obligation 1 2 Benefits paid 2 3 Net exchange adjustment 1 Defined benefit obligation at 31 December 18 19 The movement in the plan asset is as follows: $ million 2018 2017 At 1 January 3 2 Contributions by employer 1 2 Benefits paid 1 2 Actuarial gain on plan assets recognised in the income statement 1 1 Fair value of plan assets at 31 December 4 3 148 148 KAZ Minerals Ann KAZ Minerals Annual R ual Repor eport and Accounts 2018 t and Accounts 2018 STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The net liability and expected settlement of the defined benefit obligation is as follows: $ million 2018 2017 Defined benefit obligation 18 19 Less: fair value of plan assets 4 3 Net liability recognised at 31 December 14 16 Current 2 2 Non-current 12 14 14 16 The net employee benefits obligation of $14 million 2017: $16 million, consists of $2 million 2017: $3 million related to postemployment benefits and $12 million 2017: $13 million related to other long-term benefits mainly for disability allowances.
The principal actuarial assumptions used in determining the employee benefit obligation are as follows: $ million 2018 2017 Discount rate at 31 December 7.4% 6.7% Future salary increases 4.1% 3.0% Medical and other related cost increases 4.1% 4.5% In addition, mortality rates were determined with reference to the 2016 mortality table of Kazakhstan as published by the Government, adjusted by life expectancy in Kazakhstan forecasted by the United Nations in 2017.
Provision for closure and site restoration $ million 2018 2017 At 1 January 67 57 Utilised 1 1 Change in estimate 3 5 Unwinding of discount 4 4 Net exchange adjustment 8 1 At 31 December 59 67 Current 1 Non-current 58 67 59 67 1 In 2018, a $3 million reduction in the provision 2017: $6 million increase was capitalised to property, plant and equipment.
In 2017, a $1 million reduction in the provision was recognised in the income statement.
The costs of decommissioning and reclamation of mines and processing facilities within the Group are based on the current obligations under Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan legislation governing closure and rehabilitation.
The provision represents the discounted values of the estimated costs to decommission and reclaim the mines based on the current estimated life of mine of each deposit.
The present value of these provisions has been calculated using discount rates of between 6.8% and 7.7% in Kazakhstan, depending on the life of each mine 2017: between 6.3% and 6.7% and 8.9% in Kyrgyzstan 2017: 8.2%.
The liability usually becomes payable after the end of the useful life of each mine, which ranges from one year to around 40 years.
Uncertainties in estimating these costs include potential changes in regulatory requirements, decommissioning and reclamation alternatives, the levels of discount and inflation rates and the estimated timing of closure and decommissioning.
The reduced estimate for the provision in 2018 arose mainly from the use of a higher discount rate used to determine the obligation.
This was partly offset by a reduction in the life of mine estimate of the existing Aktogay concentrator and related infrastructure following the approval of the Aktogay expansion project.
The project will construct an additional concentrator which will result in the existing infrastructure being decommissioned in around 25 years compared to the previous estimate of around 50 years.
The closure and rehabilitation costs for the additional concentrator will be provided for during its construction.

Financial risk management The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are liquidity risk, credit risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity price risk.
These risks arise from exposures that occur in the normal course of business and are managed by the Groups Treasury department in close cooperation with the Groups business divisions under oversight of a Treasury Committee, which is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer.
The responsibilities of the Treasury Committee include the monitoring of financial risks, management of the Groups cash resources, debt funding programmes and capital structure, approval of treasury counterparties and relevant transaction limits, and oversight of all significant treasury activities undertaken by the Group.
The Treasury department operates as a service centre to the business divisions of the Group and not as a profit centre.
A Group Treasury Policy has been approved by the Board and is periodically updated to reflect developments in the financial markets and the financial exposures facing the Group.
The Treasury Policy covers specific areas of financial risk management, in particular liquidity risk, credit risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity price risk.
The Groups Treasury Committee and the Groups Internal Audit department monitor compliance with the Treasury Policy on a regular basis.
The Groups Treasury department prepares monthly treasury reports for senior management which monitor all major financial exposures and treasury activities undertaken by the Group.
In addition, a treasury report is prepared for each Board meeting which includes a summary of the credit markets and their impact on the implementation of the Groups strategy, progress on the Groups financing initiatives and the significant financial exposures faced by the Group.
The Groups principal financial instruments comprise borrowings, cash and cash equivalents and one derivative used for risk management purposes.
The Groups borrowings, surplus liquidity and derivative financial instrument are controlled and managed centrally by the Groups Treasury department.
Liquidity retained within Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan is only held for working capital purposes.
The Groups accounting policies with regard to financial instruments are detailed in note 36 s. a Derivatives, financial instruments and risk management The Group periodically uses derivative financial instruments to manage certain exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and exchange rates.
The Groups philosophy is generally not to hedge its core revenue streams.
In periods of significant market volatility or uncertainty, the Group may use derivative instruments as a means of reducing volatility on its operating cash flows.
Limits on the size and type of any derivative hedge transaction are laid down by the Board and subject to strict internal controls.

The transition to IFRS did not have any impact on the recognition or measurement of financial assets.
There was no change in the classification and measurement of financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss and financial liabilities at amortised cost from IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018.
2 Trade receivables subject to provisional pricing include $7 million adverse adjustment 2017: $12 million favourable arising from the marked to market valuation on provisionally priced contracts at the year end.
These are measured according to quoted forward prices in a market that is not considered active, which is a level 2 valuation method within the fair value hierarchy.
3 The fair value of borrowings approximates its carrying value and is measured by discounting future cash flows using currently available interest rates for debt of similar maturities, which is a level 3 valuation method within the fair value hierarchy.
4 Excludes payments received in advance from customers, other taxes payable and MET and royalties payable that are not regarded as financial instruments.
5 Derivative financial instruments, representing a cross currency swap and interest rate swap, are measured according to inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the derivative financial instrument, either directly or indirectly, which is a level 2 valuation method within the fair value hierarchy.
The fair values of each category of financial asset and liability are not materially different from their carrying values as presented.
152 152 KAZ Minerals Ann KAZ Minerals Annual R ual Repor eport and Accounts 2018 t and Accounts 2018 STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS c Foreign exchange risk The Group has transactional currency exposures which arise from sales or purchases in currencies other than that companys functional currency.
The different functional currencies of the Groups entities are outlined in note 36 a and the currencies giving rise to this foreign currency risk are primarily the US dollar and the CNY.
Exchange gains and losses arise principally from bank deposits, trade and other receivables, certain intercompany funding balances that exist within the Group and trade and other payables.
Where possible, the Group attempts to conduct its business, maintain its monetary assets and source corporate debt capital in US dollars to minimise its exposure to other currencies.
The Group retains surplus cash balances in US dollars for capital expenditure, acquisitions, servicing of debt and returns to shareholders.
Working capital balances are maintained in a mix of US dollars and local currencies depending on the short-term requirements of the business.
Whilst there is a strong correlation between many mining input costs and the US dollar, a significant portion of the business operating costs are denominated in local currencies, particularly the Kazakhstan tenge.
Rates of exchange for these currencies relative to the US dollar could fluctuate significantly and may materially impact the profitability of the underlying operations and the net assets of the Group.
The Group generally does not enter into hedging positions in respect of its exposure to foreign currency risk.
From time to time, acquisitions and capital investments may expose the Group to movements in other currencies and the Group will consider hedging such exposures on a case-by-case basis.
To protect the Group from currency risks arising on the CDB Aktogay CNY denominated debt, the Group has entered into a CNY US$ cross currency swap.
This derivative is measured at fair value with the fair value adjustment recorded in profit and loss.
i Foreign currency exposure by balance sheet account profile The Groups exposure to foreign currency risk based on gross amounts, which include intercompany balances, is shown below.
The table sets out the Groups financial assets and liabilities which are denominated in the stated currencies but held in subsidiaries or joint operations with a different functional currency, thereby exposing the Group to transactional net currency gains and losses which are recognised in the income statement: 1 2 $ million US dollar UK sterling KZT CNY Other Total 2018 Long-term bank deposits 2 2 Trade and other receivables 387 1 388 Cash and cash equivalents 85 2 4 2 93 Borrowings 326 87 110 523 Other liabilities 27 27 Trade and other payables 159 2 1,800 4 1,965 38 87 1,800 106 1 2,032 1 $ million US dollar UK sterling KZT CNY Other Total 2017 Trade and other receivables 292 1 2 295 Cash and cash equivalents 607 1 2 1 611 Borrowings 367 90 128 585 Other liabilities 307 307 Trade and other payables 126 4 3 133 99 92 126 119 1 The US dollar net monetary liability 2017: asset arises mainly from KZT functional currency entities, except for a $116 million 2017: $139 million net monetary liability arising in a KGS functional currency entity.
2 The KZT net monetary liability arises in a US dollar functional currency entity and relates to intercompany balances at 31 December 2018.
The Group has entered into an intercompany forward exchange contract to hedge the foreign exchange exposure.

Financial risk management continued c Foreign exchange risk continued ii Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The estimated impact of a movement in foreign currencies has been determined based on the balances of financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2018 that are not denominated in the functional currency of the subsidiary or joint operation.
This sensitivity does not represent the income statement impact that would be expected from a movement in exchange rates over the course of a period of time and assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.
A 10% strengthening of the US dollar against the following currencies at 31 December would have changed profit after tax by the amounts shown below.
Impact on profit $ million 2018 2017 1 KZT 6 19 KGS 12 14 UK sterling 7 7 CNY 9 10 1 The sensitivity excludes the impact of the $1.8 billion KZT balance as this has been internally hedged as described in note 31 c i.
A 10% weakening of the US dollar against the above currencies at 31 December would have an equal and opposite effect, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.
d Commodity price risk The Groups revenues and earnings are directly impacted by fluctuations in the prices of the commodities it produces.
The Groups principal commodities copper, zinc, gold and silver are priced via reference to global metal exchanges, upon which pricing is derived from global demand and supply and influenced by macroeconomic considerations and financial investment cash flows.
The pricing of the Groups principal commodities may also include a pre-determined margin or discount depending on the terms of sales contracts.
Commodity prices, particularly those derived from global metal exchanges, may fluctuate significantly and may have a material impact on the Groups financial results.
Management closely monitors the impact of fluctuations in commodity prices on the business and uses conservative pricing assumptions and sensitivity analysis for its forecasting and investment appraisals.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the impact of commodity prices has been determined based on the balances of financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2018.
This sensitivity does not represent the income statement impact that would be expected from a movement in commodity prices over the course of a period of time.
In addition, the analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.
A 10% increase decrease in commodity prices after the period end would impact the Groups provisionally priced sales volumes and increase decrease profit after tax by the amounts shown below.
$ million 2018 2017 Copper cathodes 2 2 Copper in concentrate 13 11 Zinc 1 Gold 2 2 e Interest rate risk The Group has financial assets and liabilities which are exposed to changes in market interest rates.
Changes in interest rates primarily impact borrowings by changing their future cash flows floating rate debt or their fair value fixed rate debt and deposits.
The Groups interest rate management policy is generally to borrow and invest at floating rates of interest.
In some circumstances, an element of fixed rate funding may be considered appropriate.
Fixed rate hedging using interest rate swaps may be undertaken during periods where the Groups exposure to movements in short-term interest rates is more significant, or in periods when interest rates are perceived to be below long-term historical levels.
At 31 December 2018, the Group had an outstanding cross currency and interest rate swap on the CDB Aktogay facility of $12 million 2017: $9 million.
154 154 KAZ Minerals Ann KAZ Minerals Annual R ual Repor eport and Accounts 2018 t and Accounts 2018 STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The exposure of the Groups floating and fixed rate financial assets and liabilities to interest rate risk is as follows: At 31 December 2018 Noninterest $ million Floating rate Fixed rate bearing Total Long-term bank deposits 1 2 3 Other long-term advances 15 15 Trade and other receivables 127 127 Current investments 250 250 Cash and cash equivalents 701 453 65 1,219 Borrowings 3,453 3,453 Other liabilities 9 44 53 1 Trade and other payables 223 223 2,752 695 58 2,115 At 31 December 2017 Noninterest $ million Floating rate Fixed rate bearing Total Long-term bank deposits 2 2 Trade and other receivables 132 132 Cash and cash equivalents 1,131 660 30 1,821 Borrowings 3,877 3,877 Other liabilities 307 307 1 Trade and other payables 199 199 2,746 355 37 2,428 1 Trade and other payables excludes payments received in advance from customers, other taxes payable and MET and royalties that are not regarded as financial instruments.
The interest charged on floating rate financial liabilities is based on the relevant benchmark rate such as LIBOR.
Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the impact of interest rates has been determined based on the balances of financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2018.
This sensitivity does not represent the income statement impact that would be expected from a movement in interest rates or outstanding borrowings over the course of a period of time.
The effect on profit after tax of a 1% movement in US$ LIBOR rates, based on the year end net debt position and with all other variables held constant, is estimated to be $17 million 2017: $17 million.
f Credit risk Exposure to credit risk arises as a result of transactions in the Groups ordinary course of business and is applicable to all financial assets and commitments due from third parties.
The Group has adopted policies and procedures to control and monitor these exposures to minimise the risk of loss in the event of non-performance by counterparties.
The maximum exposure with respect to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset on the balance sheet, as outlined in note 31 b.
Credit risk relating to trade receivables Sales of metal to customers are made either on receipt of cash prior to delivery and transfer of title of goods, cash on delivery and transfer of title of goods or through letters of credit which are received from the customers bank.
Credit risk on trade receivables is limited.
The Group monitors the credit quality of its significant customers on an ongoing basis and receivables that are neither past due nor impaired are considered of good credit quality.
Cash is received prior to delivery and transfer of title of the goods for sales to European customers.
Sales to Chinese customers are predominantly made under letters of credit which are obtained prior to delivery and transfer of title of the goods.
For sales made to Chinese customers without letters of credit, cash is received prior to delivery and transfer of title of the goods.
Sales to European and Chinese customers are subject to provisional pricing and then final pricing adjustments.
The Group is therefore exposed to the residual final pricing adjustment for each sales transaction although such amounts are not considered material in the context of the Groups overall revenues.
The impairment requirements of IFRS 9 relating to expected credit losses do not apply to the Groups trade receivables subject to provisional pricing, which are measured at fair value through profit or loss.
com 155 155 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Year ended 31 December 2018 31.
Financial risk management continued f Credit risk continued Credit risk relating to trade receivables continued The East Region may at times provide certain social services to municipal authorities in the communities in which it operates as part of its contractual obligations under its subsoil licences.
For most receivable balances due from municipal authorities, if any, expected credit losses are recognised on a forward looking basis taking into account past payment history.
The Group applies a simplified approach to measure the loss allowance for trade receivables not subject to provisional pricing and possible default events have been considered over the lifetime of those receivables.
The effect of this assessment has not resulted in a material revision in the loss allowance compared to the prior year.
i Concentrations for trade receivables by geographical regions At 31 December 2018, one customer 2017: four customers accounted for 87% 2017: 90% of the trade and other receivables balance.
By 15 February 2019, 82% 14 February 2018: 75% of year-end balances due from these customers had been received in full.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at 31 December by geographic areas was: $ million 2018 2017 Europe 4 3 China 119 120 Kazakhstan 4 9 127 132 Of the above, $114 million relates to trade receivables measured at fair value through profit or loss and $13 million is measured at amortised cost 2017: $127 million and $5 million respectively.
ii Impairment losses for trade receivables measured at amortised cost The ageing of trade receivables measured at amortised cost at 31 December, was: 2018 2017 $ million Gross Impairment Gross Impairment Not past due 13 2 Past due 0-90 days 1 Past due 91-180 days 1 Past due 181-270 days 1 More than 270 days 1 1 1 1 14 1 6 1 The movement in the loss allowance in respect of trade receivables measured at amortised cost was as follows: $ million 2018 2017 1 At 1 January 1 1 Charged to income statement At 31 December 1 1 1 There was no change in the loss allowance at 31 December 2017 as a result of initial application of IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018. Credit risk related to cash and cash equivalents and current investments Credit risk relating to the Groups other financial assets, principally cash and cash equivalents and current investments, arises from the potential default of counterparties.
Credit risk arising from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the Groups Treasury Committee in accordance with a Board approved Treasury Policy.
The Groups cash management policies emphasise security and liquidity ahead of investment return.
Investments of cash and deposits are made only with approved counterparties of high credit worthiness and within credit limits assigned to each counterparty.
Exposures are measured against maximum credit limits assigned to each approved counterparty to ensure credit risk is effectively managed.
The limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate any financial loss through potential counterparty failure.
In order to manage counterparty and liquidity risk, surplus funds within the Group are held predominantly in the UK and funds remaining in Kazakhstan are utilised mainly for working capital purposes.
The Group must maintain a level of cash and deposits in Kazakhstan with local branches of international financial institutions and well established local Kazakhstan banks.
The surplus funds in the UK are held primarily with major European and US financial institutions with minimum ratings of Standard & Poors Aand Moodys A3 and AAA rated liquidity funds.
These limits are reviewed on a regular basis to take account of developments in financial markets and updated accordingly.
Expected credit losses take into account the maturities of deposits and changes in observable inputs, such as the spread on credit default swaps, which may indicate changes in the probability of potential default of counterparties.
There have been no significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition and possible default events have been considered over a period of 12 months after the reporting date.
At 31 December 2018, there were no expected credit losses in respect of cash and cash equivalents and current investments 2017: none.
156 156 KAZ Minerals Ann KAZ Minerals Annual R ual Repor eport and Accounts 2018 t and Accounts 2018 STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS g Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between availability of funding and maximising investment return on its liquid resources through the use of liquid cash investments and debt facilities of varying maturities.
Management regularly reviews the funding requirements of the Group in selecting appropriate maturities for its liquid cash investments.
The Groups policy is to centralise debt and surplus cash balances to the maximum extent possible.
Maturity of financial liabilities The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities, which will be settled on a gross basis, into relevant maturity groups based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.
Less than 3 to 12 1 to 5 More than $ million On demand 3 months months years 5 years Total 2018 1 Borrowings 293 460 2,218 1,465 4,436 2 Other liabilities 44 2 4 4 54 3 Trade and other payables 140 140 Derivative instrument 12 12 477 462 2,234 1,469 4,642 Less than 3 to 12 1 to 5 More than $ million On demand 3 months months years 5 years Total 2017 1 Borrowings 269 428 2,436 1,845 4,978 2 Other liabilities 250 50 7 3 310 3 Trade and other payables 124 124 Derivative instrument 9 9 643 478 2,452 1,848 5,421 1 Borrowings include expected future interest payments based on contracted margins and prevailing LIBOR rates at the balance sheet date.
2 Other liabilities are presented on an undiscounted gross basis.
3 Trade and other payables exclude payments received in advance from customers, other taxes payable and MET and royalties that are not regarded as financial instruments and interest payable which is reflected within borrowings.
The interest payable on borrowings in 2017 was reflected within Trade and other payables in the 2017 financial statements.
This has been restated to be consistent with the 2018 disclosures.
h Capital management The over-riding objectives of the Groups capital management policy are to safeguard and support the business as a going concern through the commodity cycle, to maximise returns to shareholders either through dividends or share buy-backs and benefits to other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure in order to reduce the Groups cost of capital.
At 31 December 2018, total capital employed which comprises equity holders funds, non-controlling interests and borrowings of the Group amounted to $4,507 million, compared to $4,875 million at 31 December 2017.
Total capital employed is the measure that is used by the Directors in managing capital.
At 31 December 2018, the Group is in a net debt position of $1,986 million 2017: $2,056 million.
The Group seeks to maintain a level of net debt which does not exceed two times normalised EBITDA through the commodity cycle.
This ratio is reviewed in conjunction with market conditions and prevailing commodity prices in order to ensure an efficient capital structure that is balanced against the risks of carrying excessive leverage.
The Board maintains the flexibility to suspend the ratio to allow for higher gearing during periods of major capital investment.
The Group does not have a target debt equity ratio.
Included within the current debt facilities are financial covenants related to maximum borrowing levels of the Group determined by reference to net debt to EBITDA and debt to equity ratios, minimum tangible net worth of individual Group entities and consolidated gross assets to gross liabilities ratios, for which compliance certificates are produced.
All financial covenants were fully complied with during the year and up to the date of approval of the financial statements.
com 157 157 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Year ended 31 December 2018 32.
Commitments and contingencies a Legal claims In the ordinary course of business, the Group is subject to legal actions and complaints.
The Directors believe that the ultimate liability, if any, arising from such actions or complaints will not have a materially adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the Group.
As of 31 December 2018 and 2017, the Group was not involved in any significant legal proceedings, including arbitration, which may crystallise a material financial loss for the Group.
b Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan taxation contingencies i Inherent uncertainties in interpreting tax legislation The Group is subject to uncertainties relating to judgements used in the determination of its tax liabilities and the timing of recovery of tax refunds.
Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan tax legislation and practice are in a state of continuous development and, therefore, are subject to varying interpretations and changes which may be applied retrospectively.
The Directors interpretation of tax legislation as applied to the transactions and activities of the Group may not coincide with that of the tax authorities.
As a result, the tax authorities may challenge transactions and the Group may be assessed with additional taxes, penalties and fines or refused refunds, which could have a material adverse effect on the Groups financial performance or position.
ii Tax audits Historical tax years relating to various companies within the Group remain open for inspection during a future tax audit.
Consequently, the tax figures recorded in the financial statements for these years may be subject to change.
The tax authorities in Kazakhstan are able to raise additional tax assessments for five years after the end of the relevant tax period in respect of all taxes, except for excess profits tax.
In respect of excess profits tax, they are able to raise additional tax assessments for five years after the expiration of the terms of the relevant subsoil contract.
In Kyrgyzstan, tax authorities are able to raise additional tax assessments for a period of six years after the end of the relevant tax period.
iii Transfer pricing The Kazakhstan transfer pricing legislation provides clarity on various aspects of transfer pricing, including the use of LME and LBMA prices as the basis of market prices, quotation periods to be used for the sale and purchase of traded commodities and the acceptability of discounts with reference to LME LBMA prices when transacting in traded commodities.
Notwithstanding these, the Directors have recognised a provision for the amounts that represent the Directors best estimate of the probable cash payments that will be required to settle any residual transfer pricing exposures based on the Directors interpretation of the transfer pricing legislation and the prevailing status of discussions with the tax authorities.
The risk remains that the tax authorities may take a different position with regard to the interpretation of the transfer pricing legislation, and amendments thereof, and the outcome of discussions with the Kazakhstan tax authorities may be materially different from the Directors expectations.
iv Possible additional tax liabilities The Directors believe that the Group is in substantial compliance with the tax laws in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan and any contractual terms entered into that relate to tax which affect its operations and that, consequently, no additional material tax liabilities will arise.
However, due to the reasons set out above, the risk remains that the relevant tax authorities may take a differing position with regard to the interpretation of contractual provisions or tax law inclusive of corporate income taxes, value added tax and subsoil use legislation.
The resulting effect of any positions taken by the tax authorities that differ from those of the Directors is that additional tax liabilities may arise or the timing of refunds due may take longer than expected or may be refused.
Therefore it is not practical for the Directors to estimate the financial effect of the timing of tax refunds and of additional tax liabilities, if any, together with any associated penalties and charges for which the Group may be liable that may arise from different interpretations applied by the tax authorities.
The Directors do not believe that there are material uncertain tax positions at 31 December 2018. c Environmental contingencies Environmental regulations, including emissions legislation, in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan are continually evolving.
The outcome of environmental regulations under proposal or any future environmental legislation cannot be reliably estimated at present.
As obligations are determined, they will be provided for in accordance with the Groups accounting policies.
The Directors believe that there are no significant liabilities under current legislation not accrued for in the Groups consolidated financial statements, however, they recognise that the environmental regulators in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan may take a differing position with regard to the interpretation of environmental legislation.
The resulting effect is that additional environmental liabilities may arise however, due to the range of uncertainties, it is not practical for the Directors to estimate any further potential exposures.
The provision that has been made for costs associated with restoration and abandonment of mine sites upon depletion of deposits see note 26, is based upon the estimation of the Groups specialists or external consultants.
Where events occur that change the level of estimated future costs for these activities, the provision will be adjusted accordingly.
d Use of subsoil and exploration rights In Kazakhstan, all subsoil reserves belong to the State, with the Ministry of Investments and Development the Ministry granting exploration and production rights to third party bodies.
Subsoil and exploration rights are not granted in perpetuity and any renewal must be agreed before the expiration of the relevant contract or licence.
These rights may be terminated by the Ministry if the Group does not satisfy its contractual obligations.
In January 2019, the Ministry approved the extension of the Koksay exploration licence to June 2021.
In Kyrgyzstan, all subsoil reserves belong to the State, with the State Agency for Geology and Mineral Resources of the Kyrgyz Republic the competent body granting exploration and production rights to third party bodies.
These rights may be terminated by the competent body if the Company does not satisfy its contractual obligations.

c Subsidiaries and joint operations Details of investments in subsidiaries and joint operations are disclosed in note 37 k. 34.
Share-based payment plans The Companys share-based payment plans consist of a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, and a Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSBP.
The total expense for the year ended 31 December 2018 arising from these plans was $3 million 2017: $3 million.
The total number of shares outstanding under these schemes as at 31 December 2018 was 2,880,433 2017: 3,756,390.
The total number of shares exercisable under these schemes as at 31 December 2018 was 852,602 2017: 1,040,431.
These plans are discretionary benefits offered by the Company for the benefit of its employees.
The main purpose is to increase the interest of the employees in KAZ Minerals long-term business goals and performance through share ownership.
They represent incentives for employees future performance and commitment to be aligned to the goals of the Group.
For future awards, the Company may issue new shares or use shares held as treasury by the Company, as approved by shareholders, rather than purchase the shares in the open market through the Employee Benefit Trust.

Post balance sheet events a Baimskaya copper project On 22 January 2019, the Group announced the Initial Completion of the acquisition of the Baimskaya copper project in the Chukotka region of Russia.
The consideration due at Initial Completion was $436 million in cash and 22.3 million new KAZ Minerals shares, which were allotted to the Vendor.
$50 million of the $436 million cash consideration has been withheld pending the release of a guarantee agreement made by the acquired entity which is the legal owner of the Baimskaya licence.
The final cash payment of $50 million is expected to be settled in 2019.
The 22.3 million shares are subject to a three-year lock-up period ending on the third anniversary of Initial Completion.
Deferred Consideration of $225 million for the remaining interest is payable in 21.0 million shares, subject to the achievement of certain Project Delivery Conditions, including a pre-determined level of throughput and development of infrastructure by the Russian state.
To the extent these conditions are not met or waived by the Group and therefore not settled in shares, the Deferred Consideration will become payable in cash on 31 March 2029.
In assessing the accounting for the acquisition, consideration was given to whether the copper project consisted of an integrated set of inputs and processes as defined under IFRS 3 Business Combinations that could be used to generate an output.
As the copper project is in the exploration stage prior to feasibility, the work undertaken to date was considered to be an assessment of its inputs rather than the existence of inputs and processes capable of generating an output.
As such, the acquisition will be accounted for as an asset acquisition, not a business combination, with the majority of the value paid being shown as a mining licence within mining assets.
As part of the consideration is settled in shares, the transaction falls within the scope of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
The Initial Consideration of $675 million includes 22.3 million KAZ Minerals PLC shares valued at $239 million, which will be recognised as an increase in share capital of around $6 million and share premium of $233 million.
The Deferred Consideration of $225 million will also be included within equity, representing the Groups ability to settle this amount through the issue of 21.0 million shares.
The Group obtained a 75% equity stake in the project on Initial Completion, however a non-controlling interest will not be recognised as the remaining 25% will be purchased through Deferred Consideration.
b Dividends On 20 February the Directors of the Company recommended a final dividend for 2018 of 6.0 USc per share.
Summary of significant accounting policies The following significant accounting policies have been applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
These accounting policies have been consistently applied across the Group.
a Foreign currency translation The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined as the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are initially recorded at the functional currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange gains and losses on settlement of foreign currency transactions translated at the rate prevailing at the date of the transactions, or the translation of monetary assets and liabilities at period end exchange rates, are taken to the income statement.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies and that result in the recognition of non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of each transaction.
The functional currency of the Company, the Groups main financing and holding companies and KAZ Minerals Sales Limited is the US dollar as the majority of the operating activities are conducted in US dollars.
The functional currency of the Groups Kazakh entities and their UK based project finance companies, as applicable, is the Kazakhstan tenge, with the Bozymchak functional currency being the Kyrgyz som.
On consolidation, income statements of subsidiaries are translated into US dollars, at average rates of exchange.
Balance sheet items are translated into US dollars at period end exchange rates.
Exchange differences on the retranslation are taken to a separate component of equity.
The following foreign exchange rates against the US dollar have been used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements: 31 December 2018 31 December 2017 Spot Average Spot Average Kazakhstan tenge 384.20 344.71 332.33 326.00 Kyrgyz som 69.85 68.84 68.84 68.94 UK pound sterling 0.78 0.75 0.74 0.78 160 160 KAZ Minerals Ann KAZ Minerals Annual R ual Repor eport and Accounts 2018 t and Accounts 2018 STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS b Business combinations and joint operations The Group applies the purchase method to account for business combinations.
On the acquisition of a subsidiary, the purchase consideration is allocated to the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities identifiable net assets on the basis of fair values at the date of acquisition.
Those mining rights, mineral reserves and resources that are able to be reliably valued are recognised in the assessment of fair values on acquisition.
Other potential reserves, resources and mineral rights, for which, in the Directors opinion, values cannot be reliably determined, are not recognised.
The consideration transferred cost of acquisition is the aggregate of: a the fair values at the date of exchange, of assets transferred, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group: and b the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred in the income statement.
When the cost of acquisition exceeds the fair value attributable to the Groups share of the identifiable net assets, the difference is treated as purchased goodwill.
If the fair value attributable to the Groups share of the identifiable net assets exceeds the fair value of the consideration, the Group reassesses whether it has correctly identified and measured the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and recognises any additional assets or liabilities that are identified in that review.
If that excess remains after reassessment, the Group recognises the resulting gain in the income statement on the acquisition date.
When a subsidiary is acquired in a number of stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirers previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through the income statement.
Joint operations A joint arrangement is an arrangement in which two or more parties have joint control.
Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control such that decisions about the relevant activities of the arrangement those that significantly affect the Groups returns require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
A joint operation is a joint arrangement in which the parties that share joint control have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement.
This includes situations where the parties benefit from the joint activity through a share of the output, rather than by receiving a share of the results of trading.
Joint operations are proportionally consolidated such that the Groups share of its assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses are included within the consolidated financial statements.
On consolidation, transactions and balances, including any profit earned, between the Group and the joint operation are eliminated, to the extent of its interest.
c Property, plant and equipment i Initial measurement Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing it into working condition for its intended use.
The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads.
Costs which are necessarily incurred and revenues earned whilst commissioning new assets, in the period before they are capable of operating in the manner intended by management, are capitalised.
For mining and processing facility assets, this requires judgement based on the facts and circumstances of the operation and is considered to be when these assets have reached commercial levels of production.
Commercial production represents production in reasonable commercial quantities and refers to the level of output and not profit or loss and is generally considered to have been achieved when the operation is consistently operating at over 60% of its intended capacity for a sustained period of around three months.
ii Depreciation The cost of each item of property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life to its estimated residual value.
Each items estimated useful life has due regard to both its own physical life limitations and the present assessment of economically recoverable reserves of the mine property at which the item is located.
Estimates of remaining useful lives and residual values are made on a regular basis for all mine buildings, plant and equipment, with annual reassessments for major items.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the individual asset to its estimated residual value.
Depreciation commences on the date the assets are ready for use within the business.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
The expected useful lives are as follows: Buildings 15-40 years Plant and equipment 4-25 years Other 3-15 years iii Construction in progress Assets in the course of construction are capitalised as a separate component of property, plant and equipment.
On completion, the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category.
Construction in progress is not depreciated.

Repairs and maintenance expenditure, including major overhauls which are infrequent, are capitalised if additional future economic benefits will arise from the expenditure.
All other repairs and maintenance expenditure is recognised in the income statement as incurred.
v Leased assets Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor and not transferred to the Group are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
d Mining assets i Mineral licences and properties Costs of acquiring mineral licences and properties are capitalised on the balance sheet in the year in which they are incurred.
Costs associated with a start-up period for significant developments are capitalised during the commissioning period development expenditure where the asset is incapable of operating at normal levels without a commissioning period.
Mineral licences and properties are amortised over the remaining life of the mine using a unit of production method.
The unit of production method is the ratio of commodity production in the period to the estimated quantities of commercial reserves over the life of the mine using proven and probable mineral reserves as determined by the JORC Code on an annual basis based on the estimated economically recoverable reserves to which they relate.
Changes in estimates, which affect unit of production calculations, are accounted for prospectively.
ii Mine development costs Mine development costs are incurred to obtain access to proved reserves or mineral-bearing ore deposits and to provide facilities for extracting, lifting and storing minerals.
Such costs are, upon commencement of production, amortised over the remaining life of the mine using a unit of production method.
iii Mine stripping costs Mine stripping costs incurred in order to access the mineral-bearing ore deposits are deferred prior to the commencement of production.
Such costs are amortised over the remaining life of the mine using a unit of production method.
The ongoing mining and development of the open-pit mines is generally performed via a succession of individual phases.
The costs of extracting material from an open-pit mine are generally allocated between ore and waste stripping in proportion to the tonnes of waste and ore material extracted the stripping ratio.
The waste stripping costs are generally absorbed into inventory and expensed as that inventory is processed and sold.
Where the stripping costs relate to a waste stripping campaign which is expected to provide improved access to an identifiable component of the ore body, the costs of removing waste in order to improve access to that part of the ore body will be capitalised within mining assets.
The capitalised costs will then be amortised in a systematic manner over the reserves that directly benefit from the specific stripping activity.
Changes to the stripping ratio arising from changes to mine plans or ore reserves are regarded as changes in estimates and are accounted for prospectively.
iv Exploration and evaluation costs Exploration and evaluation expenditure for each area of interest once the legal right to explore has been acquired, other than that acquired through a purchase transaction, is carried forward as an asset, within mining assets, provided that one of the following conditions is met: such costs are expected to be recouped through successful exploration and development of the area of interest or, alternatively, by its sale.
exploration and evaluation activities in the area of interest have not yet reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the existence or otherwise of economically recoverable reserves, and active and significant operations in relation to the area are continuing.
Exploration expenditure which fails to meet at least one of the conditions outlined above is written off.
Administrative and general expenses relating to exploration and evaluation activities are expensed as incurred.
Identifiable exploration and evaluation assets acquired in a purchase transaction are recognised as assets at their cost, or fair value if purchased as part of a business combination.
Exploration assets are reassessed on a regular basis and these costs are carried forward provided that at least one of the conditions outlined above is met.
Exploration and evaluation assets transferred to mine development costs when attributable to producing interests are amortised on a unit of production basis over the remaining life of the associated mine.

If such indication exists, the Group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount.
d Mining assets i Calculation of recoverable amount i Mineral licences and properties The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and fair value less costs to sell.

In determining fair value expenditure where the asset is incapable of operating at normal levels without a commissioning period.
Mineral licences and properties less cost to sell, consideration will be given to whether the value of the asset or CGU can be determined from an active market e. g. are amortised over the remaining life of the mine using a unit of production method.

Where this is not determinable, fair value less costs to sell for a CGU is usually estimated with reference to a discounted over the life of the mine using proven and probable mineral reserves as determined by the JORC Code on an annual basis based on the cash flow model, similar to the method used for value in use, but may include estimates of future production, revenues, costs and capital estimated economically recoverable reserves to which they relate.
Changes in estimates, which affect unit of production calculations, are expenditure not currently included in the life of mine plan.
Additionally, cash flow estimates include the impact of tax and are discounted accounted for prospectively.
An estimate made on this basis is classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
ii Mine development costs ii Reversals of impairment Mine development costs are incurred to obtain access to proved reserves or mineral-bearing ore deposits and to provide facilities for A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets extracting, lifting and storing minerals.
Such costs are, upon commencement of production, amortised over the remaining life of the mine recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
If this is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its using a unit of production method.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying iii Mine stripping costs amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised for the asset Mine stripping costs incurred in order to access the mineral-bearing ore deposits are deferred prior to the commencement of in prior years.

Cost includes all costs incurred in the normal course of business in and ore material extracted the stripping ratio.
The waste stripping costs are generally absorbed into inventory and expensed as that bringing each product to its present location and condition.
Cost is determined on the following bases: inventory is processed and sold.
Where the stripping costs relate to a waste stripping campaign which is expected to provide improved Raw materials and consumables are valued at cost on a first-in, first-out FIFO basis: and access to an identifiable component of the ore body, the costs of removing waste in order to improve access to that part of the ore body Work in progress and finished goods are valued at the cost of production, including the appropriate proportion of depreciation, labour will be capitalised within mining assets.
The capitalised costs will then be amortised in a systematic manner over the reserves that directly and overheads based on normal operating capacity.

Summary of significant accounting policies continued h Cash and cash equivalents continued During 2018, the FRC queried the appropriateness of the Groups accounting policy for cash and cash equivalents in the 2017 Annual Reports and Accounts.
In doing so, the FRC queried whether the term deposits with original maturity of three to 12 months disclosed as $350 million in note 31 g of the 2017 financial statements, had the required characteristics to be considered as cash and cash equivalents under IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows.
Following the change in the Groups conditions and with regard to the FRCs view, deposits with original maturities in excess of three months are prospectively classified as current investments.
Short-term deposits with a maturity in excess of three months at inception were $250 million at 31 December 2018.
See note 21. i Employee benefits i Long-term employee benefits The Groups entities located in Kazakhstan remit contributions to State managed pension plans on behalf of its employees.
Contributions to be paid by the Group are withheld from employees salaries based on prescribed rates and are recognised as part of the salary expense in the income statement as incurred.
The Groups defined benefit plans, including the death and disability plans for current and former employees, are accounted for in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits Revised, such that the plan liabilities and assets are measured by actuarial valuations using the projected unit credit method.
The future benefit that employees have earned is discounted to determine the present value.
The discount rate is determined by reference to the US Treasury bond rate adjusted for country specific inflation and risk.
The Treasury bond used approximates the average maturity profile of the Groups benefit obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified independent actuary on a rotational basis.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise for defined benefit plans not considered to be other long-term employee benefits.
In respect of other long-term employee benefit plans, namely the Groups disability benefits obligation, all actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
The expense in relation to all long-term employee benefits is charged to the income statement so as to match the cost of providing these benefits to the period of service of the employees.
ii Share-based payments Certain employees of the Group receive part of their remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares equity-settled transactions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured at fair value at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value of share awards with marketrelated vesting conditions is determined using the Monte Carlo method and the fair value at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each balance sheet date up to the vesting date at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the actual outcome of awards which have vested.
No adjustment is made to the fair value after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or not exercised.
j Own shares Own equity instruments which are re-acquired either by the Employee Benefit Trust for the purposes of the Groups employee sharebased payment plans or by the Company as part of any share buy-back programmes are recognised at cost and deducted from equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Groups own equity instruments.
Any difference between the carrying amount and the consideration paid to acquire such equity instruments is recognised within equity.
k Social responsibility costs The Group contributes towards social programmes for the benefit of the local community at large.
The Groups contributions towards these programmes are expensed to the income statement at the point when the Group is committed to the expenditure.
l Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.

The Groups products are priced with reference to LME, for copper and zinc, or LBMA, for gold and silver, market projected unit credit method.
The prices achieved for the sale of copper, zinc, gold and silver in concentrate are reduced by contractually determined treatment and refining charges TC RCs, which are usually agreed annually in advance and with reference to market rates.
The Treasury bond used approximates the Revenue is recognised when the Group has satisfied its contractual performance obligations to customers, which generally require the average maturity profile of the Groups benefit obligations.

Most of the sales agreements for the Groups mineral products are provisionally priced, whereby the selling price is subject to final adjustment at the end of a quotation period typically one to three months, based on the average LME LBMA market price for the ii Share-based payments period stipulated in the contract.
At each reporting date, provisionally priced metal sales are marked-to-market using forward prices Certain employees of the Group receive part of their remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby aligned with the quotation period up to a maximum of two months, with any gains and losses recorded in revenue in the income employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares equity-settled transactions.

o Finance costs Any difference between the carrying amount and the consideration paid to acquire such equity instruments is recognised within equity.
Finance costs comprise interest on borrowings which are not capitalised under the borrowing costs accounting policy see note 36 p below, and the unwinding of interest costs on provisions.
The Groups contributions towards p Borrowing costs these programmes are expensed to the income statement at the point when the Group is committed to the expenditure.
Borrowing costs directly relating to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying capital project under construction are capitalised and added to the project cost during construction until such time as the assets are considered substantially ready for their l Provisions intended use, i. e. when they are capable of commercial production.
Where funds are borrowed specifically to finance a project, the Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, and it is probable amount capitalised represents the actual borrowing costs incurred.

Summary of significant accounting policies continued p Borrowing costs continued Borrowing costs that represent avoidable costs not related to the financing arrangements of the development projects and are therefore not directly attributable to the construction of these respective assets are expensed in the period as incurred.
These borrowing costs generally arise where the funds are drawn down under the Groups financing facilities, whether specific or general, which are in excess of the near term cash flow requirements of the development projects for which the financing is intended, and the funds are drawn down ahead of any contractual obligation to do so.
q Income tax Income tax for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax expense is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: those arising on the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit: and investments in subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised and in combination with other deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
r Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved by shareholders.
Dividends receivable are recognised when the Groups right to receive payment is established.
s Financial instruments The Group recognises financial assets and liabilities on its balance sheet when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
i Financial assets Classification and initial measurement Financial assets within the scope of IFRS 9 are classified as financial assets at amortised cost, fair value through profit or loss or fair value through other comprehensive income.
The Group determines this classification at initial recognition depending on the business model for managing the financial asset and the contractual terms of the cash flows.
The Groups financial assets include cash and cash equivalents, current investments, trade and other receivables, long-term bank deposits and derivative financial instruments.
When financial assets are initially recognised, they are measured at fair value being the consideration given or received plus directly attributable transaction costs.
Any gain or loss at initial recognition is recognised in the income statement.
The Groups financial assets measured at amortised cost are held for the collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows have specified dates and represent solely payments of principal and interest, such as cash and cash equivalents, current investments or trade receivables that are not based on listed commodity metal prices or subject to provisional pricing.
The Groups financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss are those financial assets where the contractual cash flows do not represent solely payments of principal and interest, such as trade receivables which are priced with reference to LME or LBMA prices and are subject to provisional pricing.
Subsequent measurement Financial assets held for the collection of contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest and classified as amortised cost are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method EIR.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR.
The EIR amortisation is included in finance income in the income statement.
Allowance for impairment is estimated on a case-by-case basis.
166 166 KAZ Minerals Ann KAZ Minerals Annual R ual Repor eport and Accounts 2018 t and Accounts 2018 STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Almost all sales agreements for the Groups mineral products are provisionally priced based on the LME LBMA market price for the relevant quotation period stipulated in the contract refer to the revenue accounting policy note 36 m. At each reporting date, provisionally priced metal sales are marked to market using the relevant forward prices aligned with the quotation period.
A gain or loss on a trade receivable which is priced based on listed metal prices, being a financial asset measured at fair value through profit or loss, is recognised within revenue in the income statement in the period in which it arises.
Derecognition A financial asset is derecognised when the Group loses control over the contractual rights that comprise that asset.
This occurs when the rights are realised, expire or are surrendered.
Impairment of financial assets The Group assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses that might arise on financial assets measured at amortised cost.
This assessment considers the probability of a default event occurring that could result in the expected cash flows due from a counterparty falling short of those contractually agreed.
Expected credit losses are estimated for default events possible over the lifetime of a financial asset measured at amortised cost.
However, where the financial asset is not a trade receivable measured at amortised cost and there have been no significant increases in that financial assets credit risk since initial recognition, expected credit losses are estimated for default events possible within 12 months of the reporting date.
ii Financial liabilities Classification and initial measurement Financial liabilities within the scope of IFRS 9 are classified as financial liabilities at amortised cost or fair value through profit or loss.
The Group determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition.
The Groups financial liabilities include trade and other payables, other liabilities and borrowings which are classified as amortised cost: and a derivative financial instrument which is classified as fair value through profit or loss.
Trade payables may be designated and measured at fair value through profit or loss when doing so eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities on a different basis.
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value while financial liabilities at amortised cost additionally include directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent measurement Trade and other payables, borrowings and other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method after initial recognition.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement through the EIR amortisation process.
The EIR amortisation is included in finance costs in the income statement.
A gain or loss on a financial liability measured at fair value through profit or loss is recognised in the income statement in the period in which it arises.
Where the Group enters into derivative contracts that are not hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by IFRS 9, these are carried on the balance sheet at fair value with subsequent changes recognised in finance income or finance costs in the income statement.
Derecognition A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
When an existing financial liability is replaced by another on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the income statement.
iii Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is an enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
iv Fair value of financial instruments At each reporting date, the fair value of financial instruments that are traded in active markets is determined by reference to quoted market prices, without any deduction for transaction costs.
For financial instruments not traded in an active market, the fair value is determined using appropriate valuation techniques.
Such techniques may include using recent arms length market transactions, reference to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation models.

Company financial statements continued d Company accounting policies continued Principal accounting policies continued The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs as adopted by the EU requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, following implementation of these standards, actual results may differ from those estimates.
Non-current investments Non-current investments are held at cost.
The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable.
If any such indication of impairment exists, the Company makes an estimate of its recoverable amount.
Where the carrying amount of an investment exceeds its recoverable amount, the investment is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
Any positive change in the amount or timing of estimated future cash flows or in the discount rate such that fair value of the Companys investments increases, consideration will be given to whether previously recognised impairments should be reversed.
e Company non-current investments $ million 2018 2017 Cost At 1 January 7,830 7,830 Additions 1 At 31 December 7,831 7,830 Provision for impairment At 1 January 3,638 4,478 Impairment reversals 840 At 31 December 3,638 3,638 Net book value 4,193 4,192 i KAZ Minerals Investments Limited The Company reviewed the carrying value of its investments to determine whether there were any indicators of impairment.
This assessment requires judgement, taking into account the future operational and financial plans of the underlying investment, commodity prices and cost estimates.
The Group uses a consistent methodology for impairment indicator reviews across its cash generating units.
This methodology did not identify any impairment indicators in respect of the carrying value of the Companys investments and no impairment review was performed.
Additionally, no indicators of impairment reversal were identified.
The reduction in the Companys share price in August 2018, was not found to be driven by fundamental changes to the long-term value of the existing operations.
In 2017, the continued ramp up to design capacity of the Bozshakol sulphide and Aktogay oxide plants, the achievement of commercial production of the Bozshakol clay and Aktogay sulphide plants, the improvement in the near term copper prices, the successful refinancing and increasing of the PXF financing facility and the Groups decision to proceed with the Aktogay expansion project, led to a reassessment of the carrying value of the Companys previously impaired investments.
The estimated recoverable amount of the Groups investment exceeded its carrying value and a reversal of impairment of $840 million was recognised.
The recoverable amount was supported by a range of internal valuations that were prepared using discounted cash flow models using assumptions relating to longterm pricing and other assumptions including inflation, cost estimates and production profiles based on the Groups expectations of the assets.
The revised carrying value of the Companys investment was also supported by a range of recent equity analyst discounted cash flow valuations.
Changes in the outlook to commodity prices as well as any future changes in mine production plans, could impact the recoverable amount of the investment.
The determination of the fair value less costs to sell, as estimated in 2017, was subject to the key sources of estimation uncertainty as disclosed in note 3. ii KAZ Minerals Services Limited In 2018, additional investment of $1 million 2017: $nil relating to capital contributions made by the Company to KAZ Minerals Services Limited was recognised in respect of the share awards issued by the Company on behalf of employees of KAZ Minerals Services Limited.
iii Other companies The Company holds its interests in other subsidiaries in the Group either directly or via intermediate holding companies for those businesses in Central Asia.
