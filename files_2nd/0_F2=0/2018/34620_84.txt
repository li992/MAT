NOTE 10 Fair Value Measurements, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and Financial Risk Fair Value Measurements Fair value is defined as the amount that would be received for selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and is measured using inputs in one of the following three categories: Level 1 measurements are based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access.
Valuation of these items does not entail a significant amount of judgment.
Level 2 measurements are based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or market data other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities.
Level 3 measurements are based on unobservable data that are supported by little or no market activity and are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
Considerable judgment may be required in interpreting market data used to develop the estimates of fair value.
Accordingly, certain estimates of fair value presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current or future market exchange.

 Valuation of Goodwill and Trademarks As of July 31, 2018, we performed our annual goodwill and trademark impairment reviews and we determined there was no impairment for goodwill or trademarks.
During 2017, we made a decision to strategically realign our business in Australia, which includes reducing capacity in P&O Cruises Australia.
We performed discounted cash flow analyses and determined that the estimated fair values of the P&O Cruises Australia reporting unit and its trademark no longer exceeded their 25 Annex 1 DLC Annual Report carrying values.
We recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $38 million and a trademark impairment charge of $50 million for the year ended November 30, 2017.
The determination of our reporting unit goodwill and trademark fair values includes numerous assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties.
The principal assumptions, all of which are considered Level 3 inputs, used in our cash flow analyses consisted of: Forecasted operating results, including net revenue yields and net cruise costs including fuel prices Capacity changes and the expected rotation of vessels into or out of each of these cruise brands, including decisions about the allocation of new ships amongst brands, the transfer of ships between brands and the timing of ship dispositions Weighted-average cost of capital of market participants, adjusted for the risk attributable to the geographic regions in which these cruise brands operate Capital expenditures, proceeds from forecasted dispositions of ships and terminal values We believe that we have made reasonable estimates and judgments.
Changes in the conditions or circumstances may result in a need to recognize an additional impairment charge.

Primarily as a result of our decision during 2017 to strategically realign our business in Australia, which includes reducing capacity in P&O Cruises Australia, we performed undiscounted cash flow analyses on certain ships as of July 31, 2017.
Based on these undiscounted cash flow analyses, we determined that some of these ships had net carrying values that exceeded their estimated undiscounted future cash flows.
We estimated the July 31, 2017 fair values of these ships based on their discounted cash flows and comparable market transactions.
We then compared these estimated fair values to the net carrying values and, as a result, we recognized $162 million and $142 million of ship impairment charges in the NAA and EA segments, respectively, for the year end 26 November 30, 2017.
The impairment is included in other ship operating expenses in our consolidated statements of income.
The principal assumptions used in our analyses consisted of forecasted future operating results, including net revenue yields and net cruise costs including fuel prices, estimated ship sale proceeds, and changes in strategy, including decisions about the transfer of ships between brands.
All principal assumptions are considered Level 3 inputs.

At November 30, 2018, this cross currency swap settles through September 2019. b At November 30, 2017, we had foreign currency derivatives consisting of foreign currency zero cost collars that are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges for a portion of our euro-denominated shipbuilding payments.
c We have euro interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges whereby we receive floating interest rate payments in exchange for making fixed interest rate payments.
These interest rate swap agreements effectively changed $385 million at November 30, 2018 and $479 million at November 30, 2017 of EURIBOR-based floating rate euro debt to fixed rate euro debt.
At November 30, 2018, these interest rate swaps settle through March 2025. d At November 30, 2017, we had fuel derivatives consisting of zero cost collars on Brent crude oil Brent to cover a portion of our estimated fuel consumption through 2018.

Financial Risk FuelPriceRisks We manage our exposure to fuel price risk by managing our consumption of fuel.
Substantially all of our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates to the consumption of fuel on our ships.
We manage fuel consumption through ship maintenance practices, modifying our itineraries and implementing innovative technologies.
We are also adding new, more fuel efficient ships to our fleet and are strategically disposing of smaller, less fuel efficient ships.

Our primary focus is to monitor our exposure to, and manage, the economic foreign currency exchange risks faced by our operations and realized if we exchange one currency for another.
We currently only hedge certain of our ship commitments and net investments in foreign operations.
The financial impacts of the hedging instruments we do employ generally offset the changes in the underlying exposures being hedged.
 Our operations primarily utilize the U. S. dollar, Australian dollar, euro or sterling as their functional currencies.
Our operations also have revenue and expenses denominated in non-functional currencies.
Movements in foreign currency exchange rates will affect our financial statements.
 We consider our investments in foreign operations to be denominated in stable currencies.
Our investments in foreign operations are of a long-term nature.
We have $5.9 billion and $848 million of euroand sterlingdenominated debt, respectively, including the effect of cross currency swaps, which provides an economic offset for our operations with euro and sterling functional currency.
We also partially mitigate our net investment currency exposures by denominating a portion of our foreign currency intercompany payables in our foreign operations functional currencies.
 Our shipbuilding contracts are typically denominated in euros.
Our decision to hedge a non-functional currency ship commitment for our cruise brands is made on a case-by-case basis, considering the amount and duration of the exposure, market volatility, economic trends, our overall expected net cash flows by currency and other offsetting risks.
We use foreign currency derivative contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk for some of our ship construction payments.
At November 30, 2018 we had no outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts used to manage shipyard payments.
At November 30, 2018, our remaining newbuild currency exchange rate risk primarily relates to eurodenominated newbuild contract payments to non-euro functional currency brands, which represent a total unhedged commitment of $10.1 billion for newbuilds scheduled to be delivered from 2019 through 2025.
The cost of shipbuilding orders that we may place in the future that is denominated in a different currency than our cruise brands will be affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
These foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may affect our decision to order new cruise ships.
InterestRateRisks We manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through our debt portfolio management and investment strategies.
We evaluate our debt portfolio to determine whether to make periodic adjustments to the mix of fixed and floating rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps, issuance of new debt, amendment of existing debt or early retirement of existing debt.
 As part of our ongoing control procedures, we monitor concentrations of credit risk associated with financial and other institutions with which we conduct significant business.
We seek to minimize these credit risk exposures, 29 Annex 1 DLC Annual Report
