NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNILEVER GROUP CONTINUED 1.
ACCOUNTING INFORMATION AND POLICIES CONTINUED In addition to the above, based on an initial review the Group does not currently believe adoption of the following standard amendments will have a material impact on the consolidated results or financial position of the Group.
APPLICABLE KEY REQUIREMENTS OR STANDARD CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICY IFRIC 23 Uncertainty This interpretation clarifies how entities should reflect uncertainties over income tax treatments, in particular over income tax when assessing the outcome a tax authority might reach with full knowledge and information if it were to make treatments an examination.
Based on preliminary work, the impact is estimated to be immaterial.
Effective from the year ended 31 December 2019 The IFRIC Interpretation has been endorsed by the EU IFRS 17 Insurance This standard introduces a new model for accounting for insurance contracts.
Work continues to review existing Contracts arrangements to determine the impact on adoption.
Based on preliminary work the impact is estimated to be immaterial.
Effective from the year ended 31 December 2021 The standard is not yet endorsed by the EU Amendments to IAS 19 The change requires that following plan amendments, curtailments or settlements, current service and net Employee Benefits interest costs for the remainder of the reporting period should be calculated in line with updated actuarial assumptions.
The amendment is to be applied prospectively.
Effective from the year ended 31 December 2019 The standard is not yet endorsed by the EU All other standards or amendments to standards that have been issued by the IASB and are effective from 1 January 2019 onwards are not applicable to Unilever.
SEGMENT INFORMATION SEGMENTAL REPORTING Beauty & Personal Care primarily sales of skin care and hair care products, deodorants and oral care products.
Foods & Refreshment primarily sales of soups, bouillons, sauces, snacks, mayonnaise, salad dressings, margarines and spreads, ice cream and tea-based beverages Home Care primarily sales of home care products, such as powders, liquids and capsules, soap bars and a wide range of cleaning products.
REVENUE Turnover comprises sales of goods after the deduction of discounts, sales taxes and estimated returns.
It does not include sales between group companies.
Discounts given by Unilever include rebates, price reductions and incentives given to customers, promotional couponing and trade communication costs.
Accumulated experience is used to estimate the provision for discounts, using the most likely amount method: revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is highly probable a significant reversal will not occur.
Turnover is recognised when control of the products being sold has transferred to our customer and when there are no longer any unfulfilled obligations to the customer.
This is generally on delivery to the customer but depending on individual customer terms, this can be at the time of dispatch, delivery or upon formal customer acceptance.
This is considered the appropriate point where the performance obligations in our contracts are satisfied as Unilever no longer have control over the inventory.
Our customers have the contractual right to return goods only when authorised by Unilever.
At 31 December 2018, an estimate has been made of goods that will be returned and a liability has been recognised for this amount.
An asset has also been recorded for the corresponding inventory that is estimated to return to Unilever using a best estimate based on accumulated experience.
Some of our customers are distributors who may be able to return unsold goods in consignment arrangements.
A liability is recognised where we receive payment from a customer before transferring control of the goods being sold.
UNDERLYING OPERATING PROFIT Underlying operating profit means operating profit before the impact of non-underlying items within operating profit see note 3.
Underlying operating profit represents our measure of segment profit or loss as it is the primary measure used for the purpose of making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance of segments.
Underlying operating margin is calculated as underlying operating profit divided by turnover.
