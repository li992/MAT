To provide a more relevant presentation, management has chosen to reanalyse the revenue categories from those previously reported.
Revenues previously included in Subscription, Transactional, and Other have been aggregated into Direct-to-consumer revenue.
Revenue previously labelled Programme and Channel sales is now labelled Content.
To provide a more relevant presentation, management has chosen to reanalyse the segmental allocation of certain costs in the prior year, to be consistent with their presentation in the current year, resulting in the transfer of Sales, general and administration expense of 1 million from Germany & Austria and 3 million from Italy into the UK & Ireland segment.
During the year, the Groups pay TV business in the UK and Ireland repackaged its sport channel proposition, resulting in new sport-specific channels being retailed to the customer, which are consumed throughout the year.
As a result, in accordance with the Groups accounting policy for the cost of sports rights, a portion of the total rights value has been allocated to the off-season period, and will be recognised on a straight-line basis over the off-season period.
This change in accounting estimate has resulted in a reduction in programming expense of 35 million in the year.
Revenue of 8,325 million 2017: 8,050 million arises from goods and services provided to the UK and revenue of 5,260 million 2017: 4,866 million arises from services provided to other countries.
Non-current assets located in the UK were 11,661 million 2017: 10,915 million and non-current assets located outside the UK were 499 million 2017: 977 million.
