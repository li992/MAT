The CULS were convertible at the election of holders into Ordinary Shares during the months of January and July each year up to January 2018 at a rate of 1 Ordinary share for every 310.1528p nominal of CULS.
Interest was paid on the CULS on 31 January and 31 July each year, of which 100% is charged to revenue in line with the Boards expected long-term split of returns from the investment portfolio of the Company during the life of the CULS.
The Company was required to recognise the liability component and the equity component of the CULS at the date of issue.
The liability component was required to be increased to the nominal value over the life of the CULS by crediting the liability and debiting the profit or loss account.
In order to align the revenue reserves with the distributable reserves the Company has decided to make an annual transfer between the equity component of the CULS and the revenue reserve so that the revenue reserve reflects distributable reserves as defined by company law.
Following the maturity of the CULS on 31 January 2018, the Company received conversion requests in respect of 43,741,559 nominal of CULS from CULS holders.
The result was the issue of 14,103,127 Ordinary shares on 9 February 2018.
In accordance with the Trust Deed, and after receiving independent financial advice, the remaining 937,189 nominal of CULS, for which no conversion requests had been from received from the CULS holders, were converted into Ordinary shares at a price of 310.1528p per share by the Trustee.
The Ordinary shares arising as a result of the exercise of conversion rights, being 302,170 Ordinary shares, were sold to the market at a price of 383p per Ordinary share with the proceeds of this sale, less any applicable expenses, being returned to those CULS holders who had made no conversion election pro rata their holding of unconverted CULS.
