The Company is an approved Investment Trust under Section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 and is not liable for UK taxation on capital gains.
Deferred taxation is the taxation expected to be payable or recoverable on timing differences between the treatment of certain items for accounting purposes and their treatment for the purposes of computing taxable profits.
Deferred taxation is based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted when the taxation is expected to be payable or recoverable.
Deferred taxation assets are only recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be sufficient future taxable profits to utilise them.
j Dividend paid Dividends payable to equity shareholders are recognised when the Companys obligation to make payment is established.
k Investments The Companys business is investing in financial instruments with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of investments is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy, and information about the portfolio is provided on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors.
Investments are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss, in accordance with the provisions of both Section 11 and Section 12 of FRS 102.
The fair value of investments is initially taken to be their cost and is subsequently measured as follows: Listed investments are valued at bid prices, or last market prices, depending on the convention of the exchange on which they are listed.
In accordance with the AIC SORP, the Company includes transaction costs, incidental to the purchase or sale of investments, within losses gains on investments in the capital column of the Income Statement and has disclosed those costs in Note 10 below.
l Derivative instruments When appropriate, permitted transactions in derivative instruments are used.
Derivative transactions into which the Company may enter include long and short CFDs and futures.
Derivatives are classified as other financial instruments and are initially accounted and measured at fair value on the date the derivative contract is entered into and subsequently measured at fair value as follows: Long and short CFDs the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying shares in the contract: and Futures the difference between contract price and the quoted trade price.
Where transactions are used to protect or enhance income, if the circumstances support this, the income and expenses derived are included in net income in the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Where such transactions are used to protect or enhance capital, if the circumstances support this, the income and expenses derived are included in losses gains on derivative instruments in the capital column of the Income Statement.
Any positions on such transactions open at the year end are reflected on the Balance Sheet at their fair value within current assets or creditors.
m Debtors Debtors include securities sold for future settlement, accrued income, taxation recoverable and other debtors and prepayments incurred in the ordinary course of business.
If collection is expected in one year or less or in the normal operating cycle of the business, if longer they are classified as current assets.

17 Financial Instruments Management of risk The Companys investing activities in pursuit of its investment objective involve certain inherent risks.
The Board confirms that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the risks faced by the Company.
The Board with the assistance of the Manager, has developed a risk matrix which, as part of the internal control process, identifies the risks that the Company faces.
Principal risks identified are market, performance, key person, economic and political, discount control, gearing, derivatives and cybercrime risks.
Other risks identified are tax and regulatory and operational risks, including those relating to third party service providers covering investment management, marketing and business development, company secretarial, fund administration and operations and support functions.
Risks are identified and graded in this process, together with steps taken in mitigation, and are updated and reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Risks identified are shown in the Strategic Report on pages 13 and 14.
This note refers to the identification, measurement and management of risks potentially affecting the value of financial instruments.
The Companys financial instruments may comprise: Equity shares and bonds held in accordance with the Companys investment objective and policies: Derivative instruments which comprise CFDs and futures on equity indices: and Cash, liquid resources and short term debtors and creditors that arise from its operations.
The risks identified arising from the Companys financial instruments are market price risk which comprises interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and other price risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk, credit risk and derivative instrument risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
These policies are consistent with those followed last year.
Market price risk Interest rate risk The Company finances its operations through its share capital and reserves.
In addition, the Company has gearing through the use of derivative instruments.
The level of gearing is reviewed by the Board and the Portfolio Manager.
The Company is exposed to a financial risk arising as a result of any increases in interest rates associated with the funding of the derivative instruments.

Foreign currency risk The Companys net return loss on ordinary activities after taxation and its net assets can be affected by foreign exchange rate movements because the Company has income, assets and liabilities which are denominated in currencies other than the Companys functional currency which is UK sterling.
The Company can also be subject to short term exposure from exchange rate movements, for example, between the date when an investment is purchased or sold and the date when settlement of the transaction occurs.
Three principal areas have been identified where foreign currency risk could impact the Company: Movements in exchange rates affecting the value of investments and derivative instruments: Movements in exchange rates affecting short term timing differences: and Movements in exchange rates affecting income received.
The portfolio management team monitor foreign currency risk but it is not the Companys current policy to hedge against currency risk.

INFORMATION FOR SHAREHOLDERS FINANCIAL GOVERNANCE STRATEGY 60 Fidelity European Values PLC | Annual Report 2018 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 17 Financial Instruments continued Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulties in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
The Companys assets mainly comprise readily realisable securities and derivative instruments which can be sold easily to meet funding commitments if necessary.
Shortterm flexibility is achieved by the use of a bank overdraft, if required.
Liquidity risk exposure At 31 December 2018, the undiscounted gross cash outflows of the financial liabilities were all repayable within one year and consisted of derivative instrument liabilities of 2,024,000 2017: 6,575,000 and other creditors of 840,000 2017: 2,357,000.
Counterparty risk Some of the derivative instruments in which the Company invests are not traded on an exchange but instead will be traded between counterparties based on contractual relationships, under the terms outlined in the International Swaps and Derivatives Associations ISDA market standard derivative legal documentation.
As a result the Company is subject to the risk that a counterparty may not perform its obligations under the related contract.
In accordance with the risk management process which the Manager employs, the Manager will seek to minimise such risk by only entering into transactions with counterparties which are believed to have an adequate credit rating at the time the transaction is entered into, by ensuring that formal legal agreements covering the terms of the contract are entered into in advance, and through adopting a counterparty risk framework which measures, monitors and manages counterparty risk by the use of internal and external credit agency ratings and by evaluating derivative instrument credit risk exposure.
For derivative transactions, collateral is used to reduce the risk of both parties to the contract.
Collateral is managed on a daily basis for all relevant transactions.
At 31 December 2018, 1,125,000 2017: 3,825,000 was held by the brokers in cash in a segregated collateral account on behalf of the Company, to reduce the credit risk exposure of the Company.
This collateral comprised of: HSBC Bank Plc 1,125,000 2017: 3,825,000 held in cash denominated in UK sterling.
At 31st December 2018, 4,279,000 2017: 11,127,000 was held by the Company in cash, shown as amounts held at futures clearing houses and brokers on the Balance Sheet, in a segregated collateral account on behalf of the brokers, to reduce the credit risk exposure of the brokers.
This collateral comprised of: Deutsche Bank AG 590,000 2017: 1,260,000 in cash denominated in UK sterling, Goldman Sachs International Ltd 520,000 2017: 3,460,000 in cash denominated in UK sterling, UBS AG 3,169,000 2017: 6,292,000 in cash denominated in UK sterling and HSBC Bank plc nil 2017: 115,000. Credit risk Financial instruments may be adversely affected if any of the institutions with which money is deposited suffer insolvency or other financial difficulties.
All transactions are carried out with brokers that have been approved by the Manager and are settled on a delivery versus payment basis.
Limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker and are kept under review by the Manager.
Exposure to credit risk arises on unsettled security transactions and derivative instrument contracts and cash at bank.
Derivative instruments risk The risk management process and ongoing oversight of derivatives activity is covered by the Derivatives & Counterparty Risk Committee.
Derivative instruments are used by the Manager for the following purposes: To gain unfunded long exposure to equity markets, sectors or single stocks.
Unfunded exposure is exposure gained without an initial flow of capital: and To position short exposures in the Companys portfolio.
These uncovered exposures benefit from falls in the prices of shares with the Portfolio Manager believes to be over values.
These positions, therefore, distinguish themselves from other short exposures held for hedging purposes since they are expected to add risk to the portfolio.
