This 17% tax rate will reduce the companys future current tax charge and has been reflected in the calculation of the deferred tax balance as at 31 December 2018.
A c hange in the effective corporation tax in the US from 35% to 21% was substantively enacted in December 2017 and has been reflected in the calculation of the deferred tax balance as at 31 December 2018.
As noted on page 45, the group has assessed the potential impact of the diverted profits tax DPT following the enactment of new legislation in April 2015 and is of the view that no liability arises.
The ultimate outcome may differ and any profits that did fall within the scope of the DPT would potentially be taxed at a rate of 25% rather than 12.5% the current rate of tax on corporate earnings in Ireland.
The earnings that would potentially be taxed at 25% are the relevant earnings from 2015 to 2018.
The relevant earnings are determined in relation to 75% of the profits and losses in Beazleys syndicates potentially starting with a proportion of the profits on the 2013, 2014 and 2015 years of account and 75% of all profits and losses in Beazleys syndicates on years of account from 2016 onwards.

No special dividend was declared in 2018 2017: nil.
The company expects the total amount to be paid in respect of the second interim dividend to be approximately 40.6m.
These financial statements do not provide for the second interim dividend as a liability.

com Notes to the financial statements continued 12 Intangible assets continued Impairment tests Goodwill, syndicate capacity and US insurance authorisation licences are deemed to have indefinite life as they are expected to have value in use that does not erode or become obsolete over the course of time.
Consequently, they are not amortised but annually tested for impairment.
For the purpose of impairment testing, they are allocated to the groups cash-generating units CGUs as follows: Political, accident & Specialty Marine contingency Property Reinsurance lines Total 2018 $m $m $m $m $m $m Goodwill 2.3 29.6 24.9 0.8 4.4 62.0 Capacity 1.6 1.0 2.5 0.8 4.8 10.7 Licences 1.9 7.4 9.3 Total 3.9 30.6 29.3 1.6 16.6 82.0 Political, accident & Specialty Marine contingency Property Reinsurance lines Total 2017 $m $m $m $m $m $m Goodwill 2.3 29.6 24.9 0.8 4.4 62.0 Capacity 1.6 1.0 2.5 0.8 4.8 10.7 Licences 1.9 7.4 9.3 Total 3.9 30.6 29.3 1.6 16.6 82.0 Value in use is defined as the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the CGU and represents recoverable amount for goodwill.
It is estimated by discounting future cash flows sourced from financial budgets approved by management which cover specific estimates for a five year period.
A terminal growth rate of 0% has been used to extrapolate projections beyond the covered five year period.
The key assumptions used in the preparation of future cash flows are: premium growth rates, claims experience, retention rates and expected future market conditions.
A discount rate, based on weighted average cost of capital WACC of 9% 2017: 6% has been applied to projected future cash flows.
This has been calculated using independent measures of the risk-free rate of return and is indicative of the groups risk profile relative to the market.
The impairment test for goodwill confirms that no impairment is required.
Significant changes in the economic and regulatory environment, such as US legislation and Brexit, could impact the amount of premiums written and investment income for each CGU.
This could potentially have an impact on the carrying value of the CGU, however this remains remote.
To test the segments sensitivity to variances including those caused by the factors listed above from forecast profits, the discount rate has been flexed to 5% above and 5% below the central assumption.
Within this range, the recovery of goodwill was stress tested and remains supportable across all CGUs.
Headroom was calculated in respect of the value in use of all the groups other intangible assets.
The groups intangible asset relating to syndicate capacity is allocated across all CGUs.
The fair value of syndicate capacity can be determined from the latest Lloyds of London capacity auctions.
Based upon the latest market prices, management concludes that the fair value exceeds the carrying amount and as such no impairment is necessary.
US insurance authorisation licences represent the privilege to write insurance business in particular states in the US.
Licences are allocated to the relevant CGU.
There is no active market for licences, therefore value in use is deemed to be fair value.
As described above, a WACC rate is applied to projected future cash flows sourced from management approved budgets.
Key assumptions are the same as those outlined above.
Based upon all available evidence the results of the testing indicate that no impairment is required.

Valuation hierarchy The table below summarises financial assets carried at fair value using a valuation hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
The fair value hierarchy has the following levels: Level 1 Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments.
An active market is a market in which transactions for the instrument occur with sufficient frequency and volume on an ongoing basis such that quoted prices reflect prices at which an orderly transaction would take place between market participants at the measurement date.
Included within level 1 are bonds, treasury bills of government and government agencies, corporate bonds and equity funds which are measured based on quoted prices in active markets.
Level 2 Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, or based on pricing models for which significant inputs can be corroborated by observable market data e. g. interest rates, exchange rates.
Included within level 2 are government bonds and treasury bills, equity funds and corporate bonds, which are not actively traded, hedge funds and senior secured loans.
Level 3 Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable or for which there is limited market activity against which to measure fair value.
The availability of financial data can vary for different financial assets and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether it is new and not yet established in the marketplace, and other characteristics specific to each transaction.
To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgement.
Accordingly the degree of judgement exercised by management in determining fair value is greatest for instruments classified in level 3.
The group uses prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date for valuation of these instruments.
If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability can be categorised in different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement.
The group has an established control framework and valuation policy with respect to the measurement of fair values.
com Annual report 2018 Beazley 173 16 Financial assets and liabilities continued Level 2 investments For the groups level 2 debt securities our fund administrator obtains the prices used in the valuation from independent pricing vendors such as Bloomberg, Standard and Poors, Reuters, Markit and International Data Corporation.
The independent pricing vendors derive an evaluated price from observable market inputs.
The market inputs include trade data, two-sided markets, institutional bids, comparable trades, dealer quotes, and other relevant market data.
These inputs are verified in their pricing engines and calibrated with the pricing models to calculate spread to benchmarks, as well as other pricing assumptions such as weighted average life WAL, discount margins DM, default rates, and recovery and prepayment assumptions for mortgage securities.
While such valuations are sensitive to estimates, it is believed that changing one or more of the assumptions to reasonably possible alternative assumptions would not change the fair value significantly.
The group records the unadjusted price provided and validates the price through various tolerance checks such as comparison with the investment custodians and the investment managers to assess the reasonableness and accuracy of the price to be used to value the security.
In the rare case that the price fails the tolerance test, it is escalated and discussed internally.
We would not override the price on a retrospective basis, but we would work with the administrator and pricing vendor to investigate the difference.
This generally results in the vendor updating their inputs.
We also review the valuation policy on a regular basis to ensure it is fit for purpose.
No adjustments have been made to the prices obtained from the administrator at the current year end.
For our hedge funds and equity funds, the pricing and valuation of each fund is undertaken by administrators in accordance with each underlying funds valuation policy.
For the equity funds, the individual fund prices are published on a daily, weekly or monthly basis via Bloomberg and other market data providers such as Reuters.
For the hedge funds, the individual fund prices are communicated by the administrators to all investors via the monthly investor statements.
The fair value of the hedge fund and equity fund portfolios are calculated by reference to the underlying net asset values of each of the individual funds.
Additional information is obtained from fund managers relating to the underlying assets within individual hedge funds.
We identified that 83% 2017: 67% of these underlying assets were level 1 and the remainder level 2.
This enables us to categorise hedge funds as level 2.
Prior to any new hedge fund investment, extensive due diligence is undertaken on each fund to ensure that pricing and valuation are undertaken by the administrators and that each funds valuation policy is appropriate for the financial instruments the manager will be employing to execute the investment strategy.
Fund liquidity terms are reviewed prior to the execution of any investment to ensure that there is no mismatch between the liquidity of the underlying fund assets and the liquidity terms offered to fund investors.
As part of the monitoring process, underlying fund subscriptions and redemptions are assessed by reconciling the increase or decrease in fund assets with the investment performance in any given period.
Level 3 investments During 2018, the groups investment committee approved additional allocations to an illiquid asset portfolio comprising investments in funds managed by third party managers generally closed end limited partnerships or open ended funds.
While the funds provide full transparency on their underlying investments, the investments themselves are in many cases private and unquoted, and are therefore classified as level 3 investments.
These inputs can be subjective and may include a discount rate applied to the investment based on market factors and expectations of future cash flows, the nature of the investment, local market conditions, trading values on public exchanges for comparable securities, current and projected operating performance relative to benchmarks, financial condition, and financing transactions subsequent to the acquisition of the investment.
We take the following steps to ensure accurate valuation of these level 3 assets.
A substantial part of the preinvestment due diligence process is dedicated to a comprehensive review of each funds valuation policy and the internal controls of the manager.
In addition to this, confirmation that the investment reaches a minimum set of standards relating to the independence of service providers, corporate governance, and transparency is sought prior to approval.
Post investment, unaudited capital statements confirming the fair value of the limited partner interests are received and reviewed on a quarterly or more frequent basis.

Unconsolidated structured entities A structured entity is defined as an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only, or when the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements.
As part of its standard investment activities the group holds fixed interest investments in high yield bond funds, as well as capital growth investments in equity funds, hedge funds and illiquid credit assets which in accordance with IFRS 12 are classified as unconsolidated structured entities.
The group does not sponsor any of the unconsolidated structured entities.
The assets classified as unconsolidated structured entities are held at fair value on the statement of financial position.

The capital growth assets are held in investee funds managed by asset managers who apply various investment strategies to accomplish their respective investment objectives.
The groups investments in investee funds are subject to the terms and conditions of the respective investee funds offering documentation and are susceptible to market price risk arising from uncertainties about future values of those investee funds.
Investment decisions are made after extensive due diligence on the underlying fund, its strategy and the overall quality of the underlying funds manager and assets.
com Notes to the financial statements continued 16 Financial assets and liabilities continued All the investee funds in the investment portfolio are managed by portfolio managers who are compensated by the respective investee funds for their services.
Such compensation generally consists of an asset-based fee and a performance-based incentive fee and is reflected in the valuation of the funds investment in each of the investee funds.
The right to sell or request redemption of investments in high yield bond funds, asset backed securities, equity funds and hedge funds ranges in frequency from daily to semi-annually.
The group did not sponsor any of the respective structured entities.
These investments are included in financial assets at fair value through profit or loss in the statement of financial position.

com Annual report 2018 Beazley 183 24 Insurance liabilities and reinsurance assets continued 24.2 Assumptions, changes in assumptions and claims reserve strength analysis a Process used to decide on assumptions The peer review reserving process Beazley uses a quarterly dual track process to set its reserves: the actuarial team uses several actuarial and statistical methods to estimate the ultimate premium and claims costs, with the most appropriate methods selected depending on the nature of each class of business: and the underwriting teams concurrently review the development of the incurred loss ratio over time, work with our claims managers to set reserve estimates for identified claims and utilise their detailed understanding of both risks underwritten and the nature of the claims to establish an alternative estimate of ultimate claims cost, which is compared to the actuarially established figures.
A formal internal peer review process is then undertaken to determine the reserves held for accounting purposes which, in totality, are not lower than the actuarially established figure.
The group also commissions an annual independent review to ensure that the reserves established are reasonable or within a reasonable range.
The group has a consistent reserving philosophy, with initial reserves being set to include risk margins which may be released over time as uncertainty reduces.
Actuarial assumptions Chain-ladder techniques are applied to premiums, paid claims and incurred claims i. e. paid claims plus case estimates.
The basic technique involves the analysis of historical claims development factors and the selection of estimated development factors based on historical patterns.
The selected development factors are then applied to cumulative claims data for each underwriting year that is not yet fully developed to produce an estimated ultimate claims cost for each underwriting year.
Chain-ladder techniques are most appropriate for classes of business that have a relatively stable development pattern.
Chain-ladder techniques are less suitable in cases in which the insurer does not have a developed claims history for a particular class of business, or for underwriting years that are still at immature stages of development where there is a higher level of assumption volatility.
The Bornhuetter-Ferguson method uses a combination of a benchmark market-based estimate and an estimate based on claims experience.
The former is based on a measure of exposure such as premiums: the latter is based on the paid or incurred claims observed to date.
The two estimates are combined using a formula that gives more weight to the experience-based estimate as time passes.
This technique has been used in situations where developed claims experience was not available for the projection e. g. recent underwriting years or new classes of business.
The expected loss ratio method uses a benchmark market-based estimate applied to the expected premium and is used for classes with little or no relevant historical data.
The choice of selected results for each underwriting year of each class of business depends on an assessment of the technique that has been most appropriate to observed historical developments.
In certain instances, this has meant that different techniques or combinations of techniques have been selected for individual underwriting years or groups of underwriting years within the same class of business.
As such, there are many assumptions used to estimate general insurance liabilities.
We also review triangulations of the paid outstanding claim ratios as a way of monitoring any changes in the strength of the outstanding claim estimates between underwriting years so that adjustments can be made to mitigate any subsequent over under reserving.
To date, this analysis indicates no systematic change to the outstanding claim strength across underwriting years.
Where significant large losses impact an underwriting year e. g. the events of 11 September 2001, the hurricanes in 2004, 2005, 2008, 2012, 2017 and 2018 or the earthquakes in 2010, 2011 and 2017, the development is usually very different from the attritional losses.
In these situations, the large loss total is extracted from the remainder of the data and analysed separately by the respective claims managers using exposure analysis of the policies in force in the areas affected.
Further assumptions are required to convert gross of reinsurance estimates of ultimate claims cost to a net of reinsurance level and to establish reserves for unallocated claims handling expenses and reinsurance bad debt.
com Notes to the financial statements continued 24 Insurance liabilities and reinsurance assets continued b Major assumptions The main assumption underlying these techniques is that the groups past claims development experience with appropriate adjustments for known changes can be used to project future claims development and hence ultimate claims costs.
As such these methods extrapolate the development of premiums, paid and incurred losses, average costs per claim and claim numbers for each underwriting year based on the observed development of earlier years.
Throughout, judgement is used to assess the extent to which past trends may or may not apply in the future: for example, to reflect changes in external or market factors such as economic conditions, public attitudes to claiming, levels of claims inflation, premium rate changes, judicial decisions and legislation, as well as internal factors such as portfolio mix, policy conditions and claims handling procedures.
c Changes in assumptions As already discussed, general insurance business requires many different assumptions.
The diagram below illustrates the main categories of assumptions used for each underwriting year and class combination.
Premium rate change Classes Marine Claims inflation Political, accident & contingency Mix of business Property Reporting patterns Underwriting years Reinsurance Settlement patterns Specialty lines Judicial decisions Professional judgement 1993 1994... 2016 2018 Given the range of assumptions used, the groups profit or loss is relatively insensitive to changes to a particular assumption used for an underwriting year class combination.
However, the groups profit or loss is potentially more sensitive to a systematic change in assumptions that affect many classes, such as judicial changes or when catastrophes produce more claims than expected.
The group uses a range of risk mitigation strategies to reduce such volatility including the purchase of reinsurance.
In addition, the group holds capital to absorb volatility.
d Claims reserve strength analysis The estimation of IBNR reserves for future claim notifications is subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than the estimation of the outstanding claims already notified.
This is particularly true for the specialty lines business, which will typically display greater variations between initial estimates and final outcomes as a result of the greater degree of difficulty in estimating these reserves.
The estimation of IBNR reserves for other business written is generally subject to less variability as claims are generally reported and settled relatively quickly.
As such, our reserving assumptions contain a reasonable margin for prudence given the uncertainties inherent in the insurance business underwritten, particularly on the longer tailed specialty lines classes.
Since year end 2004, we have identified a range of possible outcomes for each class and underwriting year combination directly from our internal model previously our individual capital assessment ICA process.
Comparing these with our pricing assumptions and reserving estimates gives our management team increased insight into our perceived reserving strength and the relative uncertainties of the business written.
To illustrate the robustness of our reserves, the loss development tables below provide information about historical claims development by the five segments marine, political, accident & contingency, property, reinsurance and specialty lines.
The tables are by underwriting year which in our view provides the most transparent reserving basis.
We have supplied tables for both ultimate gross claims and ultimate net claims.
The top part of the table illustrates how the groups estimate of the claims ratio for each underwriting year has changed at successive year ends.
The bottom half of the table reconciles the gross and net claims to the amount appearing in the statement of financial position.
While the information in the table provides a historical perspective on the adequacy of the claims liabilities established in previous years, users of these financial statements are cautioned against extrapolating past redundancies or deficiencies on current claims liabilities.
The group believes that the estimate of total claims liabilities as at 31 December 2018 is adequate.
However, due to inherent uncertainties in the reserving process, it cannot be assured that such balances will ultimately prove to be adequate.
com Annual report 2018 Beazley 189 24 Insurance liabilities and reinsurance assets continued Analysis of movements in loss development tables We have updated our loss development tables to show the ultimate loss ratios as at 31 December 2018 for each underwriting year.
Marine There have been reserve releases in the energy book in the 2009 underwriting year following the improvement of a specific claim.
The 2010 and 2014 underwriting years have been impacted by specific claims in energy and hull respectively.
The 2018 underwriting year has been opened higher than previous years to allow for the recent increased claims activity.
Political, accident & contingency The 2017 underwriting year has reduced supported by benign claims activity on the terrorism book, and a number of older years of the political risks account have contributed small claims recoveries.
Property Minor releases have been seen on a number of underwriting years, with one claim on the commercial property book leading to a small strengthening in 2013.
The recent years have been significantly impacted by higher attritional claims, as well as some strengthening on the 2017 catastrophe estimates during the year.
Reinsurance The 2017 underwriting year is showing improvement generated by redundancy in the 2017 catastrophe estimates.
Specialty lines Releases have been made from underwriting years as they mature and claims crystallise.
The more recent years have also benefited from the release of cyber catastrophe margin.
The most recent underwriting year has been opened slightly higher in order to maintain margin.
com Notes to the financial statements continued 24 Insurance liabilities and reinsurance assets continued Claim releases The table below analyses our net claims between current year claims and adjustments to prior year net claims reserves.
These have been broken down by segment and underwriting year.
Beazleys reserving policy is to maintain catastrophe reserve margins either until the end of the exposure period or until catastrophe events occur.
Therefore margins have been released from prior year reserves where risks have expired during 2018.
Reserve releases during the year totalled $115.0m 2017: $203.9m.
The net of reinsurance estimates of ultimate claims costs on the 2016 and prior underwriting years have improved by $133.5m during 2018, while 2017 underwriting year strengthened by $18.5m driven by the deterioration of catastrophe and attritional claims in our property division.
The movements shown on 2015 and earlier are absolute claim movements and are not impacted by any current year movements in premium on those underwriting years.

The scheme provides the following benefits: an annual pension payable to the member from his or her normal pension age 60th birthday of generally 1 60th of final pensionable salary for each year of pensionable service up to 31 March 2006: a spouses pension of 2 3rds of the members pension payable on the members death after retirement: a lump sum of four times current pensionable salary for death in service at the date of death: and a pension of 2 3rds of the members prospective pension at the date of death, payable to the spouse until their death.
This pension is related to salary at the date of death.
The scheme is administered by a trust that is legally separated from the group.
The trustees consist of both employee and employer representatives and an independent chairman, all of whom are governed by the scheme rules.
The scheme exposes the group to additional actuarial, interest rate and market risk.
Contributions to the scheme are determined by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method as set out in the scheme rules and the most recent valuation was at 31 December 2018.
According to the Schedule of Contributions, the group expects to contribute approximately $1.3m in each of the next two years.
Trustees obligations Under section 222 of the Pension Act 2004, every scheme is subject to the Statutory Funding Objective SFO, which is to have sufficient and appropriate assets to cover its technical provisions, which represent the present value of benefits to which members are entitled based on pensionable service to the valuation date.
This is assessed at least every three years using assumptions agreed between the Trustees and the employer as set out in the Statement of Funding Principles produced in accordance with the Occupational Pensions Scheme Funding Regulations 2005 OP SF R 2005 Regulation 6.
The Trustees written Statement of Funding Principles is dated 27 December 2017 and it sets out their policy for securing that the SFO is met that the scheme will have sufficient assets to cover its technical provisions.
In accordance with the OP SF R 2005 Regulation 5 2 trustees have chosen the Defined Accrued Benefit Method, a variant of the projected unit credit method where accrual has ceased.
The most recently completed Actuarial Valuation of the Scheme was carried out at 1 January 2017 including a valuation carried out in accordance with the Pensions Protection Fund Valuation Regulations 2005 and with appropriate section 179 guidance and assumptions issued by the Board of the Pension Protection Fund.
A recovery plan was agreed between the Trustees and the employer on 27 December 2017 in accordance with OP SF R 2005 Regulation 8.
These arrangements were formalised in a schedule of contributions which the scheme Actuary certified on 27 December 2017 in accordance with OP SF R 2005 Regulation 9.
