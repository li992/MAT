Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information 11 Investments in associates and joint ventures continued ITC Ltd. ITC is an Indian conglomerate based in Kolkata and maintains a presence in cigarettes, hotels, paper and packaging, agri-business and other fastmoving goods e. g. confectionery, IT, branded apparel, personal care, greetings cards and safety matches.
ITC prepares accounts on a quarterly basis with a 31 March year end.
As permitted by IAS 28, results up to 30 September 2018 have been used in applying the equity method.
This is driven by the availability of information at the half year, to be consistent with the treatment in the Groups interim accounts.
Any further information available after the date used for reporting purposes is reviewed and any material items adjusted for in the final results.
The latest published information available is at 31 December 2018.

The majority of scheme members belong to defined benefit schemes, most of which are funded externally and many of which are closed to new entrants.
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution schemes.
The liabilities arising in the defined benefit schemes are determined in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries, using the projected unit credit method.
It is Group policy that all schemes are formally valued at least every three years.
The principal schemes are in the USA, UK, Germany, Canada, The Netherlands and Switzerland.
Together, schemes in these territories account for over 85% of the total obligations of the Groups defined benefit schemes.
These obligations consist mainly of final salary pension schemes which provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life.
The level of benefits provided depends on members length of service and their salary in the final years leading up to retirement.
In addition, the Group operates several healthcare benefit schemes, of which the most significant are in the USA and Canada.
The liabilities in respect of healthcare benefits are also assessed by qualified independent actuaries, applying the projected unit creditmethod.
All of these arrangements, including funded schemes where formal trusts or equivalents are required, have been developed and are operated in accordance with local practices and regulations where applicable in the countries concerned.
For example, in the USA, the main funded pension schemes are the Reynolds American Retirement Plan and the Retirement Income Plan for Certain RAI Affiliates, and the main funded healthcare scheme is the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation Welfare & Fringe Benefit Plan, all of which are established with corporate trustees that are required to run the schemes in accordance with the Plans rules and to comply with all relevant legislation, including the Employee Retirement Income Security Act 1974 and US law.
Similarly, in the UK, the main pension scheme is the British American Tobacco UK Pension Fund, which is established under trust law and has a corporate trustee that is required to run the scheme in accordance with the Funds Trust Deed and Rules and to comply with the Pension Scheme Act 1993, Pensions Act 1995, Pensions Act 2004 and all the relevant legislation.
Responsibility for the governance of the schemes across the Group, including investment decisions and contribution schedules, generally lies with the trustees.
The trustees for each arrangement will usually consist of representatives appointed by both the sponsoring company and the beneficiaries.
In the USA, the corporate trustees act as custodians with a committee of local management acting in a fiduciary capacity with regard to investment decisions, risk mitigation and administration of the arrangements.
The majority of schemes are subject to local regulations regarding funding requirements.
Contributions to defined benefit schemes are determined after consultation with the respective trustees and actuaries of the individual externally funded schemes, and after taking into account regulatory requirements in each territory.
The Groups contributions to funded retirement benefit schemes in 2019 are expected to be 88 million in total compared to 221 million in 2018.
Contributions to the various funded schemes in the USA are agreed with the relevant corporate Trustee, the named fiduciary, scheme actuaries and the committee of local management after taking account of statutory requirements including the Pensions Protection Act of 2006, as amended.
Through its subsidiaries in the USA, the Group intends to make significant regular contributions, when required, with the aim of maintaining a funding status of at least 90%, and becoming fully funded long-term.
The Group contributed 87 million to its funded pension plans and 40 million to its funded post-retirement plans in 2018.
However, during 2019, the Group does not expect to contribute to its funded pension and post-retirement plans in the USA.
BAT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2018 155 Financial Statements Notes on the Accounts continued 12 Retirement benefit schemes continued Contributions to the British American Tobacco UK Pension Fund for 2017 and 2016 were agreed with the Trustee as part of a recovery plan to include 30 million a year to cover ongoing service costs, with additional contributions to eliminate a funding shortfall.
Additional contributions were78 million in both 2017 and 2016.
These contributions were to be used to achieve the statutory funding objective and thereafter to support attaining a lower risk investment strategy noted below.
With effect from July 2018, the Group will pay 18 million a year to meet the cost of future benefit accruals.
Additional annual contributions are payable until the Fund is valued to 115% on a Technical Provisions basis, and are expected to be 11 million in 2019.
Total contributions payable to the UK Pension Fund are secured by a charge over the Groups Head Office Globe House up to a maximum of 150 million.
The charge would be triggered in the event that the Group defaults on agreed contributions due to the Fund or if an insolvency event occurs with respect to the UK entity responsible for making the payments.
The charge is due to be released in 2039 but may be released earlier by negotiation or if the assets of the Fund are sufficient to achieve certain funding levels.
Under the rules of the scheme, any future surplus would be returnable to the Group by refund at the end of the life of the scheme.
The funding commitment is therefore not considered onerous, and in accordance with IFRIC 14 no additional liabilities or surplus restriction have been recognised in respect of this commitment.
Payments made to pensioners by the operating companies in Germany, net of income on scheme assets, are deemed to be company contributions to the Contractual Trust Arrangements and are anticipated to be around 25 million in 2019 and ranging from 24 million per annum, decreasing to 21 million in 2023.
Contributions to pension schemes in Canada, The Netherlands and Switzerland in total are anticipated to be around 25 million in 2019 and then around 10 million per annum for the four years after that.
The majority of benefit payments are from trustee administered funds, however, there are also a number of unfunded schemes where the sponsoring company meets the benefit payment obligation as it falls due.
For unfunded schemes in the USA, UK and Canada, 41% of the liabilities reported at year end are expected to be settled by the Group within 10 years, 29% between 10 and 20 years, 17% between 20 and 30 years, and 13% thereafter.
The funded arrangements in the Group have policies on investment management, including strategies over a preferred long-term investment profile, and schemes in certain territories including Canada and The Netherlands manage their bond portfolios to match the weighted average duration of scheme liabilities.
For funded schemes in the USA, the Group employs a risk mitigation strategy which seeks to balance pension plan returns with a reasonable level of funded status volatility.
Based on this framework, the asset allocation has two primary components.
The first component is the hedging portfolio, which uses extended duration fixed income holdings typically US Government and investment grade corporate bonds and to a lesser extent derivatives to match a portion of the interest rate risk associated with the benefit obligations, thereby reducing expected funded status volatility.
The second component is the return seeking portfolio, which is designed to enhance portfolio returns.
The return seeking portfolio is broadly diversified across asset classes.
In addition, the main scheme in the UK had a target investment strategy such that, by 31 December 2018, the scheme would have moved to 20% return-seeking assets and 80% risk-reducing assets.
This objective was achieved during the first quarter of 2018 and the Trustee has subsequently selected an investment strategy with a high-level target of broadly 10% return-seeking and 90% risk-reducing assets.
Investments are diversifiedbytype of investment, by investment sector, and where appropriate by country.
Through its defined benefit pension schemes and healthcare schemes, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, including: Asset volatility: The plan liabilities are calculated using discount rates set by reference to bond yields.
If plan assets underperform this yield, e. g. due to stock market volatility, this will create a deficit.
However, most schemes hold a proportion of assets which are expected to outperform bonds in the long term, and the majority of schemes by value are subject to local regulation regarding funding deficits.
Changes in bond yields: A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase scheme liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the schemes bond holdings or other hedging instruments.
Inflation risk: Some of the Groups pension obligations are linked to inflation and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities, although in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place in the scheme rules, while some assets and derivatives provide specific inflation protection.
Life expectancy: The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans liabilities.
Assumptions regarding mortality and mortality improvements are regularly reviewed in line with actuarial tables and scheme specific experience.

In the USA, pension plan assets are invested using active investment strategies and multiple investment management firms.
Managers within each asset class cover a range of investment styles and approaches.
Allowable investment types include global equity, fixed income, real assets, private equity and absolute return.
The range of allowable investment types utilised for pension assets provides enhanced returns and more widely diversifies the plan.
In addition, certain scheme assets, including a portion of the assets held in the main UK pension scheme, are further diversified by investing in equities listed on non-UK stock exchanges via investment funds.
The main UK scheme also makes use of liability driven investment funds and inflation opportunity funds as part of its investment portfolio.
In the above analysis investments via equity-based investment funds are shown under listed equities, and investments via bond-based investment funds are shown under listed bonds.
Other assets include cash and other deposits, derivatives and other hedges, recoverable taxes, reinsurance contracts, infrastructure investments and investment property.
The actuarial gains and losses in both years principally relate to movements in the fair values of scheme assets and actual returns are stated net of applicable taxes and fund management fees.
The fair values of listed scheme assets were derived from observable data including quoted market prices and other market data, including market values of individual segregated investments and of pooled investment funds where quoted.
The fair values of unlisted assets were derived from cash flow projections of estimated future income after taking into account the estimated recoverable value of these assets.

Pension increases, where allowed for, are generally assumed to be in line with inflation.
Assumptions of life expectancy are in line with best practice in each territory.
The valuation of retirement benefit schemes involves judgements about uncertain future events.
Sensitivities in respect of the key assumptions used to measure the principal pension schemes as at 31 December 2018 are set out below.
These sensitivities show the hypothetical impact of a change in each of the listed assumptions in isolation, with the exception of the sensitivity to inflation which incorporates the impact of certain correlating assumptions such as salary increases.
While each of these sensitivities holds all other assumptions constant, inpractice such assumptions rarely change in isolation, while asset values also change, and the impacts may offset to some extent.
