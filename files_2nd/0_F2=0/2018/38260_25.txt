New and amended standards and interpretations: The Company applied for the first-time certain amendments to the standards, which are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
The Company has not early adopted any standards, interpretations or amendments that have been issued but are not yet effective.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 supersedes IAS 11 Construction Contracts, IAS 18 Revenue and related Interpretations and it applies, with limited exceptions, to all revenue arising from contracts with its customers.
IFRS 15 establishes a five-step model to account for revenue arising from contracts with customers and requires that revenue be recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer.
IFRS 15 requires entities to exercise judgement, taking into consideration all of the relevant facts and circumstances when applying each step of the model to contracts with their customers.
The Company adopted IFRS 15 using modified retrospective method of adoption.
The adoption of IFRS 15 from 1 January 2018 has no significant impact on the financial statements of the Company.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9 Financial Instruments replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, bringing together all three aspects of the accounting for financial instruments: classification and measurement: impairment: and hedge accounting.
The Company has applied the requirements of IFRS 9 prospectively, with the initial application date of 1 January 2018 and without restating comparative information.
The adoption of IFRS 9 from 1 January 2018 has no significant impact on the financial statements of the Company.
The other new standards, amendments to IFRS, which are effective as of 1 January 2018 are listed below, have no impact on the Company.
IFRIC Interpretation 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Considerations Amendments to IAS 40 Transfers of Investment Property Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions Amendments to IFRS 4 Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts Amendments to IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures Amendments to IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards 2.4 Summary of significant accounting policies Investment in subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities which are controlled by the Company.
Control is achieved when the Company is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
Specifically, the Company controls an investee if, and only if, the Company has: Power over the investee i. e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns Investments in subsidiaries are recognised at acquisition cost less any provision for impairment.
When the Company incurs increases in or return of share capital, to from its subsidiaries, such movements are recognised within the cost of investment in subsidiaries.
At each reporting date, an assessment is made to determine whether there are any indicators of impairment.
Where an indicator of impairment exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount of the investment in subsidiary is made, which is considered to be the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use.
Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the investment in an arms length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties.
When this information is not available the fair value is determined based on the net present value of the future cash flows related to its subsidiaries, using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
If the carrying amount of an investment exceeds the recoverable amount, a provision is recorded in the income statement to reflect the investment at the recoverable amount.
162 NMC Health plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Group Strategic Financial Other Overview Report Governance Statements Information Where an impairment charge has previously been recognised, an assessment is made at the end of each reporting period as to whether there is any indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If any such indication exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount is made.
An impairment loss is reversed to the income statement to the extent that the increased carrying value of the investment in subsidiary does not exceed the carrying value that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Cash and cash equivalents For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consists of cash in hand and bank balances.
Equity The Company has issued ordinary shares that are classified as equity.
The difference between the issue price and the par value of ordinary share capital is allocated to share premium.
The transaction costs incurred for the share issue are accounted for as a deduction from share premium, net of any related income tax benefit, to the extent they are incremental costs directly attributable to the share issue that would otherwise have been avoided.
Accounts payable and accruals Liabilities are recognised for amounts to be paid in the future for goods and services received whether billed by the supplier or not.
Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer.
If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
Accounts payable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Company has an obligation legal or constructive arising from a past event, and the costs to settle the obligation are both probable and able to be reliably measured.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the obligation.
Increases in provisions due to the passage of time are recognised in the income statement.
Share based payments Equity-settled share-based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date.
The fair value excludes the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Details regarding the determination of the fair value of equity-settled share-based transactions are set out in note 12.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest.
At each reporting date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-marketbased vesting conditions.
The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves other payables.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for equity-settled transactions for which vesting are conditional upon a market or non-vesting condition.
These are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and or service conditions are satisfied.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded in UAE Dirhams at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All differences are taken to the statement of comprehensive income.
Impairment of financial assets An assessment is made at each statement of financial position date to determine whether there is objective evidence that a specific financial asset may be impaired.
If such evidence exists, any impairment loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Impairment is determined as the difference between carrying value and the present value of future cash flows discounted at the current market rate of return for a similar financial asset.
Financial guarantee contracts Financial guarantee contracts issued by the Company are those contracts that require a payment to be made to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because the specified debtor fails to make a payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument.
Financial guarantee contracts are recognised initially as a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee.
Subsequently, the liability is measured at the higher of the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date and the amount recognised less cumulative amortisation.
Dividend income Revenue is recognised when the Companys right to receive the payment is established, which is generally when shareholders approve the dividend.
NMC Health plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 163 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued At 31 December 2018 3 Accounting standards and interpretations issued but not effective The new and amended standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the Companys financial statements are disclosed below.
The Company intends to adopt these new and amended standards and interpretations, if applicable, when they become effective.
IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 replaces existing guidance on the accounting for leases, including IAS17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease, SIC-15 Operating Leases Incentives and SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease.
The standard is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
IFRS 16 introduces a single comprehensive, on-balance sheet lease accounting model for lessees.
IFRS 16 distinguishes leases and service contracts on the basis of whether an identified asset is controlled by a customer.
Distinctions of operating leases off balance sheet and finance leases on balance sheet are removed for lessee accounting and is replaced by a model where a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability have to be recognised for leases by lessees i. e. all on balance sheet except for short-term leases and leases of low value assets.
Lessor accounting under IFRS 16 is substantially unchanged from todays accounting under IAS 17.
Lessors will continue to classify all leases using the same classification principle as in IAS 17 and distinguish between two types of leases: operating and finance leases.
IFRS 16, which is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, requires lessees and lessors to make more extensive disclosures than under IAS 17.
Transition to IFRS 16 The Company will adopt IFRS 16 using modified retrospectively approach, with the initial application date of 1 January 2019 and without restating comparative information.
As the balance sheet as at 31 December 2018 will not be restated, any reclassifications and the adjustments arising will be recognised in the opening balance sheet on 1 January 2019.
The Company will use the following practical expedients when applying this Standard retrospectively to leases previously classified as operating leases applying IAS 17.
Company will apply these practical expedients on a lease-by-lease basis: 1.
Company will apply a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics such as leases with a similar remaining lease term for a similar class of underlying asset in a similar economic environment.
Company will elect not to apply the requirements of IFRS 16 to leases for which the lease term ends within 12 months of the date of initial application.
In this case, Company will: i Account for those leases in the same way as short-term leases: and ii Include the cost associated with those leases within the disclosure of short-term lease expense in the annual reporting period that includes the date of initial application.
Company will use hindsight, such as in determining the lease term if the contract contains options to extend or terminate the lease.
The right of use ROU assets will be taken as equal to lease liability as of transaction date.
On adoption of requirements of IFRS 16, the Companys operating profit will improve being the operating lease rental amount that will be replaced by a depreciation charge and interest expense.
This is due to the change in the accounting for expenses of leases that were classified as operating leases under IAS 17.
The Company has designed a new leasing strategy, and the actual impact of the IFRS 16 on lease expense, finance expenses, depreciation, lease liability and right of use of assets to be brought onto the consolidated financial statements as at 1 January 2019 can only be estimated once the new strategy will be implemented.
New strategy includes renegotiation of lease terms, rentals and other services with the lessors, decisions to buy or lease out on case by case basis.
164 NMC Health plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Group Strategic Financial Other Overview Report Governance Statements Information At the date of the financial statement, the following other standards, amendments and Interpretations have not been effective and have not been early adopted by the Company: a IFRIC 23 Uncertainty Over Income Tax Treatments effective 1 January 2019: b Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation Amendments to IFRS 9 effective 1 January 2019: c Annual Improvements to IFRS 2015 2017 Cycle Amendments to IFRS 3, IFRS 11, IAS 12 and IAS 23 effective 1 January 2019: d Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures Amendments to IAS 28 effective 1 January 2019: e Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associates or Joint Venture Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 Available for optional adoption effective date deferred indefinitely: f IFRIC Interpretation 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatment effective 1 January 2019: g Amendments to IAS 19: Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement effective 1 January 2019: and h Transfer to Investment Property Amendments to IAS 40.
