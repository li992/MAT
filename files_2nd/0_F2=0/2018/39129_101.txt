In particular, other items include the deduction of the shareholders interest in the with-profits estate, the value of which is derived by increasing final bonus rates so as to exhaust the estate over the lifetime of the in-force with-profits business.
This is an assumption to give an appropriate valuation.
To be conservative this item is excluded from the expected free surplus generation profile below.
Cash flows are projected on a deterministic basis and are discounted at the appropriate risk discount rate.
The modelled cash flows use the same methodology underpinning the Groups EEV reporting and so are subject to the same assumptions and sensitivities.
The table below shows how the VIF generated by the in-force business and the associated required capital for long-term business operations is modelled as emerging into free surplus over future years.

In each sensitivity calculation, all other assumptions remain unchanged except where they are directly affected by the revised economic conditions.
