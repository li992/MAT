NOTE 11 Goodwill AtNovember 30,2018, the carrying value of our CGUsor cruise brands goodwill balance was$131million 2017 $137million for AIDA, $323million 2017 $336million for Costa and $141million 2017 $146million for Cunard.
P&OCruises UK and P&OCruises Australia donot carry goodwill.
Asof July 31,2018, weperformed our annual goodwill impairment reviews.
For the impairment reviews, the estimated recoverable amounts were based onthe higher of the cruise brands fair value less cost of disposal and its value in use.
Recoverable amounts for our brands that carried goodwill were determined using a discounted future cash flow analysis, after which a terminal growth rate is applied.
Ourannual impairment reviews resulted in nogoodwill impairment for 2018and 2017.
Thedetermination of our cruise brands goodwill fair values includes numerous assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties.
Theprincipal assumptions, all of which are considered Level 3inputs, used in our cash flow analyses consisted of: Forecasted operating results, including net revenue yields and net cruise costs including fuel prices Capacity changes and the expected rotation of vessels into or out of each of these cruise brands, including decisions about the allocation of newships amongst brands, the transfer of ships between brands and the timing of ship dispositions Weighted-average cost of capital of market participants, adjusted for the risk attributable to the geographic regions in which these cruise brands operate, ranged from 6.5% to 8.5% from 7.5% to 9.0% in 2017 Capital expenditures, proceeds from forecasted dispositions of ships, terminal values and long-term perpetuity growth rates of 2.5% or less Thecash flows were estimated based onthose a market participant wouldexpect to derive from the businesses.
For all the cruise brands, weused relevant past experience in determining an estimate of future cash flows.
For AIDA, Costa and Cunard wehave significant headroom.
Based onthe sensitivity analysis performed, no reasonably possible changes in the assumptions wouldcause the carrying amount of the brands goodwill to exceed their recoverable amounts.
We believe that wehave made reasonable estimates and judgements.
Changes in the conditions or circumstances may result in a need to recognize an impairment charge.
