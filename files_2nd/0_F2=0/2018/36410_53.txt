The valuations have been prepared in accordance with the RICS Valuation Global Standards 2017 which incorporate the International Valuation Standards and the RICS Valuation Professional Standards UK January 2014 revised April 2015 the Red Book and have been primarily derived using comparable recent market transactions on arms length terms.
The total fees, including the fee for this assignment, earned by CBRE or other companies forming part of the same group of companies within the UK from the Group are less than 5.0% of total UK revenues.
The principal signatories of the CBRE valuation reports have continuously been the signatories of valuations for the same addressee and valuation purpose as this report since 2012.
CBRE has continuously been carrying out valuation instructions for the Group for in excess of 20 years.
CBRE has carried out valuation, agency and professional services on behalf of the Group for in excess of 20 years.
Real estate valuations are complex and derived using comparable market transactions which are not publicly available and involve an element of judgement.
Therefore, in line with EPRA guidance, we have classified the valuation of the property portfolio as Level 3 as defined by IFRS 13.
There were no transfers between levels during the year.
Inputs to the valuation, including capitalisation yields typicallythe true equivalent yield and rental values, are defined as unobservable as defined by IFRS 13.
Key inputs to the valuation ERV True equivalent yield Average Range Average Range per sq ft per sq ft % % North of Oxford Street Office 71 48 85 4.3 3.9 6.1 Retail 77 34 165 4.1 3.6 5.8 Rest of West End Office 74 44 91 4.6 3.7 5.7 Retail 115 15 295 4.0 2.8 5.7 City, Midtown & Southwark Office 54 45 60 5.1 4.6 5.7 Retail 79 28 122 4.6 4.6 4.7 Everything else being equal, there is a positive relationship between rental values and the property valuation, such that an increase in rental values will increase the valuation of a property and a decrease in rental values will reduce the valuation of the property.
However, the relationship between capitalisation yields and the property valuation is negative: therefore an increase in capitalisation yields will reduce the valuation of a property and a reduction will increase its valuation.
A decrease in the capitalisation yield by 25 basis points would result in an increase in the fair value of the Groups investment property by 135.6 million, whilst a 25 basis point increase would reduce the fair value by 121.3 million.
There are interrelationships between these inputs as they are determined by market conditions, and the valuation movement in any one period depends on the balance between them.
If these inputs move in opposite directions i. e. rental values increase and yields decrease valuation movements can be amplified, whereas if they move in the same direction they may offset, reducing the overall net valuation movement.
Additionally, investment property under development is sensitive to income, cost and developers profit assumptions included in the valuations.
At 31 March 2018, the Group had capital commitments of 131.6 million 2017: 27.1 million.
