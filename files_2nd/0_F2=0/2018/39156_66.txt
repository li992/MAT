Summary of Group retirement schemes UK retirement benefits The UK operates a defined contribution scheme for current employees.
The UKs defined benefit schemes were closed to future accrual on 31 May 2008.
The following four defined benefit schemes are the UKs main schemes: Main staff plan for all historically eligible UK-based staff, excluding PZ Cussons Plc Executive Directors Directors plan for PZ Cussons Plc Executive Directors Expatriate plan for all eligible expatriate staff based outside the UK Unfunded plan unfunded unapproved retirement scheme Current and past employees within these schemes are provided with defined benefits based on service and final salary.
The assets of the schemes are administered by trustees and are held in trust funds independent of the Group.
In relation to the unfunded plan, the Group made payments during the year to former Directors of 172,208 2017: 168,300.
Overseas retirement benefits Outside of the UK the Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution schemes.
Included within Overseas retirement benefits and similar obligations below are the unfunded retirement benefit obligations relating to certain of the Groups overseas subsidiaries and other employee-related provisions for long service and sick leave.
Basis of recognition of pension scheme surplus The trust deeds for the Directors and Main staff plan provides the Group with an unconditional right to a refund of surplus assets assuming the full settlement of plan liabilities in the event of a plan wind-up.
Furthermore, in the ordinary course of business the trustee has no rights to unilaterally wind up, or otherwise augment the benefits due to members of the scheme.
Based on these rights, any net surplus in these two UK schemes are recognised in full.
The trust deed for the Expatriate plan provides the trustees with an unconditional right to wind up the scheme and distribute the surplus to members.
The surplus on the expatriate scheme has been fide-recognised in the current financial year, due to a change in accounting policy under IAS 8, as documented on page 54.
