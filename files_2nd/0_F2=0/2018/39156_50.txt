Goodwill and other intangible assets continued Software includes the ERP system SAP, the implementation and embedding of which was completed during the year ended 31May 2018.
The carrying value of this asset as at 31 May 2018 is 46.8m, with nine years of amortisation remaining.
The carrying amounts of software are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
Goodwill and other intangible assets excluding software, which include the Groups acquired brands, all have indefinite useful lives and are subject to annual impairment testing, or more frequent testing if there are indicators of impairment.
The method used is as follows: Intangible assets including goodwill are allocated to appropriate CGUs based on the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows independently in relation to the specific intangible goodwill.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined through value-in-use calculations that use cash flow projections from approved budgets and plans over a period of five years, which are then extrapolated beyond the five year period based on estimated long-term growth rates.
As the Groups other intangible assets, which represent brand values, and goodwill have all arisen from previous business combinations, CGUs have been identified as the business units acquired, as they represent the smallest group of assets that independently generate cash flows.
This is the case for all intangible assets and goodwill other than the Beauty division and Greece acquired brands where the CGU has been identified as the overall operating unit.

The carrying value of each CGU as used in the value-in-use model may differ to the values disclosed above due to the inclusion ofany non-current assets directly related to driving economic benefit from the brand.
Key assumptions in the budgets and plans include future revenue volume price growth rates, associated future levels of marketing support, cost base of manufacture and supply and directly associated overheads.
These assumptions are based on historical trends and future market expectations specific to each CGU and the markets and geographies in which each CGU operates.
Other key assumptions applied in determining value-in-use are: growth rates short-term growth rates are based on the latest approved management forecasts.
Cash flows beyond the fiveyear period are extrapolated using the estimated long-term growth rate applicable for the geographies in which the CGUsoperate: terminal growth rates: and discount rate the base discount rate is based on a pre-tax Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC for comparable companies operating in similar markets and geographies as the Group, adjusted for risks specific to each CGU.

Goodwill and other intangible assets continued The long-term growth rates and discount rates applied in the value-in-use calculations have been set out below: Pre-tax Pre-tax Long-term Long-term discount discount growth growth rate rate rate rate FY18 FY17 FY18 FY17 Original Source 7.2% 7.4% 2.5% 2.5% Beauty division brands 7.2% 7.4% 2.5% 2.5% Raffertys Garden 7.2% 6.7% 3.3% 2.5% Nutricima 13.4% 14.8% 4.5% 7.0% five:am 7.2% 6.7% 3.3% 2.5% Greece 15.5% 12.0% 1.0% 1.0% The discount rates disclosed above are the pre-tax discount rates applied in the FY18 value-in-use calculations.
Discount rates have been used that reflect the similar geographic and product diversification within each CGUs market and the similar risks associated with each CGU.
Long-term growth rates have been set for each CGU based on estimated long-term growth rates for the territories in which the CGUs operate.
All CGUs, other than Nutricima, operate in geographies that include the UK, Australia, the US and central Europe.
Long-term growth rates have been set with reference to estimated long-term GDP growth forecasts, which have been deemed an appropriate proxy for long-term growth.
The long-term growth rate for the Nutricima CGU reflects the estimated long-term growth rate in the key geography of Nigeria in which the CGU operates and, consistent with the other CGUs, has been set with reference to long-term inflation forecasts.
Having performed the annual impairment tests, no impairment has been recognised for the year ended 31 May 2018 31 May 2017: nil.
In forming this conclusion the Directors reviewed a sensitivity analysis performed by management, which focused on the reasonably possible downsides of key assumptions, both individually and in reasonably possible combinations, and considered whether these reasonably possible downsides give rise to an impairment, with the conclusion that no reasonable possible changes in key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount of the CGU to be less than the carrying value, other than for Nutricima and five:am.
For the Nutricima CGU, the recoverable amount determined by the Directors was 37.9m.
Given that this CGU is located in Nigeria where the macroeconomic environment is volatile, management have had to carefully consider the range of reasonable possible changes in assumptions when performing sensitivity analysis.
The key assumption considered by the Directors, where a reasonably possible change could give rise to impairment, is the gross margin expected to be achieved in the forecast period.
The average gross margin in the initial five year forecast period would need to decrease by 0.3 percentage points to eliminate the current headroom.
Whilst it is not managements current expectation, should Nutricima trading results in FY19 be in line withthose achieved in FY18, which is considered by the Directors to be reasonably possible given the inherent market uncertainty, this would result in an impairment of 3.4m.
For the five:am CGU, the recoverable amount determined by the Directors was 63.3m.
The key assumptions considered by the Directors, where a reasonably possible change could give rise to impairment, were the revenue growth and discount factor applied to the value-in-use model.
The discount factor would need to increase by 1.2 percentage points to eliminate the current headroom.
Were the average revenue growth rates in the initial five year forecast period to decrease by 1.5 percentage points in combination with an increase in the discount rate to 8.25%, which, whilst not managements current expectation, is considered by the Directors to be reasonably possible, this would lead to an impairment charge of 2.4m.
