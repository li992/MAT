NOTES TO THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS 1.
Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies The separate Financial Statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006.
As permitted by that Act, the separate Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
In accordance with the exemption provided by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own income statement or statement of comprehensive income.
a Basis of preparation These Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 'Reduced Disclosure Framework' FRS 101.
The Companys shareholders were notified in 2015 of the use of the EU-adopted IFRS disclosure exemptions and there were no objections to the adoption of FRS 101.
In preparing these Financial Statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU IFRS, but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with the Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken.
The Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures: A Cash Flow Statement and related notes.
Comparative period reconciliations for share capital, tangible fixed assets and intangible assets.
Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly-owned subsidiaries.
Disclosures in respect of capital management.
The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs.
Disclosures in respect of the compensation of key management personnel.
As the Consolidated Financial Statements of Spectris plc pages 92 to 147 include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken the exemptions under FRS 101 available in respect of the following disclosures: IFRS 2 Share Based Payments in respect of Group-settled share-based payments.
Certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement and the disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instrument Disclosures.
The Financial Statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of financial instruments.
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.
The principal accounting policies are set out below.
As permitted by s408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account or statement of comprehensive income for the year.
The profit attributable to the Company is disclosed in the footnote to the Company's balance sheet.
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Financial Statements.
Significant accounting judgements and estimates In determining and applying accounting policies, judgement is often required where the choice of specific policy, assumption or accounting estimate to be followed could materially affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, should it later be determined that a different choice be more appropriate.
Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
In the course of preparing these Financial Statements in accordance with the Groups accounting policies, no judgements that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Financial Statements have been made, other than those involving estimation.
Management considers the following to be areas of estimation for the Company due to greater complexity and or are particularly subject to uncertainty.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty Retirement benefit plans Accounting for retirement benefit plans under IAS 19 revised requires an assessment of the future benefits payable in accordance with actuarial assumptions.
The discount rate and rate of retail price inflation RPI assumptions applied in the calculation of plan liabilities, which are set out in Note 20 to the Group Consolidated Financial Statements, represent a key source of estimation uncertainty for the Company.
Details of the accounting policies applied in respect of retirement benefit plans are set out on page 152.
150 Annual Report and Accounts 2018 150 Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial Statements b Summary of significant accounting policies Intangible assets Intangible assets purchased by the Company are capitalised at their cost.
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.
The estimated useful economic lives are as follows: Software 3 to 5 years.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
The cost comprises the purchase price paid and any costs directly attributable to bringing it into working condition for its intended use.
Depreciation is recognised in the Income Statement on a straight-line basis to write off the cost, less the estimated residual value which is reviewed annually, of property, plant and equipment over its estimated useful economic life.
Depreciation commences on the date the assets are available for use within the business and the asset carrying values are reviewed for impairment when there is an indication that they may be impaired.
Estimated useful lives are as follows: Freehold property 25 years.
Investments Investments in subsidiaries are stated at historical cost, less provision for any impairment in value.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are carried at original invoice amount which is considered a reasonable proxy for fair value and are subsequently held at amortised cost less provision for impairment.
The provision for impairment of receivables is based on lifetime expected credit losses.
Lifetime expected credit losses are calculated by assessing historic credit loss experience, adjusted for factors specific to the receivable and operating company.
Cash and cash equivalents This comprises cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits held on call or with maturities of less than three months at inception.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are recognised at the amounts expected to be paid to counterparties and subsequently held at amortised cost.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the Statement of Financial Position when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources, that can be reliably measured, will be required to settle the obligation.
In respect of warranties, a provision is recognised when the underlying products or services are sold.
Provisions are recognised at an amount equal to the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the Companys liability.
A contingent liability is disclosed where the existence of the obligation will only be confirmed by future events or where the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with reasonable reliability.
Contingent assets are not recognised but are disclosed where an inflow of economic benefit is probable.
Obligations arising from restructuring plans are recognised when detailed formal plans have been established and when there is a valid expectation that such a plan will be carried out.
Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises both current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the Income Statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case tax is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income or the Statement of Changes in Equity, respectively.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the Statement of Financial Position date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of prior years.
Tax positions are reviewed to assess whether a provision should be made based on prevailing circumstances.
Tax provisions are included within current taxation liabilities.
Deferred taxation is provided on taxable temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the Financial Statements and their corresponding tax bases.
Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates expected to apply when the asset is realised or the liability settled based on tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the Statement of Financial Position date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised or that they will reverse.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
Spectris plc 151 Spectris plc 151 NOTES TO THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS continued 1.
Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies continued Foreign currency translation The functional currency of the Company is Sterling and is determined with reference to the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are initially recorded at the functional currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange gains and losses on settlement of foreign currency transactions are translated at the rate prevailing at the date of the transactions, or the translation of monetary assets and liabilities at period end exchange rates, and are charged credited to the Income Statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at historical cost are translated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Financial instruments Recognition The Company recognises financial assets and liabilities on its Statement of Financial Position when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the Balance Sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Measurement When financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised, they are measured at fair value, being the consideration given or received plus directly attributable transaction costs.
Originated loans and debtors are initially recognised in accordance with the policy stated above and subsequently re-measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Allowance for impairment is estimated on a case-by-case basis.
The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge risks associated with foreign exchange fluctuations.
These are designated as cash flow hedges.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Company documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Company documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
Amounts deferred in equity are reclassified to the Income Statement in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in the Income Statement, in the same line of the Income Statement as the recognised hedged item.
However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Company revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the Income Statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
Derecognition A financial asset is derecognised when the Company loses control over the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset.
This occurs when the rights are realised, expire or are surrendered.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Originated loans and debtors are derecognised on the date they are transferred by the Company.
Impairment of financial assets The Company assesses at each Statement of Financial Position reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset, or group of financial assets, is impaired.
A financial asset, or group of financial assets, is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that have occurred after the initial recognition of the asset an incurred loss event and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
Employee benefits The Company operates a defined benefit post-retirement benefit plan and a defined contribution pension plan.
Defined benefit plan The Companys net obligation recognised in the Balance Sheet in respect of its defined benefit plan is calculated as the present value of the plans liabilities less the fair value of the plans assets.
The operating and financing costs of defined benefit plan are recognised separately in the Income Statement.
Operating costs comprise the current service cost, plan administrative expense, any gains or losses on settlement or curtailments, and past service costs where benefits have vested.
Finance items comprise the unwinding of the discount on the net asset deficit.
Actuarial gains or losses comprising changes in plan liabilities due to experience and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in other comprehensive income.
The amount of any pension fund asset recognised in the Balance Sheet is limited to any future refunds from the plan or the present value of reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Defined contribution plan A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised in the Income Statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.
152 Annual Report and Accounts 2018 152 Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial Statements Short-term benefits Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.
A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Share-based payments Certain employees of the Company receive part of their remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares equity-settled transactions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured at fair value at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value of share awards with market-related vesting conditions is determined by an external consultant and the fair value at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Companys estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each Balance Sheet reporting date up to the vesting date, at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the actual outcome of awards which have vested.
No adjustment is made to the fair value after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or not exercised.
Where it is not possible to incentivise managers of the Company with equity-settled options, they are issued with cash-settled options.
The charge for these awards is adjusted to reflect the expected and actual levels of options that vest and the fair value is based on either the share price at date of exercise or the share price at the balance sheet date if sooner.
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries, it recognises an increase in the cost of investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity-settled share-based payment charge recognised in the subsidiarys Financial Statements with the corresponding credit being recognised directly in equity.
In cases where a subsidiary is recharged for the share-based payment expense, no such increase in investment is recognised which may result in a credit in a particular year.
Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved by shareholders.
Treasury shares Shares held in treasury are treated as a deduction from equity until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental costs and related tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company's equity shareholders.
Auditors remuneration The details regarding the remuneration of the Companys auditor are included in Note 5 to the Group Consolidated Financial Statements under Fees payable to the Companys auditor for audit of the Companys annual accounts.
Employee costs and other information Average number of employees on a full-time equivalent basis: 2018 2017 Number Number Administrative 86 67 Employee costs, including Directors remuneration, are as follows: 2018 2017 m m Wages and salaries 16.6 13.8 Social security costs 2.6 2.5 Defined contribution pension plans 0.5 0.4 Equity-settled share-based payment expense 3.2 2.2 Cash-settled share-based payment expense 0.1 0.1 23.0 19.0 Directors remuneration Further details of Directors remuneration and share options are given in Note 6 to the Group Consolidated Financial Statements and in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 60 to 78.
Tax losses As at 31 December 2018, the Company had capital tax losses of 16.4m 2017: 16.4m.
No provision has been made for deferred tax on the basis that there is insufficient evidence that suitable taxable profits will arise in the future against which the losses may be offset and the asset recovered.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents at 31 December 2017 included 2.4m of restricted cash which was held in escrow relating to the acquisition of Millbrook in 2016.
This was paid during the year.
