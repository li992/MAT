The basis of classification for financial liabilities under IFRS 9 remains unchanged from under IAS 39.
All financial liabilities continue to be classified as amortised cost, with no financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss.
There was no change to carrying value of financial liabilities at 1 January 2018.
Impairment of financial assets Under IFRS 9, an expected credit loss ECL model replaces the incurred loss model, meaning there no longer needs to be a triggering event in order to recognise impairment losses.
A credit loss provision must be made for the amount of any loss expected to arise, whereas under IAS 39, credit losses are recognised when they are incurred.
See note 1.12 for more detail on the ECL model.
Impact of the new impairment model The initial application of IFRS 9s impairment requirements at 1 January 2018 resulted in an additional impairment provision as follows: '000 Loss provision at 31 December 2017 under IAS 39 66 Additional impairment recognised at 1 January 2018 on: treasury book: cash and balances with central banks 92 loans and advances to banks 3 debt securities 31 loans and advances to customers: investment management loan book 1 21 trust and financial planning debtors 148 Loss provision at 1 January 2018 under IFRS 9 214 Additional impairment recognised at 1 January 2018 relate to financial assets classified and measured at amortised cost.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 changes how and when revenue is recognised from contracts with customers and the treatment of the costs of obtaining a contract with a customer.
The standard requires that the recognition of revenue is linked to the fulfilment of identified performance obligations that are enshrined in the customer contract.
It also requires that the incremental cost of obtaining a customer contract should be capitalised if that cost is expected to be recovered.
The standard replaces existing revenue recognition guidance, in particular under IAS 18.

Client requirements, as described in note 1.12. relationship intangible assets with a carrying value of 8,268,000 were recognised as a result of additional costs capitalised under the new policy.

Impact on financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018 The group has considered the impact of adopting the standard, on its existing revenue streams, as well as on its policy of capitalising Impairment of financial assets the cost of obtaining customer contracts.
Under IFRS 9, an expected credit loss ECL model replaces the incurred loss model, meaning there no longer needs to be a triggering event in order to recognise impairment losses.
A credit loss provision must be made for the amount of any loss expected to arise, Net fee and commission income whereas under IAS 39, credit losses are recognised when they are incurred.
Included within net fee and commission income are initial fees, charged by a number of group companies in relation to certain business activities.
Under IFRS 15, the group has made an assessment as to whether the work performed to earn such fees constitutes Impact of the new impairment model the transfer of services and, therefore, fulfils any performance obligation s. If so, then these fees can be recognised when the relevant The initial application of IFRS 9s impairment requirements at 1 January 2018 resulted in an additional impairment provision as follows: performance obligation has been satisfied: if not, then the fees can only be recognised in the period in which the services are provided.
'000 The adoption of IFRS 15 has not had a significant impact on the groups accounting policies for revenue recognition, as the application Loss provision at 31 December 2017 under IAS 39 66 of the new requirements does not change the treatment under previous guidance, in particular IAS 18, apart from a small change in Additional impairment recognised at 1 January 2018 on: how we recognise certain fees in Rathbone Trust Company.

The policy is unchanged in all other respects.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers The group has also identified a number of other remuneration schemes where awards are linked to obtaining client contracts and has considered whether any meet the new criteria for capitalising costs under IFRS 15.
The group has determined that the adoption of the IFRS 15 changes how and when revenue is recognised from contracts with customers and the treatment of the costs of obtaining new standard has not resulted in any awards made under these schemes being capitalised.
The costs of these awards continue to be a contract with a customer.
