Accounting judgements Accounting for inventory involves the use of judgements and estimates, particularly related to the measurement and valuation of work in progress inventory within the production process.
Certain estimates, including expected metal recoveries and work in progress volumes, are calculated by engineers using available industry, engineering and scientific data.
Estimates used are periodically reassessed by the Group taking into account technical analysis and historical performance.
Accounting policy See note 38E for the Groups accounting policy on inventories.
TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES Overview Trade receivables are amounts due from the Groups customers for commodities and services the Group has provided.
Many of the Groups sales are provisionally priced, which means that the price is finalised at a date after the sale takes place.
When there is uncertainty about the final amount that will be received, the receivable is marked to market based on the forward price.
Trade and other receivables also includes amounts receivable for VAT and other indirect taxes, prepaid expenses and amounts receivable from others for non-sale transactions.
Contract assets represent prepaid freight costs for sales contracts where the Group has an outstanding performance obligation to provide freight services.

The expected credit losses on trade receivables are estimated using a provision matrix by reference to past default experience and credit rating, adjusted as appropriate for current observable data.
Of the year end trade receivables balance, $27 million 2017: $42 million were past due, stated after an associated impairment provision of$18 million 2017:$18million.
The overdue debtor ageing profile is typical of the industry in which certain of the Groups businesses operate.
Given this, theuse of payment security instruments including letters of credit from acceptable financial institutions, and the nature of the related counterparties, these amounts areconsidered recoverable.
The historical level of customer default is minimal and there is no current observable data to indicate a material future default.
As a result the credit quality of year end trade receivables is considered tobe high.
Trade receivables do not incur any interest, are principally short-term in nature and are measured at their nominal value with the exception of receivables relating to provisionally priced sales, as set out in the revenue recognition accounting policy, see note 38C, net of appropriate provision for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
