easyJet has one cash-generating unit, being its route network.
The recoverable amount of goodwill and other assets with indefinite expected useful lives has been determined based on calculations of the value in use of the route network.
Pre-tax cash flow projections have been derived from the strategic plan presented to the Board for the period up to 2023, using the following key assumptions: Pre-tax discount rate derived from weighted average cost of capital 9.4% Fuel price US dollars per metric tonne 725 Long-term economic growth rate 2.0% Exchange rates: US dollar 1.35 Euro 1.13 Swiss franc 1.35 Both fuel price and exchange rates are volatile in nature, and the assumptions used represent management's view of reasonable average rates.
Operating margins are sensitive to significant changes in these rates.
Cash flow projections beyond the forecast period have been extrapolated using an estimated average of long-term economic growth rates for the principal countries in which easyJet operates.
The impairment model is sensitive to a sustained significant adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates.
No reasonably possible combination of changes to the key assumptions above would be expected to impact the net cash flows in a way that would result in the carrying value of the cash-generating unit exceeding its recoverable amount.
