Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Group Company Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1.
Segmental Analysis The Groups operating segments are determined based on the Groups internal reporting to the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
The CODM has been determined to be the Group Chief Executive, with support from the Board.
The performance of operating segments is assessed on profits before interest and tax, excluding equity-settled share option charges recognised under IFRS 2 Share-based payment and unrealised foreign exchange gains or losses on derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting.
The activities, products and services of the operating segments are detailed in the Strategic Report on page 38.
The Property Management segment holds properties and property leases which are sublet to other segments and external parties.
The NEXT International Retail segment comprises franchise and wholly owned stores overseas.
International online sales are included in the NEXT Online formerly NEXT Directory segment.
Where third-party branded goods are sold on a commission basis, only the commission receivable is included in statutory revenue.
Total sales represents the full customer sales value of commission based sales and interest income, excluding VAT.
Segmental Analysis continued Segment profit During the year to January 2018, the recharges between NEXT Retail and NEXT Online were altered to better reflect the costs of the standalone businesses.
Prior year segment profit results for 2017 have been restated to provide comparability.

Taxation Tax charge for the year Our tax charge for the year is shown below.
Tax is made up of current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the amount payable on the taxable income in the year and any adjustments to tax payable in previous years.
Deferred tax is explained on page 119.
2018 2017 m m Current tax: Current tax on profits for the year 147.8 157.1 Adjustments in respect of prior years 12.2 Total current tax 135.6 157.1 Deferred tax: Origination and reversal of temporary differences 6.3 1.1 Adjustments in respect of prior years 5.0 3.3 Tax expense reported in the Consolidated Income Statement 134.3 154.9 Included within the adjustments in respect of prior years is an amount of 3.2m relating to the closure of open tax filings with HMRC.
Factors affecting the tax charge in the year The tax rate for the current year varied from the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK due to the following factors: 2018 2017 % % UK corporation tax rate 19.2 20.0 Non-deductible expenses 0.5 0.6 Overseas tax differentials 0.2 0.6 Adjustments in respect of prior years 1.0 0.4 Effective total tax rate on profit before taxation 18.5 19.6 118 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Group Company 6.

Deferred tax assets represent the amounts of income taxes recoverable in the future in respect of those differences, while deferred tax liabilities represent the amounts of income taxes payable in the future in respect of those differences.
The deferred tax asset liability is made up of: 2018 2017 m m Accelerated capital allowances 2.5 0.4 Revaluation of derivatives to fair value 9.1 5.2 Pension benefit obligations 18.1 10.7 Share-based payments 7.7 3.3 Other temporary differences 4.6 7.3 5.8 5.7 2018 2017 The deferred tax movement in the year is as follows: m m At the beginning of the year 5.7 2.7 Recognised in the Income Statement: Accelerated capital allowances 2.9 0.7 Revaluation of derivatives to fair value 0.1 0.1 Pension benefit obligations 1.7 Share-based payments 1.0 2.1 Other temporary differences 2.7 5.4 Recognised in Other Comprehensive Income 6.8 2.2 Recognised in the Statement of Changes in Equity 3.4 12.8 At the end of the year 5.8 5.7 119 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 6.
Taxation continued Deferred tax continued Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses carried forward to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable.
No recognition has been made of the following deferred tax assets: Unrecognised Unrecognised Gross value deferred tax Gross value deferred tax 2018 2018 2017 2017 m m m m Capital losses 27.9 4.7 34.5 5.8 The benefit of unrecognised capital losses will only accrue if taxable profits are realised on future disposals of the Groups capital assets.
Factors affecting tax charges in future years Changes to the UK corporation tax rates were substantively enacted as part of the Finance Bill 2016 on 6 September 2016.
These include reductions to the main rate of corporation tax to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to 17% from 1 April 2020.
Deferred taxes at the balance sheet date have been measured using these enacted tax rates and reflected in these financial statements.
The Groups effective tax rate is forecast to remain broadly in line with the current year.
Provisions, which are immaterial to the accounts, have been recognised in relation to uncertain tax positions.
These relate to the interpretation of tax legislation, including changes arising from the OECDs Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project, that impact our NEXT Sourcing operation in its ordinary course of business.
Any uncertainty is likely to lessen as the business responds to these rule changes.
NEXT manages its tax affairs responsibly and proactively to comply with tax legislation.
We seek to build solid and constructive working relationships with all tax authorities.

Earnings Per Share 2018 2017 Basic Earnings Per Share 416.7p 441.3p Basic Earnings Per Share is based on the profit for the year attributable to the equity holders of the Parent Company divided by the net of the weighted average number of shares ranking for dividend less the weighted average number of shares held by the ESOT during the period.
2018 2017 Diluted Earnings Per Share 415.7p 438.1p Diluted Earnings Per Share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares used for the calculation of basic Earnings Per Share as increased by the dilutive effect of potential ordinary shares.
Dilutive shares arise from employee share option schemes where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the period.
Their dilutive effect is calculated on the basis of the equivalent number of nil cost options.
Where the option price is above the average market price, the option is not dilutive and is excluded from the diluted EPS calculation.
There were 4,779,181 non-dilutive share options in the current year 2017: 2,578,878.
2018 2017 Fully diluted Earnings Per Share 399.7p 426.2p Fully diluted Earnings Per Share is based on the weighted average number of shares used for the calculation of basic Earnings Per Share, increased by the weighted average total employee share options outstanding during the period.
Underlying fully diluted Earnings Per Share is used for the purposes of the Share Matching Plan, described further in Note 22.
The table below shows the key variables used in the Earnings Per Share calculations: 2018 2017 Profit after tax attributable to equity holders of the Parent Company m 591.8 635.3 Weighted average number of shares millions Weighted average shares in issue 146.7 148.4 Weighted average shares held by ESOT 4.7 4.4 Weighted average shares for basic EPS 142.0 144.0 Weighted average dilutive potential shares 0.4 1.0 Weighted average shares for diluted EPS 142.4 145.0 Weighted average shares for basic EPS 142.0 144.0 Weighted average total share options outstanding 6.0 5.1 Weighted average shares for fully diluted EPS 148.0 149.1 As detailed in the Remuneration Report, the annual bonus for executive directors is determined by reference to underlying pre-tax Earnings per Share of 511.3p 2017: 548.9p.
This is calculated using 52 week underlying pre-tax profit of 726.1m 2017: 790.2m as shown in Note 1 divided by the net of the weighted average number of shares in issue less the weighted average number of shares held by the ESOT during the period.

As this exceeded carrying value for each of the cash generating units concerned, no impairment loss was recognised 2017: nil.
NEXT Sourcing The key assumptions in testing the goodwill for impairment are the future sourcing requirements of the Group and the ability of NEXT Sourcing to meet these requirements based on past experience.
In assessing value in use, budgets for the next year were used and extrapolated for four further years using a growth rate of -10% 2017: 0% growth rate and discounted at 10% 2017: 10%.
Lipsy In assessing the recoverable amount of goodwill, internal budgets for next year were used and extrapolated for nine further years using a growth rate of 2% 2017: 2% and discounted at 12% 2017: 12%.
For both NEXT Sourcing and Lipsy, the calculated value in use significantly exceeded the carrying value of the goodwill.
Therefore, there is no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions that would give rise to an impairment.

Pension Benefits The Group operates three pension arrangements in the UK: the Next Group Pension Plan the Original Plan, the 2013 NEXT Group Pension Plan the 2013 Plan and the NEXT Supplementary Pension Arrangement the SPA.
The Groups UK pension arrangements include defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
The Original Plan and 2013 Plan are established under trust law and comply with all relevant UK legislation.
Pension assets are held in separate trustee administered funds which have equal pension rights with respect to members of either sex in so far as this is required by current legislation.
The defined benefit section was closed to new members in 2000 and over recent years the Group has taken steps to manage the ongoing risks associated with its defined benefit liabilities.
The Group also provides additional retirement benefits through the SPA to some plan members whose benefits would otherwise be affected by the lifetime allowance.
The Original Plan comprises predominantly members with pensions in payment, following the transfer of active and deferred members and associated liabilities to the 2013 Plan.
The risks associated with the payment of pensions of the Original Plan have been largely mitigated by the purchase of two insurance contracts buy-ins with Aviva in 2010 and 2012 to cover the liabilities of this Plan, although it remains the ultimate responsibility of the Company to provide members with benefits.
The pensions and matching insurance contracts held by the Original Plan are being converted to buy-out and the Original Plan will then be dissolved.
The 2013 Plan was established in 2013 via the transfer of liabilities and assets from the Original Plan.
This arrangement provides benefits to the majority of members whose pensions were not insured with Aviva.
From November 2012, the future accrual of benefits for remaining active employee members has been based on pensionable earnings frozen at that time, rather than final earnings.
Further information on the Groups pension arrangements is given in the Remuneration Report on page 79.
Principal risks The following table summarises the principal risks associated with the Groups defined benefit arrangements: Investment risk The present value of defined benefit liabilities is calculated using a discount rate set by reference to high quality corporate bond yields.
If plan assets underperform corporate bonds, this will create a deficit.
Investment risk in the Original Plan is negligible, as almost all liabilities in this plan are covered by the insurance contracts.
The strategic allocation of assets in the 2013 Plan is currently weighted towards equity assets as its liability profile is relatively immature and it is expected that these asset classes will, over the long term, outperform gilts and corporate bonds.
Interest rate risk A fall in corporate bond yields would increase the value of the liabilities.
This would be only partially offset by an increase in the value of bond investments held.
Inflation risk Pensions in payment are increased annually in line with RPI or CPI for Guaranteed Minimum Pensions built up since 1988.
Pensions built up since 2005 are capped at 2.5% and pensions built up between 1997 and 2005 are capped at 5%.
When discretionary increases have been awarded for pensions built up before 1997, they too have tended to reflect RPI, capped at 2.5%.
Therefore an increase in inflation would increase the value of pension liabilities.
The assets would be expected to also increase, to the extent that they are linked to inflation, but this would not be expected to fully match the increase in liabilities.
Longevity risk The present value of the defined benefit liabilities is calculated having regards to a best estimate of the mortality of plan members.
If members live longer than this mortality assumption, this will increase the liabilities.
The buy-in insurance contracts represent over 99% of the Original Plan pension liabilities and 18% of the total pension liabilities.
This partially offsets the total risks described above.

The fair values of the above equity and debt instruments are determined based on quoted prices in active markets.
The property assets relate to investments in property funds and their fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets.
The majority of the benefits within the Original Plan are covered by two insurance contracts with Aviva.
The insurance assets have been valued so as to match the defined benefit obligations, the value of which was calculated by Aviva.
Principal assumptions The IAS 19 accounting valuation of the defined benefit obligation was undertaken by an external qualified actuary as at January 2018 using the projected unit credit method.
The principal actuarial assumptions used in the valuation were as follows: 2018 2017 Original 2013 and Original 2013 and Plan SPA Plan SPA Discount rate 2.40% 2.50% 2.65% 2.80% Inflation RPI 3.45% 3.20% 3.60% 3.40% Inflation CPI 2.45% 2.20% 2.60% 2.40% Salary increases Pension increases in payment RPI with a maximum of 5.0% 3.15% 3.00% 3.25% 3.10% RPI with a maximum of 2.5% and discretionary increases 2.05% 1.95% 2.10% 2.00% 2018 2017 NonNonPensioner pensioner Pensioner pensioner aged 65 aged 45 aged 65 aged 45 Life expectancy at age 65 years Male 22.7 24.5 22.9 23.3 Female 25.0 26.7 25.3 25.8 The discount rate has been derived as the single average discount rate appropriate to the term of the liabilities, based on the yields available on high quality Sterling corporate bonds.
The expected average duration of the Original Plans liabilities is 13 years and for the SPA and 2013 Plans it is 26 years.
The rate of retail price inflation RPI has been derived in a consistent way to the discount rate, so that it is appropriate to the term of the liabilities.
As in previous years, the RPI assumption for the 2013 and SPA allow for the inflation risk premium of 0.2% per annum whereas that for the Original Plan does not, because its assets and liabilities are almost fully matched.
130 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Group Company 18.
Pension Benefits continued Principal assumptions continued The rate of consumer price inflation CPI is set at 1.0% lower than the assumption for retail price inflation, reflecting the long term expected gap between the two indices.
For the 2013 Plan and the SPA, the base mortality assumptions reflect the best estimate output from a postcode mortality study.
This results in an assumption in line with the standard SAPS Series 2 All Pensioner tables with a multiplier of 95% for males and 92% for females with improvements in line with the CMI 2015 Core Projection model with a long term trend towards 1.5% per annum from 2007 to 2016.
Future improvements from 2016 have been allowed for in line with the most recent CMI 2016 core projection model with a long term trend towards 1.5% per annum.
The base mortality assumption for the Original Plan is in line with the standard SAPS Series 1 All Pensioner tables with medium cohort improvements to 2009 and CMI 2013 improvements with a long term trend towards 1.5% per annum from 2009 to 2016.
Future improvements from 2016 have been allowed for in line with the most recent CMI 2016 core projection model, with a long term trend towards 1.5% per annum.
Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity of the net pension asset to changes in the principal assumptions is: Impact on net pension asset Sensitivity analysis as at 27 January 2018 Discount rate 0.5% decrease 89.2m decrease Price inflation 0.5% increase to RPI and CPI 48.6m decrease Price inflation 0.1% decrease to CPI i. e. increase in the gap between RPI and CPI 4.4m increase Mortality Life expectancy increased by one year 21.9m decrease The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
Aside from the matching insurance contracts held in the Original Plan, no allowance has been made for any change in assets that might arise under any of the scenarios set out above.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the significant assumptions, the same method has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The inflation assumption impacts the pension increases in payment and deferred pension calculations.
The sensitivities shown are just one possible outcome and should not be taken as an indication of the likelihood of a change occurring in the future.
Economic markets have been particularly volatile in recent months and market metrics used to derive the discount rate and price inflation assumptions could increase or decrease in the future, by more or less than the change set out.
Full actuarial valuation The latest full actuarial valuation of the 2013 Plan was undertaken as at 30 September 2016 by Willis Towers Watson who act as Actuary to the Trustees.
The valuation showed a funding deficit on the Technical Provisions basis required by legislation of 70.2m at that date.
The Group has agreed a recovery plan to meet the funding deficit, which is intended to restore the Plan assets to a fully funded position on a Technical Provisions basis by 30 September 2021.
Under that agreement, the Group will contribute five annual payments of up to 14.0m by 31 January each year.
The first payment of 14.0m under this agreement was made in January 2017 and future contributions will only be required to be paid to the extent that there is a funding deficit at the preceding 31 December.
At 31 December 2017 the 2013 Plan was estimated to be fully funded on a Technical Provisions basis with a surplus in the region of 37m, therefore a deficit contribution was not payable in January 2018.
With effect from January 2018, the Company also agreed to pay contributions of 31.3% per annum of members frozen pensionable salaries as at 31 October 2012 towards the future accrual of benefits for active members, an increase from 17.5% per annum.
131 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 18.
Pension Benefits continued Contributions Members of the Defined Benefit Section of the 2013 Plan contribute 3% or 5% of pensionable earnings.
With effect from January 2018, employer contributions increased from 17.5% per annum to 31.3% c6m to c8m per annum.
Members of the defined contribution section contribute 3% or 5% of pensionable earnings which is matched by the Group.
Contributions paid by the Group are set out below: 2018 2017 m m Defined contribution recognised as an expense 11.6 10.8 Automatic enrolment recognised as an expense 1.8 1.8 Defined benefit 8.4 27.2 21.8 39.8 The 27.2m paid into the defined benefit section of the 2013 Plan in 2017 included an additional contribution of 14m paid in respect of the recovery plan agreed with the Trustees following the September 2016 full actuarial valuation and a prepayment of contributions of 6m for the cost of future accrual in the year to January 2018.
Employer contributions to the defined benefit section in the year ahead are expected to be around 22m assuming a contribution of 14m is paid in January 2019, although in practice this is contingent on there being a deficit on a funding Technical Provisions basis at this time refer to details in Full actuarial valuation section above.
Employer contributions for the defined contribution scheme is expected to be similar in the year ahead.
Employer contributions for the automatic enrolment scheme are expected to increase to around 9m, including salary sacrifice contributions.

Share-based Payments The Group operates a number of share-based payment schemes as follows: Management share options The NEXT Management Share Option Plan provides for options over shares, exercisable between three and ten years following their grant, to be allocated to Group employees at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
This plan is primarily aimed at middle management and senior store staff.
No options were granted to any directors or changes made to existing entitlements in the year under review.
No employee is entitled to be granted options under the scheme if, in the same financial year, they have received an award under NEXTs Long Term Incentive Plan or Share Matching Plan.
The total number of options which can be granted is subject to limits.
There are no cash-settlement alternatives and they are therefore accounted for under IFRS 2 as equity-settled awards.
Option prices are set at the prevailing market price at the time of grant.
The maximum total market value of shares i. e. the acquisition price of shares over which options may be granted to any person during any financial year of the Company is three times salary, excluding bonuses and benefits in kind.
This limit may be increased to five times salary in circumstances considered by the Committee to be exceptional, for example on the grant of options following recruitment.
Grants are generally made annually.
Sharesave options The Companys Save As You Earn Sharesave scheme is open to all UK employees.
Invitations to participate are generally issued annually and the scheme is subject to HMRC rules.
The current maximum monthly savings for the schemes detailed below is 250.
Options are granted at the prevailing market rate less a discount of 20% and are exercisable three or five years from the date of grant.
A similar Sharesave scheme is open to the Companys Eire employees.
Sharesave options are also accounted for as equity-settled awards under IFRS 2.
Management and Sharesave options The following table summarises the movements in Management and Sharesave options during the year: 2018 2017 Weighted Weighted average average No.
Share-based Payments continued Management and Sharesave options continued Options were exercised on a regular basis throughout the year and the weighted average share price during this period was 44.24 2017: 52.89.
Options outstanding at January 2018 are exercisable at prices ranging between 10.81 and 70.80 2017: 10.81 and 70.80 and have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 6.0 years 2017: 5.7 years, as analysed below: 2018 2017 Weighted Weighted average average remaining remaining contractual contractual No.
From January 2014, executive directors are no longer granted SMP awards.
Participants who invest a proportion of any annual cash bonus in NEXT shares will receive up to a maximum of two times the original number of shares they purchase with their bonus.
Any matching is conditional upon achieving performance measures over the following three years.
The maximum matching ratio available under the SMP rules is 3:1, matching the pre-tax equivalent of the amount invested in shares.
For any SMP grants made from 2018, participants will be entitled to receive ordinary and special dividend accruals on any awards vesting under the SMP.
The Remuneration Committees policy is to set performance measures by reference to underlying fully diluted post-tax EPS but the Committee has flexibility to use different measures.
Under the formulae, a notional adjustment is made to actual EPS achieved for special dividends, on the basis that the cash distributed had instead been used to purchase shares at the prevailing share price on the day of the special dividend payment.
The following table summarises the movements in nil cost SMP options during the year: 2018 2017 No.

SMP options were exercised at different times in the year and the weighted average share price during this period was 43.12 2017: 52.47.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP As explained in the Remuneration Report, the Group operates an LTIP scheme for executive directors and other senior executives.
Prior to January 2014, all LTIP awards were accounted for as cash-settled share-based payments.
From January 2014 onwards, new LTIP grants to executive directors are settled in shares with no cash-settlement alternative.
Awards to other senior executives were generally cash-settled until March 2017, since that date they are settled in shares.
As a result, all LTIP awards were accounted for under IFRS 2 as equity-settled in the year ended 27 January 2018.
Performance conditions for the LTIP awards are detailed in the Remuneration Report.

The weighted average remaining contractual life of these awards in 2018 was nil years 2017: 1.4 years.
Fair value calculations The fair value of Management, Sharesave and SMP options granted is calculated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price over a period equivalent to the expected life of the option.
The expected life applied in the model is based on historical analyses of exercise patterns, taking into account any early exercises.
The following table lists the inputs to the model used for options granted in the years ended 27 January 2018 and 28 January 2017 based on information at the date of grant: Management share options granted in April 2018 2017 Share price at date of grant 41.09 54.10 Exercise price 41.09 54.10 Volatility 25.90% 20.60% Expected life 4 years 4 years Risk free rate 0.32% 0.64% Dividend yield 3.85% 2.83% Weighted average fair value per option 5.35 6.22 135 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 22.

Financial Instruments: Risk Management and Hedging Activities NEXT operates a centralised treasury function which is responsible for managing the liquidity, interest and foreign currency risks associated with the Groups activities.
As part of its strategy for the management of these risks, the Group uses financial instruments.
In accordance with the Groups treasury policy, financial instruments are not entered into for speculative purposes.
Treasury policy is reviewed and approved by the Board and specifies the parameters within which treasury operations must be conducted, including authorised counterparties, instrument types and transaction limits, and principles governing the management of liquidity, interest and foreign currency risks.
The Groups financial instruments, also includes cash, short term deposits, bank overdrafts, loans, and corporate bonds.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
In addition, the Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables arising directly from its operations.
Liquidity risk The Group manages its cash and borrowing requirements centrally to minimise net interest expense within risk parameters agreed by the Board, whilst ensuring that the Group has sufficient liquid resources to meet the operating needs of its businesses.
The forecast cash and borrowings profile of the Group is monitored to ensure that adequate headroom remains under committed borrowing facilities.

135.0m of this facility was drawn down at January 2018 2017: nil.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to fair value interest rate risk on its fixed rate corporate bonds and cash flow interest rate risk on floating rate bank loans and overdrafts.
The forecast cash and borrowings profile of the Group is monitored regularly to assess the mix of fixed and variable rate debt, and the Group uses interest rate derivatives where appropriate to reduce its exposure to changes in interest rates and the economic environment.
Interest rates: fair value hedges The Group has interest rate swap agreements in place as fair value hedges of part of the interest rate risk associated with the corporate bonds.
Under the terms of the swaps, which have the same key features as the bonds, the Group receives a fixed rate of interest equivalent to the relevant coupon rate, and pays a variable rate.
The Group also has interest rate swaps where the Group receives a variable rate of interest, and pays a fixed rate.
Details of the aggregate rates payable are given in Note 17.
The fair values of the Groups interest rate swaps, including accrued interest, are as follows: 2018 2017 m m Derivatives in designated fair value hedging relationships 35.7 40.8 The fair values of derivatives have been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates and are based on-market prices at the balance sheet date.
Foreign currency risk The Groups principal foreign currency exposures arise from the purchase of overseas sourced products.
Group policy allows for these exposures to be hedged for up to 24 months ahead in order to fix the cost in Sterling.
This hedging activity involves the use of spot, forward and option contracts.
The market value of outstanding foreign exchange contracts is reported regularly at Board level, and reviewed in conjunction with percentage cover taken by season and current market conditions in order to assess and manage the Groups ongoing exposure.
The Group does not have a material exposure to currency movements in relation to the translation of overseas investments and consequently does not hedge any such exposure.
The Groups net exposure to foreign currencies, taking hedging activities into account, is illustrated by the sensitivity analysis in Note 27.

Risk is further mitigated by diversification and limiting counterparty exposure.
All customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and provision is made for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the Online customer base being large and diverse.
The Groups outstanding receivables balances are detailed in Note 11.
Capital risk The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, as analysed in Note 28, and equity attributable to the equity holders of the Parent Company, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
The Group manages its capital with the objective that all entities within the Group continue as going concerns while maintaining an efficient structure to minimise the cost of capital.
The Group is not restricted by any externally imposed capital requirements.
As part of its strategy for delivering sustainable long term growth in Earnings Per Share, the Group has been returning capital to shareholders by way of share buybacks in addition to dividends including special dividends.
Share buybacks may be transacted through both on-market purchases and off-market contingent contracts.

Financial Instruments: Fair Values The fair values of each category of the Groups financial instruments are the same as their carrying values in the Groups Balance Sheet, other than as noted below: 2018 2017 Carrying Carrying amount Fair value amount Fair value m m m m Corporate bonds In hedging relationships 458.5 478.8 463.5 478.5 Not in hedging relationships 450.0 487.9 450.0 481.3 908.5 966.7 913.5 959.8 Corporate bonds are held at amortised cost adjusted for the effect of the change in fair value hedge.
The fair values of corporate bonds are their market values at the balance sheet date IFRS 13 Level 1 reflecting quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Market values include accrued interest and changes in credit risk and interest rate risk, and are therefore different to the reported carrying amounts.
Financial Instruments: Sensitivity Analysis Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Groups principal foreign currency exposures are to US Dollars and the Euro.
The table below illustrates the hypothetical sensitivity of the Groups reported profit and closing equity to a 10% increase and decrease in the US Dollar Sterling and Euro Sterling exchange rates at the year end date, assuming all other variables remain unchanged.
The sensitivity rate of 10% represents the directors assessment of a reasonably possible change, based on historic volatility.
The analysis assumes that exchange rate fluctuations on currency derivatives that form part of an effective cash flow hedge relationship affect the fair value reserve in equity and the fair value of the hedging derivatives.
For foreign exchange derivatives which are not designated hedges, movements in exchange rates impact the Income Statement.
Positive figures represent an increase in profit or equity.
Income statement Equity 2018 2017 2018 2017 m m m m Sterling strengthens by 10% US Dollar 1.6 3.6 46.5 64.2 Euro 2.7 2.2 Sterling weakens by 10% US Dollar 1.8 0.4 57.8 73.0 Euro 3.3 2.7 Year end exchange rates applied in the above analysis are US Dollar 1.42 2017: 1.25 and Euro 1.14 2017: 1.17.
Strengthening and weakening of Sterling may not produce symmetrical results depending on the proportion and nature of foreign exchange derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting.

Financial Instruments: Sensitivity Analysis continued Interest rate sensitivity analysis The table below illustrates the hypothetical sensitivity of the Groups reported profit and closing equity to a 0.5% increase or decrease in interest rates, assuming all other variables were unchanged.
The sensitivity rate of 0.5% represents the directors assessment of a reasonably possible change, based on historic volatility.
The analysis has been prepared using the following assumptions: For floating rate assets and liabilities, the amount of the asset or liability outstanding at the balance sheet date is assumed to have been outstanding for the whole year.
Fixed rate financial instruments that are carried at amortised cost are not subject to interest rate risk for the purpose of this analysis.
