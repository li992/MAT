Risk Management As an investment trust, the Company invests in equities and other investments for the long term so as to secure its investment objective as stated on page 1.
In pursuit of its investment objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the revenue returns available for distribution.
The Companys financial instruments comprise mainly of equity investments, cash balances, borrowings, debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations.
The principal risks inherent in managing the Companys financial instruments are market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
These risks and the Directors approach to the management of them are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 16 to 18.
Market risk Market risk comprises three types of risk: market price risk, interest rate risk and currency risk.
Market price risk As an investment company, performance is dependent on the performance of the underlying companies and securities in which it invests.
The market price of investee companies shares is subject to their performance, supply and demand for the shares and investor sentiment regarding the company or the industry sector in which it operates.
Consequently market price risk is one of the most significant risks to which the Company is exposed.
At 30 September 2018, the fair value of the Companys assets exposed to market price risk was 1,431,672,000 2017: 1,186,911,000 see page 6.
If the fair value of the Companys investments at the Statement of Financial Position date increased or decreased by 10%, while all other variables remained constant, the capital return and net assets attributable to shareholders for the year ended 30 September 2018 would have increased or decreased by 143,167,000 or 82.4p per share 2017: 118,691,000 or 74.7p per share.
No derivatives or hedging instruments are currently utilised to manage market price risk.
Finsbury Growth & Income Trust PLC 45 Annual Report for the year ended 30 September 2018 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements 17.
Risk Management continued Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
Interest rate movement may affect: the interest payable on the Companys variable rate borrowings the level of income receivable from variable interest securities and cash deposits the fair value of investments of fixed rate securities The Companys main exposure to interest rate risk during the year ended 30 September 2018 was through its three year 75,000,000 secured multicurrency committed revolving credit facility with an additional 25 million facility available if required with Scotiabank Europe PLC maturing in October 2019.
Borrowings at the year-end amounted to 36,700,000 2017: 36,700,000 at an interest rate of 1.73% LIBOR plus 1.05% per annum.
If the above level of borrowing was maintained for a year a 1% increase decrease in LIBOR would decrease increase the revenue return by 121,000, 2017: 121,000 decrease increase the capital return by 246,000 2017: 246,000, and decrease increase the net assets by 367,000 2017: 367,000.
The weighted average interest rate, during the year, on borrowings under the above mentioned revolving credit facility was 1.63% 2017: 1.40%.
At 30 September 2018, the Companys financial assets and liabilities exposed to interest rate risk were as follows: 2018 2018 2017 2017 within more than within more than one year one year one year one year 000 000 000 000 Exposure to floating rates: Assets Cash and cash equivalents 13,175 11,482 Liabilities Creditors: amount falling due after more than one year borrowings under the loan facility 36,700 36,700 Exposure to fixed rates: Assets Investments at fair value through profit or loss# 817 634 Liabilities #Celtic 6% cumulative convertible preference shares and Frostrow Capital LLP AIFM Investment.

Risk Management continued Currency risk The Financial Statements are presented in sterling, which is the functional currency and presentational currency of the Company.
At30 September 2018, the Companys investments, with the exception of five, were priced in sterling.
The five exceptions, Heineken, listed in the Netherlands, Remy Cointreau listed in France, and Keurig Dr. Pepper, Manchester United and Mondelez International, all listed in the United States together represent 19.2% of the portfolio.
The AIFM and the Portfolio Manager monitor the Companys exposure to foreign currencies on a continuous basis and regularly report to the Board.
The Company does not hedge against foreign currency movements, but the Portfolio Manager takes account of the risk when making investment decisions.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted into sterling on receipt.
The Company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between its receipt and the time that the income is included in the Financial Statements.
Foreign currency exposure At 30 September 2018 the Company held 142,694,000 2017: 113,264,000 of investments denominated in U. S. dollars and 131,576,000 2017: 111,520,000 in Euros.
Currency sensitivity The following table details the sensitivity of the Companys profit or loss after taxation for the year to a 10% increase or decrease in the value of sterling compared to the U. S. dollar and Euros 2017: 10% increase and decrease.
The analysis is based on the Companys foreign currency financial instruments held at each Statement of Financial Position date.
If sterling had weakened against the U.
S dollar and Euros, as stated above, this would have had the following effect: 2018 2017 000 000 Impact on revenue return 82 67 Impact on capital return 30,477 24,980 Total return after tax increase in shareholders funds 30,559 25,047 If sterling had strengthened against the foreign currencies as stated above, this would have had the following effect: 2018 2017 000 000 Impact on revenue return 67 55 Impact on capital return 24,936 20,438 Total return after tax decrease in shareholders funds 25,003 20,493 Credit Risk Credit risk is the Companys exposure to financial loss from the failure of a counterparty to deliver securities or cash for acquisition or disposals of investments which could result in the Company suffering a financial loss.
Credit risk is managed as follows: Investment transactions are carried out only with brokers whose creditworthiness is reviewed by the Portfolio Manager.
Transactions are ordinarily undertaken on a delivery versus payment basis whereby the Companys custodian bank ensures that the counterparty to any transactions entered into by the Company has delivered its obligation before any transfer of cash or securities away from the Company is completed.
Any failing trades in the market are closely monitored by both the AIFM and the Portfolio Manager.
Cash is only held at banks that have been identified by the Board as reputable and of high credit quality.
Bank of New York Mellon has a credit rating of Aa1 Moodys and AAS&P.
Finsbury Growth & Income Trust PLC 47 Annual Report for the year ended 30 September 2018 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements 17.
Risk Management continued At 30 September 2018, the exposure to credit risk was 18,328,000 2017: 15,572,000, comprising: 2018 2017 000 000 Fixed assets: Non-equity investments preference shares 267 154 Current assets: Other receivables amounts due from brokers, dividends and priority profit share receivable 4,886 3,936 Cash and cash equivalents 13,175 11,482 Total exposure to credit risk 18,328 15,572 Liquidity risk of investments Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Liquidity risk is not significant as the majority of the Companys assets are investments in quoted equities and other quoted securities which are readily realisable: their value is significantly in excess of the Companys financial liabilities.
Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities Financial assets and financial liabilities are either carried in the Statement of Financial Position at their fair value or at a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Valuation of financial instruments The Company measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset as follows: Level 1 quoted prices in active markets.
Level 2 prices of recent transactions for identical instruments.
Level 3 valuation techniques using observable and unobservable market data.
The financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the Statement of Financial Position are grouped into the fair value hierarchy at the reporting date as follows: Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total At 30 September 2018 000 000 000 000 Equity investments 1,429,520 1,429,520 Limited liability partnership interest Frostrow Capital LLP 1,335 1,335 AIFM Capital contribution Frostrow Capital LLP 550 550 Preference share investments 267 267 1,429,787 1,885 1,431,672 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total At 30 September 2017 000 000 000 000 Equity investments 1,185,077 1,185,077 Limited liability partnership interest Frostrow Capital LLP 1,200 1,200 AIFM Capital contribution Frostrow Capital LLP 480 480 Preference share investments 154 154 1,185,231 1,680 1,186,911 The valuation techniques used by the Company are explained on page 37.

These reviews include: the level of gearing, set at limits in normal market conditions, between 5% and 25% of net assets, which takes account of the Companys position and the views of the Board, the AIFM and the Portfolio Manager on the market: the extent to which revenue reserves should be retained or utilised: and ensuring the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.
The Companys objectives, policies and procedures for managing capital are unchanged from last year.
There were no breaches by the Company during the year of the financial covenants put in place by Scotiabank Europe plc in respect of the committed revolving credit facility provided to the Company.
These requirements are unchanged since last year and the Company has complied with them at all times.
