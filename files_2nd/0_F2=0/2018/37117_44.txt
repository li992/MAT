Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 14.
Non-Current Other Assets Key Money Monies paid in certain countries to give access to retail locations are capitalised within non-current assets.
Key money is stated at historic cost less impairment losses.
These assets are not depreciated as past experience has shown that the key money is recoverable on disposal of a retail location and is deemed to have an indefinite useful economic life but will be impaired if evidence exists that the market value is less than the historic cost.
Gains losses on key money from the subsequent disposal of these retail locations are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Deposits Money paid in certain countries as deposits to store landlords as protection against non-payment of rent, is capitalised within non-current assets.
A provision for the impairment of these deposits is established when there is objective evidence that the landlord will not repay the deposit in full.
Legal Fees Legal fees and other costs associated with the acquisition of a leasehold interest are capitalised within non-current other assets and amortised over the life of the lease.
Lease Premia Money paid in certain countries specifically to landlords or tenants as an incentive to exit an existing lease commonly referred to as compensation for early termination, to enable acquisition of that lease.
These payments are capitalised within other non-current assets and amortised over the life of the lease.
