Financial Statements Notes on the Accounts continued 2 Segmental analyses revised With effect from 1 January 2018, the Group has adopted IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
The Group has fully restated revised prior periods, as explained in notes 1 and 31.
Due to the acquisition of RAI, the Group revised its organisational structure.
RAI is reported as a separate region United States.
The markets which previously comprised EEMEA merged with the Americas, Western Europe and Asia-Pacific to form three new regions.
The markets in the Middle East merged with Asia-Pacific to form the Asia-Pacific and Middle East region APME.
The markets in East and Central Africa, West Africa and Southern Africa merged with the Americas region to form the Americas and Sub-Saharan Africa region AMSSA.
The markets in Russia, Ukraine, Caucasus, Central Asia, Belarus, Turkey and North Africa merged with the Western Europe region to form the Europe and North Africa region ENA.
The segments disclosed below have been revised on this new basis.
As the chief operating decision maker, the Management Board reviews external adjusted revenues and adjusted profit from operations to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources to the overall business.
The results of Next Generation Products are reported as part of the results of each geographic region and are not currently material to the Group.
Consequently, it is not considered a reportable segment that requires separate disclosure under the requirements of IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
Interest income, interest expense and taxation are centrally managed and accordingly such items are not presented by segment as they are excluded from the measure of segment profitability.
The four geographic regions are the reportable segments for the Group as they form the focus of the Groups internal reporting systems and are the basis used by the Management Board for assessing performance and allocating resources.
The Management Board reviews current and prior year adjusted segmental revenue, adjusted profit from operations of subsidiaries and joint operations, and adjusted post-tax results of associates and joint ventures at constant rates of exchange.
The constant rate comparison provided for reporting segment information is based on a retranslation, at prior year exchange rates, of the current year results of the Group, including intercompany royalties payable in foreign currency to UK entities.
However, the Group does not adjust for the normal transactional gains and losses in operations which are generated by movements in exchange rates.
In respect of the United States region, all financial statements and financial information provided by or with respect to the US business or RAI and or the RAI Group are prepared on the basis of US GAAP and constitute the primary financial statements or financial information of the US business or RAI and or the RAI Group.
Solely for the purpose of consolidation within the results of BAT p. l. c. and the BAT Group, this financial information is then converted to International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the IASB and adopted by the European Union IFRS.
To the extent any such financial information provided in these financial statements relate to the US business or RAI and or the RAI Group it is provided as an explanation of the US business or RAIs and or the RAI Groups primary US GAAP based financial statements and information.
