General information HomeServe plc the Company is a public company, limited by shares and incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act.
The address of the registered office is Cable Drive, Walsall, WS2 7BN.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling.
Foreign operations are consolidated in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.
There have been no post balance sheet events identified since the year end.
Significant accounting policies Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs, adopted by the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments that are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period as explained in note 24.
Adoption of new or revised standards and accounting policies The following amendments to accounting standards have been adopted in the year: Amendments to IAS 7 Disclosure Initiative Amendments to IAS 12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses None of the amendments listed above have had any material impact on the amounts reported in this consolidated set of financial statements.
Standards in issue but not yet effective At the date of authorisation of these financial statements the following Standards and Interpretations, which have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective not all of which have been endorsed by the EU : IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions Amendments to IFRS 4 Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts Amendments to IFRS 9 Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture Amendments to IAS 19 Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement Amendments to IAS 40 Transfers of Investment Property Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014-2016 Cycle IFRS 1 and IAS 28 Amendments Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014-2016 Cycle IFRS 12 Amendments Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2015-2017 Cycle Clarifications to IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers Conceptual Framework Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards HomeServe plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 140 Group financial statements Notes to financial statements Year ended 31 March 2018 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Standards in issue but not yet effective continued At 31 March 2018 the status of the Groups analysis as to the impact that IFRSs 9, 15 and 16 will have on the financial statements for the years ended 31 March 2019 IFRSs 9 and 15 and 31 March 2020 IFRS 16 has concluded the following: IFRS 9 will not have a material effect on the financial statements, with only limited amendments expected to the classification of financial assets, the timing of credit loss recognition under the expected credit loss model for impairment, and disclosures.
This is due to the nature of the business model where the majority of customers pay in advance.
The Group intends to adopt this standard for the year ended 31 March 2019, in line with its mandatory effective date.
IFRS 15 will not have a material effect on the financial statements.
The Groups assessment indicates that, while changes to revenue disclosures will be required, together with the re-categorisation of certain existing intangible assets that represent contract costs under IFRS 15, the impact on existing revenue recognition patterns will be immaterial.
IFRS 16 will have a significant impact on the Group Balance Sheet through the recognition of Right of Use RoU assets and liabilities for lease payments in respect of arrangements previously classified as operating leases under IAS 17.
Additional disclosures will also be required.
Although the standard is not expected to have a material impact on profit after tax, Group EBITDA will increase due to a reduction in operating rental costs, replaced by higher interest and depreciation charges.
Further, while total cash flows will remain consistent, rental outflows will now be presented under financing activities, where they were previously recorded as operational outflows, increasing the Groups cash conversion percentage.
The Groups operating lease commitments as at 31 March 2018 see note 31 of 37.8m are the best indicator of the estimated size of the RoU assets and lease liabilities likely to be recognised on balance sheet at transition.
The transition values are subject to change due to: Judgements inherent in calculating lease liabilities e. g. determining the lease term, the discount rate and assessing variable lease payments The impact of the Groups operational activities on its lease obligations between 31 March 2018 and the date of transition to IFRS 16 The Group intends to adopt this standard for the year ended 31 March 2020, in line with its mandatory effective date.
The Group will continue to progress its impact assessment regarding IFRS 16 during the first half of FY19 and will provide a further update in the interim report for the period ending 30 September 2018.
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the other Standards and Interpretations listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group in future years.
Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic Report.
HomeServe plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 141 Group financial statements The Directors have reviewed the Groups budget, forecast and cash flows for 2019 and beyond, and concluded that they are in line with their expectations with regards to the Groups strategy and future growth plans.
In addition the Directors have reviewed the Groups position in respect of material uncertainties and have concluded that there are no items that would affect going concern or that should be separately disclosed.
The Directors have concluded that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below: Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company made up to 31 March each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity, is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of the consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups equity interest.
Non-controlling interests consist of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the minoritys share of the changes in equity since the date of the combination.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Interests in associates The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated into these financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Under the equity method, an interest in an associate is initially recognised in the consolidated balance sheet at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Groups share of the profit and loss and other comprehensive income of the associate.
If the Groups share of losses of the profit or loss exceeds the Groups interest in that associate, the Group discontinues recognising its share of further losses.
Additional losses are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
On acquisition of the investment in an associate, any excess of the cost of the investment over the Groups share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the investee is recognised as goodwill, which is included in the carrying amount of the investment.
When necessary, the entire carrying amount of the investment including goodwill is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS36 Impairment of Assets as a single asset by comparing its recoverable amount with its carrying amount.
Any impairment loss recognised forms part of the carrying amount of the investment.
The Group discontinues the use of the equity method of accounting if the investment in an associate increases to becomes a subsidiary.
Upon becoming a subsidiary, the Group accounts for the entity in accordance with the Business combinations policy below.
Any fair value gain or loss on re-measurement of an associate on acquisition of control is taken to the profit and loss account at the date of acquisition.
HomeServe plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 142 Group financial statements Notes to financial statements Year ended 31 March 2018 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Business combinations Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the consolidated income statement, as incurred, in operating costs.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent or deferred consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition-date fair value.
Subsequent changes in such fair values that qualify as measurement period adjustments are adjusted against the cost of acquisition.
All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRSs and recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.
Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as equity are not recognised.
Deferred consideration is subsequently measured at amortised cost.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete.
Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period see below, or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and is subject to a maximum of one year.
Goodwill Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised at cost as an asset at the date control is acquired the acquisition date.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if there is an indication that it may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash generating units CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
HomeServe plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 143 Group financial statements Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT, Insurance Premium Tax and other sales related taxes.
Net policy income Revenue recorded by the Group includes commissions receivable in the Groups role as an intermediary for the householder in the policy sale, but as principal in the policy administration process.
The Group contracts separately with the policy holder to provide these services.
Any third-party costs incurred on behalf of the principal that are rechargeable under the contractual arrangement, or where the Groups role is only as an intermediary in the cash collection process for the principal, are not included in revenue.
Consequently, on the sale of a policy, gross revenue consists of only a component of the overall policy price, representing the commission receivable for the marketing and sale of the policy, stated net of sales related taxes.
Where a contractual arrangement consists of two or more separate arrangements that can be provided to customers either on a stand-alone basis or as an optional extra, revenue is recognised for each element as if it were an individual contract.
Accordingly, revenue is recognised on the sale of a policy except where an obligation exists to provide future services, typically claims handling and policy administration services.
In these situations, a proportion of revenue, sufficient to cover future claims handling costs and margin, is deferred over the life of the policy, as deferred income.
The assessment of future claims handling takes account of the expected numbers of claims and the estimated cost of handling those claims, which are validated through experience of historical actual costs.
Revenue deferred for the performance of claims handling services is released over the expected profile of anticipated claims.
To the extent that policies are expected to cancel mid-term, and hence all of the economic benefits associated with those policies are not expected to flow to the Group, a provision is made to ensure that the related revenue is not recognised at the point that the policy incepts.
Repair services revenue Repair revenue relates to repairs undertaken on behalf of underwriters subject to separate contractual arrangements.
Such revenue is recognised on completion of the repair.
Other revenue Revenue in respect of boiler installations and uninsured jobs is recognised when our performance obligations are complete.
Annual service revenue is recognised on completion of the annual service.
Ongoing service revenue is recognised in equal instalments over the life of the policy.
Revenue generated in HomeServes Home Experts businesses is derived from three principal streams: Website subscriptions: recognised evenly over the period of the contract, which is typically 12 months: Directory advertising fees: recognised at the point the obligation to the customer is fulfilled: and Lead generation revenue representing commissions received from trades people : recognised at the point of purchase.
HomeServe plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 144 Group financial statements Notes to financial statements Year ended 31 March 2018 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Marketing expenses Costs incurred in respect of marketing activity, including for example, direct mail and inbound outbound telephone costs, which is undertaken to acquire or renew a policy, are charged to the income statement in the period in which the related marketing campaign is performed.
Marketing expenses also include payments made to Affinity Partners in recognition of their support for the Groups selling and policy renewal activities.
The terms of their support and related payments are included in contractual agreements with each Affinity Partner.
Amounts incurred upon the sale and renewal of an individual policy by the Group, referred to as Affinity Partner Commissions, are recognised as an operating expense when individual policies incept or renew.
Commissions are payable to Affinity Partners only when the Group has collected the premium due on behalf of the third party underwriter from the policy holder.
Leasing Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and a reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies Transactions in currencies other than functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies except for those that are designated as long-term equity investments, are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date, with changes taken to the income statement.
Foreign exchange translation movements on monetary assets that are designated as long-term equity investments are transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Borrowings in foreign currencies are treated as monetary liabilities and are translated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Exchange rate movements on foreign currency borrowings are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Foreign currency borrowings are not treated as hedges of net investments.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated to presentational currency at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly.
Exchange movements, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Such cumulative exchange movements are recognised as income or expense in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
HomeServe plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 145 Group financial statements Operating profit Operating profit is stated after charging all operating costs, but before investment income and finance costs.
Retirement benefit costs Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
For defined benefit retirement schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses and the return on scheme assets excluding interest are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside the income statement and presented in the statement of comprehensive income.
Re-measurements recorded in the statement of comprehensive income are not recycled.
Past service cost is recognised in the income statement in the period of scheme amendment.
Net interest is calculated by applying a discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset.
Any retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from the calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Any tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year along with a small number of provisions in relation to open tax positions.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income or directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income or within equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
HomeServe plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 146 Group financial statements Notes to financial statements Year ended 31 March 2018 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: Buildings 25 50 years Furniture, fixtures and equipment 5 7 years Computer equipment 3 7 years Motor vehicles 3 years with 25% residual value Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
Intangible assets Acquisition intangible assets Acquired access rights relate to the contractual agreements entered into with the former owners of businesses acquired as part of a business combination: or where the former owners previously operated a business and the Group has purchased specific access rights from the former owners.
These agreements set out the contractual terms of the Affinity Partnership and provide the contractual framework within which the Group markets, sells and renews policies with the individual customers of the Affinity Partner.
Acquired access rights are recorded at fair value by using the estimated and discounted incremental future cash flows resulting from the relationship.
Acquired access rights are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which are in the range of 3 - 20 years.
Acquired customer databases represent the value attributable to the portfolios of renewable customer policies that exist at the date of acquisition and are acquired by the Group: as part of a business combination: or where the former owners previously operated a business and the Group has purchased specific customer databases from the former owners.
Acquired customer databases are recorded at fair value using the estimated and discounted incremental future cash flows resulting from the future renewal of the portfolio of acquired policies over their estimated residual lives.
Acquired customer databases are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which are in the range of 3 - 15 years.
Acquired brands are recorded at fair value using the relief from royalty valuation method.
The Groups brand asset is amortised over its useful economic life 8 years on a straight-line basis.
This period represents the period over which the acquired brand is reasonably expected to transfer economic benefits to the Group.
Other intangible assets Access rights arise from the contractual agreements with Affinity Partners which provide the contractual framework within which the Group markets, sells and renews policies with the individual customers of the Affinity Partner.
Access rights are valued at the discounted present value of the contractually committed payments, where such payments are not related to the success or otherwise of activity under the contractual agreements and are amortised on a straightline basis over the length of the contractual agreement, up to a maximum of 20 years.
Trademarks represent costs incurred to legally protect the established brand names of the Group.
Trademarks are stated at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives, up to a maximum of 20 years.
Customer databases represent the value attributable to the portfolios of renewable customer policies that have been created by our Affinity Partners through their own sales and marketing activity and subsequently purchased by the HomeServe plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 147 Group financial statements Group.
Such customer databases are recorded at their fair value based on the amount paid to the Affinity Partner.
These customer databases are amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected duration of the customer relationship, which are in the range of 3 - 10 years.
Computer software and the related licences are stated at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of 3 10 years.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the assets for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or CGU in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Costs comprise direct material cost only.
Cost is measured on a first-in, first-out basis.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where appropriate.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets or liabilities and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
Available for sale investments At each balance sheet date the Group conducts a fair value assessment of its investments, the difference between the fair value and carrying value is charged or credited to the Statement of Comprehensive Income accordingly and held in the available for sale reserve.
Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at amortised cost as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.

Significant accounting policies continued Financial instruments continued Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Borrowings Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are stated at amortised cost and are recorded at the notional amount of the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Interest-bearing loans are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at amortised cost.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the notional amount of the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Put options over the equity of subsidiary companies The potential cash payments related to put options issued by the Group over the equity of subsidiary companies are accounted for as financial liabilities.
The amounts that may become payable under the option on exercise are initially recognised at the present value of the expected gross obligation with the corresponding entry being recognised in retained earnings.
Such options are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method, in order to accrete the liability up to the amount payable under the option at the date at which it first becomes exercisable.
The charge arising is recorded as a financing cost.
In the event that the option expires unexercised, the liability will be derecognised with a corresponding adjustment to retained earnings.
Other put and call options Other put and call options are recognised at fair value with any associated benefit being recognised directly in the income statement.
Forward contracts and hedge accounting The Group enters into derivative transactions with a view to managing currency risks associated with financing acquisitive activities.
Forward contracts used by the Group are stated at fair value on initial recognition and at subsequent balance sheet dates.
The fair values of forward contracts are calculated by discounting all future cash flows by the applicable market yield curves at the balance sheet date.
Cash flow hedges mitigate exposure to variability in cash flows that are either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecast transaction.
Hedge accounting is only used where, at the inception of the hedge, there is formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship, it meets the Groups risk management objective strategy for undertaking the hedge and it is expected to be highly effective.
The portion of any gains or losses on cash flow hedges which meet the conditions for hedge accounting and are determined to be effective, are recognised directly in the statement of comprehensive income.
The gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognised immediately in the income statement.
When a firm commitment or highly probable future transaction that is hedged becomes an asset or a liability recognised on the balance sheet, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability.
HomeServe plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 149 Group financial statements Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, for cash flow hedges, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of forward contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting, are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Share-based payments The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled sharebased payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The Group also provided employees with the ability to purchase the Groups ordinary shares at a discount to the current market value through Save As You Earn schemes.
In addition, the Group provides employees with the ability to purchase shares through its One Plan scheme.
For every two shares purchased, employees will receive one free matching share at the end of the vesting period.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model or Monte Carlo simulation models depending on the type of scheme.
Accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the application of the Groups accounting policies, which are described in note 2, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Critical accounting judgements There are no critical accounting judgements.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty Claims handling obligations Regarding revenue recognition, a proportion of revenue is deferred to cover the Groups future obligations in respect of handling future claims arising on those policies that are on risk at the year end.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty in determining an appropriate proportion of revenue to defer are the assumptions made with regards to claims frequency and the estimated cost of handling a claim.
The Group uses historical experience of claim volumes and forecast activity levels to estimate these assumptions.
The total amount of revenue deferred at 31 March 2018 in respect of the Groups future claim handing obligations is 86.3m FY17: 76.7m.
If either of these assumptions were individually higher or lower than the Groups historical experience by 10% the impact to the profit in the year would be 8.6m.
Valuation of acquisition intangible assets Acquired access rights and acquired customer databases are recognised as intangible assets.
These are valued using the excess earnings method taking into account a number of key assumptions such as retention and net income.
In applying this methodology, certain estimates are required to be made in respect of future cash flows together with an appropriate discount factor for the purpose of determining the present value of those cash flows.
HomeServe plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 150 Group financial statements Notes to financial statements Year ended 31 March 2018 3.
Accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued Valuation of acquisition intangible assets continued The key sources of estimation uncertainty with respect to customer databases are the future retention rate and the income per customer generated from those customers.
The carrying value of acquired customer databases at 31 March 2018 is 112.9m FY17: 90.0m.
If the retention rate or income per customer was individually higher or lower by 10% the impact to profit in the year would be 11.3m.
In respect of intangible assets for acquired access rights, the key sources of estimation uncertainty relate to the assumptions regarding the number of policy sales and associated penetration of the customer list along with the cost of acquisition, retention rate and costs associated with servicing those customers.
The total value of acquired access rights at 31 March 2018 is 60.3m FY17: 24.0m, therefore if the assumptions used in this valuation were individually higher or lower by 10% the impact to the profit in the year would be 6.0m.
Other areas of focus Whilst not considered to be critical accounting judgements or key sources of estimation uncertainty, the following are areas of focus for management.
Policy Cancellations In respect of those policies that may be cancelled by the customer part way through the contractual term, which will affect the economic benefits that flow to the Group, a provision is made to ensure that the related revenue is not recognised at the point that the policy incepts.
The sources of estimation uncertainty in calculating the provision for policy cancellations are the expected midterm cancellation percentage and the period of cover remaining on the policy at the point of cancellation.
The Group uses historical experience to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in this calculation.
The total amount of revenue deferred at 31 March 2018 in respect of potential future cancellations is 23.8m FY17: 18.0m and is recognised as a reduction in the value of trade receivables.
The most significant estimation uncertainty within this judgement is the mid-term cancellation percentage.
If this assumption was individually higher or lower than the Groups historical experience by 10% the impact to profit in the year would be 2.4m.
Impairment of goodwill and acquisition intangible assets The annual impairment assessment in respect of goodwill and acquisition intangibles requires estimates of the value in use or fair value less costs to sell of the CGU to which goodwill and acquisition intangibles have been allocated.
CGUs are aligned to the lines of business within each geographic territory in which the Group operates.
As a result, estimates of future cash flows are required, together with an appropriate discount factor for the purpose of determining the present value of those cash flows.
The carrying value of goodwill is 386.6m FY17: 301.9m.
The carrying value of acquisition intangibles is 186.5m FY17: 114.0m.
Following the annual impairment review, no impairment charge has been recorded against goodwill or acquisition intangibles.
As set out in note 13, changes in respect of commercial outcomes around sales volumes, prices, margins and discount rates can impact the recoverable value.
Management do not believe that any reasonably possible changes to the key assumptions would produce an impairment in the forthcoming year FY17: nil.

Business and geographical segments Segment revenues and results IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, who is considered to be the Chief Executive, to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
The operating segments are consistent with those set out in the Strategic Report.
Segment operating profit loss represents the result of each segment including allocating costs associated with head office and shared functions, but without allocating investment income, finance costs, and tax.
This is the measure reported to the Chief Executive for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in note 2.
Group cost allocations are deducted in arriving at segmental operating profit.
Inter-segment revenue is charged at prevailing market prices.

Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions, these being a blended Federal State rate of 38% in the US FY17: 40% as a result of the US enacting new tax legislation in December 2017 effective from 1 January 2018, 33% in France FY17: 33% and 25% in Spain FY17: 25%, which explains the Overseas tax rate differences overleaf.
HomeServe plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 155 Group financial statements The charge for the year can be reconciled to the profit per the income statement as follows: 2018 2017 m m Profit before tax on continuing operations 123.3 98.3 Tax at the UK corporation tax rate of 19% FY17: 20% 23.4 19.7 Tax effect of items that are not taxable in determining taxable profit 0.5 0.2 Adjustments in respect of prior years current tax 0.1 1.3 Overseas tax rate differences 4.6 2.7 Movement in deferred tax liabilities 0.4 Tax expense for the year 27.4 23.9 Given the UK parented nature of the Group, the majority of financing that the overseas businesses require is provided from the UK, and as such the UK has provided a number of intra-group loans to its overseas operations in order to fund their growth plans.
In light of the different tax rates applicable in each of the markets in which the Group operates, as noted above, these loans result in a reduction in the Groups effective tax rate, which is included in Overseas tax rate differences in the table above.
As the proportion of the Groups profits earned overseas continues to grow, the effective tax rate of 22% FY17: 24% is expected to increase slightly in future years.

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss in the financial year attributable to the equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
Adjusted earnings per share is calculated excluding amortisation of acquisition intangibles and the associated tax impact.
In FY18 adjustment has also been made for the one-off impact of tax reforms in the USA and France see note 10.
The Group uses adjusted operating profit, EBITDA, adjusted profit before tax and adjusted earnings per share as its primary performance measures.
These are non-IFRS measures which exclude the impact of the amortisation of acquisition intangible assets FY18: 18.4m, FY17: 14.1m and the associated tax effects FY18: 7.4m, FY17: 4.9m.
Acquisition intangible assets principally arise as a result of the past actions of the former owners of businesses in respect of marketing and business development activity.
Therefore, the adjusted measures reflect the post acquisition revenue attributable to, and operating costs incurred by, the Group.
Diluted earnings per share includes the impact of dilutive share options in issue throughout the period.

On 17 November 2017 HomeServe Assistance Limited increased, a Group company, its investment in Checkatrade, by 60%, taking its total holding up to 100% resulting in the disposal of the Groups previous associate interest in Checkatrade and the acquisition of Checkatrade as a 100% owned subsidiary see notes 16 and 18.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The Groups CGUs are defined as the lines of business within each geographic territory in which the Group operates, because they represent the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash flows.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding growth rates, discount rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and plans for the next three years approved by the Directors and extrapolates the annual cash flows using estimated, long-term growth rates.
The growth rates are based on detailed business plans and although long-term growth rate forecasts may be higher in certain territories, the lowest rate across the Group has been applied to ensure value in use calculations are prudent.
The long-term growth rate utilised is 2% FY17: 2%.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on expectations of future changes in the market.
Management estimates the discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money.
The pre-tax cost of capital rates used to discount the forecast pre-tax cash flows are different for each CGU and are detailed overleaf: HomeServe plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 159 Group financial statements Segment CGUs 2018 2017 UK Membership, HVAC Heating, 8.5% 8.7% Ventilation and Air Conditioning North America North America 9.9% 12.2% France Membership, HVAC 9.3% 10.4% Spain Spain 9.9% 10.0% New Markets Checkatrade 8.5% New Markets Habitissimo 9.9% Pre-tax cost of capital rates reflect the latest cost of debt and equity for a sample of comparable companies in accordance with the market participant premise detailed in IAS36.
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of each CGUs carrying value, which also reflects the different risk profile of each CGU.
The Group believes that there are no reasonably possible changes to the key assumptions in the next year which would result in the carrying amount of goodwill exceeding the recoverable amount.
This view is based upon inherently judgemental assumptions, however, it takes account of the headroom in the value in use calculation versus the current carrying value.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated, by CGU, as follows: 2018 2017 m m UK Membership 160.7 159.3 UK HVAC 23.4 North America 36.2 40.8 France Membership 79.0 77.3 France HVAC 3.7 Spain 13.8 13.6 New Markets Checkatrade 58.6 New Markets Habitissimo 11.2 10.9 386.6 301.9 In the FY17 Annual Report, the Spain CGU included 10.9m of goodwill associated with Habitissimo.

Additionally there were two immaterial acquisitions in the year ended 31 March 2018.
On 30 November 2017 HomeServe Membership Limited, a Group company, acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Energy Insurance Services Limited EISL for a total cash consideration of 1.7m.

HomeServe plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 166 Group financial statements Notes to financial statements Year ended 31 March 2018 18.
Interests in associates continued The initial investment made on 13 December 2016 included a call option for HomeServe to purchase a further 35% in mid 2019 and a put option for Sherrington Mews Limited to require the Group to acquire a further 35% shareholding.
The subsequent agreement to acquire the additional 60% of Checkatrades ordinary share capital superseded these options, which were consequently extinguished and had no material fair value at 17 November 2017.
Upon obtaining control of Checkatrade, the Group assessed the fair value of the associate interest disposed of as part of the total consideration for the business combination see note 16.
Based on a total business valuation of 100% of the share capital of Sherrington Mews Limited, the fair value of the Groups existing 40% interest was assessed to be 29.9m.
The gain on re-measurement of the existing associate interest on obtaining control was therefore calculated as follows: Total m Fair value of associate interest previously owned 29.9 Carrying value of associate interest held by the Group at 17 November 2017 27.3 Acceleration of discount unwind on contingent consideration payment associated with purchase of initial 40% shareholding 1.3 Acquisition related costs 0.4 Gain on re-measurement of associate on acquisition of control 0.9 19.
Other financial assets Trade and other receivables 2018 2017 m m Amounts receivable for the provision of services 354.6 292.3 Other receivables 143.5 143.0 Accrued income 9.6 9.2 Prepayments 8.0 10.6 515.7 455.1 Trade receivables The Group has provided fully for those receivable balances that it does not expect to recover.
This assessment has been undertaken by reviewing the status of all significant balances that are past due and involves assessing both the reason for non-payment and the creditworthiness of the counterparty.
Of the trade receivables balance at the end of the year, there is no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread across a large number of counterparties and customers.
There are no customers that represent more than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables.
Included in the Groups trade receivables balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 14.5m FY17: 12.1m which HomeServe plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 167 Group financial statements are past due at the reporting date but for which the Group has not provided for as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The average age of receivables not impaired is 24 days FY17: 21 days.
Trade debtors to be received from customers relating to instalments of policy premiums that are not yet due have been excluded from the average age calculation.
Ageing of past due but not impaired receivables: 2018 2017 m m 1 - 30 days 9.8 8.6 31 - 60 days 2.7 3.0 61 - 90 days 1.2 0.2 91 days 0.8 0.3 Balance at 31 March past due but not impaired 14.5 12.1 Current 340.1 280.2 Balance at 31 March 354.6 292.3 Movement in the allowance for doubtful debts: 2018 2017 m m At 1 April 1.9 2.5 Impairment losses recognised 0.4 0.7 Reclassification to cancellation provision 0.4 1.6 Amounts recovered during the year 0.6 0.2 Acquisition of subsidiaries 0.3 0.5 Exchange movements 0.1 Balance at 31 March 1.5 1.9 In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the credit quality from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
Ageing of impaired trade receivables: 2018 2017 m m 1 - 30 days 31 - 60 days 61 - 90 days 0.2 0.2 91 days 0.4 1.3 Current not yet due 0.9 0.4 1.5 1.9 The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.

Other financial assets continued Other receivables The Group serves as an intermediary, whereby it is responsible for the collection of cash on behalf of third parties.
Other receivables mainly represent those amounts to be collected from policyholders and are to be remitted to third parties for obligations such as the cost of underwriting and Insurance Premium Tax.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to individual receivables being small and spread across a diverse policyholder base.
In addition, overall balance sheet exposure is mitigated as defaults on these receivables can, in the most part, be offset against the corresponding payable included in Other creditors.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents of 57.8m FY17: 46.2m comprise cash held by the Group and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates to their fair value.
Current liabilities 2018 2017 m m Trade creditors and accruals 114.6 118.9 Contingent consideration 15.9 Deferred consideration 5.2 2.6 Deferred income 86.3 76.7 Taxes and social security, excluding current tax 13.2 12.0 Other creditors 273.3 246.0 508.5 456.2 Trade creditors and accruals principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing costs.
The average credit period taken for trade purchases is 60 days FY17: 70 days.
Contingent and deferred consideration relates to future amounts payable on business combinations and asset purchases.
Deferred income represents revenue where an obligation exists to provide future services.
An appropriate proportion of monies received in advance are treated as deferred income and recognised over the relevant period.
Other creditors mainly represent those amounts to be collected from policyholders but to be remitted to third parties for obligations such as the cost of underwriting and Insurance Premium Tax.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade creditors, accruals, deferred consideration and other creditors meeting the definition of financial instruments approximates to their fair values.
Contingent consideration is held at fair value.

Through a call option the Group has the means to acquire the remaining 30% of the shares in Habitissimo S. L which can be exercised in either 2020 or 2021.
In addition, the non-controlling shareholders have a put option requiring the Group to acquire the remaining 30% of their shareholding.
There is no market value defined in the shareholder agreement but a floor of 6.4m, based on the current price of the remaining 30%, and a cap of 30m.
The fair market value of the company will be mutually agreed by HomeServe and the founders at the point at which the options become exercisable.
The potential cash payment relating to the put option issued by the Group over the equity of subsidiary companies has been accounted for as a financial liability.
This was initially recognised at the present value of the gross obligation of 9.3m with the corresponding charge being recognised in retained earnings.
The option is subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method, in order to accrete the liability up to the amount payable under the option at the date at which it first becomes exercisable.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of deferred consideration, the obligation under put option and other creditors meeting the definition of financial instruments approximates to their fair values.

Borrowings continued Bank and other loans continued The US Dollar and Euro denominated borrowings are used to provide debt funding to the North America and Continental Europe operations respectively.
Foreign currency borrowings are drawn in the UK and passed to the overseas subsidiaries of the Group by way of intercompany loans, denominated in the same currencies.
These external borrowings and the equivalent intercompany receivable loans are treated as monetary liabilities and assets respectively and, as such, the Groups foreign currency exposure risk is minimised.
The weighted average interest rates paid on bank and other loans were as follows: 2018 2017 $ $ % % % % % % Fixed 2.9 3.4 Floating 1.4 0.9 2.4 1.4 0.9 1.8 All of the Groups borrowings are unsecured.
The carrying amount of the Groups borrowings approximates to their fair value and the currencies in which they are denominated reflect the geographical segments for which they have been used.
The other principal features of the Groups borrowings are as follows: The Group has a 400m revolving credit facility with eight banks.
This facility was taken out on 1 August 2017 and has an initial term of five years with the option to extend the term twice, by one year, up to maximum of seven years.
The new facility replaces the 300m facility the FY17 RCF taken out with five banks on 31 July 2014.
The financial covenants associated with the new facility are net debt to EBITDA of less than 3.0 times FY17 RCF: 3.0 times and interest cover greater than 4.0 times EBITDA FY17 RCF: 4.0 times.
Interest is charged at floating rates at margins of between 1.15% and 1.25% FY17 RCF: 1.05% and 1.25% above the relevant reference rate, thus exposing the Group to cash flow and interest rate risk.
At 31 March 2018, the Group had available 273.6m FY17 RCF: 174.0m of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.
The Group has 110m of US Private Placements FY17: 110m consisting of a 60m placement taken out on 6 March 2017 at a fixed interest rate of 2.59% and a 50m placement taken out on 7 October 2015 at a fixed interest rate of 3.44%.
Both facilities have a term of seven years and the financial covenants associated with both are the same as the 400m revolving credit facility.
The Group maintains additional funding through a 37.5m amortising term loan which was taken out on 13 September 2016 and has a term of 4 years.
The financial covenants associated with this facility are the same as the 400m revolving credit facility and interest is charged at floating rates at margins of 0.9% above the relevant reference rate, thus exposing the Group to cash flow and interest rate risk.
The Group renewed a 25m short term loan on 31 January 2018 which has a term of six months.
The financial covenants associated with this facility are the same as the 400m revolving credit facility and interest is charged at floating rates at margins of 0.63% above the relevant reference rate, thus exposing the Group to cash flow and interest rate risk.
The Group has a $5m facility in the USA, of which $2.3m 1.6m FY17: $2.3m 1.9m was drawn at 31 March 2018.
The weighted average interest rate was 1.5% FY17: 2.0%.
The Group has complied with all covenant requirements in the current and prior year.
Information about liquidity risk is presented in note 24.

All lease obligations are denominated in US dollars.
The fair value of the Groups lease obligations is approximately equal to their carrying amount.

Borrowings continued Reconciliation of movements in liabilities arising from financing continued Deferred and contingent consideration balances in the balance sheet also include a total of 6.1m FY17: nil in relation to the purchase of the AAs Home emergency services policy book.
Cash flows associated with these balances will be classified as investing when they are incurred because they do not include a significant financing component due to the anticipated timing of the payment.
Financial instruments The tables below set out the classification of financial instruments in the statement of financial position: 2018 2017 Financial assets m m Loans and receivables 555.9 481.5 Available for sale investments 8.7 8.5 2018 2017 Financial liabilities m m Fair value through profit and loss 20.6 4.7 Other financial liabilities at amortised cost 706.5 683.2 Principal financial instruments The principal financial instruments used by the Group from which risk arises are as follows: cash and cash equivalents bank overdrafts, revolving credit facilities, bank loans and Private Placements trade receivables other receivables trade payables contingent and deferred consideration other creditors other investments All principal financial instruments are stated at amortised cost, with the exception of contingent consideration which is held at fair value and other investments which are held as available for sale.
Financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are grouped into levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those equal to quoted and unadjusted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
HomeServe plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 173 Group financial statements The Group has no financial instruments with fair values that are determined by reference to Level 1 and there were no transfers of assets or liabilities between levels during the period.
There are no non-recurring fair value measurements.
The Group held the following Level 2 and 3 financial instruments at fair value: 2018 2017 m m Level 2 Assets classified as available for sale Other investments note 17 8.7 8.5 Level 3 Contingent consideration at fair value through profit and loss Current liabilities 15.9 Non-current liabilities 4.7 4.7 The movement in other investments versus the prior year relates to the foreign exchange movement as a result of the weakening of Sterling versus the Euro.
Contingent consideration liabilities are calculated using forecasts of future performance of acquisitions discounted to present value.
Forecasts and discount rates are reviewed at least annually by the Directors as part of the valuation process.
If discount rates were higher lower than the Groups historical experience by 10%, the carrying amount would decrease increase by 0.1m.
Contingent consideration relating to business combinations and asset purchases are the only financial liabilities subsequently measured at fair value using Level 3 valuation techniques.
No gain or loss for the year relating to this contingent consideration has been recognised in the income statement FY17: nil.
Additional contingent consideration incurred during the year totalled 19.7m FY17: 2.7m, extinguishment of contingent consideration relating to associates totalled 2.7m FY17: nil, payments during the year amounted to 1.9m FY17: 0.2m and unwind of interest amounted to 0.7m FY17: 0.2m.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group are able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the appropriate balance of debt and equity.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 23, cash and cash equivalents in note 20 and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 25, 26 and the Group Statement of Changes in Equity.
The table below presents quantitative data for the components the Group manages as capital: 2018 2017 m m Attributable to equity holders of the parent 551.0 369.2 Cash and cash equivalents 57.8 46.2 Bank and other loans 294.7 306.0 The amount disclosed for bank and other loans in the above table has been updated to include balances due within one year, as the Directors believe that this presentation best reflects the Groups approach to capital management.
HomeServe plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 174 Group financial statements Notes to financial statements Year ended 31 March 2018 24.
Financial instruments continued Capital risk management continued Certain of the entities in the Group are subject to externally imposed capital requirements from the Financial Conduct Authority.
Where such requirements exist, the Group manages the risk through the close monitoring of performance and distributable capital within the entities impacted by the regulations.
The Group has complied with all such arrangements throughout the current and preceding year.
Financial risk management objectives The Group principally utilises cash and cash equivalents and bank and other loans for the purpose of raising finance for its operations.
The Group also has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly from its operations.
Financial risk management is overseen by the Board according to objectives, targets and policies set by the Board.
Treasury risk management, including management of currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk is carried out by a central Group Treasury function in accordance with objectives, targets and policies set by the Board.
Treasury is not a profit centre and does not enter into speculative transactions.
Classification of financial instruments The Groups financial assets and liabilities are disclosed in notes 20 to 23.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Foreign currency risk is minimised by the treasury borrowing approach set out in note 23.
Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates primarily relates to the Groups long-term debt requirements with floating interest rates.
The Groups policy is to manage its interest rate risk using a mix of fixed and variable rate debts.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible increase of 10% in the cost of borrowing, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings.
2018 2017 Increase in cost of borrowing 10% 10% Reduction in profit before tax m 0.3 0.1 HomeServe plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 175 Group financial statements Credit risk The Group trades only with creditworthy third parties.
It is the Groups policy that, with the exception of our policy membership customers, customers who wish to trade on credit terms are reviewed for financial stability.
The majority of the Groups trade receivables consist of a large number of individual members and hence for these balances the Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to a single counterparty.
As a result, the Groups exposure to bad debts is not considered to be significant.
Note 3 to the accounts contains further detail regarding the potential risk if cancellations were to be 10% higher than expected.
With respect to credit risk arising from cash and cash equivalents, the Groups exposure arises from the probability of default of the counterparty.
The Group manages the risk associated with cash and cash equivalents through depositing funds only with reputable and creditworthy banking institutions.
Liquidity risk Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Groups Board which sets the framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities and continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows.
Included in note 23 are details of the undrawn facilities that are available to the Group to reduce liquidity risk further, along with the weighted average interest rates paid on bank and other loans.
The actual payment profile of Other creditors is principally dependent upon the collection of the corresponding Other receivables from policyholders.
These amounts principally relate to underwriting, which are collected from policyholders and remitted to underwriters following cash collection.
Therefore, the actual cash flows may differ from those presented, but will not result in the acceleration of the settlement of the liability.

Share-based payments During the year ended 31 March 2018, the Group had three FY17: three share-based payment schemes, which are described below: i Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP provides for the grant of performance, matching and restricted awards.
The vesting period is normally three years.
Restricted awards are not subject to performance conditions.
Vesting of performance and matching awards granted in 2014 was dependent upon comparative Total Shareholder Return performance.
For performance and matching awards granted from 2015 onwards, 75% of each award is subject to an Earnings Per Share performance condition and the remaining 25% is subject to comparative Total Shareholder Return performance.
In 2016, members of the Executive Committee received an additional performance award which was subject to a more stretching Earnings Per Share performance condition.
ii Save As You Earn Scheme SAYE The SAYE was open to all UK employees and provides for an exercise price equal to the closing quoted market price on the day before the date of grant, less a discretionary discount.
The options can be exercised during a six month period following the completion of either a three or five year savings period.
There were no awards made in the year FY17: nil as the scheme is now closed.

Share-based payments continued iii One Plan One Plan is a share incentive scheme which is available to all employees.
For every two partnership shares purchased, participants will receive or have the right to receive one free matching share.
Matching shares are held in trust for a period of up to three years.

HomeServe plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 182 Group financial statements Notes to financial statements Year ended 31 March 2018 29.
Share-based payments continued The estimated fair values are calculated by applying a Black-Scholes option pricing model for SAYE and One Plan and Monte Carlo simulations for the LTIP.
The assumptions used in the models which are comparable to the prior year are as follows: Input Assumption Share price Price at date of grant Exercise price Per scheme rules Expected volatility 22% 52% Option life Per scheme rules Expected dividends Based on historic dividend yield Risk free interest rate 0.1% 1.3% Levels of early exercises and lapses are estimated using historical averages.
Volatility is calculated by looking at the historical share price movements prior to the date of grant over a period of time commensurate with the remaining term for each award.
In FY18 the Group recognised an IFRS 2 charge of 9.1m FY17: 7.4m related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
Retirement benefit schemes Defined contribution schemes The Group operates defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for all UK employees.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
Where there are employees who leave the scheme within two years of joining and they choose to take a refund, the contributions paid by the Group are forfeited by the employee.
In addition to the scheme in the UK, the Group operates a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme for North American employees.
The total cost charged to income of 4.7m FY17: 3.8m represents contributions payable to the schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the schemes.
At 31 March 2018, contributions of 227,000 FY17: 323,000 due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.
Defined benefit scheme The Group participates in a defined benefit scheme, the Water Companies Pension Scheme, which is closed to new members.
This is a sectionalised scheme and the Group participates in the HomeServe plc Section of the Scheme.
The Section is administered by a Trustee and is independent of the Groups finances.
Contributions are paid to the Section in accordance with the recommendations of an independent actuary.
HomeServe plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 183 Group financial statements The results of the actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2017 were updated to the accounting date by a qualified independent actuary in accordance with IAS19.
Remeasurements are recognised immediately through other comprehensive income.
Valuation at 2018 2017 Key assumptions used: Discount rate at 31 March 2.7% 2.6% Consumer price inflation 2.4% 2.4% Retail price inflation 3.4% 3.4% Expected rate of salary increases 2.4% 2.4% Future pension increases 2.4% 2.4% Life expectancy of female aged 60 at balance sheet date 29.5yrs 29.8yrs Life expectancy of male aged 60 at balance sheet date 28.2yrs 27.9yrs Pensions accounting entries are subject to judgement and volatility, as the majority of the assets are held within instruments with quoted market prices in an active market, whereas the present value of the obligation is linked to yields on AA-rated corporate bonds.
As an indication, all other things being equal: a reasonably possible increase in the discount rate of 0.5% would lead to a reduction in the value placed on the obligations of the Section of approximately 3.1m a reasonably possible increase in the inflation assumption rate of 0.5% would lead to an increase in the value placed on the obligations of the Section of approximately 3.2m an increase of life expectancy of one year would lead to an increase in the value placed on the obligations of the Section of approximately 0.9m.

Movements in the present value of defined benefit obligations were as follows: 2018 2017 m m At 1 April 35.2 26.6 Employers part of the current service cost 0.2 0.2 Interest cost 0.9 0.9 Actuarial gains losses due to: Changes in financial assumptions 1.2 7.8 Changes in demographic assumptions 0.9 Experience adjustments on benefit obligations 0.3 Benefits paid 1.2 0.3 At 31 March 33.3 35.2 HomeServe plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 185 Group financial statements Movements in the fair value of scheme assets were as follows: 2018 2017 m m At 1 April 35.9 28.7 Interest on Section assets 0.9 1.0 Actual return less interest on Section assets 0.3 4.4 Contributions from the employer 2.1 2.1 Benefits paid 1.2 0.3 At 31 March 38.0 35.9 The amount recognised outside the income statement in the statement of comprehensive income for FY18 is a gain of 2.1m FY17: loss of 3.4m.
The cumulative amount recognised outside the income statement at 31 March 2018 is a loss of 5.2m FY17: loss of 7.3m.
