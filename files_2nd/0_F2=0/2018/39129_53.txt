Prudential has agreed with the Financial Conduct Authority FCA to review annuities sold without advice after 1 July 2008 to its contract-based defined contribution pension customers.
The review is examining whether customers were given sufficient information about their potential eligibility to purchase an enhanced annuity, either from Prudential or another pension provider.
A gross provision of 400 million, before costs incurred, was established at 31 December 2017 to cover the costs of undertaking the review and any related redress and following a reassessment, no change has been made in 2018.
The majority of the provision will be utilised in 2019.
The ultimate amount that will be expended by the Group on the review will remain uncertain until the project is completed.
If the population subject to redress increased or decreased by 10 per cent, then the provision would be expected to increase or decrease by circa 7 per cent accordingly.
Additionally, in 2018, the Group agreed with its professional indemnity insurers that they will meet 166 million of the Groups claims costs, which will be paid as the Group incurs costs redress.
This has been recognised on the Groups balance sheet within Other debtors at 31 December 2018.
C12 Capital C12.1 Group objectives, policies and processes for managing capital i Capital measure The Group manages its Group Solvency II own funds as its measure of capital.
At 31 December 2018 estimated Group Solvency II own funds are 30.2 billion 31 December 2017: 26.4 billion.
ii External capital requirements Solvency II is the Groups consolidated capital regime.
Solvency II is a risk-based solvency framework required under the European Solvency II Directive as implemented by the Prudential Regulatory Authority in the UK.
The Solvency II surplus represents the aggregated capital held by the Group less Solvency Capital Requirements.
iii Meeting of capital management objectives The Group Solvency Capital Requirement has been met during 2018.
As well as holding sufficient capital to meet Solvency II requirements at Group level, the Group also closely manages the cash it holds within its central holding companies so that it can: Maintain flexibility, fund new opportunities and absorb shock events: Fund dividends: and Cover central costs and debt payments.
More details on holding company cash flows and balances are given in section II a of the Additional unaudited financial information.
While the Group at a consolidated level is subject to the Solvency II requirements, at a business unit level capital is defined by local capital regulations and local business needs.
Each of the Groups long-term business operations is capitalised to a sufficiently strong level for its individual circumstances.
The Group manages its assets, liabilities and capital locally, in accordance with local regulatory requirements and reflecting the different types of liabilities in each business unit.
As a result of the diversity of products offered by Prudential and the different regulatory regimes under which it operates, the Group employs differing methods of asset liability and capital management, depending on the business concerned.
Stochastic modelling of assets and liabilities is undertaken in the UK, US and Asia to assess the economic capital requirements.
A stochastic approach models the inter-relationship between asset and liability movements, taking into account asset correlation, management actions and policyholder behaviour under a large number of alternative economic scenarios.
