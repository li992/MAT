Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Additional Information for US Listing Purposes 149 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR US LISTING PURPOSES CONTINUED DIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES EMPLOYEES The average number of employees for the last three years is provided in note 4A on page 86.
The average number of employees during 2018 included 7,996 seasonal workers.
We believe our relationship with our employees and any labour unions of which they may be part is satisfactory in all material respects.
GLOBAL EMPLOYEE SHARE PLANS SHARES In November 2014, Unilevers global employee plan SHARES was launched in 17 countries.
SHARES gives eligible Unilever employees below senior management level the opportunity to invest between 25 and 200 per month from their net salary in Unilever shares.
For every three shares our employees buy Investment Shares, Unilever will give them one free Matching Share, which will vest if employees hold their Investment Shares for at least three years.
The Matching Shares are not subject to any performance conditions.
In 2015, SHARES was rolled out globally and is now offered in more than 100 countries.
Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in SHARES.
As of 21 February 2019, awards for 291,657 NV and 219,423 PLC shares were outstanding under SHARES.
NORTH AMERICAN SHARE PLANS Unilever also maintains share plans for its North American employees that are governed by an umbrella plan referred to as the Unilever North America Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan.
These plans are the North American equivalents of the Unilever Share Plan 2017 and the GSIP, MCIP and SHARES plans.
The rules governing these share plans are materially the same as the rules governing the Unilever Share Plan 2017, GSIP, MCIP and SHARES plans, respectively.
However, the plans contain non-competition and non-solicitation covenants and they are subject to US and Canadian employment and tax laws.
The plans are administered by the North America Compensation Committee of Unilever United States Inc. and they are governed by New York law.
The foregoing description of the Unilever North America Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Unilever North America Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan, including all amendments thereto, filed as Exhibit 99.1 to the Form S-8 File No.
333-185299 filed with the SEC on 6 December 2012, which is incorporated herein by reference.
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE The Committee is concerned with the remuneration of the Executive and Non-Executive Directors and the tier of management directly below the Boards.
It also has responsibility for the cash and executive and all employee share-based incentive plans, the Remuneration Policy and performance evaluation of the Unilever Leadership Executive.
DIRECTORS AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT FAMILY RELATIONSHIP There are no family relationships between any of our Executive Directors, members of the ULE or Non-Executive Directors.
OTHER ARRANGEMENTS None of our Non-Executive Directors, Executive Directors or other key management personnel are elected or appointed under any arrangement or understanding with any major shareholder, customer, supplier or others.
150 Additional Information for US Listing Purposes Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2018 MAJOR SHAREHOLDERS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS MAJOR SHAREHOLDERS The voting rights of the significant shareholders of NV and PLC are the same as for other holders of the class of share held by such significant shareholder.
The principal trading markets upon which Unilever shares are listed are Euronext Amsterdam for NV ordinary shares and the depositary receipts thereof, and the London Stock Exchange for PLC ordinary shares.
NV ordinary shares mainly trade in the form of depositary receipts for shares.
In the United States, NV New York Registry Shares and PLC American Depositary Receipts are traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas Deutsche Bank acts for NV and PLC as issuer, transfer agent and, in respect of the PLC American Depositary Receipts, depositary.
At 21 February 2019 the latest practicable date for inclusion in this report, there were 4,134 registered holders of NV New York Registry Shares and 841 registered holders of PLC American Depositary Receipts in the United States.
We estimate that approximately 10% of NVs ordinary shares including shares underlying NV New York Registry shares were held in the United States approximately 11% in 2017 and approximately 11% of PLCs ordinary shares including shares underlying PLC American Depositary Receipts were held in the United States approximately 10% in 2017.
NV and PLC are separate companies with separate stock exchange listings and different shareholders.
Shareholders cannot convert or exchange the shares of one for shares of the other and the relative share prices on the various markets can, and do, fluctuate.
Each NV ordinary share represents the same underlying economic interest in the Unilever Group as each PLC ordinary share save for exchange rate fluctuations.
If you are a shareholder of NV, you have an interest in a Dutch legal entity, your dividends will be paid in euros converted into US dollars if you have shares registered in the United States and you may be subject to tax in the Netherlands.
If you are a shareholder of PLC, your interest is in a UK legal entity, your dividends will be paid in sterling converted into US dollars if you have American Depositary Receipts and you may be subject to UK tax.
Nevertheless, the Equalisation Agreement means that as a shareholder of either company you effectively have an interest in the whole of Unilever.
On a going concern basis, you have largely equal rights over our combined net profit and capital reserves as shown in the consolidated accounts.
To Unilevers knowledge, the Unilever Group is not owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by another corporation, any foreign government or by any other legal or natural person, severally or jointly.
The Group is not aware of any arrangements the operation of which may at any subsequent date result in a change of control of Unilever.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Transactions with related parties are conducted in accordance with agreed transfer pricing policies and include sales to joint ventures and associates.
Other than those disclosed in Notes 23 to 24 to the consolidated financial statements and incorporated herein as above, there were no related party transactions that were material to the Group or to the related parties concerned that are required to be reported in 2018 up to 21 February 2019 the latest practicable date for inclusion in this report.
DIVIDEND RECORD The following tables show the dividends declared and dividends paid by NV and PLC for the last five years, expressed in terms of the revised share denominations which became effective from 22 May 2006.
Differences between the amounts ultimately received by US holders of NV and PLC shares are the result of changes in exchange rates between the equalisation of the dividends and the date of payment.
Following agreement at the 2009 Annual General Meetings AGMs and separate meetings of ordinary shareholders, the Equalisation Agreement was modified to facilitate the payment of quarterly dividends from 2010 onwards.

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING In accordance with the requirements of Section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the following report is provided by management in respect of the Groups internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15 f or rule 15d15 f under the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934 : Unilevers management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Group: Unilevers management has used the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO framework 2013 to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
Management believes that the COSO framework 2013 is a suitable framework for its evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting because it is free from bias, permits reasonably consistent qualitative and quantitative measurements of internal controls, is sufficiently complete so that those relevant factors that would alter a conclusion about the effectiveness of internal controls are not omitted and is relevant to an evaluation of internal control over financial reporting: Management has assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2018, and has concluded that such internal control over financial reporting is effective.
Managements assessment and conclusion excludes Adityaa Milk, Equilibra, Betty Ice, Denny Ice, and Vegetarian Butcher from this assessment, as they were acquired on 27 September 2018, 1 October 2018, 1 November 2018, 3 December 2018, and 31 December 2018 respectively.
