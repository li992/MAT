Financial risk management Group Treasury activity The Groups Treasury function is responsible for raising finance for the Groups operations, together with associated liquidity management and management of foreign exchange, interest rate and credit risks.
Treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and guidelines authorised and reviewed annually by both the Audit Committee and the Board, which receive regular updates of Treasury activity.
Derivative instruments are transacted for risk management purposes only.
It is the Groups policy that all hedging is to cover known risks and no speculative trading is undertaken.
Regular and frequent reporting to management is required for all transactions and exposures, and the internal control environment is subject to periodic review by the Groups internal audit team.
The Groups principal market risks are exposures to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates, which arise both from the Groups sources of finance and its operations.
Following evaluation of those market risks, the Group selectively enters into derivative financial instruments to manage these exposures.
The principal instruments currently used are interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risks, and cross-currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge transactional and translational currency exposures.
Interest rate risk The Group has financial exposures to UK, Euro and US interest rates, arising primarily from the Groups long-term bonds and other borrowings.
The Groups hedging policy requires that between 50% and 85% of borrowings are held at fixed rates.
This is achieved by issuing fixed rate bonds or floating rate notes and then using interest rate swaps to adjust the balance between fixed and floating rate debt.
The Groups bank debt is at floating rates, and, if drawn, would mean that the mix of fixed and floating rate debt would fluctuate and would therefore be managed to ensure compliance with the Groups hedging policy.
At 30 June 2018, 80% of borrowings were held at fixed rates after hedging 2017: 80%.
The Group uses derivatives to convert all of its US dollar-denominated debt and associated interest rate obligations to pounds sterling or euros see section on foreign exchange risk for further detail.
At 30 June 2018, the Group had no net US dollar denominated interest rate exposure on its borrowings 2017: none.
The Group designates certain interest rate swaps as hedges of interest rate risk and certain cross-currency swaps as fair value hedges of both interest rate risk and currency risk.
Movements in the fair value of the hedged exposure are taken to the income statement and are offset by movements in the fair value of the hedging instruments, which are also taken to the income statement.
Any hedge ineffectiveness is recognised directly in the income statement.
In the year ended 30 June 2018, this amounted to less than 1 million 2017: 1 million.
At 30 June 2018 and 30 June 2017, the Groups annual finance costs would increase or decrease by less than 1 million for a one-notch downgrade or upgrade in credit rating assuming the RCF remains undrawn.
Interest rate sensitivity The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative financial instruments at the balance sheet date.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date is outstanding for the whole year.
For each one hundred basis point rise or fall in interest rates, and if all other variables were held constant at 30 June 2018: The Groups profit for the year ended 30 June 2018 would increase or decrease by 30 million 2017: profit for the year would increase or decrease by 39 million.
Other equity reserves would decrease or increase by 15 million 2017: decrease or increase by 26 million, arising from movements in cash flow hedges.
A one hundred basis point rise or fall in interest rates represents a large but realistic movement which can easily be multiplied to give sensitivities at different interest rates.
The sensitivity analyses provided are hypothetical only and should be used with caution as the impacts provided are not necessarily indicative of the actual impacts that would be experienced because the Groups actual exposure to market rates changes as the Groups portfolio of debt, cash and foreign currency contracts changes.
In addition, the effect of a change in a particular market variable on fair values or cash flows is calculated without considering interrelationships between the various market rates or mitigating actions that would be taken by the Group.
The changes in valuations are estimates of the impact of changes in market variables and are not a prediction of future events or anticipated gains or losses.
Foreign exchange risk A combination of cross-currency and interest rate swap arrangements is used to convert the Groups debt and associated interest rate obligations to pounds sterling or euros, at fixed exchange rates.
At 30 June 2018, the split of the Groups aggregate borrowings into their core currencies was US dollar 34%, euros 52% and pounds sterling 14% 2017: US dollar 38%, euros 46% and pounds sterling 16%.
At 30 June 2018, 18% of the Groups long-term borrowings, after the impact of derivatives, are denominated in pounds sterling and 82% in euros 2017: 25% in pounds sterling and 75% in euros.
The Group is exposed to currency translation on the consolidation of its foreign operations.
It uses certain borrowings and derivative instruments to hedge its net investments in these subsidiaries.
The majority of the Groups revenues and operating expenses are denominated in pounds sterling.
In the current year, approximately 36% of operating expenses 4,559 million were denominated in euros 2017: approximately 35% 4,167 million and approximately 9% of operating expenses 1,070 million were denominated in US dollars 2017: approximately 9% 1,056 million.
In the current year, approximately 38% of revenues 5,124 million were denominated in euros 2017: 37% 4,832 million.
Following the acquisitions of Sky Deutschland and Sky Italia, the Group Treasury function hedges the foreign currency exposure of its foreign subsidiaries into its functional currency.
In all territories the US dollar expense relates mainly to the Groups programming contracts with US suppliers, together with US dollar-denominated set-top box costs.
In the UK the euro revenues primarily relate to subscribers located in Ireland.
The UKs exposure to euro-denominated revenue is offset to a certain extent by euro-denominated costs, related mainly to certain transponder costs and euro financing costs on its borrowings: the net position being a euro surplus 2017: surplus.
112 Sky plc Financial statements The Group hedges currency exposures on US dollar denominated highly probable cash flows by using forward foreign exchange contracts purchased up to five years ahead of the cash flow and currently does not hedge transactional euro exposures arising in the UK.
It is the Groups policy that all US dollar foreign currency exposures are substantially hedged in advance of the year in which they occur.
At 30 June 2018, the Group had purchased forward foreign exchange contracts representing: Approximately 88% of US dollar-denominated costs falling due within one year 2017: 87%, and on a declining basis across five-year planning horizon are hedged via: Outstanding commitments to purchase, in aggregate, US$2,661 million 2017: US$2,714 million at an average rate of US$1.36 to 1.00 2017: US$1.34 to 1.00.
Outstanding commitments to purchase, in aggregate, US$1.706 million 2017: US$1,669 million at an average rate of US$1.22 to 1.00 2017: US$1.17 to 1.00.
In respect of the UK legacy euro hedging programme and to hedge current balance sheet exposures: Outstanding commitments to sell, in aggregate, 726 million 2017: 760 million at an average rate of 1.14 to 1.00 2017: 1.15 to 1.00.
Outstanding commitments to purchase, in aggregate, 335 million 2017: 444 million at an average rate of 1.13 to 1.00 2017: 1.15 to 1.00.
In respect of the Groups European subsidiaries to hedge their material non-functional currency exposures: Outstanding commitment to purchase, in aggregate, 65 million 2017: 73 million at an average rate of 0.87 to 1.00 2017: 0.84 to 1.00.
No forward foreign exchange contracts fall due beyond five years 2017: nil.
The Group designates the following as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting purposes: Forward foreign exchange contracts Cross-currency swaps where interest on both legs is at a fixed interest rate.
As such, the effective portion of the gain or loss on these contracts is reported as a component of the hedging reserve, outside the income statement, and is then reclassified to the income statement in the same periods that the forecast transactions affect the income statement.
Ineffectiveness of less than 1 million was recognised in the income statement during the year 2017: less than 1 million.
A combination of US dollar denominated interest rate and US dollar pound sterling cross-currency swaps is used to convert fixed dollar denominated debt to floating sterling denominated debt.
The interest rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges.
The associated cross-currency swaps are not designated as hedging instruments for hedge accounting purposes and, as such, movements in their value are recorded directly in the income statement.
Foreign exchange sensitivity The following analysis details the Groups sensitivity to movements in pounds sterling and euros against those currencies in which it has significant transactions.
The sensitivity analysis includes foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and outstanding foreign currency denominated financial instruments and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 25% change in foreign currency rates.
A 25% strengthening in pounds sterling against the US dollar would have the effect of decreasing profit by 11 million 2017: decreasing profit by 18 million, none of which relates to non-cash movements in the valuation of derivatives 2017: losses of 5 million.
The same strengthening would have an adverse impact on other equity of 366 million 2017: adverse impact of 436 million.
A 25% weakening in pounds sterling against the US dollar would have the effect of increasing profit by 19 million 2017: increasing profit by 30 million, none of which relates to non-cash movements in the valuation of derivatives 2017: gains of 9 million.
The same weakening would have a beneficial impact on other equity of 611 million 2017: beneficial impact of 727 million.
A 25% strengthening in pounds sterling against the euro would have the effect of increasing profit by 63 million 2017: increasing profit by 75 million of which gains of 73 million relate to non-cash movements in the valuation of derivatives 2017: gains of 80 million.
The same strengthening would have a beneficial impact on other equity of 17 million 2017: beneficial impact of 45 million.
A 25% weakening in pounds sterling against the euro would have the effect of decreasing profit by 108 million 2017: decreasing profit by 123 million of which losses of 122 million relate to non-cash movements in the valuation of derivatives 2017: losses of 133 million.
The same weakening would have an adverse impact on other equity of 29 million 2017: adverse impact of 76 million.
A 25% strengthening in the euro against the US dollar would have the effect of increasing profit by 6 million 2017: increasing profit by 8 million, none of which relates to non-cash movements in the valuation of derivatives.
The same strengthening would have an adverse impact on other equity of 272 million 2017: 272 million.
A 25% weakening in the euro against the US dollar would have the effect of decreasing profit by 10 million 2017: decreasing profit by 13 million, none of which relates to non-cash movements in the valuation of derivatives.
The same weakening would have a beneficial impact on other equity of 453 million 2017: 453 million.
The sensitivity analyses provided are hypothetical only and should be used with caution as the impacts provided are not necessarily indicative of the actual impacts that would be experienced because the Groups actual exposure to market rates is constantly changing as the Groups portfolio of debt, cash and foreign currency contracts changes.
Annual Report 2018 113 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 22.
Financial risk management continued Hedge accounting The interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk sections above outline the Groups policies regarding use of derivative products.
Further detail on valuations and the impact of hedge accounting during the year are provided in note 21. Credit risk The Group is exposed to counterparty default risk arising in respect of invested cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits, and the positive fair value of derivative financial assets held.
This risk is deemed to be low.
Counterparty risk forms a central part of the Groups Treasury policy, which is monitored and reported on regularly.
The Group manages credit risk by diversifying its exposures across a wide number of counterparties, such that the maximum exposure to any individual counterparty was 6% of the total asset value of instruments at the end of the year.
Treasury policies ensure that all derivative transactions are only effected with strong relationship banks and, at the date of signing, each existing derivative counterparty carried a minimum credit rating of Baa2 or equivalent from Standard & Poors.
To mitigate remaining risks, counterparty credit and sovereign ratings are closely monitored, and no more than 10% of cash deposits are held with a single bank counterparty with the exception of overnight deposits which are invested in a spread of AAAf rated liquidity funds.
The amount recognised in the income statement in respect of credit risk for derivatives deemed held for trading is less than 1 million 2017: 2 million.
Credit risk in our residential customer base is mitigated by billing and collecting in advance for digital television subscriptions for the majority of our residential customer base.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk on trade receivables is the carrying amounts as disclosed in note 17.
Liquidity risk Our principal source of liquidity is cash generated from operations, combined with access to a 1 billion RCF, which expires in November 2021.
At 30 June 2018, this facility was undrawn 30 June 2017: undrawn.
To ensure continuity of funding, the Groups policy is to ensure that available funding matures over a period of years.
At 30 June 2018, 46% 2017: 54% of the Groups total available funding including available undrawn amounts on our RCF was due to mature in more than five years.
Full details of the Groups borrowings and undrawn facilities are shown in note 20, other than trade and other payables, shown in note 18, and provisions, shown in note 19.
The following table analyses the Groups non-derivative financial liabilities, net settled derivative financial instruments and gross settled financial instruments into relevant maturity groupings, based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows and may therefore not reconcile to the amounts disclosed on the balance sheet for borrowings, derivative financial instruments, provisions and trade and other payables.
