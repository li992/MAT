Alternative performance measures The performance of the Group is assessed using a number of Alternative Performance Measures APMs.
The Groups results are presented both before and after separately disclosed items.
Adjusted profitability measures are presented excluding separately disclosed items as we believe this provides both management and investors with useful additional information about the Groups performance and supports a more effective comparison of the Groups trading performance from one period to the next.
Adjusted profitability measures are reconciled to unadjusted IFRS results on the face of the income statement with details of separately disclosed items provided in note 2.2.
The Groups results are also described using other measures that are not defined under IFRS and are therefore considered to be APMs.
These APMs are used by management to monitor business performance against both shorter-term budgets and forecasts but also against the Groups longer-term strategic plans.
APMs used to explain and monitor Group performance include: APM Definition Source EBITDA Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.
