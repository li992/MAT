The trustees of the Adelphi-Carlton Contributory Pension Plan have not agreed that any surplus on the plan can be refunded to the Group.
Accordingly the surplus has not been recognised.
The scheme has a surplus of $1.0m as at 31 December 2018 2017:$1.1m.
Actuaries for Adelphi-Carlton Limited carried out the last actuarial valuation of the Scheme as at 1 April 2016.

In view of this, a suspension of Group contributions was in force from 1 April 2001 to 31 December 2016.
Total contributions for the years ended 31 December 2018 were $nil 2017: $nil.
No contributions are expected for the year ending 31 December 2019.
Accrued Employee Retirement Rights Local applicable labour laws and agreements in the ROW require certain Group companies to pay severance pay to dismissed orretiring employees including those leaving their employment under certain other circumstances.
The calculation of the severance pay liability has been made in accordance with labour agreements in force and based on salary components that, inmanagements opinion, create entitlement to severance pay.
Group companies severance pay liabilities to their employees are funded partially by regular deposits with recognised pension and severance pay funds in the employees names and by purchase of insurance policies.
They are accounted for as if they were adefined contribution plan.
The amounts funded as above are netted against the related liabilities and are not reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position since they are not under the control and management of the companies.
The amounts of the liability for severance pay presented in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position see below reflect that part of the liability notcovered by the funds and the insurance policies mentioned above, as well as the liability that is funded by deposits with recognised central severance pay funds held under the name of the Companys subsidiaries.
The cost of severance provision is determined according to the projected unit credit method.
It has been calculated using adiscounted cash flow approach.
The calculations are based on the following assumptions: Discount at 31 December 2018 2.09% 2017: 2.08% Expected returns on plan assets at 31 December 2018 1.45% 2017: 1.73% The net provision for accrued employee rights upon retirement comprises: 31 December 31 December 2018 2017 $m $m Present value of unfunded obligation 6.1 5.6 Less: Fair value of plan assets 2.9 2.5 Total obligation 3.2 3.1 Movements in the provision for accrued employee rights upon retirement: Gross Amount Net amount deposited amount $m $m $m At start of period 5.6 2.5 3.1 Payments made upon retirement 0.6 1.2 1.8 Net movement in provision charged to net profit 1.5 0.6 2.1 Foreign exchange movements 0.4 0.2 0.2 Total obligation 6.1 2.9 3.2 Defined Contribution Pension Plans The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension plans.
The total expense relating to these plans in the current year was $2.8m 2017: $2.7m.
