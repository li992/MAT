Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Preparation These consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, as adopted by the European Union.
International Financial Reporting Standards are issued by the International Accounting Standard Board IASB.
IFRSs that are mandatory for application for the annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, but not adopted by the European Union, do not have any significant impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except as disclosed in the accounting policies below.
Exceptions include, but are not limited to, property, plant and equipment at the date of transition to IFRS accounted for at deemed cost, equity instruments measured at fair value, assets classified as held for sale measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and post-employment benefits measured at present value.
Going Concern These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
Changes in Accounting Policies New Revised Standards and Interpretations Adopted in 2018: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Starting from 2018, the Group applies IFRS 9 Financial Instruments that replaced IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
The impact of the adoption of IFRS 9 to the Groups consolidated financial statements was as follows: a Classification and measurement IFRS 9 contains a new classification and measurement approach for financial assets that reflects the business model, in which assets are managed and their cash flow characteristics.
IFRS 9 includes three principal classification categories for financial assets: measured at amortised cost, at fair value through other comprehensive income and at fair value through profit or loss.
It eliminates the existing IAS 39 categories of held to maturity, loans and receivables and available-for-sale financial assets.
The Group continued measuring all financial assets, which were previously measured at fair value, at fair value through profit or loss with the exception of equity investments in Delong Holdings Limited, which were classified as available-for-sale at 31 December 2017 Note 13.
At 1 January 2018, the Group has irrevocably designated these investments as measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.
For such financial instruments all subsequent changes in fair value are reported in other comprehensive income, no impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss and no gains or losses are recycled to profit or loss upon derecognition.
Loans and trade receivables are held to collect contractual cash flows and are expected to give rise to cash flows representing solely payments of principal and interest.
The Group analysed the contractual cash flow characteristics of those instruments and concluded that they meet the criteria for amortised cost measurement under IFRS 9.
Therefore, reclassification for these instruments was not required.
b Impairment Under IFRS 9, the new impairment model requires the recognition of impairment provisions based on the expected credit losses rather than only incurred credit losses under IAS 39.
The expected credit losses represent measures of an assets credit risk.
This requires judgement about how changes in economic factors affect expected credit losses, which is determined on a probability-weighted basis.
153 EVRAZ plc Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Changes in Accounting Policies continued New Revised Standards and Interpretations Adopted in 2018 continued The new impairment model applies to the Groups financial assets, including, but not limited to, trade and other receivables, loans receivable, restricted deposits, cash and cash equivalents.
Loss allowances are measured on either of the following bases: 12-month basis these are expected credit losses that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date: or lifetime basis these are expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument.
This did not impact on the loss allowance for trade debtors and other financial assets held at amortised cost.
The Groups cash and cash equivalents have low credit risk based on the external credit ratings of banks and financial institutions.
Therefore, the Group determined that no additional allowances are required at 1 January 2018 in connection with the adoption of the new impairment model under IFRS 9. c Hedge accounting The Group made a choice to continue applying IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement to all existing hedge contracts.
The Group has elected the modified retrospective approach for IFRS 9, but it did not record the cumulative impact of the new standard upon initial application due to its immateriality.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 establishes a five-step model to account for revenue arising from contracts with customers.
Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer.
The new revenue standard superseded all previous revenue recognition requirements under IFRS.
The Group analysed the impacts of IFRS 15 on its consolidated financial statements considering the following: a Sale of goods and services For contracts with customers in which the sale of goods produced by the Group is generally expected to be the only performance obligation, adoption of IFRS 15 had no any impact on the Groups revenue and profit or loss.
The Group continued to recognise the revenue at the point in time when control of the asset is transferred to the customer, generally on dispatch or shipping of the goods.
Some contracts with customers provide a right of return, trade discounts or volume rebates.
The Group recognises revenue from the sale of goods measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of the estimated returns and price concessions, trade discounts and volume rebates.
IFRS 15 requires the estimated variable consideration to be constrained to prevent over-recognition of revenue, i. e. variable consideration should be recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.
The application of the constraint did not result in any effects as the Group applied similar principles.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Changes in Accounting Policies continued b Advances received from customers Under certain contracts, the Group produces steel products specifically for the needs of some customers.
The Group has enforceable rights to payment of 100% of the contract price if the contract is cancelled after the pipe manufacturing process has begun.
The Group recognises revenue from such contracts at the moment of the transfer of control.
The Group analysed whether these contracts require the recognition of revenue over the period of manufacturing the products and concluded that the performance obligation under these contracts does not meet criteria for the recognition over time.
The Group concluded that the customers do not simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided by the Groups performance nor do the customers control the assets as it is created or enhanced.
Also despite the steel products are manufactured under customer specifications, they can be sold to another customer without any rework at a market price or with a discount.
The Group receives only short-term advances from its customers.
The Group decided to use the practical expedient provided in IFRS 15, which allows not to adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component in the contracts where the Group expects, at contract inception, that the period between the Groups transfer of a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less.
Therefore, for short-term advances, the Group will not account for a financing component even if it is significant.
c Principal versus agent considerations The Group enters into contracts with its customers, under which the Group provides transportation and handling services using third party providers i. e. the Group selects suitable firms and manages the shipment and delivery.
These services are provided to the customers before, or after, they obtain control over the goods.
The cost of services is included in the contract price.
Under IFRS 15, transportation and handling services rendered by the Group before control over the goods is transferred to the customers do not represent a separate performance obligation.
Therefore, the Group continued to recognise these services at the moment when control over the goods is passed to the customers.
With respect to the contracts when the Group provides transportation and handling services after obtaining control over the goods by the customers, the Group concluded that these services represent a separate performance obligation and the Group acts as a principal rather than an agent.
Consequently, the control over its services is transferred over time.
This change in the accounting policies had no significant impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements and, therefore, the Group did not adjust its consolidated financial statements or the comparative amounts at the date of initial recognition of IFRS 15. d Presentation and disclosure requirements For the performance obligations under transportation and handling services rendered by the Group in contracts in which it acts as a principal, it was decided to continue presenting revenues from these services within the caption Sales of goods in the consolidated statement of operations.
e Other adjustments The recognition and measurement requirements in IFRS 15 are also applicable for recognition and measurement of any gains or losses on disposal of non-financial assets such as items of property and equipment and intangible assets, when that disposal is not in the ordinary course of business.
There were no such transactions in the reporting period.
The Group has elected the modified retrospective approach for IFRS 15, but it did not record the cumulative impact of the new standard upon initial application due to its immateriality.
155 EVRAZ plc Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Changes in Accounting Policies continued Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions The IASB issued amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment that address three main areas: the effects of vesting conditions on the measurement of a cash-settled share-based payment transaction: the classification of a share-based payment transaction with net settlement features for withholding tax obligations: and accounting where a modification to the terms and conditions of a share-based payment transaction changes its classification from cash settled to equity settled.
On adoption, entities are required to apply the amendments without restating prior periods, but retrospective application is permitted if elected for all three amendments and other criteria are met.
These amendments do not have any impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements.
Amendments to IAS 40 Transfers of Investment Property The amendments clarify when an entity should transfer property, including property under construction or development into, or out of investment property.
The amendments state that a change in use occurs when the property meets, or ceases to meet, the definition of investment property and there is evidence of the change in use.
A mere change in managements intentions for the use of a property does not provide evidence of a change in use.
IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration The Interpretation clarifies that, in determining the spot exchange rate to use on initial recognition of the related asset, expense or income or part of it on the derecognition of a non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability relating to advance consideration, the date of the transaction is the date on which an entity initially recognises the non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability arising from the advance consideration.
If there are multiple payments or receipts in advance, then the entity must determine a date of the transactions for each payment or receipt of advance consideration.
This Interpretation does not have any impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements as the Group applies the same accounting practice.
Other amendments, clarifications and improvements, which became effective from 1 January 2018, had no impact on the financial position and performance of the Group or the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
The Group has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective.

Significant Accounting Policies continued Changes in Accounting Policies continued Standards Issued But Not Yet Effective in the European Union continued The Group expects that the adoption of the pronouncements listed above, except for IFRS 16, will not have a significant impact on the Groups results of operations and financial position in the period of initial application.
The Group plans to apply IFRS 16 Leases from 1 January 2019 using the modified retrospective approach, i. e. the comparative information will not be restated.
Under this approach both lease liabilities and right-of-use assets will be recognised at the date of transition to IFRS 16 in the same amount.
The Group has completed the analysis of possible impact of the application of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.
Main categories of contracts, which will be affected by the requirements of IFRS 16, are operating leases of gondola cars, land under production facilities and land used for mining, and certain items of machinery and equipment.
The Group expects to recognise approximately $200 million of lease liabilities as a result of application of the new standard.
The Group will not apply IFRS 16 for the leases to explore for or use coal, iron ore and similar non-regenerative resources.
Currently the Group is reviewing its lease portfolio to determine which leases will not be subject to IFRS 16.
The Group has elected to use the following practical expedients proposed by the standard: on initial application initial direct costs will be excluded from the measurement of the right-of-use asset: on initial application IFRS 16 will only be applied to contracts that were previously classified as leases: for all classes of underlying assets each lease component and any associated non-lease components will be accounted as a single lease component: lease payments for contracts with a duration of 12 months or less or leases for which the underlying assets are of low value will continue to be expensed to the statement of profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
In previous years and in 2018, the majority of the Groups outstanding short and long-term lease agreements were cancellable.
IAS 17 requires disclosing operating lease commitments only for non-cancellable leases, while under IFRS 16 the Group is also required to include in lease liabilities the payments relating to the term periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the lessee is reasonably certain not to exercise that option.
Significant Accounting Judgements and Estimates Accounting Judgements In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, apart from those involving estimates, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements: In 2015, following the placement of Highveld Steel and Vanadium Limited under the business rescue procedures, the Group lost control over the subsidiary and it is not expected that it will re-obtain control in the future.
As a result, the Group ceased to consolidate this entity starting 14 April 2015.
The Group determined based on the criteria in IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease that the supply contracts with PraxAir and Air Liquide do not contain a lease.
These contracts included the construction of air separation plants by PraxAir and Air Liquide to be owned and operated by them and the supply of oxygen and other industrial gases produced by the enities to the Groups steel plants for a long-term period on a take or pay basis.
Management believes that these arrangements do not convey a right to the Group to use the assets as the Group does not have an ability to operate the assets or to direct other parties to operate the assets: it does not control physical access to the assets: and it is expected that more than an insignificant amount of the assets output will be sold to the parties unrelated to the Group.
The commitments under the contracts are disclosed in Note 30.
Estimation Uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, the Group makes an estimate of the assets recoverable amount.
An assets recoverable amount is the higher of an assets or cash-generating units fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the assets.
In 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Group recognised a net impairment reversal loss of $ 30 million, $20 million and $ 151 million, respectively Notes 6 and 9.
The determination of impairments of property, plant and equipment involves the use of estimates that include, but are not limited to, the cause, timing and amount of the impairment.
Impairment is based on a large number of factors, such as changes in current competitive conditions, expectations of growth in the industry, increased cost of capital, changes in the future availability of financing, technological obsolescence, discontinuance of service, current replacement costs and other changes in circumstances that indicate that impairment exists.
In 2018, the impairment test models take into account the tariffs imposed by the US and Canada against each other on import of steel and steel products, whose effect is assumed to last until 2022 Note 6.
157 EVRAZ plc Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Significant Accounting Judgements and Estimates continued Estimation Uncertainty continued Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment continued The determination of the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit involves the use of estimates by management.
Methods used to determine the value in use include discounted cash flow-based methods, which require the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
These estimates, including the methodologies used, may have a material impact on the value in use and, ultimately, the amount of any impairment.
Impairment of Goodwill The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at least on an annual basis.
This requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated.
Estimating the value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cashgenerating unit and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
The carrying amount of goodwill at 31 December 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $864 million, $917 million and $880 million, respectively.
In 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Group recognised an impairment loss in respect of goodwill in the amount of $Nil, $Nil and $316 million, respectively Note 5.
More details of the assumptions used in estimating the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill is allocated are provided in Note 6.
Mineral Reserves Mineral reserves and the associated mine plans are a material factor in the Groups computation of a depletion charge.
The Group estimates its mineral reserves in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves JORC Code.
Estimation of reserves in accordance with the JORC Code involves some degree of uncertainty.
The uncertainty depends mainly on the amount of reliable geological and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of this data, which also requires use of subjective judgement and development of assumptions.
The changes in the pricing environment and geology-related risk factors may lead to a revision of mining plans, decisions to abandon or to mothball certain parts of a mine, to a reassessment of the capital expenditures required for the extraction of the proved and probable reserves, as well as to the changes in the resources classified as proved and probable reserves.
As the value of the Groups mining assets is very significant Note 9, these changes may have a material impact on the depletion charge and impairment, which may arise as a result of a decline in the recoverable amounts of the affected mines.
Post-Employment Benefits The Group uses an actuarial valuation method for the measurement of the present value of post-employment benefit obligations and related current service cost.
This involves the use of demographic assumptions about the future characteristics of the current and former employees who are eligible for benefits mortality, both during and after employment, rates of employee turnover, disability and early retirement, etc.
as well as financial assumptions discount rate, future salary and benefit levels, expected rate of return on plan assets, etc.. More details are provided in Note 23.
Foreign Currency Transactions The presentation currency of the Group is the US dollar because presentation in US dollars is most relevant for the major current and potential users of the consolidated financial statements.
The functional currencies of the Groups subsidiaries are the Russian rouble, US dollar, euro, Czech koruna, South African rand, Canadian dollar and Ukrainian hryvnia.
At the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the US dollar are translated into the presentation currency at the rate of exchange ruling at the end of the reporting period, and their statements of operations are translated at the exchange rates that approximate the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.
The exchange differences arising on the translation are taken directly to a separate component of equity.
On disposal of a subsidiary with functional currency other than the US dollar, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular subsidiary is recognised in the statement of operations.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Foreign Currency Transactions continued The following exchange rates were used in the consolidated financial statements: 2018 2017 2016 31 December average 31 December average 31 December average USD RUB 69.4706 62.7078 57.6002 58.3529 60.6569 67.0349 EUR RUB 79.4605 73.9546 68.8668 65.9014 63.8111 74.2336 EUR USD 1.1450 1.1810 1.1993 1.1297 1.0541 1.1069 USD CAD 1.3658 1.2962 1.2530 1.2979 1.3427 1.3248 USD UAH 27.6880 27.2029 28.0672 26.5947 27.1909 25.5458 Transactions in foreign currencies in each subsidiary of the Group are initially recorded in the functional currency at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the end of the reporting period.
All resulting differences are taken to the statement of operations.
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.
Basis of Consolidation Subsidiaries Subsidiaries, which are those entities in which the Group has an interest of more than 50% of the voting rights and over which the Group has control, or otherwise has power to exercise control over their operations, are consolidated.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are no longer consolidated from the date that control ceases.
All intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated: unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Where necessary, accounting policies for subsidiaries have been changed to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Non-controlling interest is the equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent.
Non-controlling interests are presented in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity, separately from the parents shareholders equity.
Total comprehensive income is attributed to the owners of the parent and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
Acquisition of Subsidiaries Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree.
For each business combination, the Group measures the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets.
Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in administrative expenses.
159 EVRAZ plc Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Basis of Consolidation continued Acquisition of Subsidiaries continued If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the acquirers previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through profit or loss.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability will be recognised in accordance with IFRS 9 either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income.
If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it should not be remeasured until it is finally settled within equity.
The initial accounting for a business combination involves identifying and determining the fair values to be assigned to the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities and the cost of the combination.
If the initial accounting for a business combination can be determined only provisionally by the end of the period in which the combination is effected because either the fair values to be assigned to the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities or contingent liabilities or the cost of the combination can be determined only provisionally, the Group accounts for the combination using those provisional values.
The Group recognises any adjustments to those provisional values as a result of completing the initial accounting within twelve months of the acquisition date.
Comparative information presented for the periods before the completion of initial accounting for the acquisition is presented as if the initial accounting had been completed from the acquisition date.
Increases in Ownership Interests in Subsidiaries The differences between the carrying values of net assets attributable to interests in subsidiaries acquired and the consideration given for such increases is either added to additional paid-in capital, if positive, or charged to accumulated profits, if negative, in the consolidated financial statements.
Purchases of Controlling Interests in Subsidiaries from Entities under Common Control Purchases of controlling interests in subsidiaries from entities under common control are accounted for using the pooling of interests method.
The assets and liabilities of the subsidiary transferred under common control are recorded in these financial statements at the historical cost of the controlling entity the Predecessor.
Related goodwill inherent in the Predecessors original acquisition is also recorded in the financial statements.
Any difference between the total book value of net assets, including the Predecessors goodwill, and the consideration paid is accounted for in the consolidated financial statements as an adjustment to the shareholders equity.
These financial statements, including corresponding figures, are presented as if a subsidiary had been acquired by the Group on the date it was originally acquired by the Predecessor.
Put Options over Non-controlling Interests The Group derecognises non-controlling interests if non-controlling shareholders have a put option over their holdings.
The difference between the amount of the liability recognised in the statement of financial position over the carrying value of the derecognised non-controlling interests is charged to accumulated profits.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Investments in Associates Associates are entities in which the Group generally has between 20% and 50% of the voting rights, or is otherwise able to exercise significant influence, but which it does not control or jointly control.
Investments in associates are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost including goodwill.
Subsequent changes in the carrying value reflect the post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of net assets of the associate and goodwill impairment charges, if any.
The Groups share of its associates profits or losses is recognised in the statement of operations and its share of movements in reserves is recognised in equity.
However, when the Groups share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless the Group has legal or constructive obligations to make payments to, or on behalf of, the associate.
If the associate subsequently reports profits, the Group resumes recognising its share of those profits only after its share of the profits equals the share of losses not recognised.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the associates: unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Interests in Joint Ventures The Groups interest in its joint ventures is accounted for under the equity method of accounting whereby an interest in jointly ventures is initially recorded at cost and adjusted thereafter for post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of net assets of joint ventures.
The statement of operations reflects the Groups share of the results of operations of joint ventures.
Property, Plant and Equipment The Groups property, plant and equipment is stated at purchase or construction cost, excluding the costs of day-to-day servicing, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of plant and equipment when that cost is incurred and recognition criteria are met.
The Groups property, plant and equipment include mining assets, which consist of mineral reserves, mine development and construction costs and capitalised site restoration costs.
Mineral reserves represent tangible assets acquired in business combinations.
Mine development and construction costs represent expenditures incurred in developing access to mineral reserves and preparations for commercial production, including sinking shafts and underground drifts, roads, infrastructure, buildings, machinery and equipment.
At each end of the reporting period management makes an assessment to determine whether there is any indication of impairment of property, plant and equipment.
If any such indication exists, management estimates the recoverable amount, which is the higher of an assets fair value less cost to sell and its value in use.
The carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount, and the difference is recognised as impairment loss in the statement of operations or other comprehensive income.
An impairment loss recognised for an asset in previous years is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment, except for mining assets, is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
The useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment and methods of their depreciation are reviewed, and adjusted as appropriate, at each fiscal year end.

Weighted average remaining useful life Useful lives years years Buildings and constructions 1560 19 Machinery and equipment 445 10 Transport and motor vehicles 720 8 Other assets 315 4 The Group determines the depreciation charge separately for each significant part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
Depletion of mining assets including capitalised site restoration costs is calculated using the units-of-production method based upon proved and probable mineral reserves.
The depletion calculation takes into account future development costs for reserves which are in the production phase.
Maintenance costs relating to items of property, plant and equipment are expensed as incurred.
Major renewals and improvements are capitalised, and the replaced assets are derecognised.
The Group has the title to certain non-production and social assets, primarily buildings and facilities of social infrastructure, which are carried at their recoverable amount of zero.
The costs to maintain such assets are expensed as incurred.
Exploration and Evaluation Expenditures Exploration and evaluation expenditures represent costs incurred by the Group in connection with the exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources before the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource are demonstrable.
The expenditures include acquisition of rights to explore, topographical, geological, geochemical and geophysical studies, exploratory drilling, trenching, sampling, activities in relation to evaluating the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting mineral resources.
These costs are expensed as incurred.
When the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource are demonstrable, the Group commences recognition of expenditures related to the development of mineral resources as assets.
These assets are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of an asset may exceed its recoverable amount.
Leases The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at inception date as to whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.
Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised from the commencement of the lease term at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged to interest expense.
The depreciation policy for depreciable leased assets is consistent with that for depreciable assets which are owned.
If there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is fully depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or its useful life.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the statement of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred for an acquisition of a subsidiary or an associte and the amount recognised for non-controlling interest over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
If this consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the acquiree, the difference is recognised in the consolidated statement of operations.
Goodwill on acquisition of a subsidiary is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill on acquisition of an associate is included in the carrying amount of the investments in associates.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit, or the group of cash-generating units, to which the goodwill relates.
Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation.
Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative fair values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
Intangible Assets Other Than Goodwill Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost.
The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is fair value as at the date of acquisition.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Expenditures on internally generated intangible assets, excluding capitalised development costs, are expensed as incurred.
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite.
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.
The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite life are reviewed at least at each year end.
Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are treated as changes in accounting estimates.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, they are tested for impairment annually either individually or at the cash-generating unit level.

Weighted average Useful lives years remaining useful life years Customer relationships 115 5 Contract terms 10 5 Other 519 6 Certain water rights and environmental permits are considered to have indefinite lives as management believes that these rights will continue indefinitely.
The most part of the Groups intangible assets represents customer relationships arising on business combinations Note 10.
Financial Assets Financial assets are classified, at initial recognition, as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income, and fair value through profit or loss.
The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial assets contractual cash flow characteristics and the Groups business model for managing them, i. e. how the Group manages its financial assets in order to generate cash flows.
The business model determines whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash flows, selling the financial assets, or both.
With the exception of trade and other receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group has applied the practical expedient, the Group initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs.
The Group measures financial assets at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met: The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest method and are subject to impairment.
Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised, modified or impaired.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Financial Assets continued Trade and Other Accounts Receivable Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less an allowance for any amounts of the expected credit losses.
For trade and other receivables, the Group applies a simplified approach for calculating the expected credit losses.
Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but, instead, it recognises a loss allowance based on the lifetime expected credit losses at each reporting date.
The Group separately determines the expected credit losses for individually significant balances or collectively for trade and other receivables that are not individually significant.
The expected credit losses for individually significant balances are estimated using debtors historical credit loss experience adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and economic environment.
Inventories Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost of inventory is determined on the weighted average basis and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring or producing inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition.
The cost of finished goods and work in progress includes an appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating capacity, but excluding borrowing costs.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Value Added Tax The tax authorities permit the settlement of sales and purchases value added tax VAT on a net basis.
The Groups subsidiaries apply the accrual method for VAT recognition, under which VAT becomes payable upon invoicing and delivery of goods or rendering services as well upon receipt of prepayments from customers.
VAT on purchases, even if not settled at the end of the reporting period, is deducted from the amount of VAT payable.
Where provision has been made for impairment of receivables, an impairment loss is recorded for the gross amount of the debtor, including VAT.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
165 EVRAZ plc Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method: any difference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption amount is recognised as interest expense over the period of the borrowings.
Borrowing costs relating to qualifying assets are capitalised Note 9.
Equity Share Capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
External costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown as a deduction in equity from the proceeds.
Any excess of the fair value of consideration received over the par value of shares issued is recognised as additional paid-in capital.
Treasury Shares Own equity instruments which are acquired by the Group treasury shares are deducted from equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in statement of operations on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the treasury shares.
Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability and deducted from equity only if they are declared before the end of the reporting period.
Dividends are disclosed when they are proposed before the end of the reporting period or proposed or declared after the end of the reporting period but before the financial statements are authorised for issue.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Where the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as an interest expense.
Site Restoration Provisions The Group reviews site restoration provisions at each reporting date and adjusts them to reflect the current best estimate in accordance with IFRIC 1 Changes in Existing Decommissioning, Restoration and Similar Liabilities.
Provisions for site restoration costs are capitalised within property, plant and equipment.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Employee Benefits Social and Pension Contributions Defined contributions are made by the Group to the Russian and Ukrainian state pension, social insurance and medical insurance funds at the statutory rates in force based on gross salary payments.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions in respect of those benefits.
Its only obligation is to pay contributions as they fall due.
These contributions are expensed as incurred.
Defined Benefit Plans The Group companies provide pensions and other benefits to their employees Note 23.
The entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional on the completion of a minimum service period.
Certain benefit plans require the employee to remain in service up to retirement age.
Other employee benefits consist of various compensations and non-monetary benefits.
The amounts of benefits are stipulated in the collective bargaining agreements and or in the plan documents.
The Group involves independent qualified actuaries in the measurement of employee benefit obligations.
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plan is determined using the projected unit credit method.
Re-measurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding net interest and the return on plan assets excluding net interest, are recognised immediately in the statement of financial position with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Re-measurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.
Past service costs are recognised in profit or loss on the earlier of the date of the plan amendment or curtailment, and the date that the Group recognises  costs.
Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset.
It is recorded within interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations.
The Group recognises current service costs, past-service costs, gains and losses on curtailments and non-routine settlements in the consolidated statement of operations within cost of sales, general and administrative expenses and selling and distribution expenses.
Other Costs The Group incurs employee costs related to the provision of benefits such as health services, kindergartens and other services.
These amounts principally represent an implicit cost of employment and, accordingly, have been charged to cost of sales.
Share-based Payments The Group has management compensation schemes Note 21, under which certain senior executives and employees of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby they render services as consideration for equity instruments equity-settled transactions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with grantees is measured by reference to the fair value of the Companys shares at the date on which they are granted.
The fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any conditions, other than market conditions.
167 EVRAZ plc Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Share-based Payments continued The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity additional paid-in capital, over the period in which service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant persons become fully entitled to the award the vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Groups best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The charge or credit in the statement of operations for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards if EBITDA-related conditions are not satisfied or participants lose the entitlement for the shares due to the termination of their employment.
Accumulated share-based expense is adjusted to reflect the number of share options that eventually vest.
For market-related performance conditions, such as TSR Note 21, if the conditions are not met and the share options do not vest, then no reversal is made for the share-based expense previously recognised.
The TSR-related vesting condition of Incentive Plans adopted in 2017 and 2018 was considered by the Group as a market condition.
As such, it was included in the estimation of the fair value of the granted shares and will not be subsequently revised.
Vesting condition related to EBITDA was not taken into account when estimating the fair value of the share options at the grant date.
Instead, this will be taken into account by adjusting the share-based expense based on the number of share options that eventually vest.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any modification which increases the total fair value of the share-based payment arrangement, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
The dilutive effect of outstanding share-based awards is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share Note 20.
Revenue Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised: Sale of Goods Revenue is recognised when control over the goods has passed to the buyer and it is probable that the amount of consideration is collectible.
The moment of transfer of control is determined by the contract terms and usually occurs at the date of shipment.
Sale of goods includes the transportation and handling costs incurred.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Revenue continued Rendering of Services The Groups revenues from rendering of services include electricity, transportation, port and other services.
The pattern of revenue recognition reflects the transfer of services to customers and may occur at a point in time or over time.
Interest Interest is recognised using the effective interest method.
Dividends Revenue is recognised when the shareholders right to receive the payment is established.
Rental Income Rental income is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term on ongoing leases.
Current Income Tax Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
Current income tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised in other comprehensive income or equity and not in the statement of operations.
Deferred Income Tax Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated in respect of temporary differences using the liability method.
Deferred income taxes are provided for all temporary differences arising between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting purposes, except where the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
A deferred tax asset is recorded only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.
Various factors are considered to assess the probability of the future utilisation of deferred tax assets, including past operating results, operational plans, expiration of tax losses carried forward, tax legislation and tax planning strategies.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Segment Information For management purposes the Group has four reportable operating segments: Steel segment includes production of steel and related products at all mills except for those located in North America.
Extraction of vanadium ore and production of vanadium products, iron ore mining and enrichment and certain energy-generating companies are also included in this segment as they are closely related to the main process of steel production.
Steel, North America is a segment, which includes production of steel and related products in the USA and Canada.
Coal segment includes coal mining and enrichment.
It also included operations of Nakhodka Trade Sea Port sold in June 2017 as it was used to a significant extent for shipping of products of the coal segment to the Asian markets.
Other operations include energy-generating companies, shipping and railway transportation companies.
Management and investment companies are not allocated to any of the segments.
Operating segments have been aggregated into reportable segments if they show a similar long-term economic performance, have comparable production processes, customer industries and distribution channels, operate in the same regulatory environment, and are generally managed and monitored together.
Transfer prices between operating segments are on an arms length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
Management monitors the results of the operating segments separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment.
Segment performance is evaluated based on EBITDA see below.
This performance indicator is calculated based on management accounts that differ from the IFRS consolidated financial statements for the following reasons: 1 for the last month of the reporting period, the management accounts for each operating segment are prepared using a forecast for that month: 2 the statement of operations is based on local GAAP figures with the exception of depreciation and repair expenses which are adjusted to approximate the amount under IFRS: 3 in case of volatility of functional currencies the IFRS statements of operations are translated at the exchange rates that approximate the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions quarterly, semi-annual averages, etc.
while in management accounts simple average for the whole accounting period is used.
Segment revenue is revenue reported in the Groups statement of operations that is directly attributable to a segment and the relevant portion of the Groups revenue that can be allocated to it on a reasonable basis, whether from sales to external customers or from transactions with other segments.
Segment expense is expense resulting from the operating activities of a segment that is directly attributable to the segment and the relevant portion of an expense that can be allocated to it on a reasonable basis, including expenses relating to external counterparties and expenses relating to transactions with other segments.
Segment expense does not include social and social infrastructure maintenance expenses.
Segment result is segment revenue less segment expense that is equal to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA for that segment.
Segment EBITDA is determined as a segments profit loss from operations adjusted for social and social infrastructure maintenance expenses, impairment of assets, profit loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, foreign exchange gains losses and depreciation, depletion and amortisation expense.
Management believes that this measure is more useful and relevant for the users and is more comparable with the Russian steel peers.

Changes in the Composition of the Group Business Combinations In June 2017, the Group purchased the business of Western Canada Machining Inc. Alberta, Canada, which produces couplings for use in the oil and gas industry.
The consideration amounted to $5 million in cash.
At the date of business combination the fair value of net assets of the acquired company was $5 million.
Purchase of Non-controlling Interests Raspadskaya In 2018, the Group acquired an additional 1.89% ownership interest in Raspadskaya for cash consideration of $24 million.
The excess of consideration over the carrying values of non-controlling interests acquired amounting to $3 million was charged to accumulated profits.
Mezhegeyugol On 14 March 2017, the Group signed an option agreement with a non-controlling shareholder in respect of shares of Mezhegeyugol, a coal mining subsidiary of the Group.
Under the agreement, the non-controlling shareholder has the right to sell to the Group the put option all its shares in Mezhegeyugol 39.9841% for $39 million and to settle the loan payable to the Group for $25 million.
As a result, the Group would hold 100% ownership interest in the subsidiary.
The option can be exercised from 1 December 2019 to 1 December 2020.
The Group determined that the terms of the option agreement give the Group the rights to the beneficial interests in Mezgegeyugol and derecognised the non-controlling interests and recognised a liability under the put option.
The difference between the discounted value of the liability under the put option $60 million and the carrying value of non-controlling interest in the amount of $56 million was charged to the accumulated profits of the Group.
In 2018 and 2017, the Group accrued $4 million and $1 million interest on this liability.
Sale of Subsidiaries In 2018, the group sold Dneprovsk Metallurgical Plant Note 12.

Impairment of Assets continued The Group made a write-off of certain functionally obsolete items of property, plant and equipment and recorded an impairment relating to VAT with a longterm recovery.
In addition, in 2016 and 2017, the Group recognised impairment losses as a result of the impairment testing at the level of cash-generating units.
For the purpose of the impairment testing the Group assessed the recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit to which goodwill was allocated or where indicators of impairment were identified.
In 2016-2018, the impairment tests were performed as of 30 September, the conclusions were reassessed at 31 December and no further impairment triggers were identified.
The recoverable amounts have been determined based on the calculation of value-in-use.
This valuation technique uses cash flow projections based on the actual operating results and business plans approved by management and appropriate discount rates reflecting the time value of money and risks associated with respective cash-generating units.
For the periods not covered by management business plans, cash flow projections have been estimated by extrapolating the results of the respective business plans using a zero real growth rate.
The key assumptions used by management in the value-in-use calculations with respect to the cash-generating units to which the goodwill was allocated or units containing intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are presented in the table below.
Average price Carrying amount of commodity per of CGU before Period of forecast, Pre-tax discount tonne in the next Recoverable amount impairment, Commodity years rate, % reporting year of CGU, US$ million US$ million 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 Steel North America Large diameter pipes steel products 5 5 9.37 11.23 $1,129 $913 903 1,074 900 938 Oil Country Tubular Goods steel products 5 5 9.96 10.85 $1,245 $1,121 441 547 365 383 Long products steel products 5 5 9.26 11.02 $745 $647 582 591 501 520 vanadium EVRAZ Vanady-Tula products 5 5 12.74 13.03 $46,494 $23,403 1,140 986 57 61 ferrovanadium EVRAZ Nikom, a. s. products 5 5 10.45 11.00 $48,991 $26,576 40 47 36 34 In addition, the Group determined that there were indicators of impairment in other cash generating units, which do not contain goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, and tested them for impairment using the following assumptions.
Average price of commodity per Period of forecast, Pre-tax discount tonne in the next years rate, % Commodity reporting year Steel North America Flat rolled products 5 9.30 steel products $855 Seamless pipes 5 10.04 steel products $1,396 The impairment test models take into account the tariffs imposed by the US and Canada against each other on import of steel and steel products, whose effect is expected to last until 2022 Note 30.
The models include the assumption that the tariffs will be removed starting from 2023 and are assumed not to re-occur going forward.
This assumption is particularly sensitive for the recoverable amount of Large diameter pipes.
As a result of impairment testing, the Group did not recognise any impairment loss or reversal of previous charges.
However, in 2018, the Group recognised a $12 million impairment loss with respect to EVRAZ Stratcor Inc. due to its potential bankruptcy.
In 2017, the value in use of this cash-generating unit was $18 million.
Impairment of Assets continued The estimations of value in use are most sensitive to the following assumptions: Discount Rates Discount rates reflect the current market assessment of the risks specific to each cash-generating unit.
The discount rates have been determined using the Capital Asset Pricing Model and analysis of industry peers.
Reasonably possible changes in discount rates could lead to impairment EVRAZ Nikom, Large diameter pipes, Flat rolled products and Long products.
If discount rates were 10% higher, this would lead to an impairment of $184 million.
Sales Prices The price assumptions for the products sold by the Group were estimated based on industry research using analysts views published by Citi, CRU, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Renaissance Capital, UBS, VTB Capital, WSD during the period from August to December 2018.
The Group expects that the nominal prices will fluctuate with a compound annual growth rate of 14.3 %-4.0% in 2019 2023, 2.5% in 2024 and thereafter.
Reasonably possible changes in sales prices could lead to impairment at EVRAZ Nikom and Large diameter pipes.
If the prices assumed for 2019 and 2020 in the impairment test were 10% lower, this would lead to an impairment of $46 million.
Sales Volumes Management assumed that the sales volumes of steel products in 2019 will increase by 7-13% and future dynamics will be driven by a gradual market recovery and changes in assets capacities.
Reasonably possible changes in sales volumes could lead to impairment at EVRAZ Nikom and Large diameter pipes.
If the sales volumes were 10% lower than those assumed for 2019 and 2020 in the impairment test, this would lead to an impairment of $19 million.
Cost Control Measures The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units are based on the business plans approved by management.
A reasonably possible deviation in cost from these plans could lead to impairment at EVRAZ Nikom, Large diameter pipes, Long products and Flat rolled products.
If the actual costs were 10% higher than those assumed for 2019 and 2020 in the impairment test, this would lead to an impairment of $228 million.
Terminal Growth Rate The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units are based on the terminal growth rate of 2.5% representing a forecast of long-term US CPI rate.
A reasonably possible deviation in this rate could lead to impairment at Large diameter pipes.
If the terminal growth rate was 10% lower than the rate assumed for 2024 and thereafter in the impairment test, this would lead to an impairment of $46 million.
Sensitivity Analysis For the cash-generating units, which were not impaired in the reporting period and for which the reasonably possible changes could lead to impairment, the recoverable amounts would become equal to their carrying amounts if the assumptions used to measure the recoverable amounts changed by the following percentages: Discount Sales Sales Cost control Terminal rates prices volumes measures growth rate EVRAZ Nikom 5.9% 4.9 % 6.0 % 1.3% EVRAZ Inc NA Large diameter pipes 0.2% 0.7 % 1.6 % 0.2% 0.6 % EVRAZ Inc NA Long products 8.7% 8.6% EVRAZ Inc NA Flat rolled products 9.0% 4.9% 181 EVRAZ plc Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 7.

Income Taxes The Groups income was subject to tax at the following tax rates: 2018 2017 2016 20.00% Russia and 16.50% 20.00% 20.00% Canada 26.32% 26.25% 26.06% Cyprus 12.50% 12.50% 12.50% Czech Republic 19.00% 19.00% 19.00% Italy 27.90% 27.90% 31.40% Switzerland 9.18% 9.43% 9.09% Ukraine 18.00% 18.00% 18.00% United Kingdom 19.00% USA 24.69% 37.83% 37.72% In 2018, Nizhny Tagil Metallurgical Plant completed capital construction works, which make it eligible for investment tax credit from the regional government.
Income tax rate was reduced from 20% to 16.5% for a period from 2018 to 2022.
The Group determined that the investment tax credit is in the scope of IAS 12 Income taxes.
As a result, in 2018, Nizhny Tagil Metallurgical Plant and other subsidiaries included in the group of consolidated taxpayers received a current income tax benefit amounting to $37 million.
In December 2017, new tax legislation has been adopted in the USA, which introduced a reduction in federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% starting from 1 January 2018.
The Groups subsidiaries measured the respective deferred tax assets and liabilities at 31 December 2017 using the enacted tax rates.
As a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act TCJA in the USA, at 31 December 2017 uncertainty existed as to whether certain unutilised interest expenses incurred on intra-group loans would be deductible against future taxable earnings under the new tax law and, therefore, whether the deferred tax asset would be recoverable.
The Groups interpretation of the new legislation at 31 December 2017 was that the deferred tax asset would be recoverable and, consequently, the Group did not create an allowance against this balance.
In April 2018, the US Department of Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service released Notice 2018-28, which clarified that the unutilised interest expenses can be carried forward indefinitely.
Major components of income tax expense for the years ended 31 December were as follows: US$ million 2018 2017 2016 Current income tax expense $ 679 $ 484 $ 185 Adjustment in respect of income tax of previous years 4 1 2 Deferred income tax benefit expense relating to origination and reversal of temporary differences 54 74 87 Deferred income tax recognised directly in other comprehensive income 6 15 Income tax expense benefit reported in the consolidated statement of operations $ 731 $ 396 $ 96 184 www.

Income Taxes continued The major part of income taxes is paid in the Russian Federation.
A reconciliation of income tax expense applicable to profit before income tax using the Russian statutory tax rate to income tax expense as reported in the Groups consolidated financial statements for the years ended 31 December is as follows: US$ million 2018 2017 2016 Profit loss before income tax $ 3,201 $ 1,155 $ 92 At the Russian statutory income tax rate of 20% 640 231 18 Adjustment in respect of income tax of previous years 4 1 2 Current income tax benefit from investment tax credit 37 Deferred income tax expense resulting from the changes in tax rates and laws 6 Tax on dividends distributed by the Groups subsidiaries 53 26 Tax on undistributed earnings of the Groups subsidiaries 35 Deferred income tax expense arising on the adjustment to current income tax of prior periods and the change in tax base of underlying assets 2 Effect of non-deductible expenses and other non-temporary differences 37 254 63 Unrecognised temporary differences recognition reversal 58 100 157 Effect of the difference in tax rates in countries other than the Russian Federation 57 20 110 Share of profits in joint ventures and associates 2 2 4 Income tax expense benefit reported in the consolidated statement of operations $ 731 $ 396 $ 96 In 2017, the increase in the amount of non-deductible expenses and unrecognised temporary differences was mostly caused by the significant losses on sale of subsidiaries Note 12, which either cannot be utilised or cannot be deductible for tax purposes.

Income Taxes continued As of 31 December 2018, the Group accrued deferred income taxes in respect of undistributed earnings of the Groups subsidiaries in the amount of $35 million 2017 and 2016: $Nil.
The current tax rate on intra-group dividend income varies from 0% to 15%.
The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries were not recognised as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and does not intend to reverse them in the foreseeable future.
At 31 December 2018, the aggregate amount of such temporary differences, for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised, amounted to $101 million 2017: $1,439 million, 2016: $898 million.
The decrease in these temporary differences in 2018 was caused by the changes in the Russian tax regulations, which modified the rules for using zero tax rate in relation to capital gains of the Russian parent entities, if certain conditions are met.
In the context of the Groups current structure, tax losses and current tax assets of the different companies may not be set off against current tax liabilities and taxable profits of other companies in the same jurisdiction, except for the companies registered in Cyprus, Russia and the United Kingdom where group relief and tax consolidation can be applied.
As of 31 December 2018, the unused tax losses carried forward approximated $9,321 million 2017: $9,893 million, 2016: $9,729 million.
The Group recognised deferred tax assets of $199 million 2017: $267 million, 2016: $226 million in respect of unused tax losses.
Deferred tax assets in the amount of $2,287 million 2017: $2,339 million, 2016: $2,329 million have not been recorded as it is not probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available in the foreseeable future to offset these losses.
Tax losses of $8,492 million 2017: $8,711 million, 2016: $8,593 million for which deferred tax assets were not recognised arose in companies registered in Canada, Cyprus, Italy, Kazakhstan, Luxembourg, Russia, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the USA.
Losses in the amount of $8,399 million 2017: $8,664 million, 2016: $8,549 million are available indefinitely for offset against future taxable profits of the companies in which the losses arose and $93 million will expire within 10 years 2017: $47 million, 2016: $44 million.

Under the joint venture agreement major operating and financial decisions are made by unanimous consent of the Group and Alrosa, and no single venturer is in a position to control the activity unilaterally.
Consequently, the Group accounts for its interest in Timir under the equity method.
The Groups consideration for this stake amounted to 4,950 million roubles $159 million at the exchange rate as of the date of the transaction payable in instalments to 15 July 2014.
The consideration was measured as the present value of the expected cash outflows.
In 2014 and 2015, the parties amended the payment schedule.
The latest schedule provides for an execution of payments of 500 million roubles in each of January 2017 and 2018 and 480 million roubles in 2019.
From the dates of the amendments the Group incurs interest charges on the unpaid liability.
In 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Group paid 500 million roubles $9 million, 500 million roubles $8 million and 500 million roubles $7 million, respectively, of purchase consideration.
Previously, the Group paid the principal of 2,970 million roubles $89 million in total.
In addition, the Group paid interest charges on the liability.
At 31 December 2018, 2017 and 2016, trade and other accounts payable included liabilities relating to this acquisition in the amount of $8 million, $19 million and $27 million, respectively.
In January 2019, the liability was fully settled.

Due to the postponement of the major project activities, the Group assessed the recoverability of its investment in Timir at 30 September 2017 and 2016 in 2018 there were no indicators of impairment.
The recoverable amount of the asset was its fair value less costs to sell, which was determined using cash flow projections based on business plans approved by management and an appropriate discount rate reflecting time value of money and risks associated with the asset.
The period of the forecast was 23 years.
The discount rates were 11.56% and 11.75% in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
As a result, in 2016, the Group partially impaired its investment in Timir.
The major drivers that led to impairment were the decrease in the expected long-term prices for iron ore, the increase in the amount of the required capital expenditure to maintain production at budgeted capacities and the postponement of the start of production.
At 31 December 2018, 2017 and 2016 Timir owed to the Group $7 million, $8 million and $7 million, respectively, which were included in other non-current financial assets in 2017 and in the receivables from related parties caption in 2018 and 2016.
The amounts represent a loan bearing interest of 6.45% per annum in 2017 and 2016 the interest rate was 0.5% per annum.

The vesting under Incentive Plans adopted before 2017 does not depend on the achievement of any performance conditions.
The new Plans adopted in 2017 and 2018 provide that the number of shares transferred to participants upon vesting is dependent on the Groups performance versus the selected group of peers.
EBITDA and total shareholder return TSR are used as the key performance indicators.
If the Groups EBITDA achieves a specific ranking in the peer group, then 50% of the shares of a particular tranche become vested, otherwise they are forfeited.
If the Groups TSR achieves a specific ranking in the peer group, then the other 50% of the shares of a particular tranche become vested, otherwise they are forfeited.
Subject to the resolution of the Remuneration Committee, EBITDA can become the only metric in the performance evaluation in case if the net debt to EBITDA ratio is equal to 3 or higher.
The TSR-related vesting condition of the Incentive Plans 2017 and 2018 was considered by the Group as a market condition.
The vesting date for each tranche occurs within the 90-day period after announcement of the annual results.

Loans and Borrowings continued Compliance with Financial Covenants Some of the loan agreements and terms and conditions of notes provide for certain covenants in respect of EVRAZ plc and its subsidiaries.
The covenants impose restrictions in respect of certain transactions and financial ratios, including restrictions in respect of indebtedness and profitability.
EBITDA used for covenants compliance calculations is determined based on the definitions of the respective loan agreements and may differ from that used by management for evaluation of performance.
Several bank credit facilities totalling $1,061 million contain certain financial maintenance covenants.
These covenants require EVRAZ plc to maintain two key ratios, consolidated net indebtedness to 12month consolidated EBITDA and 12-month consolidated EBITDA to adjusted 12-month consolidated interest expense, within certain limits.
A breach of one or both of these ratios or excess of the indebtedness limit would constitute an event of default under the facility which in turn may trigger cross default events under other debt instruments of the Group.
The terms of certain facilities also set certain limitations on acquisitions and disposals by EVRAZ plc.
Notes due 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023, totalling $2,700 million issued by Evraz Group S. A. a holding company directly wholly owned by EVRAZ plc, have covenants restricting the incurrence of indebtedness by the issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries conditional on a gross leverage ratio.
While the ratio level itself does not constitute a breach of covenants, exceeding the threshold of 3.5 times triggers a restriction on incurrence of consolidated indebtedness, which is removed once the ratio goes back below the threshold.
The effect of the restriction is such that Evraz Group S. A. and its subsidiaries are not allowed to increase the consolidated indebtedness at the level of Evraz Group S. A. but are allowed to refinance existing indebtedness subject to certain conditions.
As of 31 December 2018, gross leverage ratio for Evraz Group S. A. was below 3.5.
Several bank credit facilities totalling $293 million provide for certain covenants restricting the incurrence of indebtedness by Evraz North America plc and its subsidiaries conditional on a fixed charge ratio.
Once the threshold for the ratio is exceeded, it triggers restrictions on incurrence of additional indebtedness by Evraz North America plc and its subsidiaries.
The incurrence covenants are in line with the Groups financial strategy and, therefore, do not constitute any excessive restriction on its operations.
During 2018 the Group was in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants.
Unamortised Debt Issue Costs Unamortised debt issue costs represent agent commission and transaction costs paid by the Group in relation to the arrangement and reset of loans and notes.

Employee Benefits Russian Plans Certain Russian subsidiaries of the Group provide regular lifetime pension payments and lump-sum amounts payable at retirement date.
These benefits generally depend on years of service, level of remuneration and amount of pension payment under the collective bargaining agreements.
Other postemployment benefits consist of various compensations and certain non-cash benefits.
The Group funds the benefits when the amounts of benefits fall due for payment.
In addition, some subsidiaries have defined benefit plans under which contributions are made to a separately administered non-state pension fund.
The Group matches 100% of the employees contributions to the fund up to 4% of their monthly salary.
The Groups contributions become payable at the participants retirement dates.
At the end of the reporting year the benefit obligation was valued based on the terms of the pension plan assuming that all defined benefit plan participants will continue to participate in the plan.
Defined contribution plans represent payments made by the Group to the Russian state pension, social insurance and medical insurance funds at the statutory rates in force, based on gross salary payments.
In October 2018, the Russian pension law was amended introducing a higher retirement age from 1 January 2019.
During 2019 2023 the retirement age will be gradually increased for women from 55 to 60 and for men from 60 to 65.
The Group has accounted for these amendments, when measuring the postemployment benefit obligations as of 31 December 2018 and has recorded the resulting decrease in the obligations in the amount of $2 million as a part of past service costs.
Ukrainian Plans The Ukrainian companies make regular contributions to the State Pension Fund thereby compensating 100% of preferential pensions paid by the fund to employees who worked under harmful and hard conditions.
The amount of such pension depends on years of service and salary.
In addition, employees receive lump-sum payments on retirement and other benefits under collective labour agreements.
These benefits are based on years of service and level of compensation.
All these payments are considered as defined benefit plans.
The Ukrainian pension legislation provides for annual indexation of pensions, at least up to the level of CPI.
Starting from 2018 the minimum annual indexation of pensions, which takes into account 50% of CPI and 50% of salary growth, becomes obligatory.
The indexation of pensions at a level higher than minimally required depends on the availability of financial resources in the State pension fund.
The Groups Ukrainian subsidiaries were obliged to pay indexed preferential pensions.
The Group determined the amount of defined benefit obligations based on the assumption that pensions will be indexed at a minimum required level.

Employee Benefits continued US and Canadian Plans The Groups subsidiaries in the USA and Canada have defined benefit pension plans that cover specified eligible employees.
Benefits are based on pensionable years of service, pensionable compensation, or a combination of both depending on the individual plan.
The subsidiaries also have U. S. and Canadian supplemental retirement plans SERPs, which are non-qualified plans designed to maintain benefits for eligible employees at the plan formula level.
The subsidiaries provide other unfunded post-retirement medical and life insurance plans OPEBs for certain of their eligible employees upon retirement after completion of a specified number of years of service.
For the pension plans, SERPs and OPEBs, the subsidiaries use a measurement date for plan assets and obligations of 31 December.
Certain employees that were hired after specified dates are no longer eligible to participate in the defined benefit pension plans.
Those employees are instead enrolled in defined contribution plans and receive a contribution funded by the Groups subsidiaries equal to 37% of annual wages, including applicable bonuses.
The defined contribution plans are funded throughout the year and, depending on their work location, participants benefits vesting dates range from immediate to after three years of service.
In addition, the subsidiaries have defined contribution plans available for eligible U. S. and Canadian-based employees in which the subsidiaries generally match a percentage of the participants contributions.
Some Canadian employees participate in a retirement savings plan.
For these employees, the participation may be voluntary, employee contributions are matched by the employer at 1-3% of annual wages, including applicable bonuses, and depending on the group of employees, are funded either annually or throughout the year.
Other Plans Defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans are maintained by the subsidiaries located in Europe.
Defined Contribution Plans The Groups expenses under defined contribution plans were as follows: US$ million 2018 2017 2016 Expense under defined contribution plans $ 245 $ 246 $ 212 Defined Benefit Plans The Russian, Ukrainian and other defined benefit plans are mostly unfunded and the US and Canadian plans are partially funded.
Except as disclosed above, in 2018 there were no significant plan amendments, curtailments or settlements.
The Groups defined benefit plans are exposed to the risks of unexpected growth in benefit payments as a result of increases in life expectancy, inflation, and salaries.
As the plan assets include significant investments in quoted and unquoted equity shares, corporate and government bonds and notes, the Group is also exposed to equity market risk.

The exchange is exercised on approximately the same dates as the payments under the bonds.
The swap contracts, which were effective at 31 December 2016, are summarised in the table below.

Other Long-Term Liabilities continued Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments continued In 2017, one of the swaps with a notional amount of $26 million did not meet the criteria for hedging and ceased to be classified as a hedging instrument.
This swap was reclassified into Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments.
The aggregate amounts under swap contracts translated at the year end exchange rates are summarised in the table below.
US$ million 2018 2017 2016 Bonds principal $ 24 $ 28 $ Hedged amount 24 28 Swap amount 26 26 These swap contracts were not designated as cash flow or fair value hedges or excluded from such hedging instruments due to hedge inefficiency.
The Group accounted for these derivatives at fair value which was determined using valuation techniques.
The fair value was calculated as the present value of the expected cashflows under the contracts at the reporting dates.
Future rouble-denominated cashflows were translated into US dollars using the USD RUB implied yield forward curve.
The discount rates used in the valuation were the non-deliverable forward rate curve and the interest rate swap curve for US dollar at the reporting dates.
In 2018, 2017 and 2016, a change in fair value of the derivatives of $ 6 million, $2 million and $273 million, respectively, together with a realised gain loss on the swap transactions, amounting to $2 million, $2 million and $ 250 million, respectively, was recognised within gain loss on financial assets and liabilities in the consolidated statement of operations Note 7.
In 2016, upon repayment of the 8.40% bonds, the related swap contracts matured.
In 2018, the Group concluded EUR USD forward contracts, which were accounted for at fair value.
The change in fair value of the derivatives $ 2 million, together with a realised gain loss on the currency forward transactions, amounting to $9 million, was recognised within gain loss on financial assets and liabilities in the consolidated statement of operations Note 7.
Hedging Instruments In July 2015, the Group completed a placement of bonds in the total amount of 15,000 million Russian roubles $216 million at 31 December 2018, which bear interest of 12.95% per annum and have the next put date on 26 June 2019.
The Group used an intercompany loan to transfer the proceeds from the bonds within the Group.
To manage the currency exposure, the Group entered into a series of cross currency swap contracts with several banks under which it agreed to deliver US-dollar denominated interest payments at rates ranging from 5.90% to 6.55% per annum plus the notional amount, totaling approximately $265 million, in exchange for rouble-denominated interest payments at the rate of 12.95% per annum plus notional, totaling 14,948 million roubles $215 million at 31 December 2018.

In 2017, one of these swap contracts with the notional amount of $26 million did not meet the criteria for efficiency and ceased to be classified as hedging instruments.
In 2018, 2017 and 2016, the change in fair value of these derivatives amounted to $ 44 million, $20 million and $37 million, respectively.
The realised gain on the swap transactions amounting to $11 million, $14 million and $14 million, respectively, was related to the interest portion of the change in fair value of the swap.

Other Long-Term Liabilities continued Hedging Instruments continued Under IFRS the lesser of the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument from inception of the hedge and the cumulative change in present value of the expected future cash flows on the hedged item from inception of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income and the remaining loss on the hedging instrument is recorded through the statement of operations.
In 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Group recognised a gain loss in other comprehensive income amounting to $ 3 million, $9 million and $Nil, respectively.
Most of the swaps were assessed as effective.
Those swaps, which ceased to be effective, were reclassified into Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments.
In 2018, 2017 and 2016, $ 41 million, $11 million and $37 million, respectively, were recorded in the Foreign exchange gains losses caption in the consolidated statement of operations.

Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies Credit Risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
Financial instruments that potentially expose the Group to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and trade accounts receivable.
To manage credit risk related to cash, the Group maintains its available cash, mainly in US dollars and euros, in reputable international banks and major Russian banks.
Management periodically reviews the creditworthiness of the banks in which it deposits cash.
The Groups trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
The Group defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are related entities.
In 2018, the major customers were Russian Railways 3.8% of total sales, Sibuglemet Trading 2.1%, Steel Asia Manufacturing Corporation 1.8% and Treibacher Industrie AG 1.8%.
Part of the Groups sales is made on terms of letter of credit.
In addition, the Group requires prepayments from certain customers.
The Group does not require collateral in respect of trade and other receivables, except when a customer applies for credit terms which are longer than normal.
In this case, the Group requires bank guarantees or other collateral.
The Group has developed standard credit terms and constantly monitors the status of accounts receivable collection and the creditworthiness of the customers.
Certain of the Groups long-standing Russian customers for auxiliary products, such as heat and electricity, represent municipal enterprises and governmental organisations that experience financial difficulties.
The significant part of allowance for expected credit losses consists of receivables from such customers.
The Group has no practical ability to terminate the supply to these customers and negotiates with regional and municipal authorities the terms of recovery of these receivables.
At 31 December the maximum exposure to credit risk is equal to the carrying amount of financial assets, which is disclosed below.

The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies continued Liquidity Risk continued The Group prepares a rolling 12-month financial plan which ensures that the Group has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses, financial obligations and investing activities as they arise.
The Group exercises a daily monitoring of cash proceeds and payments.
The Group maintains credit lines and overdraft facilities that can be drawn down to meet short-term financing needs.
If necessary, the Group refinances its short-term debt by long-term borrowings.
The Group also uses forecasts to monitor potential and actual financial covenants compliance issues Note 22.
Where compliance is at risk, the Group considers options including debt repayment, refinancing or covenant reset.
The Group has developed standard payment periods in respect of trade accounts payable and monitors the timeliness of payments to its suppliers and contractors.
The following tables summarise the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments, including interest payments.

Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies continued Market Risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices, will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures, while optimising the return on risk.
Interest Rate Risk The Group borrows on both a fixed and variable rate basis and has other interest-bearing liabilities, such as finance lease liabilities and other obligations.
The Group incurs interest rate risk on liabilities with variable interest rates.
The Groups treasury function performs analysis of current interest rates.
In case of changes in market fixed or variable interest rates management may consider the refinancing of a particular debt on more favourable terms.
The Group does not have any financial assets with variable interest rates.
Fair Value Sensitivity Analysis for Fixed Rate Instruments The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
Therefore, a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect the Groups profits.
The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets as assets available for sale.
Therefore, a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect the Groups equity.
Cash Flow Sensitivity Analysis for Variable Rate Instruments Based on the analysis of exposure during the years presented, reasonably possible changes in floating interest rates at the reporting date would affect profit before tax PBT by the amounts shown below.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.
In estimating reasonably possible changes the Group assessed the volatility of interest rates during the reporting periods.

The currencies in which these transactions are denominated are primarily US dollars, Canadian dollars and euro.
The Group does not have formal arrangements to mitigate currency risks of the Groups operations.
However, management believes that the Group is partly secured from currency risks as foreign currency denominated sales are used to cover repayment of foreign currency denominated borrowings.
Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies continued Market Risk continued Currency Risk continued The Groups exposure to currency risk determined as the net monetary position in the respective currencies was as follows at 31 December: US$ million 2018 2017 2016 USD RUB $ 2,886 $ 2,589 $ 1,242 EUR RUB 265 276 75 CAD RUB 335 EUR USD 7 11 116 USD CAD 723 892 672 EUR CZK 12 6 1 USD CZK 20 5 6 USD ZAR 4 USD UAH 119 199 136 RUB UAH 4 4 USD KZT 170 163 161 Sensitivity Analysis The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to reasonably possible changes in the respective currencies, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax.
In estimating reasonably possible changes the Group assessed the volatility of foreign exchange rates during the reporting periods.
Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies continued Market Risk continued Currency Risk continued Sensitivity Analysis continued In addition to the effects of changes in the exchange rates disclosed above, the Group is exposed to currency risk on derivatives Note 25.
The impact of currency risk on the fair value of these derivatives is disclosed below.

The carrying amounts of financial instruments, such as cash, short-term and long-term investments, short-term accounts receivable and payable, short-term loans receivable and payable and promissory notes, approximate their fair value.
At 31 December the Group held the following financial instruments measured at fair value: 2018 2017 2016 US$ million Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets measured at fair value Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments Note 25 3 Hedging instruments Note 25 1 Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income Note 13 33 3 Liabilities measured at fair value Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments Note 25 5 Hedging instruments Note 25 46 3 22 228 www.
Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies continued Fair Value of Financial Instruments continued During the reporting period, there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements, and no transfers into and out of Level 3 fair value measurements.
The following table shows financial instruments for which carrying amounts differ from fair values at 31 December.
The fair value of long-term bank loans was calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the Groups market rates of interest at the reporting dates Level 3.
The discount rates used for valuation of financial instruments were as follows: Currency in which financial instruments are denominated 2018 2017 2016 USD 4.9 5.7% 3.6 4.5% 3.7 6.4% EUR 1.7 3.4% 1.7 3.9% 1.8 4.0% RUB 8.13% 7.97% 11.03% 229 EVRAZ plc Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 28.
Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies continued Capital Management Capital includes equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent entity.
Revaluation surplus which is included in capital is not subject to capital management because of its nature.
The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise the return to shareholders.
The Board of Directors reviews the Groups performance and establishes key performance indicators.
There were no changes in the objectives, policies and processes during 2018.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it by the issue of new shares, dividend payments to shareholders, and the purchase of treasury shares.
In addition, the Group monitors distributable profits on a regular basis and determines the amounts and timing of dividend payments taking into account cashflow and other constraints.
Non-cash Transactions Transactions that did not require the use of cash or cash equivalents, not disclosed in the notes above, were as follows in the years ended 31 December: US$ million 2018 2017 2016 Liabilities for purchases of property, plant and equipment, excluding VAT $ 92 $ 80 $ 71 Loans provided in the form of payments by banks for property, plant and equipment 6 8 46 30.
Commitments and Contingencies Operating Environment of the Group The Group is one of the largest vertically integrated steel producers globally and the largest steel producer in Russia.
The Groups major subsidiaries are located in Russia, the USA and Canada.
Russia is considered to be a developing market with higher economic and political risks.
The unrest in the Southeastern region of Ukraine and the economic sanctions imposed by the USA and the European Union on Russia in 2014 and later on caused economic slowdown in Russia and reduced access to international capital markets.
Further sanctions imposed on Russia could have an adverse impact on the Groups business.
Steel consumption is affected by the cyclical nature of demand for steel products and the sensitivity of that demand to worldwide general economic conditions.
During the first half of 2018, growing global demand and supply optimisation in China supported positive steel and raw material price growth but markets remain volatile.
In March 2018 the United States placed 25% tariffs on imports of most steel products from several countries, including Russia, while granting temporary exemptions for others, including Canada, Mexico, and the European Union.
On 31 May 2018, the U. S. announced the end of temporary exemptions for Canada, Mexico, and the European Union, putting 25% tariffs on imports from those jurisdictions effective 1 June 2018.
In response, the government of Canada introduced 25% tariffs effective 1 July 2018 on selected steel products from the U. S. but not including rail steel.
In addition, effective 25 October 2018, the Canadian government imposed provisional safeguard measures on certain categories of steel products by adding a 25% surtax in cases, where the level of imports from trading partners exceeds historical norms.
The provisional safeguards will be in place for 200 days, during which the Canadian International Trade Tribunal will conduct an inquiry and determine whether final safeguards are warranted.

Commitments and Contingencies continued Operating Environment of the Group continued The Group has cross-border transactions between U. S. and Canadian subsidiaries.
The entities of the Steel North America segment import steel for further processing and final products for selling to domestic customers.
After the introduction of the tariffs, U. S. and Canadian subsidiaries must pay tariffs on imported steel and final products.
The Group has applied for product exclusions for imports to exempt from tariffs with the governments of the United States and Canada where justified and possible.
The Group has received an exclusion from the Canadian retaliatory tariffs for one of the products.
No outcomes have been decided on for other product exclusions by either government as of the date of authorisation of these consolidated financial statements for issue.
Management believes it is taking appropriate measures to support the sustainability of the Groups business in the current circumstances.
The global economic climate continues to be unstable and this may negatively affect the Groups results and financial position in a manner not currently determinable.
Taxation Russian and Ukrainian tax, currency and customs legislation is subject to varying interpretations, and changes, which can occur frequently.
Further, the interpretation of tax legislation by tax authorities as applied to the transactions and activity of the Groups entities may not coincide with that of management.
As a result, tax authorities may challenge transactions and the Groups entities may be assessed for additional taxes, penalties and interest.
In Russia and Ukraine the periods remain open to review by the tax and customs authorities with respect to tax liabilities for three calendar years preceding the year of review.
Under certain circumstances reviews may cover longer periods.
Management believes that it has paid or accrued all taxes that are applicable.
Where uncertainty exists, the Group has accrued tax liabilities based on its best estimate of the probable outflow of resources embodying economic benefits, which will be required to settle these liabilities.
Possible liabilities which were identified by management at the end of the reporting period as those that can be subject to different interpretations of the tax laws and other regulations and are not accrued in these financial statements could be up to approximately $58 million.
Contractual Commitments At 31 December 2018, the Group had contractual commitments for the purchase of production equipment and construction works for an approximate amount of $250 million.
In 2010, the Group concluded a contract with PraxAir Note 2, Accounting Judgements for the construction of an air separation plant and for the supply of oxygen and other gases produced by PraxAir at this plant for a period of 20 years extended to 25 years in 2015, when the construction was completed.
This supply contract does not fall within the scope of IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease.
At 31 December 2018, the Group has committed expenditure of $530 million over the life of the contract.
231 EVRAZ plc Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 30.
Commitments and Contingencies continued Contractual Commitments continued In 2018, the Group concluded a contract with Air Liquide for the construction of an air separation plant and for the supply of oxygen and other gases produced by Air Liquide at this plant for a period of 20 years.
The contractual price comprises a fixed component and a variable component.
The total amount of the fixed component approximates $373 million, which is payable within 20 years starting upon commencement of production in 2021 in proportion to the amounts of the variable component.
The variable component is determined based on the actual purchase of gases and is estimated at $339 million during the life of the contract.
Based on managements assessment this supply contract does not fall within the scope of IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease as the Group has no access to the equipment and has no rights either to operate the assets, or to design them in order to predetermine the way of their usage.
Also it is expected that more than an insignificant amount of the assets output will be sold to the parties unrelated to the Group.
In addition, Air Liquide will construct the system of trunk and auxiliary pipelines, distribution stations and other equipment for products delivery, which will be leased by the Group for a period of 20 years and accounted for under IFRS 16.
The cost of construction of the products delivery system is estimated at $102 million.
In 2018, the Group entered into an agreement with Brunswick Rail, according to which it will lease gondola cars for 4 years.
The Group classified this contract as an operating lease under IAS 17.
In 2019, upon adoption of IFRS 16, the Group will recognise a right-of-use asset and the related lease liabilities amounting to $60 million in respect of this contract.
Social Commitments The Group is involved in a number of social programmes aimed to support education, healthcare and social infrastructure development in towns where the Groups assets are located.
The Group budgeted to spend approximately $27 million under these programmes in 2019.
Environmental Protection In the course of its operations, the Group may be subject to environmental claims and legal proceedings.
The quantification of environmental exposures requires an assessment of many factors, including changing laws and regulations, improvements in environmental technologies, the quality of information available related to specific sites, the assessment stage of each site investigation, preliminary findings and the length of time involved in remediation or settlement.
The Group has a number of environmental claims and proceedings which are at a stage of investigation.
Environmental provisions in relation to these proceedings that were recognised at 31 December 2018 amounted to $18 million.
Preliminary estimates available of the incremental costs indicate that such costs could be up to $186 million.
The Group has insurance agreements, which will provide reimbursement of the costs to be actually incurred up to $228 million, of which $18 million relate to the accrued environmental provisions and have been recognised in receivables at 31 December 2018.
Management believes that an economic outflow of the additional costs is not probable and any pending environmental claims or proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position and results of operations.
In addition, the Group has committed to various environmental protection programmes covering periods from 2019 to 2024, under which the Group will perform works aimed at reductions in environmental pollution and contamination.
As of 31 December 2018, the costs of implementing these programmes are estimated at $121 million.
Commitments and Contingencies continued Legal Proceedings The Group has been and continues to be the subject of legal proceedings, none of which has had, individually or in aggregate, a significant effect on its operations or financial position.
The Group exercises judgement in measuring and recognising provisions and the exposure to contingent liabilities related to pending litigations or other outstanding claims subject to negotiated settlement, mediation, arbitration or government regulation, as well as other contingent liabilities.
Judgement is necessary in assessing the likelihood that a pending claim will succeed, or a liability will arise, and to quantify the possible range of the final settlement.
Because of the inherent uncertainties in this evaluation process, actual losses may be different from the originally estimated provision.
These estimates are subject to change as new information becomes available, primarily with the support of internal specialists or with the support of outside consultants.
As of 31 December 2018, possible legal risks approximate $20 million.
Issued Guarantees In June 2018, EVRAZ plc and EVRAZ West-Siberian Metallurgical Plant issued a joint guarantee in the amount of up to 30 billion roubles $432 million at the exchange rate as of 31 December 2018 to nine companies owned by Sibuglemet to compensate any direct losses caused by the failure to perform the agreed management services provided by one the Groups subsidiaries to these entities.
Sibuglemet is a producer of coking coal and operator of coal refineries in the Kemerovo region of Russia.
The management company committed to perform all management functions including, inter alia, all the decisions required to carry out the day-to-day operations of these coal companies, their investment and procurement activities.
The guarantee expires on 31 December 2025.
