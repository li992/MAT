In particular, other items include the deduction of the shareholders interest in the with-profits estate, the value of which is derived by increasing final bonus rates so as to exhaust the estate over the lifetime of the in-force with-profits business.
This is an assumption to give an appropriate valuation.
To be conservative this item is excluded from the expected free surplus generation profile below.
Cash flows are projected on a deterministic basis and are discounted at the appropriate risk discount rate.
The modelled cash flows use the same methodology underpinning the Groups EEV reporting and so are subject to the same assumptions and sensitivities.
The table below shows how the VIF generated by the in-force business and the associated required capital for long-term business operations is modelled as emerging into free surplus over future years.

In each sensitivity calculation, all other assumptions remain unchanged except where they are directly affected by the revised economic conditions.

If the change in assumptions shown in the sensitivities were to occur, then the effect shown above would be recorded within two components of the profit analysis for the following year, namely the effect of economic assumption changes and short-term fluctuations in investment returns.
In addition to the sensitivity effects shown above, the other components of the profit for the following year would be calculated by reference to the altered assumptions, for example new business contribution and unwind of discount, together with the effect of other changes such as altered corporate bond spreads.
In addition for changes in interest rates, the effect shown above for Jackson would also be recorded within the fair value movements on assets backing surplus and required capital, which are taken directly to shareholders equity.
ii Sensitivity analysis non-economic assumptions The tables below show the sensitivity of the embedded value as at 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017 and the new business contribution after the effect of required capital for 2018 and 2017 for long-term business operations to: 10 per cent proportionate decrease in maintenance expenses for example a 10 per cent sensitivity on a base assumption of 10 per annum would represent an expense assumption of 9 per annum : 10 per cent proportionate decrease in lapse rates for example a 10 per cent sensitivity on a base assumption of 5 per cent would represent a lapse rate of 4.5 per cent per annum : and 5 per cent proportionate decrease in base mortality and morbidity rates ie increased longevity.
