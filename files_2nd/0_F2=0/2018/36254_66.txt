From 1 April 2018 onwards, the Consumer Prices Index CPI is used to Sensitivity analysis increase pensions in payment rather than the Retail Prices Index RPI.
The change reduces the financial risks of the Go-Ahead Plan and enhances the long-term sustainability of the scheme, providing an improvement in the security of Plan members benefit.
In making the valuation, the above assumptions have been used.
For bus pension schemes, the following is an approximate sensitivity analysis of the impact of the change in the key assumptions.
In isolation, the following adjustments would adjust the pension deficit as shown.
As a result of this change, a pre-tax, non-cash exceptional settlement gain of 35.2 million has been recognised in the income statement.

576.9 Franchise adjustment 785.5 The accounting treatment for such pensions scheme is not explicitly considered by IAS 19 Employee Benefits Revised.
However, since Pension scheme liability the contributions currently committed to being paid to each train operating company section are lower than the share of the service cost for current and future service that would normally be calculated under IAS 19 Revised, the Group does not account for uncommitted Pension cost for the financial year contributions towards the sections current or expected future deficits.
This reflects the legal position that some of the existing deficit and 2018 2017 some of the service costs in the current year will be funded in future years beyond the term of the current franchise.
As a result, the Group m m consequently reduces any section deficit balance that would otherwise remain after reflecting the cost sharing with the members and 95.4 Service cost 92.6 reduces any service costs that would give rise to an increase in such deficit through the use of a franchise adjustment with movements 3.5 Administration costs 7.2 in that franchise adjustment meaning that the service costs appropriately reflect contracted contributions resulting over the term of the 65.2 62.8 Franchise adjustment to current period costs franchise, as occurred on the transfer of the London Midland franchise during the year.
