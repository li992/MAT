The Group monitors its liquidity requirements regularly and is satisfied that it has access to sufficient liquidity and operating flexibility to meet its capital requirements.
The Group manages its short and long-term capital structure by seeking to maintain leverage ratios consistent with a long-term investment grade credit rating BBBor better from Standard & Poors and Baa3 or better from Moodys.
The Groups current ratings are BBB Standard & Poors and Baa2 Moodys with developing outlook, following the offers from 21st Century Fox and Comcast.
The leverage ratio assessed by Standard and Poors is Net Debt: EBITDA and the leverage ratio assessed by Moodys is Gross Debt: EBITDA.
Net Debt is defined as total borrowings, including the cash flows arising under operating leases and transponder commitments, less cash and cash equivalents, excluding derivatives.
Gross Debt does not reduce total borrowings by the inclusion of cash and cash equivalents.
The Group is also required to maintain a Net Debt: EBITDA ratio below 4.00:1 and an EBITDA to Net Interest Payable ratio at above 3.50:1 under the terms of its RCF.
The RCF definition of Net Debt does not require the inclusion of future operating lease or transponder cash flows.
At 30 June 2018, the Net Debt: EBITDA ratio as defined by the terms of the RCF was 2.7:1 2017: 2.7:1, and the EBITDA to Net Interest Payable ratio was 10.8:1 2017: 10.1:1.

In determining this limit no account shall be taken of any newly issued shares where the right to acquire the newly issued shares was released, lapsed, cancelled or otherwise became incapable of exercise.
Options and awards which will be satisfied by ESOP shares do not fall within these headroom limits.

This was calculated using the Black-Scholes share option pricing model except for awards which have market-based performance conditions, where a Monte-Carlo simulation model was used, and for grants of nil-priced options, which were treated as the award of a free share.
The fair value of nil-priced options granted during the year was measured on the basis of the market-price of the Companys shares on the date of grant, discounted for expected dividends which would not be received over the vesting period of the options.
The Monte-Carlo simulation model reflected the historical volatilities of the Companys share price and those of all other companies to which the Companys performance would be compared, over a period equal to the vesting period of the awards.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price, over a period equal to the expected life of the options.
Expected life was based on the contractual life of the awards and adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
i Sharesave Scheme The weighted average fair value of equity-settled share awards granted during the year under the Sharesave Scheme, as estimated at the date of grant, was 2.23 2017: 1.19.
This was calculated using the Black-Scholes share option pricing model.
The following weighted average assumptions were used in calculating these fair values: 2018 2017 Share price 9.30 8.35 Exercise price 7.52 6.88 Expected volatility 23% 21% Expected life 3.8 years 3.9 years Expected dividends 1.6% 3.4% Risk-free interest rate 0.7% 0.2% ii Senior Management Schemes The weighted average fair value of equity-settled share awards granted during the year under the Senior Management Schemes, as estimated at the date of grant, was 7.72 2017: 7.23.
The fair value of awards with market-based performance conditions was calculated using a Monte-Carlo simulation model.
Awards granted as nil-priced options were treated as the award of a free share.
For all other awards, fair value was calculated using the BlackScholes share option pricing model.
The following weighted average assumptions were used in calculating these fair values: 2018 2017 Share price 9.67 9.12 Exercise price 0.00 0.00 Expected volatility 24% 20% Expected life 2.1 years 3.0 years Expected dividends 2.9% 3.3% Risk-free interest rate 0.1% 0.2% 118 Sky plc
