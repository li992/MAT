Financial statements Alternative Performance Measures Overview When assessing and discussing financial performance, certain alternative performance measures APMs of historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows are used which are not defined or specified under IFRS.
APMs are used to improve the comparability of information between reporting periods and operating segments.
APMs should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or as superior to, measures reported in accordance with IFRS.
APMs are not uniformly defined by all companies.
Accordingly, the APMs used may not be comparable with similarly titled measures and disclosures made by other companies.
Our APMs fall into two categories: Financial APMs: In most cases, these reflect financial measures that can be directly derived from the financial statements, although the tax impact of any adjusting items would not normally be provided.
However, certain other financial APMs, such as the revenue per order information, cannot be derived from the financial statements as the component elements are not separately disclosed.
The accounting policies applied when calculating APMs are the same as those set out in the consolidated financial statements.
Non-financial APMs: These measures incorporate certain non-financial information that we believe is useful when assessing the performance of the business, such as the number of orders.
Financial APMs The following table reconciles the Consolidated Income Statement to the key profit measures used internally to assess performance.
The definition of operating profit has been restated in the year to exclude the results of associated undertakings.
uEBITDA has not been restated.
EBITDA before adjusting items equals uEBITDA.
A full definition of uEBITDA and Adjusted EPS is provided below.
Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Just Eat plc 145 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Alternative Performance Measures continued Underlying EBITDA uEBITDA The main measure of profitability used by the chief operating decision maker CODM to assess the performance of our businesses is uEBITDA, in conjunction with uEBITDA margin.
EBITDA is defined as earnings before investment revenue and costs, taxation, depreciation, amortisation and asset impairment charges.
uEBITDA also excludes share based payment charges including the related social security costs, acquisition transaction and integration costs, foreign exchange gains and losses, and other gains and losses.
Included within uEBITDA is our share of uEBITDA losses from associates.
The CODM uses uEBITDA as it excludes items that are either non-cash, relate to investment, or do not reflect the day-to-day commercial performance of the business.
As a result, uEBITDA provides a measure of the underlying performance of the business and is considered to enhance the comparability of profit or loss across segments.
Accordingly, Executive Team incentives are partially based on uEBITDA results and, therefore, it is considered to beboth useful and necessary to disclose this measure in our Annual Report and Accounts.
uEBITDA margin is calculated as uEBIDTA divided by revenue.
Segmental uEBITDA is as follows: 2018 2017 m m United Kingdom 189.5 155.4 Canada 11.5 11.4 ANZ 6.5 17.3 International 14.2 19.4 Total segment uEBITDA 198.7 180.7 Share of results from associates uEBITDA 5.7 0.2 Head office 19.1 17.0 uEBITDA 173.9 163.5 A reconciliation of uEBITDA to operating profit, together with further details of the component elements of these adjustments, is set out below.
2018 2017 m m Share based payment charges, including related social security costs 8.0 6.6 Impairment charges and acquisition-related intangible asset amortisation 23.9 204.8 Acquisition transaction and integration costs 14.8 10.7 Net foreign exchange gains 2.7 0.5 Operating profit adjusting items 44.0 221.6 Depreciation and amortisation of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets 25.3 14.0 Share of associates uEBITDA 5.7 0.2 uEBITDA adjusting items 63.6 235.4 Operating profit loss 110.3 71.9 uEBITDA 173.9 163.5 Share based payment charges, including related social security costs Share based payments arise as a result of our long-term incentive schemes and only the social security costs associated with these charges give rise to a cash outflow.
Further details can be seen in Note 7.
As these charges are excluded from our internal performance measures for remuneration purposes, they are also excluded from externally reported uEBITDA.
Impairment charges and acquisition-related intangible asset amortisation 2018 2017 Notes m m Impairment charges 12 180.4 Acquisition-related intangible asset amortisation 13 23.9 24.4 Total 23.9 204.8 146 Just Eat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial statements Underlying EBITDA uEBITDA continued Impairment charges and acquisition-related intangible asset amortisation continued During the year ended 31 December 2017, an impairment charge of 180.4 million was recorded in respect of the ANZ business.
The charge was driven by lower projected cash flows in the business plans resulting in a reassessment of expected future business performance in light of the recent trading environment.
The Australian market is unique within the Just Eat portfolio, with a substantial proportion of the population living in Sydney and Melbourne.
This characteristic makes Australia an attractive market for competitors with the consequence that Australia is today one of our most competitive markets.
Furthermore, success is partly dependent on our ability to add delivery capability to complement our marketplace business.
During the year, our Australian business commenced delivery operations by utilising the SkipTheDishes technology.
Along with the additional security, scalability and stability that the new platform brings, this integration will be crucial to ensure the continued growth in the ANZ market through the addition of the logistics capability.
The technology built by SkipTheDishes allows forecasting of customer demand, driver allocation and delivery times with very high levels of accuracy.
Whilst it will take time to deploy, it is this technology that will place the business in a good position for solid future growth.
Impairment charges and acquisition-related intangible asset amortisation are non-cash charges and while they are linked to operational factors in the business, they are not reflective of the day-to-day commercial performance of the business.
These charges are therefore excluded from our internal performance measures for remuneration purposes.
As a result, they are excluded from uEBITDA.
Acquisition transaction and integration costs 2018 2017 m m M&A transaction costs 3.0 1.7 Acquisition integration costs 11.8 9.0 Total 14.8 10.7 M&A transaction costs relate to legal, due diligence and other costs incurred as a result of our acquisitions see Note 25 and aborted acquisitions.
For the year ended 31 December 2018, they include 1.8 million 2017: 1.3 million of costs in respect of the acquisition of HungryHouse.
Acquisition integration costs relate to the integration of recently acquired businesses.
For the year ended 31 December 2018, 7.5 million relates to the integration of HungryHouse, which includes the costs of running two offices and platforms during employee consultation processes, redundancy costs, lease termination costs and related advisers fees.
SkipTheDishes management provided post-completion services amounting to 2.9 million 2017: 9.0 million in the current year, which are also included in this category.
These charges are separate to the acquisition consideration.
While acquisition-related costs are recurring, and are expected to be incurred in future periods, they do not represent ongoing costs of our commercial operations and are therefore excluded for performance management purposes.
Net foreign exchange gains Movements in foreign exchange rates are outside of our control and as a result these charges or credits are excluded from our internal performance measures for remuneration purposes.
They are therefore excluded from uEBITDA.
Depreciation and amortisation of property, plant and equipment and  intangible assets 2018 2017 Notes m m Depreciation of property, plant and equipment 14 12.0 7.3 Amortisation of other intangible assets, excluding acquisition-related assets 13 13.3 6.7 Total 25.3 14.0 Depreciation of tangible and intangible fixed assets are non-cash charges.
As these charges are excluded from internalperformance measures for remuneration purposes, they are also excluded from uEBITDA as reported in thesefinancial statements.
Share of associates uEBITDA Although the results of associated undertakings are not within our control and do not reflect the operational performance of our business, historically these have been included within internal profit measures and have been included in the key performance metric of uEBITDA.
As explained further below, in 2019 the share of associates uEBITDA will no longer form part of our total uEBITDA measure and management performance will not be assessed on it.
Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Just Eat plc 147 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Alternative Performance Measures continued Adjusted earnings per share Adjusted earnings per share is calculated using an underlying profit measure attributable to the equity shareholders and is used in discussions within the investment analyst community.
This APM is also used as a vesting condition in certain share based incentive schemes.
It is defined as profit attributable to the equity shareholders, before share based payment charges including the related social security costs, asset impairment charges, acquisition transaction and integration costs, other gains and losses, foreign exchange gains and losses, and amortisation in respect of acquired intangible assets.
Similar to uEBITDA, adjusted earnings per share will exclude the associates results in 2019 and beyond.

Underlying ETR for the year ended 31 December 2018 was 22.4% 2017: 23.7%.
Underlying profit is defined as profit before tax before share based payment charges, including social security costs, impairment charges, acquisition transaction and integration costs, other gains and losses, foreign exchange gains and losses, amortisation in respect of acquired intangible assets and share of results from associates below uEBITDA.
The recognition of a deferred tax asset relating to the cumulative tax losses in SkipTheDishes in Canada has also been treated as an adjusting item.
Average revenue per order ARPO ARPO is calculated as the total of order-driven revenue, divided by total orders and is a key driver of revenue, along with the number of orders processed.

growing number of restaurants and cuisine types.
Future changes to APMs Subsequent to the year end, we have changed our internal definition of uEBITDA to exclude both the results of associated undertakings and the results of our Mexican subsidiary, which together comprise our Latin America LATAM business.
A new measure of Adjusted uEBITDA is therefore total uEBITDA excluding LATAM.
Although the Mexican business is within our control, operational performance has been delegated to iFood, the non-controlling partner and, as noted in our Annual report on remuneration, Just Eat management will no longer be assessed on the performance of that business.
The results of our associated undertakings are now excluded from operating profit and therefore it is also appropriate to remove them from uEBITDA.
