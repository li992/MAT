Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 8.
Earnings per share continued Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company by the weighted average number of shares for the year.
In order to provide a measure of underlying performance, management has chosen to present an adjusted profit for the year which excludes items that may distort comparability.
Such items arise from events or transactions that fall within the ordinary activities of the Group but which management believes should be separately identified to help explain underlying performance.
The adjusted results are also those used by management to monitor performance and run the business.

Goodwill m Carrying value At 1 July 2016 4,713 Foreign exchange movements 188 Other 29 At 30 June 2017 4,930 Foreign exchange movements 16 Other 26 At 30 June 2018 4,972 96 Sky plc Financial statements Goodwill has principally arisen from the Groups purchases of Sky Deutschland, Sky Italia, British Interactive Broadcasting BiB, Easynets UK broadband network assets and residential activities, 365 Medias content activities, Amstrad, Living TV, The Cloud and the O2 consumer broadband and fixed-line telephony business.
Goodwill, allocated by cash generating unit, is analysed as follows: 2018 2017 m m 1 UK and Ireland 936 932 2 Germany and Austria 3,213 3,192 3 Italy 823 806 4,972 4,930 Impairment reviews were performed on these goodwill balances at 30 June 2018, which did not indicate impairment.
Recoverable amounts for each of the cash generating units CGUs were calculated on the basis of value in use, using cash flows calculated for the next four years as forecast by management.
In order to extrapolate cash flow projections beyond this period: A growth rate of 2% for subsequent years was applied to the UK and Ireland CGU: An initial growth rate of 20% for the four years beyond our plan period, declining to 2% for subsequent years, was applied to the Germany and Austria CGU: and An initial growth rate of 20% for the four years beyond our plan period, declining to 2% for subsequent years, was applied to the planned Italian broadband triple-play service and a growth rate of 2% for subsequent years for the remainder of the Italy CGU.
In the prior year, a growth rate of 2% was applied to all units.
The growth rates selected were based on an extrapolation of trends included within management forecasts and on historical growth rates observed by the Group for similar products and or in similar markets.
The approach with respect to growth rates has been updated in the current year to reflect our business plans and expected medium-term penetration of the market in the Germany and Austria CGU and expected medium-term growth following the launch of the Italian broadband triple-play service in the Italy CGU.
The cash flows of the UK and Ireland CGU were discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 8% 2017: 10%, the cash flows of the Germany and Austria CGU were discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 8% 2017: 8% and the cash flows of the Italy CGU were discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 9% 2017: 10%.
In determining the applicable discount rate, management applied judgement in respect of several factors, which included, inter alia: assessing the risk attached to future cash flows and making reference to the capital asset pricing model the CAPM.
Management gave consideration to the selection of appropriate inputs to the CAPM, which included the risk free rate, the equity risk premium and a measure of systematic risk.
Management also considered capital structure and an appropriate cost of debt in arriving at the discount rate.
The key assumptions used to calculate the value in use for each unit include the discount rate, the growth rate used to extrapolate cash flow projections and forecast cash flows.
The metrics on which the forecast cash flows of each unit were derived include the number of gross customer additions, the rate of churn, the average revenue per customer, levels of programming spend, acquisition costs per customer and anticipated changes in the product mix and marketing mix of the business activities.
The values assigned to each of these were determined based on the extrapolation of historical trends within the Group, and external information on expected future trends in the entertainment and communications industry in each territory.
Sensitivity analysis Changing of the key assumptions selected by management, in particular the discount rate, forecast cash flows and the growth rate used to extrapolate cash flow projections, could significantly affect the Groups impairment evaluation and hence reported assets and profits or losses.
Other than as disclosed below, management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of these key assumptions would cause the carrying value of any CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.
The following changes to key assumptions used in the impairment review would, in isolation, lead to the recoverable amount being equal to the carrying value as at 30 June 2018.
For the Germany and Austria CGU, i the discount rate would need to increase from 8% to 10%: ii the cash flows would need to decrease by 26% in each year: or iii the initial growth rate used to extrapolate those cash flow projections would need to decline from 20% to 10%.
For the Italy CGU, i the discount rate would need to increase from 9% to 12%: or ii the cash flows would need to decrease by 26% in each year.
