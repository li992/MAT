Audited financial statements Notes to the accounts 1 Segmental analysis Operating segments are the components of the Group whose results are regularly reviewed by the Groups chief operating decision maker tomake decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance.
The Chief Executive, who is considered to be the chief operating decision maker, managed the Group on the basis of business divisions determined with reference to market focus, geographic focus, investment funding model and the Groups management hierarchy.
A description of the activities, including products and services offered by these divisions and the allocation of resources, is given in the Strategic report.
For the geographical segmental split, revenue information is based on the locations of the assets held.
The segmental information that follows is presented on the basis used by the Chief Executive to monitor the performance of the Group.
The reported segments are Private Equity, Infrastructure and other, where other comprises the residual investments retained following the sale of our Debt Management business.
These investments were sold during the year.
The segmental analysis is prepared on the Investment basis to provide the most meaningful information to the reader of the accounts.

The table below is prepared in accordance with Companies Act requirements, which is consistent with both the IFRS and the Investment basis.

Tax is charged or credited in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, except where it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the tax is also dealt within equity.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year.
This may differ from the profit included in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
To enable the tax charge to be based on the profit for the year, deferred tax is provided in full on temporary timing differences, at the rates of tax expected to apply when these differences crystallise.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which temporary differences can be set off.
All deferred tax liabilities are offset against deferred tax assets, where appropriate, in accordance with the provisions of IAS 12.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
The main rate of UK corporation tax is 19% and is to be reduced to 17% from 1 April 2020.
This change will affect future UK corporate taxes payable and the rate at which deferred tax assets are expected to reverse.

An approved Investment Trust company is a UK investment company which is required to meet certain conditions set out in the UK tax rules to obtain and maintain its tax status.
This approval allows certain investment profits of the Company, broadly its capital profits, to be exempt from tax in the UK.
The Group has recognised a current UK corporation tax liability of 22 million 2017: nil for the year.
This is higher than previous years due to increased levels of taxable interest income from portfolio companies, reduced interest expenditure following the repayment of a bond in March 2017, and a 90 million performance fee from 3iN following its disposals of AWG and Elenia in the year.
Finally, the use of losses brought forward has been restricted with effect from 1 April 2017.
Including a net tax charge of 1 million 2017: nil in the fair valued entities, the Group recognised a total tax charge of 26 million 2017: tax credit 3 million under the Investment basis.

With the additional restrictions on utilising brought forward losses introduced from 1 April 2017, and the uncertainty that the Group will generate sufficient or relevant taxable profits in the foreseeable future to utilise these amounts, no deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses.
Deferred income taxes are calculated using an expected rate of corporation tax in the UK of 19% 2017: 19%.
110 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2018 Audited financial statements 8 Per share information The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the profit attributable to shareholders and the number of basic average shares.

In accordance with this policy, the Group pays a base dividend of 16 pence per share and an additional dividend which is based on cash realisations, the investment pipeline and the balance sheet at year end.
The Group will only pay an additional dividend if gross debt is less than 1 billion and gearing is less than 20%, to maintain its conservative balance sheet approach.
The dividend can be paid out of either the capital reserve or the revenue reserve subject to the investment trust rules.
The distributable reserves of the parent company are 1,941 million 31 March 2017: 1,742 million and the Board reviews the distributable reserves bi-annually ahead of proposing any dividend.
The Board also reviews the proposed dividends in the context of the requirements of being an approved Investment Trust.
Details of the Groups continuing viability and going concern can be found on page 47 and 89.
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2018 111 Audited financial statements Notes to the accounts continued 9 Dividends continued In light of the Groups continued progress in executing its strategy, we now propose to replace our base and additional dividend policy with a simpler policy.
Further details are on page 34 of the Financial review.
10 Investment portfolio Accounting policy: Investments are recognised and fide-recognised on the date when their purchase or sale is subject to a relevant contract and the associated risks and rewards have been transferred.
The Group manages its investments with a view to profiting from the receipt of investment income and capital appreciation from changes in the fair value of investments.
All investments are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration given and are subsequently measured at fair value, in accordance with the Groups valuation policies.
Quoted investments are designated at fair value through profit and loss and subsequently carried in the Consolidated statement of financial position at fair value.
Fair value is measured using the closing bid price at the reporting date, where the investment is quoted on an active stock market.
Unquoted investments, including both equity and loans are designated at fair value through profit and loss and are subsequently carried in the Consolidated statement of financial position at fair value.
Fair value is determined in line with 3is valuation policy, which is compliant with the fair value guidelines under IFRS and the International Private Equity and Venture Capital IPEV Valuation Guidelines, details of which are available in Portfolio valuation an explanation on pages 150 and 151.
Interest bearing loans accrue interest which is either settled in cash or capitalised on a regular basis and included as part of the principal loan balance.
The capitalisation of accrued interest is treated as part of investment additions during the year.
If the fair value of an investment is assessed to be below the principal value of the loan the Group recognises a fair value reduction against any interest income accrued from the date of the assessment going forward.
Capitalisation at nil value is the term used to describe the capitalisation of accrued interest which has been fully provided for.
These transactions are disclosed as additions to portfolio cost with an equal reduction made where loan notes have nil value.
In accordance with IFRS 10, the proportion of the investment portfolio held by the Groups unconsolidated subsidiaries is presented as part of the fair value of investment entity subsidiaries, along with the fair value of their other assets and liabilities.
A reconciliation of the fair value of Investments in investment entities is included in Note 11.

The holding period of 3is investment portfolio is on average greater than one year.
For this reason the portfolio is classified as non-current.
It is not possible to identify with certainty investments that will be sold within one year.
Additions from continuing operations include cash investment of 470 million 2017: 280 million and 11 million 2017: 11 million in capitalised interest received by way of loan notes, of which nil 2017: 10 million has been written down in the period to nil.
112 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2018 Audited financial statements 10 Investment portfolio continued Included within the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income is 26 million 2017: 10 million of interest income.
This is made up of the 11 million of capitalised interest noted above, 4 million 2017: 4 million of cash income and the capitalisation of prior year accrued income and non-capitalised accrued income of 11 million 2017: 5 million.
Quoted investments are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy and unquoted investments are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, see Note 12 for details.
11 Investments in investment entity subsidiaries Accounting policy: Investments in investment entity subsidiaries are accounted for as financial instruments at fair value through profit and loss.
These entities are typically limited partnerships and other intermediate investment holding structures which hold the Groups interests in investments in portfolio companies.
The fair value can increase or reduce from either cash flows to from the investment entity subsidiaries or valuation movements in line with the Groups valuation policy.
Substantially all of these entities meet the definition of a Fund under the IPEV guidelines and the fair value and unit of account of these entities is their net asset values.
There were no adjustments to the subsidiaries net asset values in the year.
We determine that in the ordinary course of business, the net asset values of investment entity subsidiaries are considered to be the most appropriate to determine fair value.
At each reporting period, we consider whether any additional fair value adjustments need to be made to the net asset values of the investment entity subsidiaries.
These adjustments may be required to reflect market participants considerations about fair value that may include, but are not limited to, liquidity and the portfolio effect of holding multiple investments within the investment entity subsidiary.
There was no particular circumstance to indicate that a fair value adjustment was required and after due consideration we concluded that the net asset values were the most appropriate reflection of fair value at 31 March 2018.

A 5% movement in the closing book value of investments in investment entities would have an impact of 202 million 31 March 2017: 174 million.
Restrictions 3i Group plc, the ultimate parent company, receives dividend income from its subsidiaries.
There are no restrictions on the ability to transfer funds from these subsidiaries to the Group except for a cash balance of 85 million 31 March 2017: 56 million held on escrow in investment entity subsidiaries for carried interest payable.
Support 3i Group plc continues to provide, where necessary, ongoing support to its investment entity subsidiaries for the purchase of portfolio investments.
During the year, there were net cash flows to the Group as noted in the table above.
The Groups current commitments are disclosed in Note 24.
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2018 113 Audited financial statements Notes to the accounts continued 12 Fair values of assets and liabilities Accounting policy: Financial instruments, other than those held at amortised cost, are held at fair value and are designated irrevocably at inception.
In particular, 3i designates groups of financial instruments as being at fair value when they are managed, and their performance evaluated, on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy, and where information about the groups offinancial instruments is reported to management on that basis.

The tables below show the classification of financial instruments held at fair value into the valuation hierarchy at 31 March 2018: Group Group Group Group Group Group Group Group 2018 2018 2018 2018 2017 2017 2017 2017 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total m m m m m m m m Assets Quoted investments 345 345 390 390 Unquoted investments 1,751 1,751 1,316 1,316 Investments in investment entity subsidiaries 4,034 4,034 3,483 3,483 Total 345 5,785 6,130 390 4,799 5,189 The above disclosure only relates to the investment portfolio and the investments in our investment entity subsidiaries.
We determine that in the ordinary course of business, the net asset values of an investment entity subsidiary are considered to be the most appropriate to determine fair value.
The underlying portfolio is valued under the same methodology as directly held investments, with any other assets or liabilities within investment entity subsidiaries fair valued in accordance with the Groups accounting policies.
Note 11 details the Directors considerations about the fair value of the underlying investment entity subsidiaries.
Movements in the directly held investment portfolio categorised as Level 3 during the year: Group Group Company Company 2018 2017 2018 2017 m m m m Opening book value 1,316 1,243 1,295 1,103 Additions from continuing operations 481 213 481 228 of which loan notes with nil value 10 10 Additions from discontinued operations 70 18 Disposals, repayments and write-offs from continuing operations 315 292 293 288 Disposals, repayments and write-offs from discontinued operations 191 24 1 Fair value movement from continuing operations 346 224 346 218 Fair value movement from discontinued operations 3 2 Other movements and net cash movements from continuing operations 77 75 78 69 2 Other movements and net cash movements from discontinued operations 19 19 Closing book value 1,751 1,316 1,751 1,295 1 All fair value movements relate to assets held at the end of the period.
2 Other movements include the impact of foreign exchange and the transfer of an investment to an investment entity subsidiary.
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2018 115 Audited financial statements Notes to the accounts continued 12 Fair values of assets and liabilities continued On a continuing basis, unquoted investments valued using Level 3 inputs also had the following impact on the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income: realised profits over value on disposal of investment of 14 million 2017: realised loss of 26 million, dividend income of 13 million 2017: 24 million and foreign exchange losses of 12 million 2017: foreign exchange gains of 63 million.
Level 3 inputs are sensitive to assumptions made when ascertaining fair value as described in the Portfolio valuation an explanation section.
On an IFRS basis, of assets held at 31 March 2018, classified as Level 3, 40% 31 March 2017: 33% were valued using a multiple of earnings and the remaining 60% 31 March 2017: 67% were valued using alternative valuation methodologies.
Of the underlying portfolio held by investment entity subsidiaries, 95% 31 March 2017: 96% were valued using a multiple of earnings and the remaining 5% 31 March 2017: 4% were valued using alternative valuation methodologies.
Assets move between Level 1 and Level 3 when an unquoted equity investment lists on a quoted market exchange.
There were no transfers in or out of Level 3 during the year.
Valuation multiple The valuation multiple is the main assumption applied to a multiple of earnings based valuation.
The multiple is derived from comparable listed companies or relevant market transaction multiples.
Companies in the same industry and geography and, where possible, with a similar business model and profile are selected and then adjusted for factors including liquidity risk, growth potential and relative performance.
They are also adjusted to represent our longer term view of performance through the cycle or our exit assumptions.
The value weighted average post discount earnings multiple used when valuing the portfolio at 31 March 2018 was 11.7x 31 March 2017: 10.2x.
If the multiple used to value each unquoted investment valued on an earnings multiple basis as at 31 March 2018 decreased by 5%, the investment portfolio would decrease by 43 million 31 March 2017: 18 million or 2% 31 March 2017: 1%.
If the same sensitivity was applied to the underlying portfolio held by investment entity subsidiaries, this would have a negative impact of 270 million 31 March 2017: 224 million or 6% 31 March 2017: 6%.
If the multiple increased by 5% then the investment portfolio would increase by 35 million 31 March 2017: 16 million or 2% 31 March 2017: 1%.
If the same sensitivity was applied to the underlying portfolio held by investment entity subsidiaries, this would have a positive impact of 260 million 31 March 2017: 215 million or 6% 31 March 2017: 5%.
Alternative valuation methodologies There are a number of alternative investment valuation methodologies used by the Group, for reasons specific to individual assets.
The details of such valuation methodologies, and inputs that are used, are given in the Portfolio valuation an explanation section on pages 150 and 151.
Each methodology is used for a proportion of assets by value, and at year end the following techniques were used under an IFRS basis: 5% DCF 31 March 2017: 41%, nil broker quotes 31 March 2017: 4%, 45% imminent sale 31 March 2017: 2%, 7% industry metric 31 March 2017: 10% and 3% other 31 March 2017: 10%.
If the value of all of the investments valued under alternative methodologies moved by 5%, this would have an impact on the investment portfolio of 53 million 31 March 2017: 44 million or 3% 31 March 2017: 3%.
If the same sensitivity was applied to the underlying portfolio held by investment entity subsidiaries, this would have an impact of 10 million 31 March 2017: 7 million or 0.3% 31 March 2017: 0.2%.
13 Carried interest and performance fees receivable Accounting policy: The Group earns a share of profits carried interest and performance fees receivable from funds which it manages on behalf of third parties.
These profits are earned when the funds meet certain performance conditions.
Carried interest and performance fees receivable include amounts receivable from Private Equity and Infrastructure.
Each scheme is separately reviewed at the balance sheet date, and an accrual for carried interest receivable is made once the performance conditions would be achieved if the remaining assets in that fund were realised at fair value.
Fair value of the assets is determined using the Groups valuation methodology and is measured at the balance sheet date.
An accrual is made equal to the Groups share of profits in excess of the performance conditions, taking into account the cash already returned to fund investors and the fair value of assets remaining in the fund.
The performance fee receivable from 3iN is based on 3iNs most recently published NAV subject to a performance hurdle and a high water mark.

A 5% movement in the valuation of all individual assets in the underlying investment portfolio would result in a 22 million movement in the carried interest receivable balance.
As there is only 5 million of carried interest receivable included within investment entity subsidiaries, there is no material difference when carried interest receivable within investment entity subsidiaries is included.
14 Carried interest and performance fees payable Accounting policy: The Group offers investment executives the opportunity to participate in the returns from investments subject to certain performance conditions.
Carried interest and performance fees payable is the term used for amounts payable to executives on these investmentrelated transactions.
A variety of asset pooling arrangements are in place so that executives may have an interest in one or more carried interest plans.
Carried interest payable is accrued if its performance conditions, measured at the balance sheet date, would be achieved if the remaining assets in that plan were realised at fair value.
An accrual is made equal to the executives share of profits in excess of the performance conditions in place in the carried interest plan, discounted to reflect the likely actual cash payment date, which may be materially later than the time of the accrual.
The Infrastructure performance fee is accrued based on the expected award.
A significant proportion of the amount awarded is deferred over time and may be granted in either 3i Group plc or 3i Infrastructure plc shares.
This is recognised over the vesting period in line with the requirements of IFRS 2 or IAS 19 depending on the type of award.
Under IFRS 10, where carried interest payable reduces the fair value of an investment entity subsidiary, that movement is recorded through Fair value movements on investment entity subsidiaries.
At 31 March 2018, 710 million of carried interest payable was recognised in the Consolidated statement of financial position of these investment entity subsidiaries 31 March 2017: 538 million.

See Note 27 Share-based payments for further details.
2 Other includes the impact of foreign exchange and a transfer from trade and other payables.
A 5% increase in the valuation of all individual assets in the underlying investment portfolio including those portfolio investments held by investment entity subsidiaries would result in a 4 million increase in carried interest payable.
Including carried interest payable recognised in investment entity subsidiaries it would result in a 45 million increase.
A 5% decrease in the valuation of all of individual assets in the underlying investment portfolio would result in a 4 million decrease in carried interest payable.
Including carried interest payable recognised in investment entity subsidiaries it would result in a 35 million decrease.
15 Other assets Accounting policy: Assets, other than those specifically accounted for under a separate policy, are stated at their cost less impairment losses.
They are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated based on expected discounted future cash flows.
Any change in the level of impairment is recognised directly in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2018 123 Audited financial statements Notes to the accounts continued 26 Retirement benefits Accounting policy: Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are charged to the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income as they fall due.
For defined benefit retirement plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit method with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Interest on the net defined benefit asset liability, calculated using the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation, is recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Re-measurement gains or losses are recognised in full as they arise in other comprehensive income.
A retirement benefit deficit is recognised in the Consolidated statement of financial position to the extent that the present value of the defined benefit obligations exceeds the fair value of plan assets.
A retirement benefit surplus is recognised in the Consolidated statement of financial position where the fair value of plan assets exceeds the present value of the defined benefit obligations limited to the extent that the Group can benefit from that surplus.
Retirement benefit plans i Defined contribution plans The Group operates a number of defined contribution retirement benefit plans for qualifying employees throughout the Group.
The assets of these plans are held separately from those of the Group.
The employees of the Groups subsidiaries in France are members of a state managed retirement benefit plan operated by the countrys government.
3i Europe plcs French branch is required to contribute a specific percentage of payroll costs to the retirement benefit scheme to fund these benefits.
The total expense recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income is 3 million 2017: 3 million, which represents the contributions paid to these defined contribution plans.
There were no outstanding payments due to these plans at the balance sheet date.
ii Defined benefit plans The Group operates a final salary defined benefit plan for qualifying employees of its subsidiaries in the UK the Plan.
The Plan is approved by HMRC for tax purposes and is operated separately from the Group and managed by an independent set of Trustees, whose appointment and powers are determined by the Plans documentation.
Membership of the Plan has not been offered to new employees joining 3i since 1 April 2006.
The Plan was closed to the future accrual of benefits by members with effect from 5 April 2011, although the final salary link is maintained on existing accruals.
Members of the Plan have been invited to join the Groups defined contribution plan with effect from 6 April 2011.
The defined benefit plan is a funded scheme, the assets of which are independent of the Companys finances and are administered by the Trustees.
The Trustees are responsible for managing and investing the Plans assets and for monitoring the Plans funding position.
As the Plan is now closed to future accrual, measures have been taken to fide-risk the Plan, including through changes to its investment policy.
The valuation of the Plan has been updated on an IAS 19 basis by an independent qualified actuary as at 31 March 2018.
Employees in Germany and Spain are entitled to a pension based on their length of service.
The future liability calculated by German and Spanish actuaries is 24 million 31 March 2017: 23 million.
The Spanish branch of 3i Europe plc contributes to individual investment policies for its employees and has agreed to indemnify any shortfall on an employees investment policy should it arise.
The total value of these investment policies intended to cover pension liabilities is 1 million 31 March 2017: 1 million.
There was no expense 2017: 1 million expense recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year and a 1 million loss 2017: nil in other comprehensive income for these schemes.

The annuity contract is provided by Pension Insurance Corporation as a result of a buy-in transaction completed by the 3i Pension Plan Trustees during FY2017.
The buy-in, which is a bulk annuity purchase, reduces member longevity risk for those pensioners covered while improving investment returns over the assets used to fund the purchase.
This contract provides an exact match for the member benefits insured and covers two in five pensioners.
The fair value of the insurance policy is calculated using the same assumptions and methodology as used to calculate the value of the pension liability as at 31 March 2018.
The Plans assets do not include any of the Groups own equity instruments nor any property in use by the Group.
Changes in the asset restriction were as follows: 2018 2017 m m Opening asset restriction 65 71 Interest on asset restriction 2 2 Re-measurements 1 8 Closing asset restriction 68 65 The principal assumptions made by the actuaries and used for the purpose of the year end valuation of the Plan were as follows: 2018 2017 Discount rate 2.5% 2.5% Expected rate of salary increases 5.8% 5.8% Expected rate of pension increases 0% to 3.4% 0% to 3.4% Retail Price Index RPI inflation 3.3% 3.3% Consumer Price Index CPI inflation 2.3% 2.3% In addition, it is assumed that members exchange 25% of pension for lump sum at retirement on the conversion terms in place at 31 March 2018 with an allowance for the terms to increase in future.
The duration of the Plans defined benefit obligation at the accounting date was around 21 years.
The post-retirement mortality assumption used to value the benefit obligation at 31 March 2018 is 80% of the S2NA Light tables allowing for improvements in line with the CMI 2015 core projections with a long-term annual rate of improvement of 1.75% 31 March 2017: 80% of S1NA Light tables allowing for improvements in line with the CMI 2012 core projections with a long-term annual rate of improvement of 1.5%.
The life expectancy of a male member reaching age 60 in 2038 31 March 2017: 2037 is projected to be 34.0 31 March 2017: 33.7 years compared to 31.3 31 March 2017: 31.4 years for someone reaching 60 in 2018.
The sensitivity of the defined benefit surplus to changes in the weighted principal assumptions is: Impact on retirement benefit surplus Change in assumption 2018 2017 Discount rate Decrease by 0.1% Decrease by 9 million Decrease by 10 million Retail Price Index RPI inflation Increase by 0.1% Decrease by 8 million Decrease by 7 million Life expectancy Increase by 1 year Decrease by 17 million Decrease by 13 million The above sensitivity analysis is based on changing one assumption whilst all others remain constant.
In practice this is unlikely to occur andchanges in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
126 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2018 Audited financial statements 26 Retirement benefits continued Through its defined benefit plan the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below: Asset volatility A fall in the value of the Plans assets may reduce the value of the defined benefit surplus and could affect the future funding requirements.
To reduce the volatility of the Plans assets, the Trustees have implemented an investment strategy that reduces the Plans equity holdings by switching them to bonds over time.
The Plans assets are also diversified across different asset classes and during FY2017 it purchased an annuity contract that is an exact match for a proportion of the Plans liabilities.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the Plans IAS 19 defined benefit obligation.
However, the Plan holds a proportion of its assets in corporate bonds and so any increase in the defined benefit obligation would bepartially offset by an increase in the value of the Plans assets.
Inflation risk The Plans defined benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
Themajority of the Plans assets are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that anincrease in inflation could reduce or eliminate the defined benefit surplus.
Life expectancy The Plans obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the members, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the Plans defined benefit obligation.
As the Plan was closed to future accrual of benefits by members with effect from 5 April 2011, the Group ceased to make regular contributions to the Plan in the year to 31 March 2012.
The latest triennial valuation for the Plan was completed on 25 September 2017, based on the position at 30 June 2016.
The outcome was an actuarial deficit of 50 million.
This valuation is produced for funding purposes and is calculated on a different basis to the IAS 19 valuation net asset of 125 million which is shown in the Note above.
The actuarial funding valuation is as at 30 June 2016 and considers expected future returns on the Plans assets against the expected liabilities, using a more prudent set of assumptions.
The IAS 19 accounting valuation compares the 31 March 2018 fair value of plan assets and liabilities, with the liabilities calculated based on the expected future payments discounted using AA corporate bond yields.
As part of the triennial valuation it was agreed that it was not necessary for the Group to make any immediate contributions to the Plan, taking into account the volatile market conditions at the valuation date immediately after the UKs referendum to leave the EU, and improvements in market conditions and liability management actions implemented since then.
The Group has agreed to pay up to 50 million to the Plan if its gearing increases above 20%, gross debt exceeds 1 billion, or net assets fall below 2 billion.
The Plan also benefits from a contingent asset arrangement, details of which are provided in Note 25.
If the gearing, net debt or net asset limits noted are reached, the Group may be required to increase the potential cover provided by the contingent arrangement until the gearing, gross debt or net assets improve.
The next triennial funding valuation will be based on the Plans position as at 30 June 2019.
27 Share-based payments Accounting policy: The Group has equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payment transactions with certain employees.
Equity-settled schemes are measured at fair value at the date of grant, which is then recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the period that employees provide services, generally the period between the start of performance period and the vesting date of the shares.
The number of share awards expected to vest takes into account the likelihood that performance and services conditions included in the terms of the award will be met.
Fair value is measured by use of an appropriate model which takes into account the exercise price of the option if any, the current share price, the risk-free interest rate, the expected volatility of the share price over the life of the option and any other relevant factors.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of 3i Group plc.
The charge is adjusted at each balance sheet date to reflect the actual number of forfeitures, cancellations and leavers during the year.
The movement in cumulative charges since the previous balance sheet is recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Liabilities arising from cash-settled share-based payment transactions are recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the vesting period.
They are fair valued at each reporting date.
The cost of cash-settled share-based payment transactions is adjusted for the forfeitures of the participants rights that no longer meet the plan requirements as well as for early vesting.
Share-based payments are in certain circumstances made in lieu of annual cash bonuses or carried interest payments.
The cost of the share-based payments is allocated either to operating expenses bonuses or carried interest depending on the original driver of the award.
Executive Director Long-Term Incentives are allocated to operating expenses.

3 Recognised in operating expenses and or carried interest.
The features of the Groups share schemes for Executive Directors are described in the Directors remuneration report on pages 73 to 82.
To ensure that employees interests are aligned with shareholders, a significant amount of variable compensation paid to higher earning employees is deferred into shares that vest over a number of years.
For legal, regulatory or practical reasons certain participants may be granted phantom awards under these schemes, which are intended to replicate the financial effects of a share award without entitling the participant to acquire shares.
The carrying amount of liabilities arising from share-based payment transactions at 31 March 2018 is 10 million 31 March 2017: 6 million.
For the share-based awards granted during the year, the weighted average fair value of those options at 31 March 2018 was 753 pence 31 March 2017: 436 pence.
The main assumptions for the valuation of certain share-based awards with market conditions attached comprised: Expected Share price Exercise Expected option life Dividend Risk free Valuation methodology at issue price volatility in years yield interest rate Monte Carlo model 916p 26% 3 0.25% Black Scholes 931p 31% 0.5-4 2.8% 1.27% Expected volatility was determined by reviewing share price volatility for the expected life of each option up to the date of grant.
Movements in share awards The number of share-based awards outstanding as at 31 March are as follows: 2018 2017 Number Number Outstanding at the start of the year 10,113,875 11,653,772 Granted 1,957,521 3,929,354 Exercised 3,907,171 5,360,537 Lapsed 85,779 108,714 Outstanding at the end of year 8,078,446 10,113,875 Weighted average remaining contractual life of awards outstanding in years 1.9 2.8 Exercisable at the end of the year 60,254 109,266 The weighted average market price at the date of exercise was 919 pence 2017: 574 pence.
Holdings of 3i Group plc shares The Group has established an employee benefit trust and the total number of 3i Group plc shares held in this trust at 31 March 2018 was 8 million 31 March 2017: 11 million.
Dividend rights have been waived on these shares.
The total market value of the shares held in trust based on the year end share price of 859 pence 31 March 2017: 750 pence was 67 million 31 March 2017: 85 million.
128 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2018 Audited financial statements 28 Financial risk management Introduction A review of the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing and monitoring risk is set out in the Risk management section on pages 44 to 51.
This Note provides further detail on financial risk management, cross-referring to the Risk management section where applicable, and includes quantitative data on specific financial risks.
The Group is a highly selective investor and each investment is subject to an individual risk assessment through an investment approval process.
The Groups Investment Committee is part of the overall risk management framework set out in the Risk section.
The risk management processes of the Company are aligned with those of the Group and both the Group and the Company share the same financial risks.
Financial risks Concentration risk 3i seeks to diversify risk through significant dispersion of investments by geography, economic sector, asset class and size as well as through the maturity profile of its investment portfolio.
Although 3i does not set maximum limits for asset allocation, it does have a maximum exposure limit for the cost of new investments.
This is detailed in the Investment policy on page 84 in the Governance section.
Quantitative data regarding the concentration risk of the portfolio across geographies can be found in the Segmental analysis in Note 1 and in the 20 large investments table on pages 148 and 149. Credit risk The Group is subject to credit risk on its unquoted investments, cash and deposits.
The maximum exposure is the balance sheet amount.
The Groups cash is held with a variety of counterparties with 93% of the Groups surplus cash held on demand in AAA rated money market funds 31 March 2017: 85%.
The credit quality of unquoted investments, which are held at fair value and include debt and equity elements, is based on the financial performance of the individual portfolio companies.
The credit risk relating to these assets is based on their enterprise value and is reflected through fair value movements.
Further detail can be found in the Price risk market fluctuations disclosure in this Note and the sensitivity disclosure to changes in the valuation assumptions is provided in the valuation section of Note 12.
Liquidity risk The liquidity outlook is monitored monthly by management and regularly by the Board in the context of periodic strategic reviews of the balance sheet.
The new investment pipeline and forecast realisations are closely monitored and assessed against our vintage control policy, as described on page 44 of the Risk management section.
The table on the next page analyses the maturity of the Groups gross contractual liabilities.

Market risk The valuation of the Groups investment portfolio is largely dependent on the underlying trading performance of the companies within the portfolio but the valuation and other items in the financial statements can also be affected by interest rate, currency and quoted market fluctuations.
The Groups sensitivity to these items is set out below.
130 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2018 Audited financial statements 28 Financial risk management continued i Interest rate risk On the liability side, the direct impact of a movement in interest rates is limited to any drawings under the committed multi-currency facility as the Groups outstanding debt is fixed rate.
The sensitivities below arise principally from changes in interest receivable on cash and deposits.
An increase of 100 basis points, based on the closing balance sheet position over a 12-month period, would lead to an approximate increase in total comprehensive income of 11 million 2017: 10 million increase for the Group and 9 million 2017: 9 million for the Company.
In addition, the Group and Company have indirect exposure to interest rates through changes to the financial performance and the valuation of portfolio companies caused by interest rate fluctuations.
ii Currency risk The Groups net assets in euro, US dollar, Danish krone and all other currencies combined are shown in the table below.
This sensitivity analysis is performed based on the sensitivity of the Groups net assets to movements in foreign currency exchange rates assuming a 10% movement in exchange rates against sterling.
The sensitivity of the Company to foreign exchange risk is not materially different from the Group.
The Group considers currency risk on specific investment and realisation transactions.
Further information on how currency risk is managed isprovided on page 44.

In addition, the Company has related parties in respect of its subsidiaries.
Some of these subsidiaries are held at fair value unconsolidated subsidiaries due to the treatment prescribed in IFRS 10.
Related parties Limited partnerships The Group manages a number of external funds which invest through limited partnerships.
Group companies act as the general partners of these limited partnerships and exert significant influence over them.

Unconsolidated structured entities The application of IFRS 12 requires additional disclosure on the Groups exposure to unconsolidated structured entities.
The Group has exposure to a number of unconsolidated structured entities as a result of its investment activities across its Private Equity and Infrastructure business lines.
The nature, purpose and activities of these entities are detailed below along with the nature of risks associated with these entities and the maximum exposure to loss.
Closed-end limited partnerships The Group manages a number of closed-end limited partnerships, which are either Private Equity or Infrastructure focused, in return for a management fee.
The purpose of these partnerships is to invest in Private Equity or Infrastructure investments for capital appreciation.
Limited Partners, which in some cases may include the Group, finance these entities by committing capital to them and cash is drawn down or distributed for financing investment activity.
The Groups attributable stakes in these entities are held at fair value, fees receivable are recognised on an accruals basis and carried interest is accrued when relevant performance hurdles are met.
The risk and maximum exposure to loss arising from the Groups involvement with these entities are summarised below: Carrying amount Maximum Assets Liabilities Net loss exposure Balance sheet line item of asset or liability m m m m Carried interest receivable 500 500 500 Total 500 500 500 At 31 March 2017, the carrying amount of assets and maximum loss exposure of carried interest receivable was 356 million.

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2018 133 Audited financial statements Notes to the accounts continued 29 Related parties and interests in other entities continued Regulatory information relating to fees 3i Investments plc acts as the AIFM of 3i Group plc.
In performing the activities and functions of the AIFM, the AIFM or another 3i company may pay or receive fees, commissions or non-monetary benefits to or from third parties of the following nature: Transaction fees 3i companies receive monitoring and directors fees from portfolio companies.
The amount is agreed with the portfolio company at the time of the investment but may be re-negotiated.
Where applicable, 3i may also receive fees on the completion of transactions such as acquisitions, refinancings or syndications either from the portfolio company or a co-investor.
Transaction fees paid to 3i are included in portfolio income.
Payments for third-party services 3i companies may retain the services of third-party consultants: for example for an independent director or other investment management specialist expertise.
The amount paid varies in accordance with the nature of the service and the length of the service period and is usually, but not always, paid reimbursed by the portfolio companies.
The payment may involve a flat fee, retainer or success fee.
Such payments, where borne by 3i companies, are usually included in portfolio income.
Payments for services from 3i companies One 3i company may provide investment advisory services to another 3i company and receive payment for such services.
30 Subsidiaries and related undertakings IFRS 10 deems control, as opposed to equity ownership, as the key factor when determining what meets the definition of a subsidiary.
If a group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee, then under IFRS 10 ithascontrol.
This is inconsistent with the UKs Companies Act 2006, where voting rights being greater than 50% is the key factor whenidentifying subsidiaries.
Under IFRS 10, 23 of the Groups portfolio company investments are considered to be accounting subsidiaries.
As the Group applies the investment entity exception available under IFRS 10, these investee companies are classified as investment entity subsidiaries.
The Companies Act 2006 requires disclosure of certain information about the Groups related undertakings.
