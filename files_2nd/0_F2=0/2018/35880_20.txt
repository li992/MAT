a Basis of accounting The Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, except for the measurement at fair value of investments and derivative instruments.
b Significant accounting estimates and judgements The Directors make judgements and estimates concerning the future.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, such as expectations of future events, and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The judgements required in order to determine the appropriate valuation methodology of level 3 financial instruments have a risk of causing an adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets.
These judgements include making assessments of the possible valuations in the event of a listing or other marketability related risks.
c Segmental reporting The Company is engaged in a single segment business and, therefore, no segmental reporting is provided.
d Presentation of the Income Statement In order to reflect better the activities of an investment company and in accordance with guidance issued by the AIC, supplementary information which analyses the Income Statement between items of a revenue and capital nature has been prepared alongside the Income Statement.
The net revenue return after taxation for the year is the measure the Directors believe appropriate in assessing the Companys compliance with certain requirements set out in Section 1159 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010. e Income Income from equity investments is accounted for on the date on which the right to receive the payment is established, normally the ex-dividend date.
Overseas dividends are accounted for gross of any tax deducted at source.
Amounts are credited to the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised in the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in the capital column of the Income Statement.
Special dividends are treated as a revenue receipt or a capital receipt depending on the facts and circumstances of each particular case.
Debt security interest is accounted for on an accruals basis and is credited to the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Derivative instrument income received from dividends on long contracts for difference CFDs and derivative expenses paid as dividends on short CFDs are accounted for on the date on which the right to receive or make the payment is established, normally the ex-dividend date.

i Taxation The taxation charge represents the sum of current taxation and deferred taxation.
Current taxation is taxation suffered at source on overseas income less amounts recoverable under taxation treaties.
Taxation is charged or credited to the revenue column of the Income Statement, except where it relates to items of a capital nature, in which case it is charged or credited to the capital column of the Income Statement.
Where expenses are allocated between revenue and capital any tax relief in respect of the expenses is allocated between revenue and capital returns on the marginal basis using the Companys effective rate of corporation tax for the accounting period.
The Company is an approved Investment Trust under Section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 and is not liable for UK taxation on capital gains.
Deferred taxation is the taxation expected to be payable or recoverable on timing differences between the treatment of certain items for accounting purposes and their treatment for the purposes of computing taxable profits.
Deferred taxation is based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted when the taxation is expected to be payable or recoverable.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be sufficient future taxable profits to utilise them.
j Dividend paid Dividends payable to equity Shareholders are recognised when the Companys obligation to make payment is established.
k Investments The Companys business is investing in financial instruments with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of investments is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy, and information about the portfolio is provided on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors.
Investments are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss, in accordance with the provisions of both Section 11 and Section 12 of FRS 102.
The fair value of investments is initially taken to be their cost and is subsequently measured as follows: Listed investments are valued at bid prices, or last market prices, depending on the convention of the exchange on which they are listed: and Unlisted investments are investments which are not quoted, or are not frequently traded, and are stated at the Directors best estimate of fair value.
The Managers Fair Value Committee, which is independent of the portfolio management team, provides a recommendation of fair values to the Directors based on recognised valuation techniques that take account of the cost of the investment, recent arms length transactions in the same or similar investments and financial performance of the investment sincepurchase.
In accordance with the AIC SORP, the Company includes transaction costs, incidental to the purchase or sale of investments, within gains on investments in the capital column of the Income Statement and has disclosed these costs in Note 10. l Derivative instruments When appropriate, permitted transactions in derivative instruments are used.
Derivative transactions into which the Company may enter include long and short CFDs, futures and options.
Derivatives are classified as other financial instruments and are initially accounted and measured at fair value on the date the derivative contract is entered into and subsequently measured at fair value as follows: Long and short CFDs the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying shares in the contract: Futures the difference between contract price and the quoted trade price: and Options the quoted trade price or the recent transaction price for the contract.
INFORMATION FOR SHAREHOLDERS FINANCIAL GOVERNANCE STRATEGY 50 | Fidelity Special Values PLC Annual Report 2018 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2 Accounting Policies continued Derivative instruments continued Where transactions are used to protect or enhance income, if the circumstances support this, the income and expenses derived are included in net income in the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Where such transactions are used to protect or enhance capital, if the circumstances support this, the income and expenses derived are included: for long CFDs, as gains or losses on long CFDs, and for short CFDs, futures and options as gains or losses on short CFDs, futures and options in the capital column of the Income Statement.
Any positions on such transactions open at the year end are reflected on the Balance Sheet at their fair value within current assets or creditors.
m Debtors Debtors include securities sold for future settlement, accrued income, taxation recoverable and other debtors incurred in the ordinary course of business.
If collection is expected in one year or less or in the normal operating cycle of the business, if longer they are classified as current assets.
If not, they are presented as non-current assets.
They are recognised initially at fair value and, where applicable, subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
n Amounts held at futures clearing houses and brokers These are amounts held in segregated accounts as collateral on behalf of brokers and are carried at amortised cost.
o Fidelity Institutional Liquidity Fund plc The Company holds an investment in the Fidelity Institutional Liquidity Fund plc, a short term money market fund investing in a diversified range of short term instruments.
It is a distributing fund and accordingly the interest earned is credited to the revenue column of the Income Statement.
p Other creditors Other creditors include securities purchased for future settlement, investment management fees and other creditors and expenses accrued in the ordinary course of business.
If payment is due within one year or less or in the normal operating cycle of the business, if longer they are classified as current liabilities.
If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
q Capital reserve The following are accounted for in the capital reserve: Gains and losses on the disposal of investments and derivative instruments: Changes in the fair value of investments and derivative instruments held at the year end: Foreign exchange gains and losses of a capital nature: Dividends receivable which are capital in nature: and Costs of repurchasing or issuing ordinary shares.
As a result of technical guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales in TECH 02 10: Guidance on the determination of realised profits and losses in the context of distributions under the Companies Act 2006, changes in the fair value of investments which are readily convertible to cash, without accepting adverse terms at the Balance Sheet date, can be treated as realised.
Capital reserves realised and unrealised are shown in aggregate as capital reserve in the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Balance Sheet.
At the Balance Sheet date the portfolio of the Company consisted of: investments listed on a recognised stock exchange and derivative instruments, contracted with counterparties having an adequate credit rating, and the portfolio was considered to be readily convertible to cash, with the exception of the level 3 investments which had unrealised investment holding losses of 594,000 2017: gains 895,000.

INFORMATION FOR SHAREHOLDERS FINANCIAL GOVERNANCE STRATEGY 58 | Fidelity Special Values PLC Annual Report 2018 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 1 7 Financial Instruments and Risk Management Management of risk The Companys investing activities in pursuit of its investment objective involve certain inherent risks.
The Board confirms that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the risks faced by the Company.
The Board with the assistance of the Manager, has developed a risk matrix which, as part of the internal control process, identifies the risks that the Company faces.
Principal risks identified are market, share price, discount control, regulatory, cybercrime and investment management risks.
Other risks identified are operational risks, including those relating to third party service providers covering investment management, marketing and business development, company secretarial, fund administration and operations and support functions.
Risks are identified and graded in this process, together with steps taken in mitigation, and are updated and reviewed on an ongoing basis.
These risks and how they are identified, evaluated and managed are shown in the Strategic Report on pages 11 and 12.
This note refers to the identification, measurement and management of risks potentially affecting the value of financial instruments.
The Companys financial instruments may comprise: Equity shares and bonds held in accordance with the Companys investment objective and policies: Derivative instruments which comprise CFDs, options and futures on listed stocks and equity indices: and Cash, liquid resources and short term debtors and creditors that arise from its operations.
The risks identified arising from the Companys financial instruments are market price risk which comprises interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and other price risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk, credit risk and derivative instrument risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
These policies are consistent with those followed last year.
Market price risk Interest rate risk The Company finances its operations through its share capital and reserves.
In addition, the Company has gearing through the use of derivative instruments.
The Board imposes limits to ensure gearing levels are appropriate.
The Company is exposed to a financial risk arising as a result of any increases in interest rates associated with the funding of the derivative instruments.
Interest rate risk exposure The values of the Companys financial instruments that are exposed to movements in interest rates are shown below: 201 8 2017 000 000 Exposure to financial instruments that bear interest Long CFDs exposure less fair value 1 25,733 90,699 Exposure to financial instruments that earn interest Short CFDs exposure plus fair value 1 4,003 22,916 Amounts held at futures clearing houses and brokers 2,235 1,386 Fidelity Institutional Liquidity Fund 1 4,588 11,796 Cash at bank 2,303 1,969 33,1 29 38,067 Net exposure to financial instruments that bear interest 92,604 52,632 59 | Annual Report 2018 Fidelity Special Values PLC 1 7 Financial Instruments and Risk Management continued Foreign currency risk The Company does not carry out currency speculation.
The Companys net return on ordinary activities after taxation for the year and its net assets can be affected by foreign exchange movements because the Company has income and assets which are denominated in currencies other than the Companys functional currency which is UK sterling.
The Company can also be subject to short term exposure from exchange rate movements, for example, between the date when an investment is purchased or sold and the date when settlement of the transaction occurs.
Three principal areas have been identified where foreign currency risk could impact the Company: Movements in exchange rates affecting the value of investments and derivative instruments: Movements in exchange rates affecting short term timing differences: and Movements in exchange rates affecting income received.
Currency exposure of financial assets The currency exposure profile of the Companys financial assets is shown below: 201 8 long investments exposure to at fair derivative cash at 1 2 value instruments debtors bank total Currency 000 000 000 000 000 Euro 69,730 64,465 1 77 1 34,372 US dollar 73,31 6 4,684 39 78,039 Canadian dollar 8,390 8,390 Swiss franc 7,563 7,563 Other foreign currencies 7,286 1 1 8 7,404 UK sterling 545,998 9,685 1 5,887 2,264 573,834 704,997 81,436 20,866 2,303 809,602 2017 long investments exposure to at fair derivative cash at 1 2 value instruments debtors bank total Currency 000 000 000 000 000 Euro 61,847 47,954 93 36 109,930 US dollar 76,095 11,790 15 87,900 Canadian dollar 7,918 203 8,121 Other foreign currencies 2,481 200 2,681 UK sterling 508,112 2,629 5,842 1,918 518,501 653,972 53,267 17,925 1,969 727,133 1 The exposure to the market of long CFDs and options after the netting of hedging exposures.

The Companys financial liabilities comprise short positions on derivative instruments and other creditors.

Other price risk Other price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Companys business.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
The Board meets quarterly to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors within the parameters of the investment objective.
The Portfolio Manager is responsible for actively monitoring the existing portfolio selected in accordance with the overall asset allocation parameters described above and seeks to ensure that individual stocks also meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Other price risks arising from derivative positions, mainly due to the underlying exposures, are estimated using Value at Risk and Stress Tests as set out in the Companys internal Derivative Risk Measurement and Management Document.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulties in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
The Companys assets mainly comprise readily realisable securities and derivative instruments which can be sold easily to meet funding commitments if necessary.
Short term flexibility is achieved by the use of a bank overdraft, if required.
Liquidity risk exposure The remaining undiscounted gross cash outflows of the financial liabilities were all repayable within one year and consisted of derivative instrument liabilities of 5,371,000 2017: 9,003,000 and other creditors of 2,764,000 2017: 2,039,000.
61 | Annual Report 2018 Fidelity Special Values PLC 1 7 Financial Instruments and Risk Management continued Counterparty risk Certain derivative instruments in which the Company may invest are not traded on an exchange but instead will be traded between counterparties based on contractual relationships, under the terms outlined in the International Swaps and Derivatives Associations ISDA market standard derivative legal documentation.
As a result the Company is subject to the risk that a counterparty may not perform its obligations under the related contract.
In accordance with the risk management process which the Manager employs, the Manager will seek to minimise such risk by only entering into transactions with counterparties which are believed to have an adequate credit rating at the time the transaction is entered into, by ensuring that formal legal agreements covering the terms of the contract are entered into in advance, and through adopting a counterparty risk framework which measures, monitors and manages counterparty risk by the use of internal and external credit agency ratings and by evaluating derivative instrument credit risk exposure.
For Over the Counter OTC derivative transactions, collateral is used to reduce the risk of both parties to the contract.
Collateral is managed on a daily basis for all relevant transactions.
At 31 August 2018 8,451,000 2017: 5,417,000 was held by the brokers in cash in a segregated collateral account on behalf of the Company, to reduce the credit risk exposure of the Company.
This collateral comprised of: DeutscheBank AG 1,270,000 2017: nil held in cash denominated in Euros, HSBC Bank Plc 185,000 2017:nil held in cash denominated in UK sterling, and UBSAG 6,996,000 2017: 5,417,000 held in cash denominated in US dollars.
2,235,000 2017: 1,386,000, shown as amounts held at futures clearing houses and brokers on the Balance Sheet was held by the Company, ina segregated collateral account, on behalf of the brokers, to reduce the credit risk exposure of the brokers.
This collateral comprised of: Goldman Sachs International Ltd 1,600,000 in cash and UBS AG 635,000 in cash 2017: 1,386,000 held atJPMorganChase Bank.
Credit risk Financial instruments may be adversely affected if any of the institutions with which money is deposited suffer insolvency or other financial difficulties.
All transactions are carried out with brokers that have been approved by the Manager and are settled on a delivery versus payment basis.
Limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker and are kept under review by the Manager.
Exposure to credit risk arises on unsettled security transactions and derivative instrument contracts and cash at bank.
Derivative instruments risk The risks and risk management processes which result from the use of derivative instruments are set out in a documented Derivative Risk Measurement and Management Document.
Derivative instruments are used by the Manager for the following purposes: To gain unfunded long exposure to equity markets, sectors or single stocks.
Unfunded exposure is exposure gained without an initial flow of capital: To hedge equity market risk using derivatives with the intention of at least partially mitigating losses in the exposures of the Companys portfolio as a result of falls in the equity market: To position short exposures in the Companys portfolio.
These uncovered exposures benefit from falls in the prices of shares which the Portfolio Manager believes to be over valued.
These positions, therefore, distinguish themselves from other short exposures held for hedging purposes since they are expected to add risk to the portfolio.
RISK SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis Based on the financial instruments held and interest rates at 31 August 2018, an increase of 0.25% in interest rates throughout the year, with all other variables held constant, would have decreased the return on ordinary activities after taxation for the year and decreased the net assets of the Company by 232,000 2017: 132,000.
A decrease of 0.25% in interest rates throughout the year would have had an equal but opposite effect.
Foreign currency risk sensitivity analysis Based on the financial instruments held and currency exchange rates at 31 August 2018, a 10% strengthening of the UK sterling exchange rate against foreign currencies, with all other variables held constant, would have decreased the Companys net return on ordinary activities after taxation for the year and decreased the Companys net assets by 20,516,000 2017: 17,232,000.
A 10% weakening of the UK sterling exchange rate against foreign currencies would have increased the Companys net return on ordinary activities after taxation for the year and increased the Companys net assets by 25,076,000 2017: 21,062,000.
Other price risk exposure to investments sensitivity analysis Based on the investments held and share prices at 31 August 2018, an increase of 10% in share prices, with all other variables held constant, would have increased the Companys net return on ordinary activities after taxation for the year and increased the net assets of the Company by 70,500,000 2017: 65,397,000.
A decrease of 10% in share prices would have had an equal and opposite effect.
