Notes on the accounts for the year ended 31st March 2018 31 Financial risk management continued 31g Capital management The group's policy for managing capital is to maintain an efficient balance sheet to ensure that the group always has sufficient resources to be able to invest in future growth.
The group has a long term target of a return on invested capital underlying operating profit divided by average capital employed over the year of 20% to ensure focus on efficient use of the group's capital.
See the section on return on invested capital in the Financial Review.
The group also has a long term target of net debt including post tax pension deficits to EBITDA of between 1.5 and 2.0 times, although in any given year it may fall outside this range depending on future plans.
See the section on capital structure in the Financial Review.
Net debt including post-tax pension deficits is reduced for the quoted bonds purchased to fund the UK pension deficit.
Since the UK pension plan is in surplus, the pension deficits do not include the UK plan and, therefore, an amendment has been made to the definition of net debt including post-tax pension deficits to reduce it for these bonds net of the related deferred tax only when the UK pension plan is in deficit.

The warranty and technology provisions represent managements best estimate of the groups liability under warranties granted and remedial work required under technology licences, based on past experience in Clean Air, Efficient Natural Resources and New Markets.
Warranties generally cover a period of up to three years.
The other provisions include environmental, onerous contract and legal provisions arising across the group.
Amounts provided reflect management's best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligations at the balance sheet date.
They are expected to be fully utilised within the next 15 years.
The group has recognised a charge in connection with the resolution of a contract dispute lawsuit related to a component supplied by the group in the US note 6.
At 31st March 2018, there is a provision of 18 million in respect of this settlement agreement which is estimated to be fully utilised over the next two years.
32b Group contingent liabilities Johnson Matthey has been informed of failures in certain engine systems for which the group supplied a particular coated substrate as a component for emissions after-treatment.
The extent to which, if any, the reported failures are due to the coated substrate supplied by Johnson Matthey group companies has not been demonstrated.
Potential solutions for the reported engine system issues and any associated costs have not yet been notified to the group.
Johnson Matthey has not been contacted by any regulatory authority and no Johnson Matthey group company has been served with any contract dispute lawsuit, nor has any formal claim for recovery of identified costs been made at this point.
Having reviewed its contractual obligations and the information currently available to it, the group believes that were it to be served with a contract dispute lawsuit, it would have defensible warranty positions in respect of its supplies of coated substrate for the after-treatment systems in the affected engines.
If required, it will vigorously assert its available contractual protections and defences.
The outcome of any discussions is not certain, nor is the group able to make a reliable estimate of the possible financial impact at this stage, if any.
