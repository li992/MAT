There is an unrecognised deferred tax asset of 15,285,000 at 17% 2017: 11,664,000 at 17% which relates to unutilised excess expenses.
The deferred tax asset would only be recovered if the Company were to generate sufficient profits to utilise these expenses.
It is considered highly unlikely that this will occur and therefore, no deferred tax asset has been recognised.

Financial instruments Background The Companys financial instruments comprise securities and other investments, cash balances and term loans, debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations, for example, in respect of sales and purchases awaiting settlement and debtors for accrued income.
The numerical disclosures below exclude short-term debtors and creditors which are denominated in sterling and do not incur interest and therefore are not subject to foreign currency risk or interest rate risk.
The principal risks the Company faces in its portfolio management activities are: foreign currency risk market price risk i. e. movements in the value of investment holdings caused by factors other than interest rate or currency movement interest rate risk liquidity risk credit and counterparty risk The Investment Advisers policies for managing these risks are summarised in the following paragraph and have been applied throughout the year.
a Foreign currency risk A por tion of the financial assets of the Company are denominated in currencies other than sterling with the result that the Statement of Financial Position and Comprehensive Income can be significantly affected by currency movements.
The Compan y may hedge against foreign currency movements affecting the value of the investment portfolio where adverse movements are anticipated but otherwise takes account of this risk when making investment decisions.
F oreign currency sensitivity The f ollowing tables illustrate the sensitivity of the profit after tax for the year and net assets to exchange rates for the against the Euro, Danish Krone, Swiss Franc, Norwegian Krone and Swedish Krona.
It assumes the following changes in exchange rates: Euro 5% 2017: 10% Danish Krone 5% 2017: 10% Swiss F ranc 5% 2017: 15% Norwegian Krone 10% 2017: 15% Swedish Krona 10% 2017: 10%.
This percenta ge has been determined based on market volatility in exchange rates over the previous twelve months.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys foreign currency financial instruments held at the date of each Statement of Financial Position.
If sterling had weakened against the currencies below this would have the following effect on revenue, capital, total return and, accordingly, net assets: 2018 2017 Impact on Impact on Impact on Impact on revenue capital revenue capital return return Total return return Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Euro 240 31,997 31,757 329 43,877 43,548 Danish Krone 28 3,737 3,709 64 8,528 8,464 Norwegian Krone 13 1,693 1,680 14 1,890 1,876 Swedish Krona 1 188 187 13 1,761 1,748 Swiss Franc 5 723 718 282 37,615 37,333 425 56,779 56,354 43 43 JUPITER EUROPEAN OPPORTUNITIES TRUST PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2018 Accounts continued Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31 May 2018 continued 14.
Financial instruments continued If sterling had strengthened against the currencies below this would have the following effect: 2018 2017 Impact on Impact on Impact on Impact on revenue capital revenue capital return return Total return return Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Euro 240 31,997 31,757 329 43,877 43,548 Danish Krone 28 3,737 3,709 64 8,528 8,464 Norwegian Krone 13 1,693 1,680 14 1,890 1,876 Swedish Krona 1 188 187 13 1,761 1,748 Swiss Franc 5 723 718 282 37,615 37,333 425 56,779 56,354 b Market price risk By the v ery nature of its activities, the Companys investments are exposed to market price fluctuations.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing this risk.
The Investment Adviser assesses the exposure to market price risk when making each investment decision, and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
Further information on the investment portfolio and investment policy is set out in the Investment Advisers Review.
Other price risk sensitivity The f ollowing illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after taxation for the year and the total equity to an increase or decrease of 20% 2017: 20% in the fair value of the Companys equities.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of market conditions during the year.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys equities at each Statement of Financial Position date, with all other variables held constant.
The impact of a 20% increase in the value of investments on the revenue return as at 31 May 2018 is a decrease of 348,000 2017: Decrease 320,000 and on the capital return is an increase of 157,658,000 2017: Increase 149,805,000.
The impact of a 20% fall in the value of investments on the revenue return as at 31 May 2018 is an increase of 348,000 2017: Increase 320,000 and on the capital return is a decrease of 172,267,000 2017: 170,553,000. c Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect: the fair value of investments of any fixed interest securities: the level of income receivable from any floating interest-bearing securities and cash at bank and on deposit: and the interest payable on the Companys floating interest term loans.
The Board re views regularly the values of the Companys fixed interest rate securities.
The Board imposes limits on the Companys borrowing to ensure gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions, and these are monitored and reviewed on a regular basis.
The Companys borrowings are conducted through a fixed rate facility, which allows the Investment Manager to finance opportunities at competitive rates.
Interest Rate Sensitivity As interest r ates for any short term loans are fixed at the commencement of the loan, only cash at call are subject to interest rate movements.
All such deposits at call, earn interest at daily rate.
Therefore, if a sensitivity analysis was performed by increasing or decreasing the interest rates applicable to the Companys cash balances held at each reporting date, with all other variables held constant, there would be no material change to the profit after taxation or net assets for the year.

Sterling cash deposits at call earn interest at floating rates based on daily Sterling Overnight Index Average SONIA rates.
The non-interest bearing assets represent the equity element of the investment portfolio at 31 May 2018.
However, the amounts are not representative of the exposure to foreign currency risk during the year as levels of monetary foreign currency exposure change significantly throughout the year.

Financial instruments continued d Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is not considered significant.
All liabilities are payable within three months.
The Compan ys assets comprise mainly readily realisable securities which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.
Shortterm flexibility is achieved through the use of short-term borrowings.
e Credit and counterparty risk Credit risk is the e xposure to loss from the failure of a counterparty to deliver securities or cash for acquisitions or disposals of investments or to repay deposits.
The Company manages credit risk by using brokers from a database of approved brokers who have undergone rigorous due diligence tests by the Managers Risk Management Team and by dealing through Jupiter Asset Management Limited with banks approved by the Financial Conduct Authority.
Any derivative positions are marked to market and exposure to counterparties is monitored on a daily basis by the Manager: the Board of Directors reviews it on a quarterly basis.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 May 2018 was 21,682,000 consisting of short term debtors and cash and cash equivalents 2017: 62,623,000.
The calculation is based on the Companys credit exposure as at 31 May 2018 and may not be representative of the year as a whole.
There are no financial assets that are either past due or impared.
f Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities The financial assets and financial lia bilities are carried in the statement of financial position at their fair value or the statement amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value due from brokers, dividends and interest receivable, due to brokers, accruals, short term bank loans and cash at bank.
F air value hierarchy IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement requires an entity to classify fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
The fair value hierarchy shall have the following levels: Level 1 reflects financial instruments quoted in an active market.
Le vel 2 reflects financial instruments whose fair value is evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument or based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable markets.
Le vel 3 reflects financial instruments whose fair value is determined in whole or in part using a valuation technique based on assumptions that are not supported by prices from observable market transactions in the same instrument and not based on available observable market data.
The financial assets measured at fair value in the statement of financial position are grouped into the fair value hierarchy as follows: 2018 2017 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Investments 926,757 926,757 852,763 852,763 g Use of derivatives In order to enhance returns, the Company may take short positions using contracts for difference in respect of a small number of larger capital securities.

Financial instruments continued h Capital management policies and procedures The Board with the assistance of the Investment Adviser monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Companys capital on an ongoing basis.
This review includes: the planned le vel of gearing, which takes into account the Investment Advisers view on the market: the need to buy back equity shares, either for cancellation or to hold in treasury, which takes account of the difference between the Net Asset Value per share and the share price i. e. the level of share price discount or premium : the need f or new issues of equity shares, including shares from treasury: and the e xtent to which revenue in excess of that which is required to be distributed should be retained.
The Compan ys objectives, policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from the preceding accounting period.
The Compan y is subject to several externally imposed capital requirements: The value of any short-term loans must be supported by a level of readily realisable assets.
As a public company, the Company has a minimum share capital of 50,000.
In order to be able to pay dividends out of profits available for distribution, the Company has to be able to meet one of the two capital restriction tests imposed on investment companies by company law.
These requirements are unc hanged since last year, and the Company has complied with them.
