Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information SECTION 2: FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE The financial performance section gives further information about the items in the Consolidated income statement.
It includes a summary of financial performance by each of the Groups businesses note 2.1, analysis of certain income statement items notes 2.22.6 and information regarding the Adjusted and Total Results, distributable profits and dividends notes 2.72.10.
Further commentary on the Groups trading and operational performance during the year, which is predominantly reflected in Adjusted EBITDA, can be found in the Strategic report on pages 1 to 49, with particular reference to key transactions and market conditions that have affected the results.
2.1 SEGMENTAL REPORTING The Group is organised into three businesses, with a dedicated management team for each and a central corporate office providing certain specialist and shared functions.
Our businesses are: Power Generation: power generation activities in the UK: Pellet Production: production of sustainable compressed wood pellets at our processing facilities in the US: and B2B Energy Supply: supply of electricity and gas to business customers in the UK.
The generation assets acquired from ScottishPower will form part of the Power Generation segment.
No profit or loss has been recognised in respect of these assets in 2018 as the assets were acquired at 23:59 on 31 December 2018.
The operating segments are consistent with the prior year.
Each business is an operating segment for the purpose of segmental reporting.
Information reported to the Board for the purposes of assessing performance and making investment decisions is based on these three operating segments.
The measure of profit or loss for each reportable segment presented to the Board on a regular basis is Adjusted EBITDA as defined on page 116.
Operating costs are allocated to segments to the extent they are directly attributable to the activities of that segment.
Corporate office costs are included within central costs.
Segment revenues and results The following is an analysis of the Groups performance by reporting segment for the year ended 31 December 2018.
The Board monitors the Adjusted Results for the Group by operating segment as presented in the tables below: Year ended 31 December 2018 Exceptional items and certain Power B2B Energy Pellet Intra-group Adjusted remeasureTotal Generation Supply Production eliminations Results ments Results m m m m m m m Revenue External sales 1,994.9 2,242.4 4,237.3 8.3 4,229.0 Inter-segment sales 1,336.7 213.7 1,550.4 Total revenue 3,331.6 2,242.4 213.7 1,550.4 4,237.3 8.3 4,229.0 Segment gross profit 396.0 143.4 65.1 3.5 601.0 38.4 639.4 Segment Adjusted EBITDA 232.4 28.2 20.8 3.5 277.9 Central costs 28.3 Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA 249.6 Acquisition and restructuring costs 27.7 27.7 Depreciation and amortisation 173.8 26.8 200.6 Losses on disposals 3.9 3.9 Other gains 4.1 4.1 Operating profit 76.0 16.1 59.9 Net finance costs 39.2 7.2 46.4 Foreign exchange gains 0.3 0.3 Profit before tax 37.1 23.3 13.8 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 123 SECTION 2: FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE continued 2.1 SEGMENTAL REPORTING continued The following is an analysis of the Groups performance by reporting segment for the year ended 31 December 2017 restated due to the initial application of IFRS 9, see note 8.3 : Year ended 31 December 2017 Restated Exceptional items and certain Power B2B Energy Pellet Intra-group Adjusted remeasureTotal Generation Supply Production eliminations Results ments Results m m m m m m m Revenue External sales 1,686.2 1,999.0 3,685.2 0.9 3,684.3 Inter-segment sales 1,033.4 135.7 1,169.1 Total revenue 2,719.6 1,999.0 135.7 1,169.1 3,685.2 0.9 3,684.3 Segment gross profit 398.4 117.4 39.0 9.8 545.0 176.9 368.1 Segment Adjusted EBITDA 237.5 29.4 5.5 9.8 262.6 Central costs 33.7 Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA 228.9 Acquisition and restructuring costs 7.8 7.8 Depreciation and amortisation 166.3 166.3 Other losses 0.4 0.4 Loss on disposal 15.4 15.4 Operating profit loss 46.8 184.7 137.9 Net finance costs 31.3 24.2 55.5 Foreign exchange losses 10.6 10.6 Profit loss before tax 4.9 208.9 204.0 The accounting policies applied for the purpose of measuring the segments profits or losses, assets and liabilities are the same as those used in measuring the corresponding amounts in the Groups financial statements.
The external revenues and results of all the reporting segments are subject to seasonality, with higher dispatch and prices in the winter months compared to summer months.
Capital expenditure by segment Assets and working capital are monitored on a consolidated basis: however, spend on capital projects is monitored by operating segment.

Key capital investments in the year include the conversion of the fourth unit at Drax Power Station to run on biomass fuel and preparatory work for the repowering of the fifth and sixth units to gas Power Generation : investment in digital transformation in the B2B Energy Supply segment: and expansion projects in the Pellet Production segment.
The prior year includes 48 million for the purchase of the LaSalle Bioenergy pellet plant.

During 2018, the Pellet Production segment sold wood pellets with a total value of 213.7 million 2017: 135.7 million to the Power Generation segment and the Power Generation segment sold electricity, gas and ROCs with a total value of 1,336.7 million 2017: 1,033.4 million to the B2B Energy Supply segment.
The impact of all intra-group transactions, including any unrealised profit arising, is eliminated on consolidation.
Major customers Total consolidated revenue for the year ended 31 December 2018 includes 555.8 million from one individual customer 2017: no amounts from any individual customer that represented 10% or more of total revenue for the year.
These revenues arose in the Power Generation segment.
2.2 REVENUE Accounting policy The Group has adopted IFRS 15 for the first time in 2018.
The accounting policies have been updated, however the amount and timing of revenue recognition in the Groups financial statements is unchanged see note 8.3.
Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods or services provided to customers in the normal course of business, net of trade discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes and excluding transactions between Group companies.
Revenues from the sale of electricity by our Power Generation business are measured based upon metered output delivered at rates specified under contract terms or prevailing market rates as applicable.
Following conversion of the fourth unit in July 2018, three biomass-fuelled generating units at Drax Power Station earn Renewable Obligation Certificates ROCs under the UK Governments Renewables Obligation RO regime.
The financial benefit of a ROC is recognised in the income statement at the point the relevant renewable biomass fuel is burnt and power dispatched as a reduction in the cost of the biomass fuel.
A corresponding asset is recognised on the balance sheet see note 3.3.
Revenue from sale of ROCs is recognised when the ROC is transferred to a third party.
The Group recognises the income or costs arising from the CfD see below in the income statement as a component of revenue at the point the Group meets its performance obligation under the CfD contract.
This is considered to be the point at which the relevant generation is delivered and the payment becomes contractually due.
Revenue from the sale of electricity and gas directly to business customers through the B2B Energy Supply business is recognised on the supply of electricity or gas when a contract exists, supply has taken place, a quantifiable price has been established or can be determined and the receivables are expected to be recovered at the point of sale.
Energy supplied is measured based upon metered consumption and contractual rates: however, where a supply has taken place but is not yet measured or billed, the revenue is estimated based on consumption statistics and selling price estimates and is recognised as accrued income.
Revenue for contracts satisfied over time is recognised in line with the progress of those contracts.
The measurement of progress is based on cost inputs for fixed price B2B Energy Supply contracts, and volume supplied for other contracts.
Assumptions are applied consistently but third party costs can be variable, therefore actual outcomes may vary from initial estimates.
The Group is eligible for, and therefore applies, the practical expedient available in IFRS 15 and has not disclosed information related to the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations.
The right to receive consideration from a customer is at an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Groups performance completed to date.
Other revenues derived from the provision of services to National Grid for example, the supply of system support services are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contractual performance obligations.
Most such contracts are for the delivery of a service either continually or on an ad-hoc basis over a period of time and thus stage of completion is calculated by reference to the amount of the contract term that has elapsed.
Depending on the contract terms this approach may require judgement in estimating probable future outcomes.
Other revenues derived from the sale of goods for example, by-products from electricity generation such as ash and gypsum are recognised at the point the control of the goods is transferred to the customer, typically at the point of delivery to the customers premises.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 125 SECTION 2: FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE continued 2.2 REVENUE continued CfD payments The Group is party to a Contract for Difference CfD with the Low Carbon Contracts Company LCCC, a Government-owned entity responsible for delivering elements of the Governments Electricity Market Reform Programme.
Under the contract, the Group makes or receives payments in respect of electricity dispatched from a specific biomass-fuelled generating unit.
The payment is calculated by reference to a strike price of 100 per MWh.
The base year for the strike price was 2012 and it increases each year in line with the UK Consumer Price Index and changes in system balancing costs.
The strike price at 31 December 2018 was 111 per MWh.
When market prices at the point of generation are above below the strike price, the Group makes receives an additional payment to from LCCC equivalent to the difference between the market power price at the point of dispatch and the strike price.
Such payments are in addition to amounts received from the sale of the power in the wholesale market and either increase or limit the total income from the power dispatched from the relevant generating unit to the strike price in the CfD contract.
ROC sales The generation and sale of ROCs is a key driver of the Groups financial performance.
The RO scheme places an obligation on electricity suppliers to source an increasing proportion of their electricity from renewable sources.
Under the RO, ROCs are certificates issued to generators of renewable electricity which are then sold to bilateral counterparties, including suppliers to demonstrate that they have fulfilled their obligations under the RO.
ROCs are managed in compliance periods CPs, running from April to March annually, CP1 commenced in April 2002.
To meet its obligations a supplier can either submit ROCs or pay the buy-out price at the end of the CP.
The buy-out price was set at 30 per ROC in CP1 and rises with inflation.
ROCs are typically procured in arms-length transactions with renewable generators at a market price typically slightly lower than the buy-out price for that CP.
At the end of the CP, the amounts collected from suppliers paying the buy-out price form the recycle fund, which is distributed on a pro-rata basis to ROC generators.
The financial benefit of a ROC recognised in the income statement at the point of generation is thus comprised of two parts: the expected value to be obtained in a sale transaction with a third party supplier and the expected recycle fund benefit to be received at the end of the CP.
During the year, the Group made sales and related purchases of ROCs to help optimise our working capital position.
External sales of ROCs in the table below include 555.8 million of such sales 2017: 201.2 million, with a similar value reflected in cost of sales.
See note 3.3 for further details of ROCs generated and sold by the Power Generation business and those utilised by the B2B Energy Supply business in the year.

2.4 REVIEW OF FIXED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT Accounting policy The Group reviews its fixed assets or, where appropriate, groups of assets known as cash-generating units CGUs whenever there is an indication that an impairment loss may have been suffered.
The Group assesses the existence of indicators of impairment annually.
The Group considers the smallest collections of assets that generate independent cash flows to be its operating entities Drax Power, Haven Power, Opus Energy, Drax Biomass and the OCGTs and accordingly considers the Group to be comprised of five CGUs.
The assets of the Acquired Generation Business have been recognised on the Groups Consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2018 at fair value see note 5.1.
These assets are therefore not included in the impairment review at 31 December 2018.
If an indication of potential impairment exists, the recoverable amount of the asset or CGU in question is assessed with reference to the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the continuing use of the asset or CGU value in use or the expected price that would be received to sell the asset to another market participant fair value less costs to sell.
The initial assessment of recoverable amount is normally based on value in use.
Where value in use is calculated, the assessment of future cash flows is based on the most recent approved business plan and includes all of the necessary costs expected to be incurred to generate the cash inflows from the CGUs assets in their current state and condition, including an allocation of centrally managed costs.
Central costs are only allocated where they are necessary for and directly attributable to the CGUs activities.
Future cash flows include, where relevant, contracted cash flows arising from our cash flow hedging activities and as a result the carrying amount of each CGU includes the mark-to-market value of those cash flow hedges.
The additional value that could be obtained from enhancing or converting the Groups assets is not reflected, nor the potential benefit of any future restructuring or reorganisation.
In determining value in use, the estimate of future cash flows is discounted to present value using a pre-tax rate reflecting the specific risks attributable to the CGU in question.
If the recoverable amount is less than the current carrying amount in the financial statements, a provision is made to reduce the carrying amount of the asset or CGU to the estimated recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Goodwill balances and intangible assets with an indefinite useful economic life are assessed for impairment annually see note 5.2 and 5.3.
128 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information 2.4 REVIEW OF FIXED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT continued Assessment of indicators of impairment A review of the Groups CGUs did not give rise to any indicators of impairment.
Accordingly no detailed impairment calculation has been completed for CGUs where no goodwill is allocated Drax Power and Drax Biomass.
The review considered the effect on previously calculated headroom of movements in market prices for commodities and changes in foreign exchange rates.
The review also considered the impact of the recent suspension in Capacity Market payments.
The Groups core planning assumption reflects the belief that the UK electricity market needs a capacity mechanism to ensure continuity of supply and that the Capacity Market will be reinstated during 2019.
As a result, estimates of future cash flows are not materially affected by the current suspension.
Separate consideration has been given to the impact on the OCGT development assets, see note 5.3.
2.5 NET FINANCE COSTS Finance costs reflect expenses incurred in managing our debt structure such as interest payable on our bonds as well as foreign exchange gains and losses, the unwinding of discount on provisions for reinstatement of our sites at the end of their useful lives see note 5.4 and net interest charged on the Groups defined benefit pension scheme obligation see note 6.3.
These are offset by interest income that the Group generates through efficient use of short-term cash surpluses for example through investment in money market funds.
On 26 April 2018, the Group issued loan notes of USD $300 million, listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.
The proceeds of the issue were used to repay in full the 200 million floating rate loan notes issued in 2017.
Incremental costs of the new borrowing 3.8 million have been deferred and are being amortised over the period to maturity of the debt instrument.
Deferred costs of 5.2 million in relation to the floating rate notes have been written off in the period, in addition to an early repayment charge of 2.0 million 2017: deferred costs of 10.4 million and early repayment charges of 13.8 million in relation to the refinancing of the Groups previous debt structure.
As described in note 2.7, these costs have been excluded from the Adjusted Results and are presented as exceptional items in arriving at Total Results.
Further information about the Groups financing structure can be found in note 4.3.

Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 129 SECTION 2: FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE continued 2.6 CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAXATION The tax charge includes both current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the estimated amount of tax payable on this years taxable profits which are adjusted for items upon which the Group is not required to pay tax or, in some cases, for items which are not allowable for tax purposes and therefore on which additional tax is required and adjusted for estimates for previous years.
Deferred tax is an accounting adjustment which reflects where more or less tax is expected to arise in the future due to differences between the accounting and tax rules.
This is reflected in differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profits.
The tax credit reflects the estimated effective tax rate on the loss before tax for the Group for the year ended 31 December 2018 and the movement in the deferred tax balance in the year, so far as it relates to items recognised in the income statement.
Accounting policy Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is based on the taxable profit or loss for the year in the relevant jurisdiction.
Taxable profit or loss differs from profit loss before tax as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expenditure that are either taxable or deductible in other years or never taxable deductible.
The Groups liability or asset for current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the current and deferred tax are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.
Significant estimation uncertainty In accounting for taxation the Group makes assumptions regarding the treatment of items of income and expenditure for tax purposes.
The Group believes that these assumptions are reasonable based on prior experience and consultation with advisers.
Full provision is made for deferred taxation at the rates of tax prevailing at the period end date unless future rates have been substantively enacted.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is considered more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Where such assets relate to losses incurred by a business unit, particularly one with a history of losses, the Group seeks evidence other than its own internal forecasts to support recognition of the related deferred tax asset.

Tax for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on jurisdictional tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

Drax Power was granted a patent to protect certain intellectual property it owns and which attaches to the technology developed to manage the combustion process in generating electricity from biomass.
Under UK tax legislation the Company is now entitled to apply a lower rate of tax to some of its profits each year which are derived from utilisation of that technology.

Within the above deferred tax balances is a net deferred tax asset of 31.8 million 2017: 22.7 million in relation to start-up losses and other temporary differences in the US-based Pellet Production business.
Based on its business plan and reflecting continuing improvement in operational performance, the Group anticipates generating sufficient profits in future periods against which to utilise this asset.
2.7 CERTAIN REMEASUREMENTS AND EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS The Group reflects its underlying financial results in the Adjusted Results column of the Consolidated income statement.
In order to provide a clear and consistent view of trading performance, certain remeasurements and exceptional items are presented in a separate column.
The Group believes that this presentation provides useful information about the financial performance of the business and is consistent with the way executive management, the Board and the analysts assess the performance of the business.
The Group has a framework for the determination of transactions as exceptional.
Transactions presented as exceptional are approved by the Audit Committee.
In these financial statements, the following transactions have been designated as exceptional items and presented separately: Acquisition and restructuring costs associated with the acquisition and on-boarding of ScottishPower Generation Limited 2018 and Opus Energy Group Limited 2017 into the Group, along with costs associated with the restructuring of the Pellet Production and B2B Energy Supply businesses.
132 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information 2.7 CERTAIN REMEASUREMENTS AND EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS continued Costs incurred as a result of restructuring the Groups debt in 2018 and 2017, including facility break costs and the acceleration of the amortisation of deferred finance costs associated with the redeemed facilities.
Asset obsolescence charges relating to coal-specific assets written-off following the conversion of the fourth unit at Drax Power Station to run on biomass.
Certain remeasurements comprise gains or losses on derivative contracts to the extent that those contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting, or hedge accounting is not effective, and those gains or losses are either i unrealised and relate to the delivery of commodity contracts in future periods, or ii are realised in relation to the delivery of commodity contracts in the current period.
The effect of excluding certain remeasurements from the Adjusted Results is to reflect commodity sales and purchases at contracted prices i. e. at the all-in-hedged amount paid or received in respect of the delivery of the commodity in question, to better present the trading performance of the Group in Adjusted Results.

2.8 EARNINGS PER SHARE Earnings per share EPS represents the amount of earnings post-tax profits attributable to each ordinary share in issue.
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the Groups earnings profit after tax in accordance with IFRS by the weighted average number of ordinary shares that were in issue during the year.
Diluted EPS demonstrates the impact if all outstanding share options that are expected to vest on their future maturity dates such as those to be issued under employee share schemes see note 6.2 were exercised and treated as ordinary shares as at the balance sheet date.

Application of the same calculation to Adjusted profit after tax of 41.9 million results in Adjusted basic EPS of 10.4 pence and Adjusted diluted EPS of 10.3 pence 2017: Adjusted profit after tax of 2.7 million, Adjusted basic EPS of 0.7 pence and Adjusted diluted EPS of 0.7 pence.
Prior year EPS has been restated due to the initial application of IFRS 9, see note 8.3.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 133 SECTION 2: FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE continued 2.9 DIVIDENDS Years ended 31 December 2018 2017 m m Amounts recognised as distributions to equity holders in the year based on the number of shares in issue at the record date : Interim dividend for the year ended 31 December 2018 of 5.6 pence per share paid on 12 October 2018 2017: 4.9 pence per share paid on 4 October 2017 22.4 20.0 Final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2017 of 7.4 pence per share paid on 11 May 2018 2016: 0.4 pence per share paid on 12 May 2017 30.1 1.6 52.5 21.6 At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting the Board will recommend to shareholders that a resolution is passed to approve payment of a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2018 of 8.5 pence per share equivalent to approximately 33.6 million payable on or before 10 May 2019.
The final dividend has not been included as a liability as at 31 December 2018.
This would bring total dividends payable in respect of the 2018 financial year to 56.0 million.
In future years, if there is a build-up of capital in excess of the Groups investment needs, the Board will consider the most appropriate mechanism to return this to shareholders.
2.10 RETAINED PROFITS Retained profits are a component of equity reserves.
The overall balance reflects the total profits the Group has generated over its lifetime, reduced by the amount of that profit distributed to shareholders.
The table below sets out the movements in retained profits during the year.
Years ended 31 December 2017 2018 Restated m m At 1 January 457.9 624.0 Profit loss for the year 20.2 167.9 Actuarial gains on defined benefit pension scheme note 6.3 15.9 21.4 Deferred tax on actuarial gains on defined benefit pension scheme note 2.6 3.0 4.1 Equity dividends paid note 2.9 52.5 21.6 Gain on equity investment 0.2 Net movements in equity associated with share-based payments note 6.2 4.0 6.1 At 31 December 442.7 457.9 Distributable profits The capacity of the Group to make dividend payments is primarily determined by the availability of retained distributable profits and cash resources.
The Parent Company financial statements, set out on pages 182 to 187 of this Annual report, disclose the Parent Companys distributable reserves of 233.6 million.
Sufficient reserves are available across the Group as a whole to make future distributions in accordance with the Groups dividend policy for the foreseeable future.
The majority of the Groups distributable reserves are held in holding and operating subsidiaries.
Management actively monitors the level of distributable reserves in each company in the Group, ensuring adequate reserves are available for upcoming dividend payments and that the Parent Company has access to these reserves.
The immediate cash resources of the Group of 289.0 million are set out in note 4.2 and the recent history of cash generation within note 4.4.
The majority of these cash resources are held centrally within the Group by Drax Corporate Limited for treasury management purposes and are available for funding the working capital and other requirements of the Group.
The Groups financing facilities see note 4.3 place certain conditions on the amount of dividend payments to be made in any given year.
The Group expects to be able to make dividend payments, in line with its policy, within these conditions for the foreseeable future.
