In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any non-market based vesting conditions and no expense or investment is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest as a result of a failure to satisfy a non-market based vesting condition.
None of the Companys equity-settled transactions have any market based performance conditions.
Fair value for equity-settled share based payments is determinable from the Companys quoted share price at the time of the award.
At each balance sheet date, before vesting, the cumulative expense or investment is calculated based on managements best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest taking into consideration the likelihood of achieving non-market based vesting conditions.
Cash-settled transactions The cost of cash-settled transactions is measured at fair value.
Fair value is estimated initially at the grant date and at each balance sheet date thereafter until the awards are settled.
Market based performance conditions are taken into account when determining fair value.
At each balance sheet date, the liability recognised is based on the fair value of outstanding awards ignoring non-market based vesting conditions at the balance sheet date, the period that fell prior to the balance sheet date and managements estimate of the likelihood and extent of non-market based vesting conditions being achieved.
Changes in the carrying amount of the liability are recognised in the income statement for the period.
Fair value for cash-settled share based payments relating to the Long Term Incentive Plan is estimated by use of a simulation model.
Choice of settlement The Company can choose to settle awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan in either cash or equity, although it currently expects to settle all such awards in cash.
Awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan are accounted for as cash-settled transactions see above.
The Company can choose to settle awards under the Executive Participation Plan in either cash or equity, although it currently expects to settle all such awards in equity.
The awards under the Plan can also be structured as deferred shares or share options with a zero exercise price.
The Company intends the awards to operate in substance as deferred shares such that, subject to fulfilling the service condition, each participant receives actual shares on the applicable vesting date.
Awards under the Executive Participation Plan are accounted for as equity-settled transactions see above.
Dividends Dividends on ordinary shares are recorded in the financial statements in the period in which they are approved by the Companys shareholders, or in the case of interim dividends, in the period in which they are paid.
Financial instruments Financial instruments are accounted for in accordance with IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation, IAS 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement, and IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures which is the same as the accounting policy for the Group.
Therefore, for details of the Companys accounting policy for financial instruments refer to pages 88 to 90.
The Company holds derivative financial instruments that hedge financial risks of the Group as a whole and to which hedge accounting is applied in the consolidated financial statements.
However, these instruments are accounted in the Company financial statements at fair value through profit or loss.
Investment in own shares Own shares held in treasury by the Company have also been classified as deductions from equity.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially as the proceeds received, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method: any difference between proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings.
The carrying value of borrowings takes account of accrued interest, issue costs and the effect of fair value hedges.
"Retirement benefit obligations During the year ended 28 April 2018, the Company was confirmed as the ""principal employer"" of the main section of the Stagecoach Group Pension Scheme ""SPS."
Where other participating employers are unable to meet their liabilities to the SPS, the company is liable for the remaining liabilities.
No liability has been recognised in the Company's financial statements for that as the participating employers are expected to meet their liabilities to SPS.
The Company has no employees and is therefore not liable for a share in any of the other Group defined benefit schemes that are disclosed in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements.
It does have unfunded liabilities in respect of former employees and these are reflected in the balance sheet.
