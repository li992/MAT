Derivative financial instruments Group and Company Fair value hierarchy IFRS 7 requires all financial instruments carried at fair value to be analysed under the following levels: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that ar e observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market for example, over-the-counter derivatives is determined by using valuation techniques.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.
The fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange rates at the date of the statement of financial position, with the resulting value discounted accordingly as relevant.
The following tables show the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities.
It does not include fair value information for financial assets and financial liabilities not measured at fair value if the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fairvalue.

In the current year, this has been reclassified into Other financial liabilities at fair value.
The comparative tables above have been restated to reflect the change indisclosure.
With the exception of the contingent consideration, all financial instruments at fair value sit within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
The contingent consideration sits as a Level 3 measurement.
The Group and Company also had an option to purchase 7.0m euros which expired on 27 March 2018 and has not been exercised.
The option had a fair value of nil as at 27 January 2018.
Cash and cash equivalents held by the Group have an original maturity of three months or less.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates to their fair value.
The fair value of the current trade and other receivables and the current trade and other payables approximates to their book value as none of the balances are interest-bearing.
For the current borrowings, the impact of discounting is not significant as the borrowings will be paid within 12 months of the year end date.
The carrying amount approximates their fair value.
The cumulative amount of gains and losses on effective hedging instruments are held within the cash flow hedge reserve.
Contingent consideration The Group had agreed to pay the former owners of Funkin a contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain financial targets by Funkin in the two years from the date of its acquisition by the Group.
The potential undiscounted amount of all future payments that the Group was to make under the acquisition agreement was between nil and 4.5m.
The fair value of the contingent consideration arrangement of 4.5m was estimated by assessing the expected growth of Funkin over the two years trading post acquisition.
No discount rate was applied to the fair value estimate of the contingent consideration as due to the short time period the effect of discounting had a negligible effect on the fair value.
The consideration of 4.5m was paid in the year to 27 January 2018.
