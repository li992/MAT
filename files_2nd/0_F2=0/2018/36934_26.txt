Accounting policies continued CASH FLOW HEDGE For cash flow hedges that meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the portion of the gains or losses on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is recognised within net operating expenses in the consolidated income statement.
When the hedged forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability.
For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the consolidated income statement in the same period in which the hedged forecast transaction affects the consolidated income statement.
AVAILABLE FOR SALE FINANCIAL ASSETS Gains and losses on available for sale financial assets are recognised in other comprehensive income, until the investment is sold or is considered to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in other comprehensive income is included in the consolidated income statement.
Cumulative gains and losses on investments held for operational reasons are included within net operating expenses.
Cumulative gains and losses on investments held for financing purposes are included within finance income and finance costs respectively.
SHARE CAPITAL Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Where the Group purchases the Groups equity share capital treasury shares, the consideration paid is deducted from shareholders equity until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received is included in shareholders equity.
DIVIDENDS Final dividends proposed by the Board of Directors and unpaid at the year-end are not recognised in the consolidated financial statements until they have been approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
The Directors have made a number of estimates and assumptions regarding the future, and made some significant judgements in applying the Groups accounting policies.
These are discussed below: SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE LIFE INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets are tested at least annually for impairment in accordance with the accounting policy set out above.
The recoverable amount of cash generating units is determined based on value in use calculations.
These impairment calculations require the use of estimates including projected future cash flows see note 11.
INCENTIVES AND OTHER REBATES FROM BRAND PARTNERS The Group receives income in the form of various incentives which are determined by our brand partners.
The amount we receive is generally based on achieving specific objectives, such as a specified sales volume, as well as other objectives including maintaining brand partner standards which may include, but are not limited to, retail centre image and design requirements, customer satisfaction survey results and training standards.
Objectives are generally set and measured on either a quarterly or annual basis.
Where incentives are based on a specific sales volume or number of registrations, the related income is recognised as a reduction in cost of sales when it is reasonably certain that the income has been earned.
This is generally the later of the date the related vehicles are sold or registered or when it is reasonably certain that the related target will be met.
Where incentives are linked to retail centre image and design requirements, customer satisfaction survey results or training standards, they are recognised as a reduction in cost of sales when it is reasonably certain that the incentive will be received for the relevant period.
The Group may also receive contributions towards advertising and promotional expenditure.
Where such contributions are received, they are recognised as a reduction in the related expenditure in the period to which they relate.
116 Inchcape plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 116 Inchcape Annual Report and Accounts 2018 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PENSIONS AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS ASSUMPTIONS Pension and other post-retirement benefit liabilities are determined based on the actuarial assumptions detailed in note 5.
A number of these assumptions require estimates to be made, including the rate of inflation and expected mortality rates.
These assumptions are subject to a review on an annual basis and are determined in conjunction with an external actuary.
The use of different assumptions could have a material effect on the value of the relevant liabilities and could result in a material change to amounts recognised in the income statement over time.
In November 2015, the TKM Group Pension Scheme completed a buy-in transaction whereby the assets of the scheme were invested in a bulk purchase annuity contract that matches the benefits payable to the members of the scheme.
The contract has been structured to enable the scheme, in time, to move to a full buy-out, following which the insurance company will become directly responsible for the pension payments under the scheme.
The scheme has now been fully bought out and it was formally wound up on 3 August 2018.
TAX The Group is subject to income taxes in a number of jurisdictions.
Some degree of estimation is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes see note 8.
There are a number of transactions and calculations during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on best estimates of whether additional taxes will be due without taking into account whether tax authorities would detect any particular issue.
The estimate is made separately for each jurisdiction and takes into account managements view of the relevant tax laws and environment applicable to the operations of the Group in those jurisdictions.
No single item is expected to give rise to a material adjustment in the following or subsequent years.
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.
In addition, the recognition of deferred tax assets is dependent upon an estimation of future taxable profits that will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised see notes 8 and 16.
In the event that actual taxable profits are different, such differences may impact the carrying value of such deferred tax assets in future periods.
IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
When an impairment review is carried out, the recoverable value is determined based on value in use calculations which require estimates to be made of future cash flows see notes 11 and 12.
REPURCHASE COMMITMENTS The Group has entered into commitments in relation to certain leased vehicles to repurchase the vehicle for a specified value at a predetermined date.
These commitments are an estimate of future market value at a specified point in time.
The actual market value of vehicles bought back may vary from the committed purchase value.
To the extent that the actual market value of such vehicles is expected to be less than the repurchase commitment, a provision is recognised and is included with Other Provisions in note 21.
Where the repurchase commitment is in respect of a vehicle sold by the Group to a leasing company, the repurchase commitment is held within trade and other payables.
Where the Group has entered into a repurchase commitment in respect of vehicles that have not been sourced from within the Group, then the repurchase commitment is included as a purchase commitment see note 30.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS PENSIONS DISCOUNT RATE The Groups defined benefit obligations are discounted at a rate set by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on high quality corporate bonds.
Significant judgement is required when setting the criteria for bonds to be included in the population from which the yield curve is derived.
The most significant criteria considered for the selection of bonds include the issue size of the corporate bonds, quality of the bonds and the identification of outliers which are excluded.
com 117 Inchcape Annual Report and Accounts 2018 117 Notes to the financial statements 1 SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS The Group has eight reportable segments which have been identified based on the operating segments of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision-maker, which has been determined to be the Executive Committee, in order to assess performance and allocate resources.
Operating segments are then aggregated into reporting segments to combine those with similar economic characteristics.
During the year, the Group has reviewed the operating segments and determined that in those regions where we are the Distributor and manage a network that includes dealerships that we own and operate, the results of those retail operations are better reflected as part of the results from Distribution.
This has resulted in the results from our Subaru, Peugeot and Citroen retail operations in Australia and Toyota retail operations in Europe being reported as part of Australasia and UK and Europe Distribution.
The following summary describes the operations of each of the Groups reportable segments: Distribution Australasia Distribution of new vehicles and parts in Australia and New Zealand together with associated marketing and logistics operations.
Sale of New and Used vehicles in Australia where the Group is also the Distributor of those vehicles, together with associated Aftersales activities of service, bodyshop repairs and parts sales.
UK and Europe Distribution of New vehicles and parts, together with associated marketing activities, in mature European markets.
Sale of New and Used vehicles in Europe where the Group is also the Distributor of those vehicles, together with associated Aftersales activities of service, bodyshop repairs and parts sales.
Asia Exclusive distribution and sale of New vehicles and parts in Asian markets, together with associated Aftersales activities of service and bodyshop repairs.
Emerging Markets Distribution of New vehicles and parts in growing markets, together with associated Aftersales activities of service and bodyshop repairs.
Retail Australasia Sale of New and Used vehicles in Australia together with associated Aftersales activities of service, bodyshop repairs and parts sales.
UK and Europe Sale of primarily New and Used premium vehicles in mature markets, together with associated Aftersales activities of service, bodyshop repairs and parts sales.
Emerging Markets Sale of New and Used vehicles in growing markets together with associated Aftersales activities of service, bodyshop repairs and parts sales.
Central Comprises the Groups head office function and includes all central activities including the Board, finance, human resources, marketing, governance and global information services.
The Group has also refined the methodology for allocating gross profit between Vehicles and Aftersales and the apportionment of certain Central costs to the segments.
Comparatives have been restated accordingly.

128 Inchcape plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 128 Inchcape Annual Report and Accounts 2018 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 5 PENSIONS AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS The Group operates a number of pension and post-retirement benefit schemes for its employees in a number of its businesses, primarily in the UK.
a. UK schemes: benefits, governance, cash flow obligations and investments The Inchcape Motors Pension Scheme comprising the Group, Motors, Normand and Cash sections in the UK is the main defined benefit final salary pension scheme.
The Group, Motors and Normand sections are closed to new employees and largely closed to future benefit accrual.
The Cash section is a defined benefit cash balance scheme, open to accrual for current and new employees, which is designed to meet regulatory requirements for auto-enrolment legislation.
The Group also operates the Inchcape Overseas Pension Scheme which is non-UK registered.
Benefit structure Final salary schemes provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life.
The level of benefits provided depends on final salary at retirement or leaving date, if earlier and length of service.
The Group underwrites investment, mortality and inflation risks necessary to meet the obligations under the schemes.
In the event of poor returns, increased life expectancy or higher than expected inflation, the Group is required to address any shortfall through a combination of an increase in contributions or by making appropriate adjustments to the schemes.
Cash balance schemes like Cash allow members to accrue a percentage of their earnings each year, which then grows to provide a lump sum payment on retirement.
Members have accrued benefits under this scheme with effect from 1 January 2013.
The Group underwrites the investment risk to normal retirement age 65, but all inflation and mortality risks associated with benefits are borne solely by the members.
Across the schemes a number of exercises have been undertaken to significantly mitigate these key funding risks.
Governance Our UK schemes are registered with HMRC and comply fully with the regulatory framework published by the UK Pensions Regulator.
Benefits under the Inchcape Motors Pension Scheme are paid to members from separate funds administered by a trustee board comprised of two independent trustee companies the Trustees appointed by the Group.
The Trustees are required to act in the best interest of the members, and are responsible for making funding and investment decisions in conjunction with the Group.
The Group also has some minor unfunded arrangements relating to post-retirement health and medical plans in respect of past employees.
There are no material defined contribution schemes in the UK.
Scheme specific cash obligation investment detail Inchcape Motors Pension Scheme Group, Motors and Normand sections closed sections The latest actuarial valuations for these sections were carried out at 5 April 2016 on a market-related basis and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the defined accrued benefit method.
The actuarial valuation determined that the duration of the liabilities was approximately 18 years and that a small surplus existed.
The Group contributes 0.6m p. a. towards the administrative costs of running these sections and no further review is scheduled until April 2019.
For the Normand section, the Group also currently pays deficit reduction contributions of 1.1m p. a. rising by 3.05% p. a. up until 5 April 2026 at which point the funding shortfall is expected to be eliminated.
Each sections investment strategy sees it holding a proportion of its assets in matching assets 75% for the Group section, 45% for the Motors section and 46% for the Normand section with the remainder in growth assets.
The matching assets are invested in a liability-driven investment solution complemented with absolute return bonds.
They are designed to hedge inflation and interest rate risk in a capitally efficient manner.
The growth assets are invested in assets that are expected to grow at rates significantly faster than each sections liabilities and include equities, diversified growth funds and property.
Cash section This scheme is a defined benefit scheme under which members accrue benefits with effect from 1 January 2013, or date of joining if later.
The latest actuarial valuation was carried out at 5 April 2016 on a market-related basis and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit credit method.
The valuation showed the funding level to be 98%, with the Trustee expecting the small shortfall to be removed by the ongoing pension contributions and returns on the assets held.
The Group contributes 0.2m p. a. towards the administrative costs of running the scheme and the next review is in April 2019.
The investment strategy is to be 60% invested in diversified growth funds which are designed to grow at a rate significantly faster than the liabilities, whilst spreading investment risk across a broad spectrum of asset classes.
The remaining 40% is to be split equally between multi-factor equities and emerging market multi-asset funds.
The next actuarial valuations for the four sections of the Inchcape Motors Pensions Scheme will be carried out as at 5 April 2019. www.

It is therefore reported under the United Kingdom in this note.
The latest triennial actuarial valuation for this scheme was carried out at 31 March 2015 and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the attained age method.
The actuarial valuation determined that the duration of the liabilities was approximately 11 years and that the scheme was approximately 86% funded on a prudent funding basis.
The Group contributes 0.8m p. a. towards scheme administrative costs and improving the funding ratio.
The investments are managed under a Fiduciary Management arrangement with the level of investment risk inherent in the investment arrangements reducing as and when the funding level improves.
The schemes actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2018 is currently in progress.
TKM Group Pension Scheme closed scheme In November 2015, the trustees of the TKM Group Pension Scheme completed a buy-in transaction whereby the assets of the scheme were used to acquire a bulk purchase annuity policy with Aviva under which the benefits payable to the members of the scheme are now fully insured.
The insurance policy was purchased using the existing assets of the scheme with no additional funding required from the Group.
The insurance policy was structured to enable the scheme, in time, to move to full buy-out, following which Aviva would become directly responsible for the pension payments under the scheme.
All liability for member benefits now lie with Aviva and the duties of the Group and the trustee have been discharged.
Overseas schemes There are a number of smaller defined benefit schemes overseas, the most significant being the Inchcape Motors Limited Retirement Scheme in Hong Kong.
In general these schemes offer a lump sum on retirement with no further obligation to the employee and assets are held in trust in separately administered funds.
These schemes are typically subject to triennial valuations.
The overseas defined contribution schemes are principally linked to local statutory arrangements.
c. Defined contribution plans The total expense recognised in the consolidated income statement is 7.0m 2017 6.2m.
There are no outstanding contributions at 31 December 2018 2017 0.2m.
d. Defined benefit plans As the Groups principal defined benefit schemes are in the UK, these have been reported separately from the overseas schemes.
For the purposes of reporting, actuarial updates have been obtained for the Groups material schemes and these updates are reflected in the amounts reported in the following tables.

com 133 Inchcape Annual Report and Accounts 2018 133 Notes to the financial statements continued 5 PENSIONS AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS CONTINUED The following disclosures relate to the Groups defined benefit plans only.
e. Risk management Asset volatility Scheme liabilities are calculated on a discounted basis using a discount rate which is set with reference to corporate bond yields.
If scheme assets underperform this yield, then this will create a deficit.
The combined schemes hold assets as defensive assets liability driven investment solutions, absolute return bonds and annuity policies which mitigate significant changes in yields, and active monitoring plans are in place to identify opportunities to increase the proportion of such assets further when economically possible.
As the schemes mature, the Trustees reduce investment risk by increasing the allocation to defensive assets, which are designed to better match scheme liabilities.
However, the Trustees believe that due to the long-term nature of the scheme liabilities, a level of continuing equity investment is an appropriate element of the long-term investment strategy.
Inflation risk The majority of the Groups defined benefit obligations are linked to inflation.
Higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities, although in the majority of cases there are caps on the level of inflationary increases to be applied to pension obligations.
The Groups investment strategy across the schemes is to mitigate inflation risk through holding inflation-linked assets.
Life expectancy Where relevant, the plans obligations are to provide a pension for the life of the member, so realised increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans benefit payments.
Future mortality rates cannot be predicted with certainty.
All of the schemes conduct scheme-specific mortality investigations annually, to ensure the Group has a clear understanding of any potential increase in liability due to pensioners living for longer than assumed.
The Trustees of the schemes hedge this risk by adopting a prudent approach in their assumption for future improvements.
f. Sensitivity analysis The disclosures above are dependent on the assumptions used.
The table below demonstrates the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the assumptions used for the UK schemes.
Changes in assumptions have an immaterial effect on the overseas schemes.
Impact on the defined benefit obligation United Kingdom 2018 2017 m m Discount rate -0.25% 31.2 44.8 Discount rate 0.25% -29.3 -42.1 Inflation -0.25% -17.8 -28.8 Inflation 0.25% 19.8 29.6 Life expectancy 1 year 29.4 39.3 The above analysis is based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
The above variances have been used as they are believed to be reasonably possible fluctuations.
g. Expected future cash flows The Group has agreed to pay approximately 2.8m to its UK defined benefit plans in 2019 on top of the ongoing employer contributions for the open Cash section.
The Group does not expect any material changes to the annual cash contributions over the next three years given the funding position of the largest schemes, which account for 90% of the Groups total pension liabilities.
The defined benefit obligations are based on the current value of expected benefit payment cash flows to members over the next several decades.
The average duration of the liabilities is approximately 18 years for the UK schemes.

In addition, a change in profit mix between low and high taxed jurisdictions will impact the Groups future tax expense.
In October 2017 the EU Commission opened a formal State Aid investigation into an exemption within the UKs current Controlled Foreign Company CFC regime introduced in 2013 for certain finance income.
The investigation is ongoing, but if the Commission ultimately concludes that the provisions do constitute State Aid then they would require the UK to recover any such aid from affected parties.
The Group has claimed the benefit of this exemption, and therefore may be adversely affected by the outcome of the investigation.
If the Commission were to conclude that the finance exemption within the UKs CFC regime constitutes State Aid and no other exemptions were available to the Group then, as at 31 December 2018, an estimated tax liability of 5.0m plus interest would arise unless such a decision could be successfully challenged in the EU Courts.
However, no provision has been made in respect of this investigation since we believe that it is more likely than not that no additional tax will ultimately be due.
The utilisation of brought forward tax losses or the recognition of deferred tax assets associated with such losses may also give rise to tax charges or credits.
The recognition of deferred tax assets, particularly in respect of tax losses, is based upon an assessment of whether it is probable that there will be sufficient and suitable taxable profits in the relevant legal entity or tax group against which to utilise the assets in the future.
Judgement is required when determining probable future taxable profits.
More detail of the Groups tax losses and deferred tax assets can be found in note 16.

These CGU groups represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill is monitored for management purposes.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to CGU groups within the following reporting segments: Long-term 2018 2017 Reporting segment Discount rate growth rate CGU group m m UK and Europe Retail 9.8% 2.0% UK Retail 90.3 265.7 South America 51.4 54.7 12.9% Emerging Markets Distribution to 2.5% Central America 46.6 14.8% Kenya 1.1 Asia 9.5% 2.0% Singapore 23.3 22.4 Australasia Retail Australia Retail 45.2 47.0 10.5% 2.0% Australasia Distribution Peugeot Citron Australia 1.9 2.0 259.8 391.8 Goodwill is subject to impairment testing annually, or more frequently where there are indications that the goodwill may be impaired.
Impairment tests were performed for all CGU groups during the year ended 31 December 2018.
The recoverable amounts of all CGU groups were determined based on the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and value in use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections based on five-year financial forecasts prepared by management.
The key assumptions for these forecasts are those relating to revenue growth, operating margins, the level of working capital required to support trading and capital expenditure, and have been based on past experience, recent trading and expectations of future changes in the operation of the business and changes in the relevant markets.
They also reflect expectations about continuing relationships with key brand partners.
For CGU groups in Emerging Markets, cash flows after the five-year period are extrapolated for a further five years using declining growth rates which reduces the year five growth rate down to the long-term growth rate of 2.5%, to better reflect the medium-term growth expectations for those markets.
A terminal value calculation is used to estimate the cash flows after year ten using these long-term growth rates.
For all other markets, a terminal value calculation is used to estimate the cash flows after year five.
Cash flows are discounted back to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate.
The discount rates used are calculated as the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for a risk premium attributable to the relevant country.
Impairment The Group has previously reported that the headroom attributable to the UK Retail CGU group was 24% 144m as at 31 December 2017 and that this had declined to 8% 46m as at 30 June 2018.
During 2018, the UK New car market declined by 6.8% source: SMMT, continuing the weak trend from 2017, with the sale of diesel vehicles down 29.6%.
In addition, the supply imbalance and the elevated level of pre-registration activity resulted in pressure on both New and Used margins.
In light of this and the recent performance of the Retail business in the UK, the Board has reassessed its short and medium-term forecasts and has updated the impairment test for the UK Retail CGU group based on a value in use calculation.
This calculation used cash flow projections based on revised five-year financial forecasts prepared by management.
The key assumptions for these forecasts were those relating to volumes, gross margins, the level of working capital required to support trading and capital expenditure and have been based on past experience, recent trading and expectations of future changes in the market, consistent with external sources of information.
Due to significant uncertainty around the mechanisms for the UK leaving the European Union, these forecasts assume a non-disorderly exit.
The medium-term forecast for UK Retail assumes that the New vehicle gross margin will increase to 7.2% by 2023 consistent with the average achieved over the period 2013 to 2017.
A terminal value calculation was used to estimate the cash flows after year five using a long-term growth rate of 2.0% 2017 2.0%.

com 139 Inchcape Annual Report and Accounts 2018 139 Notes to the financial statements continued 11 INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED The results of the impairment review indicated that the value in use calculation was less than the carrying value of the assets attributable to the UK Retail CGU group and an impairment charge of 175m should be recognised.
The forecasts are sensitive to changes in the key assumptions used.
In addition, they are sensitive to a more disruptive consequence on the industry following a disorderly exit from the European Union.
The table below shows the sensitivity of the value in use calculations to possible changes in the more sensitive assumptions while holding all other assumptions constant.
Effect on Increase value-in-use decrease in calculation assumption m New vehicle margins -20bps -40m Used vehicle margins -20bps -35m Aftersales gross margins -150bps -40m Overheads -50bps - 20m In light of the sensitivity of the value in use calculations to changes in the key assumptions, the Directors intend to review the carrying value of UK Retail goodwill on a regular basis.
Sensitivities The Groups value in use calculations for the remaining CGU groups are sensitive to a change in the key assumptions used.
However, with the exception of UK Retail, a reasonably possible change in a key assumption will not cause a material impairment of goodwill in any of the CGU groups.
Distribution agreements Distribution agreements with indefinite useful lives are also subject to impairment testing annually, or more frequently where there are indications that they may be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the Distribution agreements were determined based on value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for these forecasts are those relating to revenue growth, operating margins and the level of working capital required to support trading and have been based on past experience, recent trading and expectations of future changes in the relevant markets.
Cash flows after the five-year period are extrapolated for each market using declining growth rates which reduces the year five growth rate down to the long-term growth rate for each market of between 2.5% and 2.0%.
The pre-tax discount rates used vary between 10% and 15% and reflect long-term country risk.

However, each party to the netting agreement will have the option to settle all such amounts on a net basis in the event of a default of the other party.
152 Inchcape plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 152 Inchcape Annual Report and Accounts 2018 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 23 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED c. Market risk and sensitivity analysis Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The Group is not exposed to commodity price risk.
The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being primarily UK interest rates and the Japanese yen exchange rate with both the Australian dollar and Chilean peso.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges from movements in interest rates are assumed to be recorded fully in equity: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges from movements in interest rates have an immaterial effect on the consolidated income statement and equity due to compensating adjustments in the carrying value of debt: changes in the carrying value of financial instruments not in hedging relationships only affect the consolidated income statement: and all other changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges are fully effective with no impact on the consolidated income statement.
d. Interest rate risk and sensitivity analysis The Groups interest rate policy has the objective of minimising net interest expense, and protecting the Group from material adverse movements in interest rates.
Instruments approved for the purpose of hedging interest rate risk include interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and options.
The Groups exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates arises primarily from the floating rate interest payable on the Groups loan notes that expire in 2019, bank borrowings, supplier-related finance and the returns available on surplus cash.
In December 2016 the Group entered into agreements to issue new 3.0% fixed interest rate Private Placement loan notes to refinance the floating rate loan notes that matured in May 2017 see note 22.
Interest rate risk table The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of the Groups profit before tax to a reasonably possible change in interest rates on bank borrowings, supplier related finance and cash balances as at 31 December 2018 with all other variables held constant.

Foreign currency risk The Group publishes its consolidated financial statements in Sterling and faces currency risk on the translation of its earnings and net assets, a significant proportion of which are in currencies other than Sterling.
Transaction exposure hedging The Group has transactional currency exposures, where sales or purchases by an operating unit are in currencies other than in that units reporting currency.
For a significant proportion of the Group these exposures are removed as trading is denominated in the relevant local currency.
In particular, local billing arrangements are in place for many of our businesses with our brand partners.
The principal exception is for our business in Australia which purchases vehicles in Japanese yen and our South and Central American businesses which purchase vehicles in Japanese yen and US dollars.
In this instance, the Group seeks to hedge forecast transactional foreign exchange rate risk using forward foreign currency exchange contracts.
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedge is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income to the extent it is effective and recycled into the consolidated income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction affects the consolidated income statement.
Under IFRS 9 hedges are documented and tested for the hedge effectiveness on an ongoing basis.
Hedge of foreign currency debt The Group uses cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the forward foreign currency risk associated with the US$161m Private Placement 2017 US$161m.
The effective portion on the gain or loss of the hedge is recognised in the consolidated income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction affects the consolidated income statement.
Foreign currency risk table The following table shows the Group sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates on its Japanese yen financial instruments.
In this table, financial instruments are only considered sensitive to foreign exchange rates when they are not in the functional currency of the entity that holds them.
Increase decrease in Effect on exchange equity rate m 2018 Yen 10% Yen -10% 0.1 2017 Yen 10% Yen -10% 0.1 f. Credit risk The amount due from counterparties arising from cash deposits and the use of financial instruments creates credit risk.
The Group monitors its credit exposure to its counterparties via their credit ratings where applicable and through its policy of limiting its exposure to any one party to ensure that they are within Board approved limits and that there are no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Group policy is to deposit cash and use financial instruments with counterparties with a long-term credit rating of A or better, where available.
The notional amounts of financial instruments used in interest rate and foreign exchange management do not represent the credit risk arising through the use of these instruments.
The immediate credit risk of these instruments is generally estimated by the fair value of contracts with a positive value.
Credit limits are reviewed regularly.
The table below analyses the Groups short-term deposits and derivative assets by credit exposure excluding bank balances and cash in hand: 2018 2017 Derivative Short-term Derivative Short-term assets deposits assets deposits m m m m Credit rating of counterparty AA- 43.4 29.5 3.1 A 32.5 68.1 22.5 A 37.8 A- 12.0 32.0 BBB 0.9 0.7 0.4 0.6 BBB- 0.1 19.9 12.0 No rating 3.2 98.3 53.4 92.1 219.0 52.4 106.9 Counterparties in certain markets in which the Group operates do not have a credit rating.
154 Inchcape plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 154 Inchcape Annual Report and Accounts 2018 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 23 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period and management does not expect any losses from nonperformance by these counterparties.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for cash at bank, receivables and other financial assets is represented by their carrying amount.
Total cash at bank of 370.3m 2017 820.0m includes cash in the Group's regional pooling arrangements which are offset against borrowings for interest purposes.
Netting of cash and overdraft balances in the consolidated statement of financial position only occurs to the extent that there is the legal ability and intention to settle net.
As such, overdrafts are presented in current liabilities to the extent that there is no intention to offset with the cash balance.
Trade receivables include amounts due from a number of finance houses in respect of vehicles sold to customers on finance arranged through the Group.
An independent credit rating agency is used to assess the credit standing of each finance house.
Limits for the maximum outstanding with each finance house are set accordingly.
g. Liquidity risk Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Group Treasury aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group's financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2018 based on contractual expected undiscounted cash flows: Between Less than 3 to 12 Between Greater than 3 months months 1 to 5 years 5 years Total 2018 m m m m m Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents 573.7 15.6 589.3 Trade and other receivables 356.2 31.1 10.3 397.6 Available for sale financial assets 0.2 7.2 7.4 Derivative financial instruments 24.7 141.8 166.5 954.8 188.5 17.5 1,160.8 Financial liabilities Interest bearing loans and borrowings 164.6 253.6 25.9 229.7 673.8 Trade and other payables 1,913.6 299.2 12.9 2,225.7 Derivative financial instruments 13.4 76.4 89.8 2,091.6 629.2 38.8 229.7 2,989.3 Net outflows 1,136.8 440.7 21.3 229.7 1,828.5 Between Less than 3 to 12 Between Greater than 3 months months 1 to 5 years 5 years Total 2017 m m m m m Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents 895.3 31.6 926.9 Trade and other receivables 390.7 19.0 8.2 1.1 419.0 Available for sale financial assets 0.2 7.3 7.5 Derivative financial instruments 1.7 10.8 178.3 190.8 1,287.7 61.6 186.5 8.4 1,544.2 Financial liabilities Interest bearing loans and borrowings 516.0 31.9 173.2 242.5 963.6 Trade and other payables 1,981.1 79.5 7.6 2,068.2 Derivative financial instruments 12.5 12.4 131.4 156.3 2,509.6 123.8 312.2 242.5 3,188.1 Net outflows 1,221.9 62.2 125.7 234.1 1,643.9 www.

Fair value measurement In accordance with IFRS 13, disclosure is required for financial instruments that are measured in the consolidated statement of financial position at fair value.
This requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level for the following fair value measurement hierarchy: quoted prices in active markets level 1 : inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly level 2 : or inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data level 3.
The following table presents the Groups assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value: 2018 2017 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total m m m m m m m m Assets Derivatives used for hedging 92.1 92.1 52.4 52.4 Available for sale financial assets 0.5 6.9 7.4 1.3 6.2 7.5 0.5 92.1 6.9 99.5 1.3 52.4 6.2 59.9 Liabilities Derivatives used for hedging 13.3 13.3 21.6 21.6 Level 1 represents the fair value of financial instruments that are traded in active markets and is based on quoted markets prices at the end of the reporting period.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market level 2 is determined by using valuation techniques which include the present value of estimated future cash flows.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.
Derivative financial instruments are carried at their fair values.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign exchange swaps represents the difference between the value of the outstanding contracts at their contracted rates and a valuation calculated using the spot rates of exchange prevailing at 31 December 2018.
The Groups derivative financial instruments comprise the following: Assets Liabilities 2018 2017 2018 2017 m m m m Cross currency interest rate swaps 52.2 49.7 Forward foreign exchange contracts 39.9 2.7 13.3 21.6 92.1 52.4 13.3 21.6 The ineffective portion recognised in the consolidated income statement that arises from fair value hedges amounts to a loss of 0.6m 2017 Gain of 1.2m.

156 Inchcape plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 156 Inchcape Annual Report and Accounts 2018 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 23 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Cash flow hedges The Group principally uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge purchases in a non-functional currency against movements in exchange rates.
The cash flows relating to these contracts are generally expected to occur within 12 months 2017 12 months of the end of the reporting period.
The nominal principal amount of the outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts relating to transactional exposures at 31 December 2018 was 810.5m 2017 910.4m.
Net fair value gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve in shareholders' equity see note 25 on forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2018 are expected to be released to the consolidated income statement within 12 months of the end of the reporting period 2017 12 months.
Fair value hedge At 31 December 2018, the Group had in place three cross currency interest rate swaps.
Two of these total US$200m which hedge changes in the fair value of the Groups 12-year loan notes that are due to mature in May 2019.
Under these swaps the Group receives fixed rate US dollar interest of 6.04% on US$200m and pays LIBOR 90bps.
An additional US$39.2m cross currency interest rate swap was put in place after debt reduction in 2009 to offset the nonrequired portion of the original swaps.
Under this swap the Group pays US dollar interest of 6.04% on US$39.2m and receives LIBOR 214bps.
The loan notes and cross currency interest rate swaps have the same critical terms.
Capital management The Groups capital structure consists of equity and debt.
Equity represents funds raised from shareholders and debt represents funds raised from banks and other financial institutions.
The primary objective of the Groups management of debt and equity is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios in order to finance the Groups activities, both now and in the future, and to maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
The Directors consider the Groups capital structure and dividend policy at least twice a year prior to the announcement of results, taking into account the Groups ability to continue as a going concern and the requirements of its business plan.
The Group uses return on capital employed ROCE as a measure of its ability to drive better returns on the capital invested in the Groups operations.
2018 2017 Return on capital employed 27.8% 30.1% The committed bank facilities and Private Placement borrowings are subject to the same interest cover covenant based on an adjusted EBITA measure to interest on consolidated borrowings.
The Group is required to maintain a ratio of not less than three to one and was compliant with this covenant throughout the year.
The Group monitors Group leverage by reference to three tests: Adjusted EBITA interest cover, the ratio of net debt to EBITDA and the ratio of net debt to market capitalisation.

Acquisitions On 26 March 2018 the Group acquired the full share capital of Grupo Rudelman, an automotive Distribution business in Central America focused on Suzuki, for a total cash consideration of 155.5m.
The business was acquired to establish the Groups presence in markets with structural growth potential and to expand the partnership with Suzuki in a strategically important region, adjacent to existing South American operations.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition represents intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition and the premium paid to establish the Groups presence in Panama and Costa Rica in order to provide a platform to deliver growth and returns far quicker than would otherwise have been achievable.
None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Details of the provisional fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities as at the date of acquisition are set out below: Acquisition book Fair value values adjustments Final fair values m m m Assets and liabilities acquired Intangible assets 0.2 0.2 Distribution agreements recognised on acquisition see note 11 80.1 80.1 Property, plant and equipment 38.2 6.6 44.8 Tax assets 0.3 1.4 1.7 Inventory 58.0 1.6 56.4 Trade and other receivables 29.3 11.5 40.8 Cash and cash equivalents 8.5 8.5 Trade and other payables 17.0 2.1 19.1 Provisions 0.9 1.6 2.5 Borrowings 61.2 61.2 1 Tax liabilities 1.7 34.6 36.3 Net assets acquired 53.7 59.7 113.4 Goodwill 42.1 Purchase consideration 155.5 1 Includes deferred tax liabilities arising in connection with the Distribution agreements recognised on acquisition.
The acquired business contributed 140.4m revenue and 12.2m operating profit before exceptional items to the Group's reported figures between the date of acquisition and 31 December 2018.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2018, the approximate revenue and operating profit before exceptional items for the year ended 31 December 2018 of the Group would have been 9,322.4m and 387.2m respectively.
Other acquisitions During the year, the Group also entered into a Distribution contract with Jaguar Land Rover to distribute the Jaguar and Land Rover brands in Kenya, acquired one Lexus site in the UK and made a completion payment in relation to the acquisition of BMW operations in Estonia.
The total cost of these acquisitions was 5.7m with total goodwill arising on the transactions of 1.5m.
c. Disposals In 2018, the Group disposed of its Jaguar Land Rover operations in Shaoxing and a dealership in the UK generating disposal proceeds of 13.4m.
d. 2017 acquisitions and disposals In 2017 the Group acquired premium automotive operations in Estonia, focused on exclusive distribution for BMW Group, from United Motors AS, and entered into a Distribution contract with Groupe PSA to distribute the Peugeot and Citroen brands in Australia.
The total cost of these acquisitions was 19.3m.

Franked Investment Income Group Litigation Order Inchcape is a participant in an action in the United Kingdom against HM Revenue and Customs HMRC in the Franked Investment Income Group Litigation Order FII GLO.
There are 25 corporate groups in the FII GLO.
The action concerns the treatment for UK corporate tax purposes of profits earned overseas and distributed to the UK.
As reported previously, the resolution of the test case in the FII GLO remains incomplete.
Inchcape has in the meantime joined an action at the High Court to establish whether judgment should be entered for non-test claims, also involving the determination of some issues that do not arise in the test case.
A positive judgment would result in the recovery by Inchcape of amounts claimed from HMRC.
However, this judgment would remain subject to the final conclusion of the test case and so could be amended resulting in a reduction of the non-test case recoveries and thus a repayment to HMRC.
As at 31 December 2018, no further receipts have been recognised in relation to the balance of Inchcapes claim in the FII GLO due to the uncertainty of the eventual outcome given the test case has not yet completed nor has Inchcapes specific claim been heard by the Courts.
In addition, following the judgment of the Supreme Court in Prudential Assurance Company Limited v The Commissioners for HM Revenue and Customs in July 2018, there is uncertainty regarding the value of the claim and it is likely to be lower than the previously reported amount 35.8m.
Other matter While this does not represent a contingent liability, we note that a class action has been brought against our subsidiary, Subaru Australia Pty Limited, in connection with the global Takata airbag inflator recall.
Subaru Australia Pty Limited is one of a number of named defendants and is, along with others, taking steps to defend the action.
