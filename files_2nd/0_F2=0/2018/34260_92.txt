Pensions The primary pension arrangement is a funded final salary pension plan in the UK under which retired employees draw the majority of their benefit as an annuity.
This pension plan is governed by a corporate trustee whose board is composed of four member-nominated directors, four company-nominated directors, an independent director, and an independent chairman nominated by the company.
The trustee board is required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants and is responsible for setting certain policies, such as investment policies of the plan.
The plan is closed to new joiners but remains open to ongoing accrual for current members.
New joiners are eligible for membership of a defined contribution plan.
The level of contributions to funded defined benefit plans is the amount needed to provide adequate funds to meet pension obligations as they fall due.
During 2018 the aggregate level of contributions was $490 million 2017 $509 million.
The aggregate level of contributions in 2019 is expected to be approximately $262 million, and includes contributions we expect to be required to make by law or under contractual agreements, as well as an allowance for discretionary funding.

Pensions continued For the primary UK plan there is a funding agreement between the company and the trustee.
On an annual basis the latest funding position is reviewed and a schedule of contributions is agreed covering the next five years.
Contractually committed funding amounted to $1,275 million at 31December2018, all of which relates to future service.
The surplus relating to the primary UK pension plan is recognized on the balance sheet on the basis that the company is entitled to a refund of any remaining assets once all members have left the plan.
The obligation and cost of providing the pension benefits is assessed annually using the projected unit credit method.
The date of the most recent actuarial review was 31 December 2018.
The principal plans are subject to a formal actuarial valuation every three years in the UK.
The most recent formal actuarial valuation of the main pension plan was as at 31 December 2017.
The material financial assumptions used for estimating the benefit obligations of the plans are set out below.
The assumptions are reviewed by management at the end of each year and are used to evaluate accrued pension benefits at 31 December and pension expense for the following year.
Financial assumptions used to determine benefit obligation % 2018 2017 Discount rate for pension plan liabilities 2.9 2.5 Rate of increase in salaries 3.8 4.1 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 3.0 2.9 Rate of increase in deferred pensions 3.0 2.9 Inflation for pension plan liabilities 3.1 3.1 Financial assumptions used to determine benefit expense % 2018 2017 Discount rate for pension plan service costs 2.6 2.7 Discount rate for pension plan other finance expense 2.5 2.7 Inflation for pension plan service costs 3.1 3.2 The discount rate assumption is based on third-party AA corporate bond indices and we use yields that reflect the maturity profile of the expected benefit payments.
The inflation rate assumption is based on the difference between the yields on index-linked and fixed-interest longterm government bonds.
The inflation assumption is used to determine the rate of increase for pensions in payment and the rate of increase in deferred pensions.
The assumption for the rate of increase in salaries is based on our inflation assumption plus an allowance for expected long-term real salary growth.
This comprises of an allowance for promotion-related salary growth of 0.7%.
In addition to the financial assumptions, we regularly review the demographic and mortality assumptions.
The mortality assumptions reflect best practice in the UK and have been chosen with regard to the latest available published tables adjusted to reflect the experience of the plans and an extrapolation of past longevity improvements into the future.
For the main pension plan the mortality assumptions are as follows: Mortality assumptions Years 2018 2017 Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 60 27.4 27.4 Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 40 28.9 29.0 Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 60 28.8 28.8 Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 40 30.6 30.5 The assets of the primary plan are held in a trust, the primary objective of which is to accumulate pools of assets sufficient to meet the obligations of the plan.
The assets of the trusts are invested in a manner consistent with fiduciary obligations and principles that reflect current practices in portfolio management.
A significant proportion of the assets are held in equities, owing to a higher expected level of return over the long term of such assets with an acceptable level of risk.
In order to provide reasonable assurance that no single security or type of security has an unwarranted impact on the total portfolio, the investment portfolios are highly diversified.
The trustees long-term investment objective for the primary UK plan as it matures is to invest in assets whose value changes in the same way as the plan liabilities, in order to reduce the level of funding risk.
To move towards this objective, the UK plan uses a liability driven investment LDI approach for part of the portfolio, investing primarily in government bonds to achieve this matching effect for the most significant plan liability assumptions of interest rate and inflation rate.
This is partly funded by short-term sale and repurchase agreements, whereby the plan borrows money using existing bonds as security and which will be bought back at a specified price at an agreed future date.
The funds raised are used to invest in further bonds to increase the proportion of assets which match the plan liabilities.
The borrowings are shown separately in the analysis of pension plan assets in the table below.
For the primary UK pension plan there is an agreement with the trustee to increase the proportion of assets with liability matching characteristics over time primarily by reducing the proportion of plan assets held as equities and increasing the proportion held as bonds.
During 2018, the plan switched 12.5% from equities to bonds.
The companys asset allocation policy for the primary plan is as follows: Asset category % Total equity including private equity 30 Bonds cash including LDI 63 Property real estate 7 The amounts invested under the LDI programme by the primary UK pension plan as at 31December2018 were $4,197 million 2017 $2,588 million of government-issued nominal bonds and $17,491 million 2017 $16,177 million of index-linked bonds.

Pensions continued The primary plan does not invest directly in either securities or property real estate of the company or of any subsidiary.
The fair values of the various categories of assets held by the defined benefit plans at 31December are presented in the table below, including the effects of derivative financial instruments.
Movements in the fair value of plan assets during the year are shown in detail in the table on page 246.

Sensitivity analysis The discount rate, inflation, salary growth and the mortality assumptions all have a significant effect on the amounts reported.
A onepercentage point change, in isolation, in certain assumptions as at 31December2018 for the companys plans would have had the effects shown in the table below.
The effects shown for the expense in 2019 comprise the total of current service cost and net finance income or expense.

b The amounts presented reflect the total impact of an inflation rate change on the assumptions for rate of increase in salaries, pensions in payment and deferred pensions.
One additional year of longevity in the mortality assumptions would increase the 2019 pension expense by $34 million and the pension obligation at 31December2018 by $965 million.
