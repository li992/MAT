These APMs, which are not considered to be a substitute for IFRS measures, provide additional helpful information.
APMs are consistent with how business performance isplanned, reported and assessed internally by management and the Board and provide comparable information across the Group.
Ongoing and non-ongoing The Group reports some financial measures net of businesses that have been disposed of, closed or classified as held for sale and uses the following terminology: Non-ongoing operations are businesses, which do not meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations under IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which have been disposed of, closed or classified as held for sale.
In 2017, the Groups Swiss business, Tobler, and a small Industrial business in the USA, Endries, were classified as non-ongoing and subsequently sold during 2017.
There are no businesses classified as non-ongoing in 2018.
Ongoing operations are continuing operations excluding non-ongoing operations.
Constant exchange rates The Group measures some financial metrics on both a reported basis and at constant exchange rates.
The constant exchange rate basis re-translates the prior year at the current year exchange rates to eliminate the effect of exchange rate fluctuations when comparing information year-on-year.
Organic revenue growth Management uses organic revenue growth as it provides a consistent measure of the percentage increase decrease in revenue year-on-year, excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations, trading days, acquisitions and disposals.

Exceptional items Exceptional items are those which are considered significant by virtue of their nature, size or incidence.
These items are presented as exceptional within their relevant income statement category to assist in the understanding of the trading and financial results of the Group as these types of cost credit do not form part of the underlying business.
Examples of items that are considered by the Directors for designation asexceptional items include, but are not limited to: restructuring costs within a segment which are both material and incurred as part of a significant change in strategy or due to the closure of alarge part of a business and are not expected to be repeated on a regular basis: significant costs incurred as part of the integration of an acquired business and which are considered to be material: gains or losses on disposals of businesses are considered to be exceptional in nature as they do not reflect the performance of the trading business: material costs or credits arising as a result of regulatory and litigation matters: gains or losses arising on significant changes to or closures of defined benefit pension plans are considered to be exceptional in nature as they do not reflect the performance of the trading business: and other items which are material and considered to be non-recurring in nature and or are not as a result of the underlying trading activities of the business.
If provisions have been made for exceptional items in previous years, any reversal of these provisions is treated as exceptional.
Exceptional items for the current and prior year are disclosed in note 5.

Headline profit after tax and headline earnings per share Headline profit after tax is calculated as the profit from continuing operations after tax, before charges for amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets and impairment of interests in associates net of tax, exceptional items net of tax and non-recurring tax relating to changes in tax rates and other adjustments.
The Group excludes amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets to improve the comparability between acquired and organically grown operations, as the latter cannot recognise internally generated intangible assets.
Headline earnings per share is the ratio of headline profit after tax to the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by the Employee Benefit Trusts and those held by the Company as Treasury shares.
Headline earnings per share is used for the purpose of setting remuneration targets for executive directors and other senior executives.
Net debt Net debt comprises cash and cash equivalents and liabilities from financing activities, including bank overdrafts, bank loans, derivative financial instruments and obligations under finance leases.
Net debt is a good indicator of the strength of the Groups balance sheet position and is widely used by credit rating agencies.
Return on gross capital employed Return on gross capital employed is the ratio of the Groups trading profit to the average year-end shareholders equity, adjusted net debt and accumulated amortisation and impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets.
Return on gross capital employed is a key performance indicator see page 29.

Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 109 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Year ended 31 July 2018 3 Segmental analysis The Groups operating segments are established on the basis of the operating businesses overseen by distinct divisional management teams responsible for their performance.
These operating businesses are managed on a geographical basis and are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and assess the performance of the businesses.
All operating segments derive their revenue from a single business activity, the distribution of plumbing and heating products.
Revenue is attributed to a country based on the location of the Group company reporting the revenue.
The Group has combined the Canada and Central Europe operating segments into one reportable segment as individually they do not meet the quantitative thresholds set out in IFRS 8 Operating Segments to be separately disclosed.
The Groups business is not highly seasonal and the Groups customer base is highly diversified, with no individually significant customer.
The changes in revenue and trading profit for continuing operations between the years ended 31 July 2017 and 31 July 2018 include changes inexchange rates, disposals, acquisitions and organic change.
Where businesses are disposed in the year, the difference between the revenue and trading profit in the current year up to the date of disposal and the revenue and trading profit in the equivalent portion of the prior year is included in organic change.

The Group has made provisions for the liabilities likely to arise from open audits and assessments.
At 31 July 2018, the Group has recognised provisions of $237 million in respect of its uncertain tax positions 2017: $214 million.
The total provision has increased by $23 million in the year due primarily to increases related to certain cross border transfer pricing risks, partly offset by the settlement of a transfer pricing enquiry through a Mutual Agreement Procedure between the US Internal Revenue Service and HM Revenue & Customs.
The remaining open significant tax issues relate predominantly to cross border transfer pricing risks.
Although there is uncertainty regarding the timing of the resolution of these matters, management do not believe that the Groups uncertain tax provisions constitute a major source of estimation uncertainty as they consider that there is no significant risk of a material change to its estimate of these provisions within the next 12 months.

T his expected weighted average tax rate reflects the applicable statutory corporate tax rates on the accounting profits losses in the countries in which the Group operates after intra-group financing.
The intra-group financing reduces taxable profits in many of the countries and therefore reduces the tax rate.
The pre intra-group financing ongoing expected weighted average tax rate is 31.6 per cent 2017: 37.2 per cent and this is reduced to a post intra-group financing ongoing expected weighted average tax rate of 22.5per cent 2017: 24.4 per cent.
The decrease inthe expected weighted average tax rates is primarily due to the reduction in US statutory rate and a change in profit mix.
This includes adjustments arising out of movements in uncertain tax provisions regarding prior periods and differences between the final tax liabilities in the tax computations and the taxliabilities provided in the consolidated financial statements.
In 2017, this related primarily to non-taxable disposals of businesses.
T his reflects managements assessment of the potential tax liability for the current year in relation to open tax issues and audits.
T his relates to certain expenditure for which no tax relief is available such as disallowable business entertaining costs and restrictions on interest deductions.
I n 2018, this relates to the reduction in the US federal rate of tax from 35 per cent to 21 per cent from 1 January 2018.
O ngoing profit means profit before tax, exceptional items, the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets and impairment of interests in associates for ongoing operations as defined in note 2.
Ongoing tax is the tax expense arising on ongoing profit.
N on-ongoing and other profit or loss is profit or loss from non-ongoing operations as defined in note 2 and from the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets, impairment of interests in associates and exceptional items.
Non-ongoing and other tax is the tax expense or credit arising on the non-ongoing and other profit or loss and includes other non-recurring tax items.
In 2018, the non-ongoing and other credit of $18 million relates primarily to exceptional UK restructuring costs, an increase in uncertain tax provisions in respect of prior periods and the settlement of a transfer pricing enquiry.

For those shareholders paid in pounds sterling, the exchange rate used to translate the declared value was set in advance of the payment date.
As a result of foreign exchange rate movements between these dates, the total amount paid shown in the Group cash flow statement will be different to that stated above.

Management has performed a sensitivity analysis across all CGUs which have goodwill and acquired intangible assets using reasonably possible changes in the following key impairment review assumptions: compound average revenue growth rate, post-tax discount rate and long-term growth rate, keeping all other assumptions constant.
The sensitivity testing identified no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions that would cause the carrying amount of any CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.

Meier Tobler Group AG The investment in Meier Tobler Group AG is accounted for as an associate using the equity method.
Meier Tobler Group AG prepares accounts under SwissGAAP FER with a year-end of 31 December.
The Groups accounts have been prepared based on Meier Tobler Group AGs half-year accounts ended 30 June 2018.
There were no significant transactions between that date and 31 July 2018.
Summarised financial information from Meier Tobler Group AGs half-year accounts ended 30 June 2018 is set out below.

This generated a trigger event for management to reassess the recoverability of the carrying value recognised in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
Due to the size of the Groups shareholding and the illiquid nature of the shares, it was not appropriate to use the quoted share price for assessing the fair value.

Accordingly, the US deferred tax assets and liabilities have predominately been calculated based on a 26 per cent tax rate combined federal and state rates which materially reflects the rate for the period in which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to reverse.
Legislation has been enacted in the UK to reduce the standard rate of UK corporation tax from 19 per cent to 17 per cent with effect from 1 April2020.
Accordingly, the UK deferred tax assets and liabilities have predominantly been calculated based on a 17 per cent tax rate which materially reflects the rate for the period in which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to reverse.
Net deferred tax assets have been recognised on the basis that sufficient taxable profits are forecast to be available in the future toenable themto be utilised.
In addition, the Group has unrecognised gross tax losses totalling $469 million 2017: $433 million that have not been recognised on the basis thattheir future economic benefit is uncertain.
These losses have no expiry date and relate predominantly to capital losses.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of temporary differences associated with unremitted earnings from its investments in subsidiaries.
However, taxmayarise on$408 million 2017: $375 million of temporary differences but the Group is in a position to control the timing of their reversal anditis probable that suchdifferences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

There have been no significant changes during the year to the Groups policies on accounting for, valuing and managing the risk of financial instruments.
These policies are summarised in note 1.

Fair value measurements canbeclassified in the following hierarchy: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 : inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly level 2 : and inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs level 3.
The Groups derivatives are measured at fair value through profit and loss at 31 July 2018 and 31 July 2017 using level 2 inputs.
The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its borrowings and foreign exchange swaps to hedge cash flows in respect of committed transactions or to hedge its investment in overseas operations.
The current element of derivative financial assets is $nil 2017: $7 million and the non-current element is $17 million 2017: $19 million.
The current element of derivative financial liabilities is$2 million 2017: $nil and the non-current element is $17 million 2017: $nil.
Total net derivative financial instruments is a liability of $2 million 2017: asset $26 million.
No transfers between levels occurred during the current or prior year.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market such as over-the-counter derivatives is determined by using valuation techniques.
The Groups other financial instruments are measured on bases other than fair value.
Other receivables include an amount of $67million 2017:$66 million which has been discounted at a rate of 3.0 per cent 2017: 2.3 per cent due to the long-term nature of the receivable.
Other current assets and liabilities are either of short maturity or bear floating rate interest and their fair values approximate to book values.
The only non-current financial assets or liabilities for which fair value does not approximate to book value are the senior unsecured loan notes, which had a book value of $1,528 million 2017: $1,258 million and a fair value level 2 of $1,621 million 2017: $1,309 million.

126 Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic report Governance Financials Other information 23 Financial instruments and financial risk management continued Risk management policies The Group is exposed to market risks arising from its international operations and the financial instruments which fund them.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has well-defined policies for the management of interest rate, liquidity, foreign exchange and counterparty exposures, which have been consistently applied during the financial years ended 31 July 2018 and 31 July 2017.
By the nature of its business, the Group also has trade credit and commodity price exposures, the management of which is delegated tothe operating businesses.
There has been no change since the previous year in the majorfinancial risks faced by the Group.
Policies for managing each of these risks are regularly reviewed and are summarised below.
When the Group enters into derivative transactions principally interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts, the purpose of such transactions is to hedge certain interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout the period underreview, the Groups policy that no trading infinancial instruments or speculative transactions be undertaken.
Capital structure and risk management To assess the appropriateness of its capital structure based on current and forecast trading, the Groups principal measure of financial gearing is the ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA.
The Group aims to operate with investment grade credit metrics and ensure this ratio remains within 1 to 2 times.
The Groups main borrowing facilities contain a financial covenant limiting the ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA to 3.5:1.
The reconciliation of opening to closing net debt is detailed in note 30.
The Groups sources of funding currently comprise cash flows generated from operations, equity contributed by shareholders and borrowings from banks and other financial institutions.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may pay a special dividend, return capital to shareholders, repurchase its own shares, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Credit risk The Group provides sales on credit terms to most of its customers.
There isan associated risk that customers may not be able topay outstanding balances.
At 31 July 2018, the maximum exposure to credit riskwas $3,005 million 2017: $2,673 million.
Each of the Groups businesses have established procedures in place to review and collect outstanding receivables.
Significant outstanding and overdue balances are reviewed on a regular basis and resulting actions are put in place on a timely basis.
In some cases, protection is provided through credit insurance arrangements.
All of the major businesses use professional and dedicated credit teams, in some cases field-based.
Appropriate provisions are made for debts that may be impaired on a timely basis.
Concentration of credit risk in trade receivables is limited as the Groups customer base is large and unrelated.
Accordingly, the Group considers that there is no further credit risk provision required above the current provision for impairment.
The ageing of trade receivables is detailed in note 18.
The Group has cash balances deposited for short periods with financial institutions and enters into certain contracts such as interest rate swaps which entitle the Group to receive future cash flows from financial institutions.
These transactions give rise to credit risk on amounts due from counterparties with a maximum exposure of $429 million 2017: $560 million.
This risk is managed by setting credit and settlement limits for a panel of approved counterparties.
The limits are approved bythe Treasury Committee and ratings are monitored regularly.
Liquidity risk The Group maintains a policy of ensuring sufficient borrowing headroom to finance all investment and capital expenditure included in its strategic plan, with an additional contingent safety margin.
The Group has estimated its anticipated contractual cash outflows excluding interest income and income from derivatives, including interest payable in respect of its trade and other payables and bank borrowings, on an undiscounted basis.
The principal assumptions are that floating rate interest is calculated using the prevailing interest rate at the balance sheet date and cash flows in foreign currency are translated using spotrates at the balance sheet date.
These cash flows can be analysed by maturity as follows: Restated 2018 2017 Trade and Trade and other Interest other Interest payables Debt on debt Total payables Debt on debt Total $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m Due in less than one year 2,829 5 68 2,902 2,557 165 51 2,773 Due in one to two years 44 1 63 108 26 5 47 78 Due in two to three years 59 281 52 392 28 1 43 72 Due in three to four years 19 44 63 13 281 43 337 Due in four to five years 16 250 40 306 12 1 34 47 Due in over five years 160 1,001 92 1,253 159 801 84 1,044 Total 3,127 1,538 359 5,024 2,795 1,254 302 4,351 Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 127 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Year ended 31 July 2018 23 Financial instruments and financial risk management continued Liquidity risk continued The Group holds three main bank facilities: an 800 million 2017: 800 million revolving credit facility that matures in September 2021, a $290 million 2017: $190 million bi-lateral facility that matures in November 2018 and a $600 million 2017: $600 million securitisation facility thatmatures in December 2020.
This facility is secured against the trade receivables of Ferguson Enterprises Inc. All facilities were undrawn at31 July 2018 and 31 July 2017.
The maturity profile of the Groups undrawn facilities is as follows: Restated 2018 2017 $m $m Less than one year 290 190 Between one and two years Between two and three years 600 600 Between three and four years 1,050 Between four and five years 1,057 After five years Total 1,940 1,847 At 31 July 2018 the Group has total available facilities, excluding bank overdrafts, of $3,470 million 2017: $3,085 million, of which $1,530 million is drawn note 22 and $1,940 million is undrawn 2017: $1,238 million and $1,847 million respectively.
The Group does not have any debt factoring or supply chain financing arrangements.
Foreign currency risk The Group has significant overseas businesses whose revenues are mainly denominated in the currencies of the countries in which the operations are located.
Approximately 80 per cent of the Groups revenue is in US dollars.
Within each country it operates, the Group does not have significant transactional foreign currency cash flow exposures.
However, those that do arise may be hedged with either forward contracts orcurrency options.
The Group does not normally hedge profit translation exposure since such hedges have only a temporary effect.
The Groups policy is to adjust the currencies in which its net debt is denominated materially to match the currencies in which its trading profit is generated.
Details of average exchange rates used in the translation of overseas earnings and of year-end exchange rates used in the translation ofoverseas balance sheets for the principal currencies used by the Group are shown in the five-year summary on page 151.
The net effect of currencytranslation was to increase revenue by $229 million 2017: decrease by $391 million and to increase trading profit by $7 million 2017: decrease by $6 million.
These currency effects primarily reflect a movement of the average US dollar exchange rate against pounds sterling, euroand Canadian dollars as follows: 2018 2017 Strengthening Weakening weakening of USD of USD Pounds sterling 6.4% 13.3% Euro 9.2% 1.6% Canadian dollars 4.0% 0.2% The Group has net financial liabilities denominated in foreign currencies which have been designated as hedges of the net investment in its overseas subsidiaries.
The principal value of those financial liabilities designated as hedges at the balance sheet date was $431 million 2017: pounds sterling equivalent of $2,019 million.
The loss on translation of these financial instruments into US dollars of $11 million 2017: pounds sterling equivalent of $8 million has been taken to the translation reserve.

Gains and losses on those hedging instruments designated as hedges of the net investments in foreign operations are recognised in equity to the extent that the hedging relationship is effective.
These amounts are included in exchange differences on translation of foreign operations as stated in the Groupstatement of comprehensive income.
Gains and losses relating to hedge ineffectiveness are recognised immediately in the income statement for the period.
Gains and losses accumulated in the translation reserve are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
Interest rate risk At 31 July 2018, 70 per cent of loans were at fixed rates.
The Group borrows in the desired currencies principally at rates determined by reference to short-term benchmark rates applicable to the relevant currency or market, such as LIBOR.
Rates which reset at least every 12 months are regarded as floating rates and the Group then, if appropriate, considers interest rate swaps to generate the desiredinterestrate profile.
The Group reviews deposits and borrowings by currency at Treasury Committee and Board meetings.
The Treasury Committee gives prior approval to any variations from floating rate arrangements.
The interest rate profile of the Groups net debt including the effect of interest rate swaps is set out below: Restated 2018 2017 Floating Fixed Total Floating Fixed Total $m $m $m $m $m $m US dollars 217 1,082 1,299 475 1,243 768 Pounds sterling 101 4 97 73 4 69 Euro, Danish kroner and Swedish kronor 23 23 8 8 Other currencies 99 99 15 15 Total 6 1,086 1,080 541 1,247 706 The Groups weighted average cost of debt is 4.0 per cent.
Fixed rate borrowings at 31 July 2018 carried a weighted average interest rate of 3.4 per cent fixed for a weighted average duration of 6.6 years 31 July 2017: 3.3 per cent for 6.5 years.
Floating rate borrowings, excluding overdrafts, at 31 July 2018 had a weighted average interest rate of 2.6 per cent 31 July 2017: the Group had no floating rate borrowings, excluding overdrafts.
In November 2017, the Group entered into interest rate swap contracts comprising fixed interest receivable on $355 million of notional principal.
These contracts expire between November 2023 and November 2026 and the fixed interest rates range between 3.30 per cent and 3.51 per cent.
These swaps were designated as a fair value hedge against a portion of the Groups outstanding debt.
The table below shows the income statement movement on interest rate swaps at fair value through profit and loss: Restated 2018 2017 $m $m At 1 August 26 38 Settled 9 12 Valuation loss debited to income statement 17 At 31 July 26 Monitoring interest rate and foreign currency risk The Group monitors its interest rate and foreign currency risk by reviewing the effect on financial instruments over various periods of a range of possible changes in interest rates and exchange rates.
The financial impact for reasonable approximation of possible changes in interest rates and exchange rates are as follows.
The Group has estimated that an increase of one per cent in the principal floating interest rates to which it is exposed would result in a charge to the income statement of $nil 2017: $nil.
The Group has estimated that a weakening of the US dollar by 10 per cent against gross borrowings denominated in a foreign currency in which the Group does business wouldresult in a charge to the currency translation reserve of $4 million 2017: $146 million.
The Group does not consider that there is a useful way of quantifying theGroups exposure to any of the macroeconomic variables that might affect the collectability of receivables or the prices of commodities.

This amount has been actuarially determined as at 31 July 2018 based on advice from independent professional advisers.
The Group has insurance that it currently believes significantly covers the estimated liability and accordingly an insurance receivable has been recorded in other receivables.
Based on current estimates, theamount of performing insurance cover significantly exceeds the expected level of future claims and no material profit or cash flow impact is therefore expected to arisein the foreseeable future.
Due to the nature of these provisions, the timing of any settlements is uncertain.
Wolseley Insurance provisions represent an estimate, based on historical experience, of the ultimate cost of settling outstanding claims andclaims incurred but not reported on certain risks retained by the Group principally USA casualty and global property damage.
Due tothenature of these provisions, the timing of any settlements is uncertain.
Restructuring provisions include provisions for staff redundancy costs and future lease rentals on closed branches.
The weighted average maturity ofthese obligations is approximately three years.
Other provisions include warranty costs relating to businesses disposed of, rental commitments on vacant properties and dilapidations onleased properties.
The weighted average maturity of these obligations is approximately three years.
130 Ferguson plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic report Governance Financials Other information 25 Retirement benefit obligations i Long-term benefit plans provided by the Group The principal UK defined benefit plan is the Wolseley Group Retirement Benefits Plan which provides benefits based on final pensionable salaries.
This plan was closed to new entrants in 2009.
The assets are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The Group contribution rate is calculated on the Projected Unit Credit Method and agreed with an independent consulting actuary.
The Group Retirement Benefits Plan wasclosed to future service accrual in December 2013 and was replaced byadefined contribution plan.
During October 2016, the plan was closed for future non-inflationary salary accrual.
In 2017, the Group secured a buy-in insurance policy with Pension Insurance Corporation PIC for the UK pension plan.
This policy covered all ofthe pensioner members of the plan at the time and exactly matches the benefits provided by the plan.
The deferred members of the plan at the time were not covered by this policy.
The insurance asset is valued as exactly equal to the insured liabilities.
The principal plans operated for USA employees are defined contribution plans, which are established in accordance with USA 401k rules.
Companies contribute to both employee compensation deferral and profit sharing plans.
The Group completed a buy out of its primary defined benefit plan in the USA during the year.
In Canada, defined benefit plans and a defined contribution plan are operated.
Most of the Canadian defined benefit plans are funded.
The contribution rate is calculated on the Projected Unit Credit Method asagreed with independent consulting actuaries.
The Group operates a number of smaller defined benefit and defined contribution plans providing pensions or other long-term benefits such as long service or termination awards.
Investment policy The Groups investment strategy for its funded post-employment plans is decided locally and, if relevant, by the trustees of the plan and takes account of the relevant statutory requirements.
The Groups objective for the investment strategy is to achieve a target rate of return in excess ofthe increase in the liabilities, while taking an acceptable amount of investment risk relative to the liabilities.
This objective is implemented by using specific allocations to a variety ofasset classes that are expected over the long term to deliver the target rate of return.
Most investment strategies have significant allocations to equities, with the intention that this will result in the ongoing cost to the Group of the post-employment plans being lower over the long term andwithin acceptable boundaries of risk.
For the UK plan, the buy-in insurance policy represents approximately 30 per cent of the plan assets.
For the remaining assets, the strategy is toinvest in a balanced portfolio of equities, government bonds and corporate bonds.
The investment strategy is subject to regular review bythe plan trustees in consultation with the Company.
For the overseas plans, the investment strategy involves the investment in defined levels, predominantly equities with the remainder of the assets being invested in cash and bonds.
Investment risk The present value of the UK defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to high quality corporate bond yields: if the actual return on plan assets is below this rate, it will decrease a net surplus or increase a net pension liability.
Currently, the plan has a relatively balanced investment in equity securities, debt instruments and property.
Due to the long-term nature of the plan liabilities, the trustees of the pension plan consider it appropriate that a reasonable portion of the plan assets should be invested in equity securities toleverage the return generated by the fund.
Interest risk A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the UK plan liability and this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans debt investments.
Longevity risk The present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of the UK plan participants both during and after their employment.
An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plans liability.

Further adjustments may be necessary when additional information is available for some of the judgemental areas.
The goodwill arising on these acquisitions is attributable to the anticipated profitability of the new markets and product ranges to which the Group hasgained access and additional profitability and operating efficiencies available in respect of existing markets.
The acquisitions contributed $187 million to revenue, $6 million to trading profit and $3 million loss to the Groups operating profit for the period between the date of acquisition and the balance sheet date.
It is not practicable to disclose profit before and after tax, as the Group manages itsborrowings asaportfolio and cannot attribute an effective borrowing rate to an individual acquisition.
If each acquisition had been completed on the first day of the financial year, continuing revenue would have been $21,000 million and continuing trading profit would have been $1,532 million.
It is not practicable to disclose profit before tax or profit attributable to shareholders of the Company, asstated above.
It is also not practicable to disclose operating profit as the Group cannot estimate the amount of intangible assets thatwould havebeen acquired at a date other than the acquisition date.

In the case of unfavourable outcomes, the Group maybenefit from applicable insurance protection.
Warranties and indemnities in relation to business disposals Over the past few years, the Group has disposed of a number of non-core businesses and various Group companies have provided certain standard warranties and indemnities to acquirers and other third parties.
Provision is made where the Group considers that a liability is likely tocrystallise, though it is possible that claims in respect of which no provision has been made could crystallise in the future.
Group companieshave also made contractual commitments for certain property and other obligations which could be called upon in an eventofdefault.

Environmental liabilities The operations of certain Group companies are subject tospecific environmental regulations.

Where an obligation toremediate contamination arises, this is provided for, though future liabilities could arise from sites for which no provision is made.
Outcome of claims and litigation The outcome of claims and litigation to which Group companies are party cannot readily be foreseen as, in some cases, the facts are unclear, further time is needed to assess properly the merits of the case, or they are part of continuing legal proceedings.
However, based on information currently available, the Directors consider that the cost to the Group of an unfavourable outcome arising from such litigation is not expected tohave a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Group.
