The fair value of equity settled share-based payments is determined at the date of grant and is either expensed in income statement if it relates to employees of the company or capitalised as an investment in the relevant subsidiary if it relates to the employees of a subsidiary company, with a corresponding increase in equity, and amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the companys estimate of the shares that will eventually vest.
The amount expensed or capitalised is adjusted over the vesting period for changes in the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest, save for changes resulting from any market-related performance conditions.
The company also issues cash-settled share-based payments to certain employees, which are recognised as a liability at fair value at the date of grant.
The value of the liability is re-measured at each reporting date and at the date on which the liability is settled.
The fair value of cash settled share-based payments is expensed in the income statement if it relates to employees of the company and capitalised as an investment in the relevant subsidiary if it relates to employees of a subsidiary company.
Financial guarantees The company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the Group.
The company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such.
The company therefore treats such contracts as a contingent liability unless and until such time as it becomes probable that the company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
The contingent liabilities are disclosed in note t. d Adoption of new and revised accounting standards and interpretations The company has applied IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments for the first time in the year ended 31 December 2018.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers The company has adopted IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers with effect from 1 January 2018 and has prepared its financial statements in accordance with the requirements of this new standard.
The company has chosen to apply the standard fully retrospectively and has restated comparatives where appropriate.
The company derives its revenue principally from its group companies as license or royalty fees by providing them intellectual property rights.
The license or royalty fees is determined based on pre-defined terms as per the terms of the contract.
The impact of adopting IFRS 15 on the companys financial position as at 31 December 2017 and as at 1 January 2017 was nil.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments The company has adopted IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with effect from 1 January 2018, and has prepared its financial statements in accordance with the requirements of this new standard.
The new standard is applicable to the classification, measurement, impairment and re-categorisation of financial assets and liabilities.
It also introduces a new hedge accounting model.
There has been no material change to the company's statement of other comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity or statement of financial position on adoption.
The company has no financial liabilities held at fair value other than derivatives.
The introduction of an expected-loss impairment model has had no material effect given the general quality and short-term nature of the company's trade receivables.
There has been no re-categorisation of assets on adoption of the new standard and the company's existing hedging relationships have been assessed as compliant with the new requirements following a review of the existing hedging arrangements.
Hedge accounting The company has adopted the new general hedge accounting model in IFRS 9.
This requires the company to ensure that hedge accounting relationships are aligned with its risk management objectives and strategy, and to apply a more qualitative and forward-looking approach to assessing hedge effectiveness.
Following a review of the companys hedging arrangements, the company has determined that its existing hedges are compliant with the new requirements.
In accordance with the accounting policy, the company has elected to present separately the cost of hedging reserve in equity.
Transition Changes in accounting policies resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 have been applied retrospectively.
Other than described above, the company has not made any voluntary elections on adoption.

The fair values are calculated using discounted cash flow models.
The relevant currency yield curve is used to forecast the floating rate cash flows anticipated under the instrument, which are discounted back to the balance sheet date.
Currency risk and cross-currency swaps The Group conducts business in many currencies.
The Group presents its consolidated financial statements in Sterling and as a consequence is subject to foreign exchange risk due to the translation of the results and net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.
The company, together with its subsidiary G4S International Finance plc, hedges a substantial portion of the Groups exposure to fluctuations in the translation into sterling of the Groups overseas net assets by holding loans in foreign currencies.
On consolidation, translation adjustments arising on the translation of foreign currency loans are recognised in equity to match translation adjustments on foreign currency equity investments as they qualify as net investment hedges.
However, in the companys own financial statements, translation adjustments arising on the translation of foreign currency loans are recognised in the income statement and are in part hedged by cross currency swaps.
The company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage part of the foreign currency risk associated with non functional currency debt.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve within equity.
The ineffective portion of movements in the fair value of hedging instruments is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.
There were no cross-currency interest rate swaps outstanding as at 31 December 2018 2017: 12m.
Cost of Hedging Currency basis is considered an unavoidable cost of the derivatives that the company uses in cash flow hedges.
Currency basis spread is an element that is only present in the hedging instrument, but not in a hedged item that is a single currency exposure.
As such, when designating the foreign currency transactions, the Group has excluded the currency basis spread.
The change in fair market value which relates to currency basis spread is recognised in OCI in a separate component of equity: cost of hedging reserve.
The balance held in this reserve was nil 2017: nil.
Integrated Report and Accounts 2018 G4S plc 223 220 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2018 NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED j Derivative financial instruments continued Interest rate risk and interest rate swaps Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the company to fair value interest rate risk, which the company manages within policy limits approved by the directors.
When fixed floating interest rate debt in the preferred mix is unavailable directly from investors, interest rate swaps are utilised to create the desired blend in accordance with Group Treasury policy which is to maintain a fixed percentage of debt within the range of 25% to 75%.
The quantity of interest rate swaps outstanding in the company is expected to continue to decline as treasury activity is increasingly conducted by G4S International Finance plc.
The 350m public notes have a coupon step-up of 1.25%, which is triggered should the credit rating of the company fall below investment grade.
k Retirement benefit obligations The company is the sponsoring company for the Groups UK defined benefit pension scheme, to which it provides a guarantee over all payments to be made to the scheme by the operating companies.

A deferred tax asset of 43m 2017: 49m has been recognised in respect of these unutilised tax losses based on expected forecast profitability from approved budgets and business plans.
The recognition of deferred tax assets on tax losses is predicated on the projected generation of income in the company which should result in the utilisation of the available tax losses within a foreseeable period.

In addition, the company has estimated capital losses of approximately 2.7bn 2017: 2.6bn of which 139m 2017: 15m have been agreed with HMRC.
