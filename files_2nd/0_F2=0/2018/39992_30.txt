Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
REFERENCE INFORMATION Sirius Minerals Plc the Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006 Registration number 04948435.
The Company is registered in England and its registered address is 3rd floor, Greener House, 68 Haymarket, London, SW1Y 4RF.
BASIS OF PREPARATION These consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries together, the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The standards used are those published by the International Accounting Standards Board and endorsed by the EU as at 31 December2018.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by financial assets and financial liabilities principally derivatives stated at fair value through profit or loss.
The principal accounting policies set out both below and throughout the subsequent notes have been consistently applied to all years presented unless otherwise stated.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling rounded to the nearest million, which is the functional currency of the Company and its principal subsidiaries.
GOING CONCERN These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The Group continues to incur significant cash outflows due to the development activity that it is undertaking of its polyhalite project in North Yorkshire the Project.
The stage 1 financing conducted in November 2016 generated sufficient funds to allow the Group to commence construction of the Project.
As a result, the Group held total cash and cash equivalents and bank deposits of 230.1m at 31 December 2018 31 December 2017: 394.0m.
The Group does not currently anticipate generating any positive net cash flows from the Project until 2023.
Therefore, its ability to continue as a going concern for the time being is dependent upon it securing sufficient funding from external parties to enable it to complete development of the Project.
The Group is currently working towards obtaining financial commitments that will allow it to complete development of the Project the stage 2 financing to a point at which it would be able to generate sufficient cash flows to operate profitably and without need for additional fundraisings.
In order to meet the Groups funding needs prior to financial close of stage 2 financing, on 30 April 2019 the Directors approved a plan for the Group to raise US$400 million from the issuance of new ordinary shares in the Company.
The Board of Directors believes that both the US$400 million equity issuance and the stage 2 financing will be successfully completed, however there is a risk that a successful outcome may not be reached.
This therefore represents a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt upon the Groups ability to continue as a going concern.
The Groups latest cash flow forecasts indicate that, including the receipt of the funds from the equity issuance of US$400 million, it will have sufficient liquidity to continue development of the Project on its current schedule into Q3 of 2019, when proceeds from the stage 2 financing will be required.
Should the Group need to continue operating without the stage 2 financing, it would need to curtail discretionary expenditures until further financing was secured but this would significantly threaten the Groups ability to continue as a going concern.
Having assessed the principal risks and having regard for the above, based on the current likelihood of the success of the US$400 million equity issuance and stage 2 financing, the Directors consider it appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing these financial statements.
Therefore, these financial statements do not include any adjustments that would result if the going concern basis of preparation was inappropriate.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION The Groups consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements made up to 31 December each year of the Company and all of its subsidiaries over which it has control.
All intra-group transactions and balances are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
The Groups associates being entities over which the Group has significant influence but not outright control are not consolidated in the same way as the Groups controlled subsidiaries, but instead are accounted for using the equity method.
See note 9 for further details of the accounting for associates.
98 Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Additional Information ACCOUNTING POLICIES Accounting policies that are material to the financial statements are generally described in the specific note in relation to the individual component of the financial statements indicated by a symbol.
The accounting policies set out in the following paragraphs within this note are considered to be general to the financial statements and not covered by a specific subsequent note.
Segment reporting IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires information to be disclosed about each business activity and economic environment in which the Group operates.
Management has determined the operating segments by considering the business from both a geographic and activity perspective.
The Group is currently organised into one business division the UK segment which consists of project-related activities and the corporate operations.
This division is the segment for which the Group reports information internally to the Board of Directors.
The Groups only material non-UK operations are in its investments in associates in South America.
Note 9 provides detailed disclosures over the performance of these investments during the year as well as their carrying value at year-end.
These investments in associates are the only non-current assets that the Group holds in any country other than the UK.
Therefore, all disclosures required under IFRS 8 are already included elsewhere in these financial statements and so no further segment information requires disclosure.
Foreign currencies The presentation currency of the Group and functional currency of the majority of the Groups subsidiaries is Sterling.
Transactions denominated in a foreign currency are translated into Sterling at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of the transaction.
At the balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at the rate prevailing at that date.
Allexchange differences that are not designated within effective cash flow hedges at the end of the period are reported as part of finance costs in the income statement.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations which have a functional currency other than Sterling are translated into Sterling at foreign exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
The expenses of these subsidiary undertakings are translated at average exchange rates applicable in the period.
All resulting exchange differences are recognised through other comprehensive income and accumulated within other reserves.
Upon the disposal or dissolution of foreign subsidiaries, all historic exchange differences associated with that subsidiary are recycled from other reserves through the income statement.
The year-end rate which was applied in translating balances denominated in US Dollars into Sterling in the financial statements at 31December 2018 was 1 $1.27 2017: 1 $1.35.
The average exchange rate which was applied to US Dollar transactions occurring during 2018 was 1 $1.34 2017: 1 $1.29.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include various instant-access deposits and short-term fixed deposits with maturities of three months or less from the date in which they were entered into.
Bank deposits Amounts reported as bank deposits represent short-term investments held by the Group with maturities on deposit date in excess of threemonths, which the Group intends to hold until maturity, at which point it will receive cash from the counterparty.
These amounts are recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
NEW AND AMENDED STANDARDS ADOPTED BY THE GROUP All accounting policies applied by the Group in the preparation of these financial statements are consistent with those applied and disclosed in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017, other than the Groups accounting policies for financial instruments which have been updated for the impact of IFRS 9, as described below.
The Group adopted the new IFRS standard IFRS 9 Financial Instruments on 1 January 2018 which was its mandatory date for adoption.
The standard provides updated principles around the classification and measurement of financial instruments compared to its predecessor IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
The initial adoption of IFRS 9 has not caused any changes in the measurement of any financial instruments recognised by the Group either in the current or comparative year, nor has it impacted the Groups accounting for its unrecognised financial instruments principally, the US$250 million royalty financing agreement prior to its drawdown during 2018.
Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 99 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1.
REFERENCE INFORMATION CONTINUED IFRS 16 Leases will become mandatory for the Group to adopt from 1 January 2019.
IFRS 16 provides new principles around accounting for leases compared to its predecessor, IAS 17 Leases, with which the accounting policies used in the preparation of these financial statements comply.
The main change of IFRS 16 compared to the existing IAS 17 will be that future liabilities in respect of operating leases will be recognised on the balance sheet at the inception of a lease, alongside a corresponding right-of-use asset.
This contrasts with the existing treatment of such leases whereby the only liabilities recognised in respect of operating leases are cash amounts outstanding for lease periods up to the balance sheet date which have not yet been paid over to the lessor.
The Group is party to a large volume of lease transactions relating to its ongoing access to mineral deposits around the Projects area ofinterest.
Consistent with IAS 17, the scope of IFRS 16 specifically excludes its application to leases of mineral rights, therefore the adoption of IFRS 16 will have no impact upon the Groups existing accounting policy for these leases.
The Group is also party to a number of other operating lease contracts whose accounting will be modified by the transition to IFRS 16.
However, the fair value of the liabilities due under these leases is, in aggregate, immaterial to the Group and therefore it is not currently expected that initial adoption ofIFRS 16 will materially impact the value of the Groups reported assets or liabilities.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS In the preparation of these financial statements, the Groups management was required to exercise significant judgement in applying the Groups accounting policies in accounting for the royalty financing commitment prior to its drawdown.
The Group entered into the royalty financing agreement during 2016.
Significant judgement was required in determining how the agreement should be accounted for due to the lack of explicit guidance for these types of arrangements under IFRS.
Based on the precise contractual terms of the agreement, the Group concluded that the agreement should be accounted for as a financial instrument, to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 9 and, previously, IAS 39.
Furthermore, the Group concluded that prior to drawdown occurring, the agreement is analogous to a loan commitment and therefore no recognition of it was necessary in the financial statements until drawdown occurred.
There were no further significant judgements that the Groups management was required to make in these financial statements in applying the Groups accounting policies.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of these financial statements has required the use of estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, withrevisions recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
The most significant area of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that has a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities within the next financial year is in the estimation of the fair value of the convertible loans embedded derivative.
In addition, although it is not expected to lead to a material adjustment to the carrying value ofassets or liabilities in the next financial year, the estimation of the fair value of the royalty financing embedded derivative will be asignificant area of estimation uncertainty in future years once more certainty is gained around the level of future revenues and consequent royalty payments.
Derivative financial instruments held by the Group do not have observable market prices and so the Group is required to identify appropriate valuation models in calculating these fair values.
In making its estimates, priority is given to inputs based on actual market data and transactions, although these valuations nevertheless require some level of subjective assessment and the use of different valuation assumptions could have a significant impact upon the Groups reported financial performance and position.
Further information is given within note 24 around the valuation methods and sources of estimation uncertainty around each of the Groups derivatives.

Total directors emoluments and emoluments of the highest-paid Director, together with full details of Directors remuneration, pensions and benefits in kind are given in the Remuneration Committee Report.
NET FINANCE INCOME COSTS Interest income is accrued using the effective interest rate method.
Interest expense is expensed as incurred except where it relates to the financing of construction or development of qualifying assets.
Interest on borrowings directly relating to the financing of qualifying assets in the course of construction is added to the capitalised cost of those projects under capital works in progress, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Where funds have been borrowed specifically to finance a project, the amount capitalised represents the actual borrowing costs incurred net of all interest income earned on the temporary re-investment of those borrowings prior to utilisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised as part of interest expense in the period in which they are incurred.

TAXATION Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Research and development tax credits are recognised within current tax in the period in which they can be reasonably estimated.
2018 2017 m m Corporation tax credit receivable 1.0 0.4 Total tax recognised in statement of comprehensive income 1.0 0.4 The tax credit for the year is lower 2017: lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK for the year ended 31 December 2018 of 19% 2017: 19.25%.
The differences are explained below: 2018 2017 m m Loss on ordinary activities before taxation 13.5 79.3 Loss on ordinary activities multiplied by the standard rate of corporation taxation in the UK of 19% 2017:19.25% 2.6 15.3 Taxation effects of: Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 2.5 8.0 Tax losses not recognised see note 20 0.1 7.3 Research and development tax credit 1.0 0.4 Total tax credit for the year 1.0 0.4 The standard rate of corporation tax changed from 20% to 19% from 1 April 2017.
Accordingly the Groups loss for the year is taxed at an effective rate of 19% 2017: 19.25%.
Changes to the UK corporation tax rates were substantively enacted as part of the Finance Bill 2017 on 6 September 2016.
These include reductions to the main rate to reduce the rate to 17% from 1 April 2020.
Deferred taxes at the balance sheet date have been measured using these enacted tax rates and reflected in these financial statements.
The research and development tax credit is in relation to the HMRC Research and Development Relief Scheme for SMEs and enables the Group to realise tax losses on certain qualifying expenditure to be received immediately in cash rather than waiting for taxable profits to set them against in the future.
LOSS PER SHARE Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the total loss attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number ofordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted loss per share is calculated by adjusting the total loss for the year to reverse any recognised dilutive gains recognised in the total loss for the year, as well as by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares as if all classes of dilutive potential ordinary shares had been issued at the beginning of the year.
In 2018, the only dilutive potential ordinary shares that existed and were relevant to the calculation of diluted loss per share were in relation to the Hancock US$50 million equity investment derivative detailed in note 17.
This instrument was anti-dilutive in 2017 therefore there is no difference between basic and diluted loss per share in that year.
All other potential ordinary shares that the Group has in issuance as detailed in note 12 are anti-dilutive in both years presented.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS EXPLORATION COSTS AND RIGHTS Costs arising from exploration and evaluation activities are accumulated separately for each area of interest and onlycapitalised as part of intangible assets where such costs are expected to be recouped through successful development.
Expenditure capitalised comprises direct costs that have a specific connection with a particular areaofinterest.
Capitalised expenditure in respect of areas of interest is written off in the income statement when the above criteria donot apply or when the Directors assess that the carrying value may exceed the expected recoverable amount.
Capitalised costs in respect of an area of interest that is abandoned are written off in the period in which the decision to abandon is made.
When technical feasibility and commercial viability of an area of interest have been demonstrated, all capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure in respect of that area of interest is reclassified from intangible assets to capital works in progress within property, plant and equipment.
All subsequent development expenditures on that area of interest are capitalised and classified as capital works in progress within property, plant and equipment, provided commercial viability conditions continue to be satisfied.
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND GOODWILL On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of subsidiaries are measured at their fair values atthedate of acquisition.
Any excess of cost of acquisition over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Goodwill arising on consolidation is recognised as an asset and allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.
Any goodwill recognised is stated at cost less accumulated impairment and any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
OTHER INTANGIBLES Research expenditure is expensed to the income statement as incurred.
Development costs on activities that havemoved past the research phase are capitalised and depreciated over their expected useful lives.
Prior to any sales occurring of the products to which the development costs relate, they are held at cost and tested annually forimpairment.
Computer software is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairments, and is amortised on a straightline basis over its useful life ranging between three and five years.
Amortisation of software is included within operating costs in the income statement.
IMPAIRMENT At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that any of its intangible assets may be impaired.
Where an indication of impairment exists or, on an annual basis in the case of any assets that have not been amortised in the year, the Group makes aformal estimate of recoverable amount.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount estimated as the value-in-use of the asset, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances based on the Groups latest approved forecasts.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less depreciation and any recognised impairment losses.
Cost includes all expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of these items and, for assets that take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use, include borrowing costs.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the costs can be measured reliably.
All other costs, including repairs and maintenance costs, are charged to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Capital works in progress include all spend directly attributable to the development of the Project, including buildings, civil works, equipment, labour, direct services and professional fees.
These assets are not depreciated.
At the point intime in the future when the Project commences production, all assets within this category will be transferred to appropriate separate asset classes and depreciation will commence from that point.
The plant and equipment category currently represents assets used for general administrative purposes and which are not directly involved in development of the Project, including the Groups head office leasehold improvements and IT hardware.
Depreciation is provided on all assets within this category over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are generally between three and five years.
Freehold land is not depreciated.

INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence but not overall control.
Significant influence ispresumed to exist where the Group has over 20% of the voting rights, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that this presumption is not the case.
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity-accounting method.
The total carrying values of investments in associates represent the initial cost of each investment including the carrying value of goodwill, the share of post-acquisition retained earnings and any other movements in reserves.
Thecarrying values of associates are regularly reviewed and if there is objective evidence that an impairment in value has occurred as a result of one or more events during the period, the investment is impaired down to its estimated recoverable value.
On 26 November 2018 the Group acquired 30% of the ordinary share capital of each of Cibrafertil Companhia Brasileira fide Fertilizantes Cibrafertil and Cibra Trading Inc Cibra Trading from the Omimex Group.
On this date it was judged that the Group had gained significant influence over the two companies and that they should be accounted for as associates under the equity method.
Both associates are private companies for which there are no quoted market prices available for their shares.
There are no contingent liabilities relating to the Groups interest in either associate.
Set out below is summarised financial information covering the period over which the Group had significant influence over the associates from 26 November and at 31 December 2018.
The losses incurred in this period are reflective of the seasonality of the associates businesses in relation to the portion of the year in which the Group began accounting for them.
All of Cibra Tradings revenues are in respect of sales made to Cibrafertil.

RESTRICTED CASH Restricted cash represents amounts set aside by the Group in bank accounts and which are not available for general use due to contractual restrictions.
Amounts are reclassified from restricted cash to cash and cash equivalents when the contractual restrictions expire.
All amounts are classified as non-current except for those amounts which are expected to be released back to the Group within the next 12 months which are classified as current assets.

SHARE CAPITAL An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting allofits liabilities.
Equity instruments generally ordinary shares issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, with the par value of shares issued being recorded within ordinary share capital and any surplus, net of anydirect issue costs, being recorded in the share premium account.
The Company has only one class of share capital, being ordinary shares with a par value of 0.25p each.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain Directors and employees.
Equity-settled sharebased payments are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
For employees employed directly in relation to the Project, any charge in relation to options or awards held by them is capitalised as part of additions to property, plant and equipment.
At each reporting date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options and awards that are expected to vest and immediately recognises any impact of the revision to original estimates.
The accumulated expense recorded prior to vesting in respect of each share-based payment is recognised within theshare-based payment reserve and reclassified to share capital upon the issuance of the underlying shares.
If fully vested share options are not exercised and expire then the accumulated expense in respect of these is reclassified to accumulated losses.
The Group operates four equity-settled share-based payment arrangements as part of its employee remuneration strategy, which aredetailed below.
All shares to be issued under each of the schemes are ordinary shares in the Company.
The total expense recognised within the income statement in relation to equity-settled share-based payment transactions inthe year is 1.4 million 2017: 0.8 million.
Further amounts of 0.8 million 2017: 1.2 million have been capitalised within property, plant and equipment in relation to the fair value of share-based payments earned by employees who are employed solely on direct development work on the Project.
Share options The Groups share option scheme historically provided for the grant of share options to certain parties at stipulated exercise prices.
The options are generally conditional upon the completion of a set service period between one and three years and typically expire ten years after grant date.
The Group used the Black-Scholes model to value the share options that it awarded under the scheme.
The options outstanding at 31 December 2018 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 4.3 years 2017: 3.9 years and exercise prices between 10.2p and 34.0p 2017: 10.2p and 43.7p.
For the options exercised during 2018, the weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 30.26p.

PROVISIONS The Group is required to rehabilitate sites and associated facilities during construction and at the end of their lives toacondition acceptable to the relevant authorities in compliance with licence requirements and other commitments made to stakeholders.
The costs associated with these obligations are provided for in the accounting period when theobligation arising from the related disturbance occurs.
Such costs do not include any additional obligations which are expected to arise from disturbance expected to be caused in future years.
Provisions are initially recognised at the net present value of the future cash flows associated with them.
When provisions are initially recognised, the corresponding cost is capitalised as an asset within property, plant and equipment, representing part of the cost of acquiring the future economic benefits of the operation.
Any change inthenet present value of provisions due to the unwinding of the discount in relation to the time value of money is recognised in finance costs within the income statement in the period in which the change in discount factor occurs.
2018 2017 m m At 1 January 2.8 New amounts capitalised as part of property, plant and equipment 2.2 2.8 Charged to the income statement 0.1 At 31 December 5.1 2.8 The Groups development work on the Project gives rise to the future need to undertake restoration activities in order to maintain compliance with relevant planning consents.
The Groups obligation is to undertake restoration activities at the end of the Projects lifeinorder to restore sites to their previous character.
In order to estimate the value of the provision, the Group has relied upon valuations which were undertaken for the purposes of determining the value of local security requirements that are held in restricted cash at the end of the year.
These amounts were valued bythird parties based on the estimated present-day cost that would be required to remediate the disruption caused by the Groups activities by the end of the year.
These costs, which the Group does not plan to be incurred for in excess of 50 years, have been discounted at a real risk-free rate of 2% per annum, based on an estimate of the long-term, risk-free, cost of borrowing.

ROYALTY FINANCING The royalty financing is a financial instrument committing the Group to make future royalty payments over the life of the Project in return for an up-front payment by Hancock.
The contract commits the Group to make cash payments linked to its revenues and is therefore a financial liability.
In substance, the royalty agreement means that the Group receives cash up-front from the counterparty, who will be repaid over the Projects life through royalty payments, analogous to a loan arrangement.
Therefore, the royalty instrument is treated as a financial liability measured under amortised cost, with the value on initial recognition being equal to its fair value, which is the value of the cash that wasreceived on drawdown.
Each period, an interest charge is recognised, with the interest rate applied being the instruments internal rate of return which discounts the present value of all expected cash flows over the royaltys life back to the value of the proceeds received on the drawdown date.
The exact value of royalty payments that will be made over the life of the royalty is not fixed, but will vary based on theexact level of revenues achieved by the Group.
This uncertainty over future cash flows represents an embedded derivative to be measured at fair value which must be separately accounted for from the host royalty liability.
This embedded derivative is valued as the discounted present value of all differences in expected royalty payments between the expectation prevailing on the drawdown date and the latest period-end date.
The Group will report aderivative liability asset when the present value of royalty payments due to Hancock is expected to be greater lower than those originally forecast because of expected revenues being higher lower than those originally forecast, meaning that the Groups royalty payments will then be higher lower.
On the drawdown date, the embedded derivative was designated as a hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge relationship and so any forecast changes in cash flows are accounted for through other comprehensive income rather than the income statement.
On 19 September 2018, Hancock British Holdings Limited Hancock paid the Group US$250 million in return for future royalty payments amounting to 5% of gross revenues on the first 13 million tonnes of product sold in each calendar year and a further 1% ofgross revenues on sales in excess of 13 million tonnes, for the life of the Project.
On receipt of the US$250 million cash, a corresponding host US Dollar-denominated royalty liability of the same amount was recognised in respect of the present value of future royalty payments that the Group expects to pay Hancock over the Projects life.
As a US Dollardenominated liability, the host royalty liability will give rise to foreign exchange volatility in respect of foreign exchange fluctuations that arise in each period from translating the underlying liability back into the Companys functional currency of Sterling based on the Sterling US Dollar exchange rate prevailing at the period-end date compared to the exchange rate at the start of each period.
On the drawdown date, the Group designated the host liability as a hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge relationship against the Groups future US Dollar-denominated revenues.
Therefore all foreign exchange gains and losses arising on the host royalty liability will be recognised through the statement of comprehensive income instead of finance costs within the income statement and accumulated within the cash flow hedge reserve within equity.
Accumulated foreign exchange differences will be recycled out of the cash flow hedge reserve through the income statement in the periods in which the underlying revenue transactions are expected to occur.
The value of the host royalty liability has moved in the year as follows: 2018 Value of host royalty liability m Outstanding at 1 January Drawdown in the year 190.1 Interest charged 12.0 Foreign exchange movements 6.4 Outstanding at 31 December 208.5 On the drawdown date, the Group designated the royaltys embedded derivative as a hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge relationship against the Groups future revenues.
This is on the basis that any changes in the value of expected future royalty payments will be inevitably offset by changes in the Groups revenues compared to the original drawdown-date expectation.
Therefore all fair value gains or losses upon re-measurement of the derivative will be recorded through the statement of comprehensive income instead of finance costs within the income statement and accumulated within the cash flow hedge reserve within equity.
Accumulated fair value differences will be recycled out of the cash flow hedge reserve through the income statement in the same periods as differences occur between royalty payments anticipated on the drawdown date and royalty payments actually due.
On 31 December 2018 the embedded derivative had nil value as there was no difference between the latest expectation of royalty payments due and the expectation that prevailed on the drawdown date.
Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 111 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 16.
CONVERTIBLE LOANS Convertible loans represent liabilities entered into by the Group which are principally loans that require repayment, but which may ultimately be settled by conversion into shares at the option of the Group and or counterparty based on the terms of a conversion element which is written into the terms of the loan contract.
Convertible loans are assessed according to the substance of the contractual arrangements.
The conversion elementof each agreement is split out of the host loan and is classified as a liability or equity on the basis of the contractual characteristics of the conversion features.
Conversion features of convertible loans denominated in theGroups functional currency of Sterling are typically classified as equity amounts and not re-measured while conversion features of convertible loans denominated in a currency other than Sterling are classified as derivative financial instruments.
All transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issuance of the convertible loans are deducted from the initial carrying value of the host loan.
These transaction costs are amortised in line with the host loan and recognised as part of finance costs.
At inception, the conversion element is separated from the host loan and is assigned a fair value based on an appropriate fair-valuation technique.
The initial carrying amount of the host loan is equal to the funds raised less thefair value attributable to the conversion option at inception and less transaction costs.
The host loan is held at amortised cost and measured using the effective interest rate method, with all interest being charged to finance costs.
Conversion elements that are derivative instruments are re-measured to fair value at each balance sheet andconversion date with any movement in fair value being recorded in finance costs.
Upon conversion, the carrying value of the host loan and conversion derivative is extinguished from liabilities and reclassified into equity as share capital and share premium.

The key terms of the convertible loans are that at any date subsequent to 8 January 2017 up until maturity a loanholder may convert their loans into ordinary shares in the Company at a conversion price of US$ 0.31 per share.
If a loanholder elected to convert prior to 28 November 2018 then, as well as receiving ordinary shares in the Company, they would also have received a make-whole cash payment equal to the total value of coupon payments that they would have been owed had they held their loans until 28 November 2018.
The Group also has a call option to redeem all loans at par should the Companys share price consistently exceed US$ 0.54 from 19 December 2018 onwards.
Loanholders may not request early cash-repayment of their loans except under certain protective clauses relating to changes of ownership in the Group.
Under the terms of the convertible loan, the Group has also been required to set aside an amount in an escrow bank account in respect of all coupon payments due until 28 November 2019, which is disclosed as part of restricted cash.
The Group is not able to use this restricted cash for any purpose other than the payment of quarterly coupons and make-whole payments.
Due to the conversion terms of the loans leading to the issuance of a fixed number of ordinary shares in the Company in return for the extinguishment of the bonds whose value is variable in terms of the Companys functional currency of Sterling, the Group has accounted for the bonds as a host loan instrument containing an embedded derivative liability in respect of the conversions features.
See note 24 for further information around the estimation of the embedded derivative.
During 2018, conversion notices in respect of 16.6% 2017: 22.4% of the US$400 million convertible loans were delivered by convertible loanholders to the Group, leading to the creation of 225.9 million 2017: 291.3 million new ordinary shares in the Company.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Derivatives are recognised by the Group when it becomes party to contractual arrangements which include derivative features on a standalone basis or embedded within a linked host non-derivative instrument.
Derivatives are measured at fair value at each reporting date with all changes in fair value being recognised within finance costs within the income statement, unless the derivatives are designated in hedge accounting relationships.
The Group does not usederivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
LOAN COMMITMENTS Loan commitments are a financial instrument, to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 9 and, previously, IAS 39.
IFRS 9 specifically excludes loan commitments from recognition and measurement prior to drawdown.
Once drawdown of the loan commitment occurs, the loan will be initially recognised at fair value generally the value of loan proceeds received and will be subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
On 25 October 2016 the Group entered into a US$250 million royalty financing agreement with Hancock.
As a loan commitment, no amounts were recognised in the financial statements in respect of it.
Drawdown of the US$250 million occurred on 19 September 2018 atwhich point it became recognised in the financial statements as disclosed further in note 15.
As part of the royalty financing agreement, Hancock is committed to subscribe for 200 million new ordinary shares in the Company for an additional consideration of US$50 million.
Hancock is required to subscribe for these shares upon the Groups securement of its stage 2 funding commitments.
A derivative liability is recognised in respect of this commitment and its fair value is measured as the difference between the fair value of the US$50 million that will be received and the fair value of 200 million new ordinary shares that will be issued onthe drawdown date.
Further information about the fair value estimation of this equity investment derivative is provided in note 24.

NET CASH CONTINUED Net cash is defined by the Group as being the total value of cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits and restricted cash, less all interest-bearing debt.
Interest-bearing debt includes only the host loan element of the US$400 million convertible loans and not the embedded conversion derivative on the basis that the Group has no obligation to cash-settle the embedded derivative.
Interest-bearing debt also excludes the Royalty financing on the basis that obligations to make cash payments against this liability only arise when the Group generates revenues, and that otherwise the Group is not currently contractually liable to make any payments under this arrangement other than in the event of the Groups insolvency.
DEFERRED TAXATION Deferred taxation represents temporary differences in the accounting carrying values of assets and liabilities and thetax base of those same assets and liabilities.
Deferred taxation is provided in full, using the liability method, ontemporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
In line with IAS 12 Income taxes, no deferred tax is recognised on the initial recognition of an asset or liability that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting, nor taxable profit orloss unless the transaction is a business combination.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balancesheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised, or to the extent that they offset deferred tax liabilities.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intentionto settle the balances on a net basis.
The following table shows the nature of deferred tax assets liabilities recognised by the Group: Non-current Convertible Tax Net assets Loans losses Total m m m m At 1 January 2017 6.5 9.2 15.7 Charged credited to income statement 4.3 5.4 1.1 At 31 December 2017 10.8 3.8 14.6 Charged credited to income statement 3.4 3.4 At 31 December 2018 14.2 3.8 18.0 All deferred tax balances arise from timing differences in relation to UK corporation taxes and are expected to be able to be offset between UK Group companies.
Deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses are only recognised to the extent that they offset deferred tax liabilities.
In addition to those tax losses recognised above, the Group has further unused UK tax losses which would represent a deferred tax asset of 8.8 million 2017: 9.7 million.
These losses have not been recognised due to uncertainty over the availability of future taxable profits against which to set them.
For the same reason, a deferred tax asset in relation to the cash flow hedging movement in Other comprehensive income which would otherwise give rise to such an asset has not been recognised.
In the UK tax losses generally have no expiry.
However for companies which have not yet begun formal trading including the Groupsmain subsidiary, only expenditure from the seven years prior to the date of commencement of trade are available for future use.
Consequently, 1.1 million 2017: 1.1 million of the potential deferred tax asset in respect of unrecognised losses noted above are expected toexpire before the expected commencement of trading and therefore will likely not be available for use by the Group.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases net of any incentives received from the lessor are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Operating lease commitments The Group leases certain buildings under operating lease agreements.
The lease terms are between two and fifteen years and the majority of agreements are renewable at the end of the lease period, at market rate.
The lease expenditure charged to the income statement during the year is disclosed in note 2.

At 31 December 2018 the lessor had not yet fulfilled all conditions precedent to the commencement of the lease therefore its financial effects are not included in the table above although these conditions were expected to be completed in early 2019, thus representing a material commitment to the Group.
The Group has no other commitments or contingent liabilities at 31 December 2018 2017: nil.

24 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The main financial risks faced by the Group relate to the availability of funds to meet business needs liquidity risk and fluctuations inforeign exchange rates market risk.
Liquidity risk and capital management Liquidity risk The Groups policy on overall liquidity is to ensure that it can call on sufficient funds to facilitate all ongoing operations and planned expansion of the Project on its optimal production timetable.
The Group monitors its levels of working capital and financial investments to ensure that it can meet its payments as they fall due.
The following table shows the gross contractual maturities of the Groups recognised financial liabilities, including unrecognised future interest payments: Trade and other Convertible payables loans Total 31 December 2018 m m m Amount due within 1 year or less 43.1 16.5 59.6 Amount due within 1-2 years 16.5 16.5 Amount due within 2-5 years 241.3 241.3 Total contractual cash flows 43.1 274.3 317.4 Trade and other Convertible payables loans Total 31 December 2017 m m m Amount due within 1 year or less 29.4 19.6 49.0 Amount due within 1-2 years 19.6 19.6 Amount due within 2-5 years 58.7 58.7 Amount due after 5 years 249.6 249.6 Total contractual cash flows 29.4 347.5 376.9 All cash flows contractually due in respect of the convertible loans until the end of 2019 will be settled with the Groups restricted cash.
The above table does not include cash flows in relation to the royalty financing on the basis that cash flows under this arrangement are not contractually defined, but instead are wholly dependent upon the Groups revenue in future years.
Capital management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to ensure that it is best placed to further its development of the Project, whilst also safeguarding the Groups ability to continue as a going concern.
The Group defines capital as being cash and cash equivalents plus bank deposits.
The Board of Directors monitors the level of capital as compared to the Groups commitments and approves plans to adjust the level of capital accordingly in the best interests of shareholders.
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
As part of the annual budgeting and long-term planning process, the Groups cash flow forecast is reviewed and approved by the Board.
The cash flow forecast is updated on a monthly basis, taking account of the latest expenditure forecasts.
Based on the size and timing of the forecast expenditures, the Group adjusts the mix of holdings of its cash and cash equivalents and bank deposits in order to ensure that it has sufficient liquidity to meet its expenditures, whilst maximising the return on its funds, within the bounds of the Groups Board-approved treasury policy.

Foreign currency exchange rate risk The Groups operations are essentially based in the United Kingdom and it is expected that future revenues will be denominated in US dollars.
The majority of the Groups operating and capital expansion costs are denominated in Sterling although a significant portion of capital expansion costs are expected to be denominated in Euros.
The Groups existing debt financing is denominated in US Dollars.

The Group is exposed to foreign currency transaction risk on transactions that are denominated in currencies other than its presentational currency of Sterling.
It is the Groups policy to hedge foreign currency exposures associated with committed or probable expenditures in order to mitigate potential transaction risk.
The Group achieves this by purchasing cash and bank deposits in the relevant foreign currencies ahead of the occurrence of the transactions and simultaneously designating these foreign cash and bank deposits as hedging instruments in cash flow hedge relationships.
As a result the Group is able to significantly mitigate its exposures to movements in the Sterling Euro and Sterling Canadian dollar exchange rates, both in its expected cash flows and upon its income statement.
The Group is also exposed to foreign currency translation risk since its convertible loan debt financing is denominated in US Dollars.
It is the Groups policy to not hedge this risk.
As a result, movements in the Sterling US Dollar exchange rate will impact upon the Groups reported financial position and performance.
A strengthening of the US dollar against Sterling would have an adverse impact on reported losses and the Groups financial position.
It is expected that this exposure will reduce over time by conversion of the convertible loans which will crystallise all currency fluctuations in equity without requiring any cash settlement by the Group, meaning that this is not expected to give rise to a material cash flow risk.
The Group is also exposed to foreign currency translation risk in relation to the royalty financing, however it has designated this as the hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge relationship as detailed further in note 15.
The impact of a 10% weakening in the Sterling US dollar exchange rate compared to the rate prevailing at 31 December 2018 would be an increase in reported loss of 19.1 million 2017: 9.1 million and a reduction of 40.9 million 2017: 9.1 million to the Groups reported equity.
The Group has put in place a foreign exchange risk management system within its intercompany borrowing structure to minimise the risk that any adverse fluctuations in the Sterling US Dollar exchange rate indicated by the sensitivities in the paragraph above could give rise to any material cash tax exposures.
Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 117 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 24.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED c. Interest rate risk The Groups convertible loans have a fixed rate of interest of 8.5% and so interest payments due under these loans are not exposed to any cash flow risk arising from fluctuations in market interest rates.
The Group has no other interest-bearing liabilities.
Cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits and restricted cash held by the Group all earn interest which is either floating or fixed for no longer than one year.
The Group seeks to invest its interest-bearing financial assets in such a way so as to maximise the interest earned based on prevailing market rates, within the bounds of first minimising credit risk associated with the investments and then ensuring that the investments are sufficiently liquid to allow the Group to service its day-to-day operating and expected capital expenditures.
d. Credit risk The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits and restricted cash.
The Groups maximum credit exposure is equal to the carrying value of its financial assets as reported in the statement of financial position.
This risk is mitigated by placing cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits and restricted cash only with approved institutions that have an S&P credit rating of at least A-.
Furthermore, to prevent concentration risk, the Groups treasury policy mandates that no more than 20% oftheGroups surplus funds can be placed with any single institution other than the Groups primary relationship bank.
e. Market risk The Groups expected future revenues will fluctuate depending upon market conditions and so these may be different from those currently anticipated.
The royalty financing mitigates a portion of this risk as the arrangement means that the Group has passed over anelement of market risk to Hancock in return for an up-front fixed cash payment in 2018.
Accordingly, the Group has designated thearrangement as part of a cash flow hedge relationship to faithfully reflect the risk transfer that the royalty achieves.

The traded market price of the Groups convertible loan at 31 December 2018 was 108.9 2017: 124.5.
The fair value of the royalty financing at 31 December 2018 based upon discounting it at an annual rate of 10% which is normal for development projects of the type being undertaken by the Group was981.8 million compared to its stated carrying value of 208.5 million.
g. Fair value Financial instruments measured at fair value are grouped into one of three levels as set out by IFRS 13 Fair Value based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
These levels are as follows: Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted based on active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly I. e prices or indirectly I. e. derived from prices.
Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
The only assets or liabilities that the Group has which are measured at fair value are the derivatives associated with the convertible loans and the royalty financing.
Convertible loans embedded derivative This has been assessed as being a level 2 financial instrument.
In order to estimate the fair value of the convertible loans embedded derivative at any point in time, the Group estimates the fair value of the cash flows due under the host loan at an assumed discount rate that would likely apply to any debt issued by the Group which was not convertible and subtracting this from the market value of the convertible loans based on the quoted trading price at the measurement date.
In estimating this assumed discount rate, the Group considers publicly quoted bond yield data of comparable entities with similar credit profiles and their prevailing bond yields at the measurement date.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Hancock equity investment derivative liability This has been assessed as being a level 2 financial instrument.
The fair value of the Hancock equity investment derivative is estimated asthe net present value of the difference between the US$50 million receivable in Sterling terms, based on the forward exchange rate estimated for the drawdown date and the 200 million shares to be issued on the royalty drawdown date whose value is based on the Groups share price at the measurement date.
Royalty financing embedded derivative This has been assessed as being a level 3 financial instrument.
The fair value of the derivative is based on the latest projections of expected royalty payments, which is dependent upon expectations over the Projects future revenues, compared to the equivalent expectation which prevailed at the drawdown date.
Fair valuation sensitivities The inputs used in the fair valuation estimates of these derivatives reflect the Groups exposure to various market risks.
Movements in these inputs cause the fair valuation of the derivatives but not the cash flows, except for the royalty financing embedded derivative to fluctuate and affect reported net finance costs.
Correlated increases in the convertible loans price and share price would cause an increase in the loss reported from the convertibles loans embedded derivative and Hancock equity investment derivatives while an increase in thediscount rate assumed would cause an increase in the loss reported from the convertible loans embedded derivative.
Increases in expected future revenues and consequently, royalty payments compared to the expectation on drawdown date would cause the royalty embedded derivative to become a liability, although would have no impact on total loss as the derivative has been designated in a cash flow hedge relationship.
The sensitivity of each of the derivatives valuation in respect of a 10% change in the most significant input variables is as follows: 2018 2017 Impact on Impact on Impact on Impact on total loss equity total loss equity m m m m Convertible loans and share price increase decrease 24.9 24.9 24.9 24.9 33.1 33.1 33.1 33.1 Discount rate increase decrease 6.6 6.9 6.6 6.9 8.2 8.6 8.2 8.6 Estimate of future revenues increase decrease 125 125 25.
