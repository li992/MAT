Impairment Impairments recognised during 2018 totalled $nil within the US operating segment, $7.1m within the UK operating segment and $11.2m within the ROW.
Impairments recognised during 2018 were in relation to six sites in the UK and two sites in the ROW, whose recoverable amount was less than carrying amount.
Impairments recognised during 2017 totalled $0.4m within the UK and Ireland operating segment: $0.1m related to capital expenditure on cinema sites for which onerous lease provisions were in place, the remaining $0.3m related to the write off of residual assets held at sites which were closed during the year impairments for ROW were $0.1m.
The Group determines whether tangible fixed assets are impaired when indicators of impairment exist or based on the annual impairment assessment.
The annual assessment requires an estimate of the value in use of the CGUs to which the tangible fixedassets are allocated, which is predominantly at the individual cinema site level.
Where individual sites cash flows are determined not to operate independently from one another, mainly due to strategic or managerial decisions being made across more than one site, they may be combined into a single CGU.
Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 105 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 10.
Property, Plant and Equipment continued Estimating the value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from each CGU and discount these to their net present value at a pre-tax discount rate which is appropriate for the territory where the assets areheld.
A table summarising the rates used, which are derived from externally benchmarked data, is set out below: Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2018 2017 % % United States 12.43 United Kingdom 10.02 9.90 Poland 12.41 12.41 1 Israel 11.73 11.93 Hungary 10.78 10.68 Romania 11.70 11.36 Czech Republic 10.92 10.92 Bulgaria 10.22 10.22 Slovakia 11.57 11.56 1 For sites which generate significant rental cash flows in addition to cinema cash flows a separate discount rate of 8.0% 2017: 8.0% was applied to rental cash flows in to reflect the specific risks related to them.
In order to determine whether indicators of impairment exist at a CGU, the value in use is calculated using expected future cash flows, which are based on actual cash flows for the year ended 2018.
These are extrapolated using the assumptions used in the impairment model over the remaining lease term of the CGU.
Where indicators of impairment are identified a CGU is considered at-risk of impairment.
An impairment trigger is only identified for newly established sites in their first two years of operation if it is performing significantly below its investment case assumptions and despite any remedial actions management no longer consider such plans to be achievable.
Following initial review for impairment indicators and the recognition of the impairment charges described above, four CGUs, two in the UK and two in the ROW, were identified as at-risk of impairment.
For at-risk CGUs, a more detailed cash flow forecast is used, the expected cash flows are based on financial budgets approved by the Board of Directors covering a one year period.
Cash flows beyond the first period are extrapolated using assumptions specific to the individual CGU over the projected life of the lease, including any expected lease renewals or extensions.
For impairment procedures performed in prior years, the expected cash flows are based on financial budgets approved by the Board of Directors covering a one year period.
Cash flows beyond the first period are extrapolated using the assumptions used in the impairment model.
Constant growth rate assumptions are used for projections on established sites.
For freehold or leasehold sites with more than 20 years left to run only the next 20 year period is considered.
Impairment Reversals A review of future cash flows for previously impaired cinema sites did not identify improvements in trading performance and therefore no impairments previously recognised were reversed in the current year.
In 2017, an impairment reversal of $6.2m was recognised in respect of a site in the UK and $0.5m in respect of a site in ROW.
Sensitivity to Changes in Assumptions Impairment reviews are sensitive to changes in key assumptions.
Sensitivity analysis has been performed on the at-risk CGUs calculated recoverable amounts giving consideration to incremental changes in the key assumptions of admissions levels, average ticket price, concession spend per person and discount rates.
At one specific freehold site the levels of rental income earned is also a key assumption.
The total net book value of the at-risk CGUs was $36.6m.
The cash flow models used in assessing the carrying values of sites opened within the last two years are based on specific assumptions made prior to opening in respect of the early growth phase of the sites.
Therefore sensitivity analysis is not applied to these sites during this time.
The sensitivities applied reflect realistic scenarios which management believe would have the most significant impact on the cash flows described above.
Discounts rates are largely derived from market data, and these rates are intended to be long term in nature so therefore should be reasonably stable in the short term.
However, the models are sensitive to changes in these rates.
An increase by a factor of 1% has been applied in the sensitised scenarios.
For detailed cashflow forecasts for at-risk sites, growth rates in admissions in the range 0% to 5% have been applied in the first five years.
For average ticket price growth rates in the range 0% to 3.5% have been applied and for concession spend per person growth rates in the range 2.0% to 4.0% have been applied.
The growth rate of admissions, average ticket price and concession spend per person in years one to five have been reduced by 1%.
Given the inflationary growth rates applied to admissions trends and ticket price inflation, sensitivities applied are believed to reflect a potential downside scenario.
From year three onward a lower long-term growth rate is applied, which is in line or below long-term inflation in each territory.
As such, this assumption is already considered prudent and therefore this has not been included as part of the sensitivities performed.
