In addition, share based payment awards were granted to employees of Group undertakings which are recorded at fair value net of recoveries.
156 Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial Statements Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 In the opinion of the Directors, the value of investments in subsidiary undertakings is not less than the aggregate amount at which they are shown above, after taking account of the impairment charged in the year.
This assessment is based on value in use with reference to the discounted cash flow forecasts prepared by management and reviewed by the Board covering a three year period.
These cash flows are subject to the same assumptions and dependencies as described in note 10 to the Group Financial Statements.
The impairment charge relates to two direct subsidiaries of the Company, Lockman Investments Limited and Flight Refuelling Limited.
This reflects, to a large extent, the impact of cash flows from the KC-46 programme see note 3 to the Group Financial Statements.
This valuation is considered a key estimation uncertainty, as the value of the Companys investments remains sensitive to cash flow projections on the Groups development programmes, specifically the completion and production ramp up in subsidiaries in the Mission Systems and Advanced Electronic Solutions Sectors.
A reduction in the future cash flows in these subsidiaries would result in a further impairment.
A list of all subsidiaries is provided in note 33 to the Group Financial Statements.
The market capitalisation of the Group as a whole is given in the Group Financial Record on page 162.

Derivative financial instruments The Companys activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Company uses foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swap contracts to reduce these exposures and does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Other derivative financial instruments may be used from time to time to manage exposures such as inflation risk.
The fair values of derivative financial instruments are as follows, these are financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss: Foreign exchange Inflation m derivatives swap Total Non-current assets 28.8 28.8 Current assets 12.4 12.4 Current liabilities 10.9 10.9 Non-current liabilities 27.7 27.7 At 31 December 2018 2.6 2.6 Non-current assets 33.1 33.1 Current assets 15.2 0.4 15.6 Current liabilities 18.1 0.4 18.5 Non-current liabilities 29.7 29.7 At 31 December 2017 0.5 0.5 The movements in the fair values of derivative financial instruments during the year are as follows: Foreign Interest rate exchange m swaps derivatives Total At 1 January 2017 1.8 7.7 9.5 Gain through income statement not hedged 8.0 8.0 Gain loss reclassified to income statement 0.7 0.1 0.6 Ineffectiveness of net investment hedge through income statement 0.2 0.2 Gain through OCI hedged items 1.1 0.1 1.2 At 31 December 2017 0.5 0.5 Gain through income statement not hedged 2.7 2.7 Loss reclassified to income statement 0.3 0.3 Ineffectiveness of net investment hedge through income statement 0.1 0.1 Loss through OCI hedged items 0.4 0.4 At 31 December 2018 2.6 2.6 159 Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements continued The majority of foreign exchange derivative financial instruments are not accounted for using hedge accounting and movements in fair values are recorded in the income statement.
The Company has a small number of cross-currency swaps which have been designated as hedging instruments, further details can be found in note 22 to the Group Financial Statements.
In addition, a small number of specific foreign exchange derivatives were previously designated as cash flow hedging instruments and hedge accounting was applied.
These were, however, fide-designated as hedging instruments during the year.
The fair value of these contracts at 31 December 2017 was 0.1m.
Floating to fixed interest rate swaps were cancelled in the year ended 31 December 2017 following the repayment of the associated floating rate borrowings.
These interest rate swaps were previously designated as cash flow hedging instruments and hedge accounting was applied.
The most significant assumptions in valuing the derivatives are the exchange rates for GBP: US$, GBP: DKK and GBP: EUR.
Retirement benefit schemes Retirement benefit obligations in the Balance Sheet comprise: m 2018 2017 Defined benefit scheme assets 399.4 431.4 Defined benefit obligations 417.5 457.2 18.1 25.8 Defined benefit pension schemes The Company operates and participates in the Cobham Pension Plan CPP and the Cobham Executive Pension Plan CEPP.
The plans are funded defined benefit schemes where benefits are based on employees length of service and average final salary and assets are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The plans have been closed to new members since 2003 and were closed to future accrual from 1 April 2016.
During the year, there have been two major events affecting the defined benefit schemes: The CPP completed its triennial valuation: and In October 2018, the English High Court determined that UK defined benefit pension schemes with Guaranteed Minimum Pensions must be equalised between men and women.
The impact of this ruling has been estimated at 2.8m and recognised as a past service cost.
This has been calculated using the C2 method as the Companys current best estimate: the actual method of satisfying the obligations to the members of the pension plans will ultimately need to be agreed by the Company and the trustees of the pension plans.
Details of actuarial valuation processes and risks, assumptions and sensitivities relating to the CPP and CEPP are not significantly different to those disclosed in note 23 to the Group Financial Statements.
The Company expects to contribute 3.1m to its defined benefit pension schemes in 2019 and future years.
At 31 December 2018, 0.5m 2016: 0.7m of contributions were outstanding.
Changes in the fair value of scheme assets are as follows: m 2018 2017 At 1 January 431.4 415.7 Interest 10.0 10.9 Actuarial losses gains 29.4 18.0 Employer contributions 6.7 8.7 Benefits paid 19.3 21.9 At 31 December 399.4 431.4 Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligations are as follows: m 2018 2017 At 1 January 457.2 452.5 Past service cost 2.8 Interest cost 10.6 11.7 Actuarial gains losses arising from changes in financial assumptions 26.4 20.7 Actuarial gains arising from changes in demographic assumptions 7.4 5.8 Benefits paid 19.3 21.9 At 31 December 417.5 457.2 The actual return on scheme assets was 19.4m 2017: 28.9m.
The weighted average duration of the scheme liabilities is estimated to be 17 years.
