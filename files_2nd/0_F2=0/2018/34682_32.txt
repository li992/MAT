These measures are chosen as they provide additional useful information on business performance and underlying trends.
They are also used to measure the Groups performance against its strategic financial framework.
They are not however, defined terms under IFRS and may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
Where possible they have been reconciled to the statutory equivalents from the primary statements Group Income Statement I S, Group Balance Sheet B S, Group Cash Flow Statement C F or the notes to the Financial Statements.
Adjusted operating profit, adjusted earnings and adjusted operating cash flow have been defined and reconciled separately in notes 2, 4 and 10 to the consolidated Group Financial Statements where further explanation of the measures is given.
Additional performance measures are used within this announcement to help explain the performance of the Group and these are defined and reconciled below.
Adjusted gross margin, Underlying adjusted gross margin and Controllable operating costs as a % of underlying adjusted gross margin Adjusted gross margin is a metric used to assess the gross profit performance of the business without the distorting effects of certain re-measurements.
Underlying adjusted gross margin removes the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and acquisitions and disposals, thereby providing a like-for-like measure.
Controllable operating costs are the Groups operating costs as adjusted to remove exceptional items and other non-controllable costs e. g. depreciation, amortisation, smart metering, solar costs, dry hole costs, impairments and foreign exchange movements.
Controllable operating costs as a % of underlying adjusted gross margin is a metric that assesses operating costs under the Groups control relative to its gross margin on a like-for-like basis.

Underlying adjusted operating cash flow Adjusted operating cash flow is the key metric used to assess the cash generating performance of the Group.
Underlying adjusted operating cash flow makes further adjustments for foreign exchange and the commodity price movements that most impact the Group, which are outside its control, along with other material one-off items, to provide a comparable year on year measure of cash generation that more closely reflects business performance.
The calculation has been amended to make adjustments to rebase adjusted operating cash flow to reflect the prevailing foreign exchange and commodity prices in 2015 rather than those in the current reporting period.
This provides a fixed reference point and prevents the need to continually recalculate the comparative periods and allows management to measure underlying adjusted operating cash flow growth since 2015, the announcement of the Strategic Review.

ii The foreign exchange movement has been calculated by applying the average 2015 rate to the 2018, 2017 and 2016 adjusted operating cash flow net of taxation of entities with functional currencies other than GBP.
Underlying adjusted operating cash flow is adjusted operating cash flow as defined in note 2 and reconciled in note 5 f. It has been adjusted for the impacts of commodity price movements on E&P and nuclear assets and foreign exchange movements.
In 2018 the impact of the Safeguard Tariff and prepayment cap have been removed for the purposes of calculating underlying adjusted operating cash flow.
In 2016 the measure was adjusted for one-off working capital movements in UK Business.
This followed billing performance issues after the implementation of a new system in 2014, impacting the Groups ability to collect cash from customers and therefore its adjusted operating cash flow.
As a consequence, in 2016 the working capital movement for UK Business was removed from underlying adjusted operating cash flow.
236 Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Definitions and reconciliation of adjusted performance measures E&P free cash flow Free cash flow is used as an additional cash flow metric for the E&P business due to its asset intensive nature.
This metric provides a measure of the cash generating performance of the E&P business, taking account of its investment activity.

E&P free cash flow is E&Ps adjusted operating cash flow, as defined in note 2 and reconciled in note 4 f, less the businesss capital expenditure and net disposals as defined above.
Return on average capital employed ROACE Post-tax ROACE is one of the key performance metrics in the financial framework of the Group and represents the return the Group makes from capital employed in its wholly owned assets and its investments in joint ventures and associates.

Average capital employed takes the Groups net assets excluding net debt and deducts the net retirement benefit obligation and other derivative financial instruments together with their associated deferred tax balances because these represent unrealised positions and therefore do not reflect true capital employed.
They are also subject to market driven volatility which could materially distort the ROACE calculation.
