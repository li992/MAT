barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2018 263 Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 20 for the year ended 31 December 2018 18 This section describes Barclays Groups significant policies and critical accounting estimates that relate to the financial statements and notes as a whole.
If an accounting policy or a critical accounting estimate relates to a particular note, the accounting policy and or critical accounting estimate is contained with the relevant note.
Reporting entity These financial statements are prepared for Barclays PLC and its subsidiaries the Barclays Group under Section 399 of the Companies Act 2006.
The Barclays Group is a major global financial services provider engaged in retail banking, credit cards, wholesale banking, investment banking, wealth management and investment management services.
In addition, individual financial statements have been presented for the holding company.
Compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards The consolidated financial statements of the Barclays Group, and the individual financial statements of Barclays PLC, have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and interpretations IFRICs issued by the Interpretations Committee, as published by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
They are also in accordance with IFRS and IFRIC interpretations endorsed by the European Union.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated and individual financial statements are set out below, and in the relevant notes to the financial statements.
These policies have been consistently applied with the exception of the adoption of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments including the early adoption of Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation Amendments to IFRS 9, IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and the amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment from 1 January 2018.
Basis of preparation The consolidated and individual financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention modified to include the fair valuation of investment property, and particular financial instruments, to the extent required or permitted under IFRS as set out in the relevant accounting policies.
They are stated in millions of pounds Sterling m, the functional currency of Barclays PLC.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies using IFRS.
Accounting policies The Barclays Group prepares financial statements in accordance with IFRS.
The Barclays Groups significant accounting policies relating to specific financial statement items, together with a description of the accounting estimates and judgements that were critical to preparing them, are set out under the relevant notes.
Accounting policies that affect the financial statements as a whole are set out below.
i Consolidation Barclays Group applies IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements combine the financial statements of Barclays PLC and all its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are entities over which Barclays PLC has control.
The Barclays Group has control over another entity when the Barclays Group has all of the following: 1 power over the relevant activities of the investee, for example through voting or other rights 2 exposure to, or rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and 3 the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
The assessment of control is based on the consideration of all facts and circumstances.
The Barclays Group reassesses whether it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control.
Intra-group transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.
Consistent accounting policies are used throughout the Barclays Group for the purposes of the consolidation.
Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions if they occur after control has already been obtained and they do not result in loss of control.
As the consolidated financial statements include partnerships where the Barclays Group member is a partner, advantage has been taken of the exemption under Regulation 7 of the Partnership Accounts Regulations 2008 with regard to preparing and filing of individual partnership financial statements.
Details of the principal subsidiaries are given in Note 34, and a complete list of all subsidiaries is presented in Note 44. ii Foreign currency translation The Barclays Group applies IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rate ruling on the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency monetary balances are translated into Sterling at the period end exchange rates.
Exchange gains and losses on such balances are taken to the income statement.
Non-monetary foreign currency balances are carried at historical transaction date exchange rates.
The Barclays Groups foreign operations including subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and branches based mainly outside the UK may have different functional currencies.
The functional currency of an operation is the currency of the main economy to which it is exposed.
Prior to consolidation or equity accounting the assets and liabilities of non-Sterling operations are translated at the period end exchange rate and items of income, expense and other comprehensive income are translated into Sterling at the rate on the date of the transactions.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign operations are included in currency translation reserves within equity.
These are transferred to the income statement when the Barclays Group disposes of the entire interest in a foreign operation, when partial disposal results in the loss of control of an interest in a subsidiary, when an investment previously accounted for using the equity method is accounted for as a financial asset, or on the disposal of an autonomous foreign operation within a branch.
264 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2018 home.
barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 1 Significant accounting policies continued iii Financial assets and liabilities The Barclays Group applies IFRS 9 Financial Instruments to the recognition, classification and measurement, and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities and the impairment of financial assets.
The Barclays Group applies the requirements of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement for hedge accounting purposes.
Recognition The Barclays Group recognises financial assets and liabilities when it becomes a party to the terms of the contract.
Trade date or settlement date accounting is applied depending on the classification of the financial asset.
Classification and measurement Financial assets are classified on the basis of two criteria: i the business model within which financial assets are managed, and ii their contractual cash flow characteristics whether the cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest SPPI.
The Barclays Group assesses the business model criteria at a portfolio level.
Information that is considered in determining the applicable business model includes i policies and objectives for the relevant portfolio, ii how the performance and risks of the portfolio are managed, evaluated and reported to management, and iii the frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, sales expectation for future periods, and the reasons for such sales.
The contractual cash flow characteristics of financial assets are assessed with reference to whether the cash flows represent SPPI.
In assessing whether contractual cash flows are SPPI compliant, interest is defined as consideration primarily for the time value of money and the credit risk of the principal outstanding.
The time value of money is defined as the element of interest that provides consideration only for the passage of time and not consideration for other risks or costs associated with holding the financial asset.
Terms that could change the contractual cash flows so that it would not meet the condition for SPPI are considered, including: i contingent and leverage features, ii non-recourse arrangements and iii features that could modify the time value of money.
Financial assets will be measured at amortised cost if they are held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows, and their contractual cash flows represent SPPI.
Financial assets will be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if they are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets, and their contractual cash flows represent SPPI.
Other financial assets are measured at fair value through profit and loss.
There is an option to make an irrevocable election on initial recognition for non traded equity investments to be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, in which case dividends are recognised in profit or loss, but gains or losses are not reclassified to profit or loss upon derecognition, and impairment is not recognised in the income statement.
The accounting policy for each type of financial asset or liability is included within the relevant note for the item.
The Barclays Groups policies for determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities are set out in Note 17.
Derecognition The Barclays Group derecognises a financial asset, or a portion of a financial asset, from its balance sheet where the contractual rights to cash flows from the asset have expired, or have been transferred, usually by sale, and with them either substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset or significant risks and rewards, along with the unconditional ability to sell or pledge the asset.
Financial liabilities are fide-recognised when the liability has been settled, has expired or has been extinguished.
An exchange of an existing financial liability for a new liability with the same lender on substantially different terms generally a difference of 10% in the present value of the cash flows or a substantive qualitative amendment is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability.
Transactions in which the Barclays Group transfers assets and liabilities, portions of them, or financial risks associated with them can be complex and it may not be obvious whether substantially all of the risks and rewards have been transferred.
It is often necessary to perform a quantitative analysis.
Such an analysis compares the Barclays Groups exposure to variability in asset cash flows before the transfer with its retained exposure after the transfer.
A cash flow analysis of this nature may require judgement.
In particular, it is necessary to estimate the assets expected future cash flows as well as potential variability around this expectation.
The method of estimating expected future cash flows depends on the nature of the asset, with market and market-implied data used to the greatest extent possible.
The potential variability around this expectation is typically determined by stressing underlying parameters to create reasonable alternative upside and downside scenarios.
Probabilities are then assigned to each scenario.
Stressed parameters may include default rates, loss severity, or prepayment rates.
Accounting for reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements including other similar lending and borrowing Reverse repurchase agreements and stock borrowing or similar transaction are a form of secured lending whereby the Barclays Group provides a loan or cash collateral in exchange for the transfer of collateral, generally in the form of marketable securities subject to an agreement to transfer the securities back at a fixed price in the future.
Repurchase agreements are where the Barclays Group obtains such loans or cash collateral, in exchange for the transfer of collateral.
The Barclays Group purchases a reverse repurchase agreement or borrows securities subject to a commitment to resell or return them.
The securities are not included in the balance sheet as the Barclays Group does not acquire the risks and rewards of ownership.
Consideration paid or cash collateral provided is accounted for as a loan asset at amortised cost, unless it is designated at fair value through profit and loss.
The Barclays Group may also sell a repurchase agreement or lend securities subject to a commitment to repurchase or redeem them.
The securities are retained on the balance sheet as the Barclays Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
Consideration received or cash collateral provided is accounted for as a financial liability at amortised cost, unless it is designated at fair value through profit and loss.
barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2018 265 Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018 1 Significant accounting policies continued iv Issued debt and equity instruments The Barclays Group applies IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation, to determine whether funding is either a financial liability debt or equity.
Issued financial instruments or their components are classified as liabilities if the contractual arrangement results in the Barclays Group having an obligation to either deliver cash or another financial asset, or a variable number of equity shares, to the holder of the instrument.
If this is not the case, the instrument is generally an equity instrument and the proceeds included in equity, net of transaction costs.
Dividends and other returns to equity holders are recognised when paid or declared by the members at the AGM and treated as a deduction from equity.
Where issued financial instruments contain both liability and equity components, these are accounted for separately.
The fair value of the debt is estimated first and the balance of the proceeds is included within equity.
New and amended standards and interpretations The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year, with the exception of the adoption of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments including the early adoption of Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation Amendments to IFRS 9, IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and the amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment from 1 January 2018.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9 Financial Instruments replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
IFRS 9 introduces key changes in the following areas: Classification and measurement requiring asset classification and measurement based upon both business model and product characteristics.
Impairment introducing an expected credit loss model using forward looking information which replaces an incurred loss model.
The expected credit loss model introduces a three-stage approach to impairment as follows: Stage 1 the recognition of 12 month expected credit losses ECL, that is the portion of lifetime expected credit losses from default events that are expected within 12 months of the reporting date, if credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition: Stage 2 lifetime expected credit losses for financial instruments for which credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition: and Stage 3 lifetime expected credit losses for financial instruments which are credit impaired.
Refer to Note 7 for further details regarding the impairment requirements of IFRS 9.
As required by IFRS 9 the Barclays Group applied IFRS 9 retrospectively by adjusting the opening balance sheet at the date of initial application, and comparative periods have not been restated: for more detail refer to Note 42.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers replaces IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 Construction Contracts.
IFRS 15 establishes a more systematic approach for revenue measurement and recognition by introducing a five-step model governing revenue recognition.
The five-step model includes: 1 identifying the contract with the customer, 2 identifying each of the performance obligations included in the contract, 3 determining the amount of consideration in the contract, 4 allocating the consideration to each of the identified performance obligations and 5 recognising revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied.
The Barclays Group elected the cumulative effect transition method with a transition adjustment calculated as of 1 January 2018, and recognised in retained earnings without restating comparative periods.
There were no significant impacts from the adoption of IFRS 15 in relation to the timing of when the Barclays Group recognises revenues or when revenue should be recognised gross as a principal or net as an agent: for more detail refer to Note 42.
IFRS 2 Share-based Payment Amendments to IFRS 2 The IASB issued amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment that address three main areas: the effects of vesting conditions on the measurement of a cash-settled share-based payment transaction: the classification of a share-based payment transaction with net settlement features for withholding tax obligations: and accounting where a modification to the terms and conditions of a share-based payment transaction changes its classification from cash settled to equity settled.
The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
Adoption of the amendments did not have a significant impact on the Barclays Group.
Future accounting developments There have been, and are expected to be, a number of significant changes to the Barclays Groups financial reporting after 2018 as a result of amended or new accounting standards that have been or will be issued by the IASB.
The most significant of these are as follows: IFRS 16 Leases In January 2016 the IASB issued IFRS 16 Leases, which was subsequently endorsed by the EU in November 2017, and will replace IAS 17 Leases for period beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
IFRS 16 will apply to all leases with the exception of licenses of intellectual property, rights held by licensing agreement within the scope of IAS 38 Intangible Assets, service concession arrangements, leases of biological assets within the scope of IAS 41 Agriculture, and leases of minerals, oil, natural gas and similar non-regenerative resources.
A lessee may elect not to apply IFRS 16 to remaining assets within the scope of IAS 38 Intangible Assets.
IFRS 16 will not result in a significant change to lessor accounting: however, for lessee accounting there will no longer be a distinction between operating and finance leases.
Lessees will be required to recognise both: a lease liability, measured at the present value of remaining cash flows on the lease, and a right of use ROU asset, measured at the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability, plus any lease payments made prior to commencement date, initial direct costs, and estimated costs of restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the lease, less any lease incentives received.
There is a recognition exception for leases with a term not exceeding 12 months which allows the lessee to apply similar accounting as an operating lease under IAS 17.
266 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2018 home.
barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 1 Significant accounting policies continued Subsequently the lease liability will increase for the accrual of interest, resulting in a constant rate of return throughout the life of the lease, and reduce when payments are made.
The right of use asset will amortise to the income statement over the life of the lease.
The Barclays Group IFRS 16 implementation and governance programme has been led by Finance with representation from all impacted departments.
The project has identified the contracts impacted by IFRS 16, which are predominantly existing property leases.
Other lease types are not material.
The project has also established appropriate accounting policies, determined the appropriate transition options to apply, and updated Finance systems and processes to reflect the new accounting and disclosure requirements.
As permitted by the standard, the Barclays Group intends to apply IFRS 16 on a retrospective basis but to take advantage of the option not to restate comparative periods by applying the modified retrospective approach.
The Barclays Group intends to take advantage of the following transition options available under the modified retrospective approach: To calculate the right of use asset equal to the lease liability, adjusted for prepaid or accrued payments.
To rely on the previous assessment of whether leases are onerous in accordance with IAS 37 immediately before the date of initial application as an alternative to performing an impairment review.
The Barclays Group will adjust the carrying amount of the ROU asset at the date of initial application by the previous carrying amount of its onerous lease provision.
Apply the recognition exception for leases with a term not exceeding 12 months.
Use hindsight in determining the lease term if the contract contains options to extend or terminate the lease.
The expected impact of adopting IFRS 16 is an increase in assets of 1.6bn, an increase in liabilities of 1.6bn with no material impact on retained earnings.
This impact assessment has been estimated under an interim control environment.
The implementation of the comprehensive end state control environment will continue as the Barclays Group introduces business as usual controls through 2019.
IFRS 17 Insurance contracts In May 2017, the IASB issued IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts, a comprehensive new accounting standard for insurance contracts covering recognition and measurement, presentation and disclosure.
Once effective, IFRS 17 will replace IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts that was issued in 2005.
IFRS 17 applies to all types of insurance contracts i. e. life, non-life, direct insurance and re-insurance, regardless of the type of entities that issue them, as well as to certain guarantees and financial instruments with discretionary participation features.
A few scope exceptions will apply.
The standard is currently effective from 1 January 2021, and the standard has not yet been endorsed by the EU.
The Barclays Group is currently assessing the expected impact of adopting this standard.
IFRIC Interpretation 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatment IFRIC 23 clarifies the application of IAS 12 to accounting for income tax treatments that have yet to be accepted by tax authorities, in scenarios where it may be unclear how tax law applies to a particular transaction or circumstance, or whether a taxation authority will accept an entitys tax treatment.
The effective date is 1 January 2019.
The Barclays Group has considered the guidance included within the interpretation and concluded that the prescribed approach under IFRIC 23 is not expected to have a material impact on the Barclays Groups financial position.
IAS 12 Income Taxes Amendments to IAS 12 In December 2017, as part of the Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 20152017 Cycle, the IASB amended IAS 12 in order to clarify the accounting treatment of the income tax consequences of dividends.
Effective from 1 January 2019 the tax consequences of all payments on financial instruments that are classified as equity for accounting purposes, where those payments are considered to be a distribution of profit, will be included in, and will reduce, the income statement tax charge.
Refer to Note 9 for the expected impact of adopting the amendments of IAS 12.
IAS 19 Employee Benefits Amendments to IAS 19 In February 2018 the IASB issued amendments to the guidance in IAS 19 Employee Benefits, in connection with accounting for plan amendments, curtailments and settlements.
The amendments must be applied to plan amendments, curtailments or settlements occurring on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins on or after 1 January 2019.
The amendments have not yet been endorsed by the EU.
Adoption of the amendments is not expected to have significant impact on the Barclays Group.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of estimates.
It also requires management to exercise judgement in applying the accounting policies.
The key areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions are significant to the consolidated and individual financial statements are highlighted under the relevant note.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements are disclosed in: Credit impairment charges on page 273 Tax on page 278 Fair value of financial instruments on page 291 Pensions and post-retirement benefits obligations on page 331 Provisions including conduct and legal, competition and regulatory matters on page 313.
Other disclosures To improve transparency and ease of reference, by concentrating related information in one place, certain disclosures required under IFRS have been included within the Risk review section as follows: Credit risk on pages 137 to 138 and 149 to 175 Market risk on pages 139 and 176 to 180 Treasury and capital risk liquidity on pages 140 and 183 to 196 Treasury and capital risk capital on pages 141 and 197 to 207.
These disclosures are covered by the Audit opinion included on pages 248 to 255 where referenced as audited.

barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2018 269 Notes to the financial statements Performance return 3 Net interest income Accounting for interest income and expenses Interest income on loans and advances at amortised cost, and interest expense on financial liabilities held at amortised cost, are calculated using the effective interest method which allocates interest, and direct and incremental fees and costs, over the expected lives of the assets and liabilities.
The effective interest method requires the Barclays Group to estimate future cash flows, in some cases based on its experience of customers behaviour, considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, as well as the expected lives of the assets and liabilities.
Barclays Group incurs certain costs to originate credit card balances with the most significant being co-brand partner fees.
To the extent these costs are attributed to customers that continuously carry an outstanding balance revolvers, they are capitalised and subsequently included within the calculation of the effective interest rate.
They are amortised to interest income over the period of expected repayment of the originated balance.
Costs attributed to customers that settle their outstanding balances each period transactors are deferred on the balance sheet as a cost of obtaining a contract and amortised to fee and commission expense over the life of the customer relationship refer to Note 4.
There are no other individual estimates involved in the calculation of effective interest rates that are material to the results or financial position.

4 Net fee and commission income Accounting for net fee and commission income under IFRS 15 effective from 1 January 2018 The Barclays Group applies IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
The standard establishes a five-step model governing revenue recognition.
The five-step model requires Barclays Group to i identify the contract with the customer, ii identify each of the performance obligations included in the contract, iii determine the amount of consideration in the contract, iv allocate the consideration to each of the identified performance obligations and v recognise revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied.
Barclays Group recognises fee and commission income charged for services provided by the Barclays Group as the services are provided, for example on completion of the underlying transaction.
Accounting for net fee and commission income under IAS 18 for 2017 and 2016 The Barclays Group applies IAS 18 Revenue.
Fees and commissions charged for services provided or received by the Barclays Group are recognised as the services are provided, for example on completion of the underlying transaction.
Fee and commission income is disaggregated below by fee types that reflect the nature of the services offered across the Barclays Group and operating segments, in accordance with IFRS 15.
It includes a total for fees in scope of IFRS 15.
Refer to Note 2 for more detailed information about operating segments.

The comparative figures are reported under IAS 18.
Fee types Transactional Transactional fees are service charges on deposit accounts, cash management services and transactional processing fees including interchange and merchant fee income generated from credit and bank card usage.
Transaction and processing fees are recognised at the point in time the transaction occurs or service is performed.
They include banking services such as Automated Teller Machine ATM fees, wire transfer fees, balance transfer fees, overdraft or late fees and foreign exchange fees, among others.
Interchange and merchant fees are recognised upon settlement of the card transaction payment.
Barclays incurs certain card related costs including those related to cardholder reward programmes and various payments made to co-brand partners.
To the extent cardholder reward programmes costs are attributed to customers that settle their outstanding balance each period transactors they are expensed when incurred and presented in fee and commission expense while costs related to customers who continuously carry an outstanding balance revolvers are included in the effective interest rate of the receivable refer to Note 3.
Payments to partners for new cardholder account originations for transactor accounts are deferred as costs to obtain a contract under IFRS 15 while those costs related to revolver accounts are included in the effective interest rate of the receivable refer to Note 3.
Those costs deferred under IFRS 15 are capitalised and amortised over the estimated cardholder relationship.
Payments to co-brand partners based on revenue sharing are presented as a reduction of fee and commission income while payments based on profitability are presented in fee and commission expense.
Advisory Advisory fees are generated from wealth management services and investment banking advisory services related to mergers, acquisitions and financial restructurings.
Wealth management advisory fees primarily consists of asset-based fees for advisory accounts of wealth management clients and are based on the market value of client assets.
They are earned over the period the services are provided and are generally recognised quarterly when the market value of client assets is determined.
Investment banking advisory fees are recognised at the point in time when the services related to the transaction have been completed under the terms of the engagement.
Investment banking advisory costs are recognised as incurred in fee and commission expense if direct and incremental to the advisory services or otherwise recognised in operating expenses.
Brokerage and execution Brokerage and execution fees are earned for executing client transactions with various exchanges and over-the-counter markets and assisting clients in clearing transactions.
Brokerage and execution fees are recognised at the point in time the associated service has been completed which is generally the trade date of the transaction.
Underwriting and syndication Underwriting and syndication fees are earned for the distribution of client equity or debt securities and the arrangement and administration of a loan syndication.
This includes commitment fees to provide loan financing.
Underwriting fees are generally recognised on trade date if there is no remaining contingency, such as the transaction being conditional on closing of an acquisition or other transaction.
Underwriting costs are deferred and recognised in fee and commission expense when the associated underwriting fees are recorded.
Syndication fees are earned for arranging and administering a loan syndication: however, the associated fee may be subject to variability until the loan has been syndicated to other syndicate members or until other contingencies such as a successful M&A closing have been resolved and therefore the fee revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is resolved.
Underwriting and syndication fees were previously reported on a net basis in the income statement.
Following the adoption of IFRS 15, expenses associated with underwriting and syndication of 38m are now reported in fee and commission expense.
Including in the underwriting and syndication, commitment fees to provide loan financing includes fees which are not presented as part of the effective interest rate of a loan in accordance with IFRS 9.
Loan commitment fees included as IFRS 15 revenues are fees for loan commitments that are not expected to fund, fees received as compensation for unfunded commitments and the applicable portion of fees received for a revolving loan facility, which for that period, are undrawn.
Such commitment fees are recognised over time through to the contractual maturity of the commitment.
Contract assets and contract liabilities The Barclays Group had no material contract assets or contract liabilities as at 31 December 2018.
Impairment on fee receivables and contract assets During 2018, there have been no material impairments recognised in relation to fees receivable and contract assets.
Fees in relation to transactional business can be added to outstanding customer balances.
These amounts may be subsequently impaired as part of the overall loans and advances balance.
Remaining performance obligations The Barclays Group applies the practical expedient of IFRS 15 and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less or because the Barclays Group has a right to consideration that corresponds directly with the value of the service provided to the client or customer.
barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2018 271 Notes to the financial statements Performance return 4 Net fee and commission income continued Costs incurred in obtaining or fulfilling a contract The Barclays Group expects that incremental costs of obtaining a contract such as success fee and commission fees paid are recoverable and therefore capitalised such contract costs in the amount of 125.4m at 31 December 2018.
Capitalised contract costs are amortised based on the transfer of services to which the asset relates which typically ranges over the expected life of the relationship.
In 2018, the amount of amortisation was 30.4m and there was no impairment loss recognised in connection with the capitalised contract costs.
5 Net trading income Accounting for net trading income In accordance with IFRS 9, trading positions are held at fair value, and the resulting gains and losses are included in the income statement, together with interest and dividends arising from long and short positions and funding costs relating to trading activities.
Income arises from both the sale and purchase of trading positions, margins which are achieved through market making and customer business and from changes in fair value caused by movements in interest and exchange rates, equity prices and other market variables.
Gains or losses on non-trading financial instruments designated or mandatorily at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement are included in net trading income where the business model is to manage assets and liabilities on a fair value basis which includes use of derivatives or where an instrument is designated at fair value to eliminate an accounting mismatch and the related instruments gain and losses are reported in trading income.

barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 7 Credit impairment charges and other provisions Accounting for the impairment of financial assets under IFRS 9 effective from 1 January 2018 Impairment The Barclays Group is required to recognise expected credit losses ECLs based on unbiased forward-looking information for all financial assets at amortised cost, lease receivables, debt financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts.
At the reporting date, an allowance or provision for loan commitments and financial guarantees is required for the 12 month Stage 1 ECLs.
If the credit risk has significantly increased since initial recognition Stage 2, or if the financial instrument is credit impaired Stage 3, an allowance or provision should be recognised for the lifetime ECLs.
The measurement of ECL is calculated using three main components: i probability of default PD ii loss given default LGD and iii the exposure at default EAD.
The 12 month ECL is calculated by multiplying the 12 month PD, LGD and the EAD.
The 12 month and lifetime PDs represent the PD occurring over the next 12 months and the remaining maturity of the instrument respectively.
The EAD represents the expected balance at default, taking into account the repayment of principal and interest from the balance sheet date to the default event together with any expected drawdowns of committed facilities.
The LGD represents expected losses on the EAD given the event of default, taking into account, among other attributes, the mitigating effect of collateral value at the time it is expected to be realised and the time value of money.
Determining a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition: The Barclays Group assesses when a significant increase in credit risk has occurred based on quantitative and qualitative assessments.
The credit risk of an exposure is considered to have significantly increased when: i Quantitative test The annualised lifetime PD has increased by more than an agreed threshold relative to the equivalent at origination.
PD deterioration thresholds are defined as percentage increases, and are set at an origination score band and segment level to ensure the test appropriately captures significant increases in credit risk at all risk levels.
Generally, thresholds are inversely correlated to the origination PD, i. e. as the origination PD increases, the threshold value reduces.
The assessment of the point at which a PD increase is deemed significant, is based upon analysis of the portfolios risk profile against a common set of principles and performance metrics consistent across both retail and wholesale businesses, incorporating expert credit judgement where appropriate.
Wholesale assets apply a 100% increase in PD and 0.2% PD floor to determine a significant increase in credit risk.
Retail assets apply bespoke relative increase and absolute PD thresholds based on product type and origination PD.
Thresholds are subject to maximums defined by Barclays Group policy and typically apply minimum relative thresholds of 50100% and a maxiumum relative threshold of 400%.
For existing historical exposures where origination point scores or data are no longer available or do not represent a comparable estimate of lifetime PD, a proxy origination score is defined, based upon: back-population of the approved lifetime PD score either to origination date or, where this is not feasible, as far back as possible, subject to a data start point no later than 1 January 2015, or use of available historical account performance data and other customer information, to derive a comparable proxy estimation of origination PD.
ii Qualitative test Relevant for accounts that meet the portfolios high risk criteria and are subject to closer credit monitoring.
High risk customers may not be in arrears but either through an event or an observed behaviour exhibit credit distress.
The definition and assessment of high risk includes as wide a range of information as reasonably available, such as industry and Group-wide customer level data, including but not limited to bureau scores and high consumer indebtedness index, wherever possible or relevant.
Whilst the high risk populations applied for IFRS 9 impairment purposes are aligned with risk management processes, they are also regularly reviewed and validated to ensure that they capture any incremental segments where there is evidence of credit deterioration.
iii Backstop criteria Relevant for accounts that are more than 30 calendar days past due.
The 30 days past due criteria is a backstop rather than a primary driver of moving exposures into Stage 2.
Exposures will move back to Stage 1 once they no longer meet the criteria for a significant increase in credit risk.
This means that, at a minimum: all payments must be up-to-date, the PD deterioration test is no longer met, the account is no longer classified as high risk, and the customer has evidenced an ability to maintain future payments.
Management overlays and other exceptions to model outputs are applied only if consistent with the objective of identifying significant increases in credit risk.
barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2018 273 Notes to the financial statements Performance return 7 Credit impairment charges and other provisions continued Forward-looking information The measurement of ECL involves complexity and judgement, including estimation of PD, LGD, a range of unbiased future economic scenarios, estimation of expected lives where contractual life is not appropriate, and estimation of EAD and assessing significant increases in credit risk.
Credit losses are the expected cash shortfalls from what is contractually due over the expected life of the financial instrument, discounted at the original effective interest rate EIR.
ECLs are the unbiased probability-weighted credit losses determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes and considering future economic conditions.
Barclays Group uses a five-scenario model to calculate ECL.
An external consensus forecast is assembled from key sources, including HM Treasury, Bloomberg and the Urban Land Institute, which forms the baseline scenario.
In addition, two adverse scenarios Downside 1 and Downside 2 and two favourable scenarios Upside 1 and Upside 2 are derived, with associated probability weightings.
The adverse scenarios are calibrated to a similar severity to internal stress tests, whilst also considering IFRS 9 specific sensitivities and non-linearity.
Downside 2 is benchmarked to the Bank of Englands annual cyclical scenarios and to the most severe scenario from Moodys inventory, but is not designed to be the same.
The favourable scenarios are calibrated to be symmetric to the adverse scenarios, subject to a ceiling calibrated to relevant recent favourable benchmark scenarios.
The scenarios include six economic core variables, GDP, unemployment and House Price Index HPI in both the UK and US markets, and expanded variables using statistical models based on historical correlations.
All five scenarios converge to a steady state after eight years.
The methodology for estimating probability weights for each of the scenarios involves a comparison of the distribution of key historic UK and US macroeconomic variables against the forecast paths of the five scenarios.
The methodology works such that the baseline reflecting current consensus outlook has the highest weight and the weights of adverse and favourable scenarios depend on the deviation from the baseline: the further from the baseline, the smaller the weight.
A single set of five scenarios is used across all portfolios and all five weights are normalised to equate to 100%.
The impacts across the portfolios are different because of the sensitivities of each of the portfolios to specific macroeconomic variables, for example, mortgages are highly sensitive to house prices and base rates, credit cards and unsecured consumer loans are highly sensitive to unemployment.
Definition of default, credit impaired assets, write-offs, and interest income recognition The definition of default for the purpose of determining ECLs, and for internal credit risk management purposes, has been aligned to the Regulatory Capital CRR Article 178 definition of default, to maintain a consistent approach with IFRS 9 and associated regulatory guidance.
The Regulatory Capital CRR Article 178 definition of default considers indicators that the debtor is unlikely to pay, includes exposures in forbearance and is no later than when the exposure is more than 90 days past due or 180 days past due in the case of UK mortgages.
When exposures are identified as credit impaired or purchased or originated as such interest income is calculated on the carrying value net of the impairment allowance.
Credit impaired is when the exposure has defaulted which is also anticipated to align to when an exposure is identified as individually impaired.
Uncollectable loans are written off against the related allowance for loan impairment on completion of the Barclays Groups internal processes and when all reasonably expected recoverable amounts have been collected.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to the income statement.
The timing and extent of write-offs may involve some element of subjective judgement.
Nevertheless, a write-off will often be prompted by a specific event, such as the inception of insolvency proceedings or other formal recovery action, which makes it possible to establish that some or the entire advance is beyond realistic prospect of recovery.
Loan modifications and renegotiations that are not credit-impaired When modification of a loan agreement occurs as a result of commercial restructuring activity rather than due to the credit risk of the borrower, an assessment must be performed to determine whether the terms of the new agreement are substantially different from the terms of the existing agreement.
This assessment considers both the change in cash flows arising from the modified terms as well as the change in overall instrument risk profile.
Where terms are substantially different, the existing loan will be derecognised and a new loan will be recognised at fair value.
Where terms are not substantially different, the loan carrying value will be adjusted to reflect the present value of modified cash flows discounted at the original EIR, with any resulting gain or loss recognised immediately within the income statement as a modification gain or loss.
Expected life Lifetime ECLs must be measured over the expected life.
This is restricted to the maximum contractual life and takes into account expected prepayment, extension, call and similar options.
The exceptions are certain revolver financial instruments, such as credit cards and bank overdrafts, that include both a drawn and an undrawn component where the entitys contractual ability to demand repayment and cancel the undrawn commitment does not limit the entitys exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period.
For revolving facilities, expected life is analytically derived to reflect behavioural life of the asset, i. e. the full period over which the business expects to be exposed to credit risk.
Behavioural life is typically based upon historical analysis of the average time to default, closure or withdrawal of facility.
Where data is insufficient or analysis inconclusive, an additional maturity factor may be incorporated to reflect the full estimated life of the exposures, based upon experienced judgement and or peer analysis.
Potential future modifications of contracts are not taken into account when determining the expected life or EAD until they occur.
Discounting ECLs are discounted at the EIR at initial recognition or an approximation thereof and consistent with income recognition.
For loan commitments the EIR is the rate that is expected to apply when the loan is drawn down and a financial asset is recognised.
Issued financial guarantee contracts are discounted at the risk free rate.
Lease receivables are discounted at the rate implicit in the lease.
For variable floating rate financial assets, the spot rate at the reporting date is used and projections of changes in the variable rate over the expected life are not made to estimate future interest cash flows or for discounting.
274 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2018 home.
barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 7 Credit impairment charges and other provisions continued Modelling techniques ECLs are calculated by multiplying three main components, being the PD, LGD and the EAD, discounted at the original EIR.
The regulatory Basel Committee of Banking Supervisors BCBS ECL calculations are leveraged for IFRS 9 modelling but adjusted for key differences which include: BCBS requires 12 month through the economic cycle losses whereas IFRS 9 requires 12 months or lifetime point in time losses based on conditions at the reporting date and multiple forecasts of the future economic conditions over the expected lives: IFRS 9 models do not include certain conservative BCBS model floors and downturn assessments and require discounting to the reporting date at the original EIR rather than using the cost of capital to the date of default: Management adjustments are made to modelled output to account for situations where known or expected risk factors and information have not been considered in the modelling process, for example forecast economic scenarios for uncertain political events: and ECL is measured at the individual financial instrument level, however a collective approach where financial instruments with similar risk characteristics are grouped together, with apportionment to individual financial instruments, is used where effects can only be seen at a collective level, for example for forward-looking information.
For the IFRS 9 impairment assessment, Barclays Groups risk models are used to determine the PD, LGD and EAD.
For Stage 2 and 3, Barclays Group applies lifetime PDs but uses 12 month PDs for Stage 1.
The ECL drivers of PD, EAD and LGD are modelled at an account level which considers vintage, among other credit factors.
Also, the assessment of significant increase in credit risk is based on the initial lifetime PD curve, which accounts for the different credit risk underwritten over time.
Forbearance A financial asset is subject to forbearance when it is modified due to the credit distress of the borrower.
A modification made to the terms of an asset due to forbearance will typically be assessed as a non-substantial modification that does not result in derecognition of the original loan, except in circumstances where debt is exchanged for equity.
Both performing and non-performing forbearance assets are classified as Stage 3 except where it is established that the concession granted has not resulted in diminished financial obligation and that no other regulatory definition of default criteria has been triggered, in which case the asset is classified as Stage 2.
The minimum probationary period for non-performing forbearance is 12 months and for performing forbearance, 24 months.
Hence, a minimum of 36 months is required for non-performing forbearance to move out of a forborne state.
No financial instrument in forbearance can transfer back to Stage 1 until all of the Stage 2 thresholds are no longer met and can only move out of Stage 3 when no longer credit impaired.
Accounting for the impairment of financial assets under IAS 39 for 2017 and 2016 Loans and other assets held at amortised cost In accordance with IAS 39, the Barclays Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that loan assets will not be recovered in full and, wherever necessary, recognises an impairment loss in the income statement.
An impairment loss is recognised if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of events that have occurred and these have adversely impacted the estimated future cash flows from the assets.
These events include: becoming aware of significant financial difficulty of the issuer or obligor a breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments the Barclays Group, for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrowers financial difficulty, grants a concession that it would not otherwise consider it becomes probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties observable data at a portfolio level indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, although the decrease cannot yet be ascribed to individual financial assets in the portfolio such as adverse changes in the payment status of borrowers in the portfolio or national or local economic conditions that correlate with defaults on the assets in the portfolio.
Impairment assessments are conducted individually for significant assets, which comprise all wholesale customer loans and larger retail business loans, and collectively for smaller loans and for portfolio level risks, such as country or sectoral risks.
For the purposes of the assessment, loans with similar credit risk characteristics are grouped together generally on the basis of their product type, industry, geographical location, collateral type, past due status and other factors relevant to the evaluation of expected future cash flows.
The impairment assessment includes estimating the expected future cash flows from the asset or the group of assets, which are then discounted using the original effective interest rate calculated for the asset.
If this is lower than the carrying value of the asset or the portfolio, an impairment allowance is raised.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases, and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed by adjusting the allowance account.
The amount of the reversal is recognised in the income statement.
Following impairment, interest income continues to be recognised at the original effective interest rate on the restated carrying amount, representing the unwind of the discount of the expected cash flows, including the principal due on non-accrual loans.
Uncollectable loans are written off against the related allowance for loan impairment on completion of the Barclays Groups internal processes when all reasonably expected recoverable amounts have been collected.
barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2018 275 Notes to the financial statements Performance return 7 Credit impairment charges and other provisions continued Available for sale financial assets Impairment of available for sale debt instruments Debt instruments are assessed for impairment in the same way as loans.
If impairment is deemed to have occurred, the cumulative decline in the fair value of the instrument that has previously been recognised in the available for sale reserve is removed from reserves and recognised in the income statement.
This may be reversed if there is evidence that the circumstances of the issuer have improved.
Impairment of available for sale equity instruments Where there has been a prolonged or significant decline in the fair value of an equity instrument below its acquisition cost, it is deemed to be impaired.
The cumulative net loss that has been previously recognised directly in the available for sale reserve is removed from reserves and recognised in the income statement.
Increases in the fair value of equity instruments after impairment are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
Further declines in the fair value of equity instruments after impairment are recognised in the income statement.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements IFRS 9 impairment involves several important areas of judgement, including estimating forward looking modelled parameters PD, LGD and EAD, developing a range of unbiased future economic scenarios, estimating expected lives and assessing significant increases in credit risk, based on the Barclays Groups experience of managing credit risk.
The determination of expected life is most material for Barclays credit card portfolios which is obtained via behavioural life analysis.
As a result, the expected life of credit card portfolios is modelled over 10 years, to materially capture the risk of these facilities.
Within the retail and small businesses portfolios, which comprise large numbers of small homogenous assets with similar risk characteristics where credit scoring techniques are generally used, the impairment allowance is calculated using forward looking modelled parameters which are typically run at account level.
There are many models in use, each tailored to a product, line of business or customer category.
Judgement and knowledge is needed in selecting the statistical methods to use when the models are developed or revised.
The impairment allowance reflected in the financial statements for these portfolios is therefore considered to be reasonable and supportable.
The impairment charge reflected in the income statement for retail portfolios is 1,689m 2017: 2,095m: 2016: 2,053m of the total impairment charge on loans and advances.
For individually significant assets in Stage 3, impairment allowances are calculated on an individual basis and all relevant considerations that have a bearing on the expected future cash flows across a range of economic scenarios are taken into account.
These considerations can be subjective and can include the business prospects for the customer, the realisable value of collateral, the Barclays Groups position relative to other claimants, the reliability of customer information and the likely cost and duration of the work-out process.
The economic scenarios considered are the same as those used in the Groups ECL models.
The level of the impairment allowance is the difference between the value of the discounted expected future cash flows discounted at the loans original effective interest rate, and its carrying amount.
Furthermore, judgements change with time as new information becomes available or as work-out strategies evolve, resulting in frequent revisions to the impairment allowance as individual decisions are taken.
Changes in these estimates would result in a change in the allowances and have a direct impact on the impairment charge.
The impairment charge reflected in the financial statements in relation to wholesale portfolios is a release of 99m 2017: 238m: 2016: 299m of the total impairment charge on loans and advances.

8 Operating expenses Accounting for staff costs The Barclays Group applies IAS 19 Employee benefits in its accounting for most of the components of staff costs.
Short-term employee benefits salaries, accrued performance costs and social security are recognised over the period in which the employees provide the services to which the payments relate.
Performance costs recognised to the extent that the Barclays Group has a present obligation to its employees that can be measured reliably and are recognised over the period of service that employees are required to work to qualify for the payments.
Deferred cash and share awards are made to employees to incentivise performance over the period employees provide services.
To receive payment under an award, employees must provide service over the vesting period.
The period over which the expense for deferred cash and share awards is recognised is based upon the period employees consider their services contribute to the awards.
For past awards, the Barclays Group considers that it is appropriate to recognise the awards over the period from the date of grant to the date that the awards vest.
In relation to awards granted from 2017, the Barclays Group, taking into account the changing employee understanding surrounding those awards, considered it appropriate for expense to be recognised over the vesting period including the financial year prior to the grant date.
The accounting policies for share-based payments, and pensions and other post-retirement benefits are included in Note 32 and Note 33 respectively.

barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2018 277 Notes to the financial statements Performance return 9 Tax Accounting for income taxes The Barclays Group applies IAS 12 Income Taxes in accounting for taxes on income.
Income tax payable on taxable profits current tax is recognised as an expense in the periods in which the profits arise.
Withholding taxes are also treated as income taxes.
Income tax recoverable on tax allowable losses is recognised as a current tax asset only to the extent that it is regarded as recoverable by offsetting against taxable profits arising in the current or prior periods.
Current tax is measured using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised, except in certain circumstances where the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and legislation enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date which are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when there is both a legal right to set-off and an intention to settle on a net basis.
The Barclays Group considers an uncertain tax position to exist when it considers that ultimately, in the future, the amount of profit subject to tax may be greater than the amount initially reflected in the Barclays Groups tax returns.
The Barclays Group accounts for provisions in respect of uncertain tax positions in two different ways.
A current tax provision is recognised when it is considered probable that the outcome of a review by a tax authority of an uncertain tax position will alter the amount of cash tax due to, or from, a tax authority in the future.
From recognition, the current tax provision is then measured at the amount the Barclays Group ultimately expects to pay the tax authority to resolve the position, taking into account any interest and penalties potentially payable to the tax authority.
Deferred tax provisions are adjustments made to the carrying value of deferred tax assets in respect of uncertain tax positions.
A deferred tax provision is recognised when it is considered probable that the outcome of a review by a tax authority of an uncertain tax position will result in a reduction in the carrying value of the deferred tax asset.
From recognition of a provision, measurement of the underlying deferred tax asset is adjusted to take into account the expected impact of resolving the uncertain tax position on the loss or temporary difference giving rise to the deferred tax asset.
The approach taken to measurement takes account of whether the uncertain tax position is a discrete position that will be reviewed by the tax authority in isolation from any other position, or one of a number of issues which are expected to be reviewed together concurrently and resolved simultaneously with a tax authority.
Barclays Groups measurement of provisions is based upon its best estimate of the additional profit that will become subject to tax.
For a discrete position, consideration is given only to the merits of that position.
Where a number of issues are expected to be reviewed and resolved together, Barclays Group will take into account not only the merits of its position in respect of each particular issue but also the overall level of provision relative to the aggregate of the uncertain tax positions across all the issues that are expected to be resolved at the same time.
In addition, in assessing provision levels, it is assumed that tax authorities will review uncertain tax positions and that all facts will be fully and transparently disclosed.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements There are two key areas of judgement that impact the reported tax position.
Firstly, the level of provisioning for uncertain tax positions: and secondly, the recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets.
The Barclays Group does not consider there to be a significant risk of a material adjustment to the carrying amount of current and deferred tax balances, including provisions for uncertain tax positions in the next financial year.
The provisions for uncertain tax positions cover a diverse range of issues and reflect advice from external counsel where relevant.
It should be noted that only a proportion of the total uncertain tax positions will be under audit at any point in time, and could therefore be subject to challenge by a tax authority over the next year.
Deferred tax assets have been recognised based on business profit forecasts.
Details on the recognition of deferred tax assets is provided in this note.

In addition, the UK profits of banking companies are subject to a surcharge.
These factors, which have each increased the effective tax rate, are partially offset by the impact of non-taxable gains and income in the period, changes in the recognition of deferred tax, and the impact of adjustments in respect of prior years.
The Barclays Groups future tax charge will be sensitive to the geographic mix of profits earned and the tax rates in force in the jurisdictions that the Barclays Group operates in.
In the UK, legislation to reduce the corporation tax rate to 17% from 1 April 2020 has been enacted.
Effective from 1 January 2019, a change in accounting standards requires the tax consequences of all payments on financial instruments that are classified as equity for accounting purposes, where those payments are considered to be a distribution of profit, to be included in the income statement tax charge.
The Barclays Group currently includes the tax credit associated with deductions for payments made under Additional Tier 1 instruments as a movement in reserves.
This accounting change will result in that tax credit being included in the income statement tax charge, and this will have the effect of reducing the Barclays Groups effective tax rate from 2019.
For illustrative purposes, if this future accounting approach had been applied in 2018, then, the tax credit on payments under Additional Tier 1 instruments would have reduced the Barclays Groups total income statement tax charge by 203m.

Under US tax rules, losses occurring prior to 1 January 2018 can be carried forward and offset against profits for a period of 20 years.
The losses first arose in 2011 in the IHC Tax Group and 2008 in the US Branch Tax Group and therefore, any unused amounts may begin to expire in 2031 and 2028 respectively.
The remaining US deferred tax assets relate to temporary differences for which there is no time limit on recovery.
The deferred tax assets for the IHC and the US Branch Tax Groups tax losses are currently projected to be fully utilised by 2020.
UK Tax Group deferred tax asset The deferred tax asset in the UK Tax Group of 861m 2017: 492m relates entirely to temporary differences.

These deferred tax assets relate to a number of different territories and their recognition is based on profit forecasts or local country law which indicate that it is probable that the losses and temporary differences will be utilised.
Of the deferred tax asset of 426m 2017: 318m, an amount of 247m 2017: 218m relates to entities which have suffered a loss in either the current or prior year.
This has been taken into account in reaching the above conclusion that these deferred tax assets will be fully recovered in the future.

Fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price that would be paid to transfer a liability in an arms-length transaction with a willing counterparty, which may be an observable market price or, where there is no quoted price for the instrument, may be an estimate based on available market data.

In addition, financial assets are held at fair value through profit or loss if they do not contain contractual terms that give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI, or if the financial asset is not held in a business model that is either i a business model to collect the contractual cash flows or ii a business model that is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling.
Accounting for financial assets designated at fair value Financial assets, other than those held for trading, are classified in this category if they are so irrevocably designated at inception and the use of the designation removes or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch.
Subsequent changes in fair value for these instruments are recognised in the income statement in net investment income, except if reporting it in trading income reduces an accounting mismatch.
The details on how the fair value amounts are derived for financial assets at fair value are described in Note 17.

barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2018 283 Notes to the financial statements Assets and liabilities held at fair value 14 Derivative financial instruments Accounting for derivatives Derivative instruments are contracts whose value is derived from one or more underlying financial instruments or indices defined in the contract.
They include swaps, forward-rate agreements, futures, options and combinations of these instruments and primarily affect the Barclays Groups net interest income, net trading income and derivative assets and liabilities.
Notional amounts of the contracts are not recorded on the balance sheet.
Derivatives are used to hedge interest rate, exchange rate, commodity, and equity exposures and exposures to certain indices such as house price indices and retail price indices related to non-trading positions.
All derivative instruments are held at fair value through profit or loss, except for derivatives that are in a designated cash flow or net investment hedge accounting relationship.
Derivatives are classified as assets when their fair value is positive or as liabilities when their fair value is negative.
This includes terms included in a contract or financial liability the host, which, had it been a standalone contract, would have met the definition of a derivative.
If these are separated from the host, i. e. when the economic characteristics of the embedded derivative are not closely related with those of the host contract and the combined instrument is not measured at fair value through profit or loss, then they are accounted for in the same way as derivatives.
For financial assets, the requirements are whether the financial asset contain contractual terms that give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI, and consequently the requirements for accounting for embedded derivatives are not applicable to financial assets.
Hedge accounting The Barclays Group applies the requirements of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement for hedge accounting purposes.
The Barclays Group applies hedge accounting to represent the economic effects of its interest rate, currency and contractually linked inflation risk management strategies.
Where derivatives are held for risk management purposes, and when transactions meet the required criteria for documentation and hedge effectiveness, the Barclays Group applies fair value hedge accounting, cash flow hedge accounting, or hedging of a net investment in a foreign operation, as appropriate to the risks being hedged.
Fair value hedge accounting Changes in fair value of derivatives that qualify and are designated as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
The fair value changes adjust the carrying value of the hedged asset or liability held at amortised cost.
If hedge relationships no longer meet the criteria for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is discontinued.
For fair value hedges of interest rate risk, the fair value adjustment to the hedged item is amortised to the income statement over the period to maturity of the previously designated hedge relationship using the effective interest method.
If the hedged item is sold or repaid, the unamortised fair value adjustment is recognised immediately in the income statement.
For items classified as fair value through other comprehensive income, the hedge accounting adjustment is included in other comprehensive income.
Cash flow hedge accounting For qualifying cash flow hedges, the fair value gain or loss associated with the effective portion of the cash flow hedge is recognised initially in other comprehensive income, and then recycled to the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss.
Any ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement immediately.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the hedged item is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was recognised in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Hedges of net investments The Barclays Groups net investments in foreign operations, including monetary items accounted for as part of the net investment, are hedged for foreign currency risks using both derivatives and foreign currency borrowings.
Hedges of net investments are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges: the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is being recognised directly in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion being recognised immediately in the income statement.
The cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in the income statement on the disposal or partial disposal of the foreign operation, or other reductions in the Barclays Groups investment in the operation.

286 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2018 home.
barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 14 Derivative financial instruments continued Hedge accounting Hedge accounting is applied predominantly for the following risks: i Interest rate risk predominantly arises due to a mismatch between fixed interest rates and floating interest rates.
Interest rate risk also includes exposure to inflation risk for certain types of investments.
ii Currency risk arises due to assets or liabilities being denominated in different currencies than the functional currency of the relevant entity.
At a consolidated level, currency risk also arises when the functional currency of subsidiaries are different from the parent.
iii Contractually linked Inflation risk arises from financial instruments within contractually specified inflation risk.
The Barclays Group does not hedge inflation risk that arises from other activities.
In order to hedge the risks to which the Barclays Group is exposed, the hedging instruments employed are interest rate swaps, inflation swaps, currency swaps and foreign currency debt to: i Swap fixed interest rate exposures into variable rates.
ii Swap variable interest rate exposures into fixed rates.
iii Swap inflation exposure into either fixed or variable interest rates.
iv Swap foreign currency net investment exposure to local currency.
The hedging instruments share the same risk exposures as the hedged items, being interest rate risk, inflation risk and foreign currency risk.
Hedge effectiveness is assessed with reference to the shared risks, but to the extent hedging instruments are exposed to different risks than the hedged items, this could result in hedge ineffectiveness or hedge accounting failures.
In some cases, certain items which are economically hedged may be ineligible hedged items for the purposes of IAS 39, such as core deposits and equity.
In these instances, a proxy hedging solution can be utilised whereby portfolios of floating rate assets are designated as eligible hedged items in cash flow hedges.
The ratio between the hedged item and the hedging instruments is typically determined with reference to the sensitivity of the hedged item, on designation to the risk factor, compared to that of the hedging instrument.
In many cases the ratio is 100%.
In some hedging relationships, the Barclays Group would designate risk components of hedged items as follows: i Benchmark interest rate risk as a component of interest rate risk, such as the LIBOR component.
ii Inflation risk as a contractually specified component of a debt instrument.
iii Spot exchange rate risk for foreign currency financial assets or financial liabilities.
iv Components of cash flows of hedged items, for example certain interest payments for part of the life of an instrument.
Using the benchmark interest rate risk results in other risks such as credit risk and liquidity risk being excluded from the hedge accounting relationship.
LIBOR is considered the predominant interest rate risk and therefore the hedged items change in fair value on a fully proportionate basis with reference to this risk.
For disclosures of the extent of risk exposures that the Barclays Group manages, refer to the Risk review section.
In respect of many of the Barclays Groups hedge accounting relationships, the hedged item and hedging instrument change frequently due to the dynamic nature of the risk management and hedge accounting strategy.
The Barclays risk management strategy is to hedge interest rate risk with interest rate derivatives predominantly interest rate swaps, currency risk with currency derivatives and inflation risk with inflation derivatives.
The interest rate risk management strategy is to reduce Barclays exposure to interest rate risk to within approved risk limits.
The Barclays Group applies hedge accounting to dynamic scenarios, predominantly in relation to interest rate risk, with a combination of hedged items some hedged items are designated by proxy in order for its financial statements to reflect as closely as possible the economic risk management undertaken.
Hedge relationships are analysed and rebalanced on a daily basis.
In some cases, if the hedge accounting objective changes, the relevant hedge accounting relationship is fide-designated: in some cases, a fide-designated relationship is replaced with a different hedge accounting relationship.
Changes in the GBP value of net investments due to foreign currency movements are captured in the currency translation reserve, resulting in a movement in CET1 capital.
The Barclays Groups strategy is to minimise the volatility of the capital ratios caused by foreign exchange movements, by matching the CET1 capital movements to the revaluation of the Barclays Groups foreign currency RWA exposures.
Net investment hedges are designated where necessary to reduce the exposure to movement in a particular exchange rate to within mandated limits.
As far as possible, existing external currency liabilities are designated as the hedging instruments.
Hedging relationships are reviewed, and adjusted if necessary, at least once a month.
Sources of ineffectiveness affecting hedge accounting are as follows: i Mismatches between the contractual terms of the hedged item and hedging instrument, including basis differences between the hedged risk and the risk exposure of the hedging instrument.
ii Changes in credit risk of the hedging instruments.
iii If a hedge accounting relationship becomes overhedged.
This might occur in hedges of net investments if the net asset value designated at the start of the period falls below the amount of the hedging instrument.
iv In the cash flow hedging solution, when a hedge is built using external swaps having non-zero present values, it creates ineffectiveness.
No other source of ineffectiveness has arisen during the period.
Hedge effectiveness is determined with reference to quantitative tests, predominantly regression testing, which takes into account the regression co-efficient, the slope of the regression line, and ensuring that the relevant confidence intervals are complied with.
There were no instances of forecast transactions for which hedge accounting had been used in the previous period, but which are no longer expected to occur.

They are subsequently re-measured at fair value and changes therein except for those relating to impairment, interest income and foreign currency exchange gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income until the assets are sold.
Interest calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in the income statement in net interest income Note 3.
Upon disposal, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is included in net investment income.
In determining whether the business model is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets, it is determined that both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets are integral to achieving the objective of the business model.
The Barclays Group will consider past sales and expectations about future sales to establish if the business model is achieved.
For equity securities that are not held for trading, the Barclays Group may make an irrevocable election on initial recognition to present subsequent changes in the fair value of the instrument in other comprehensive income except for dividend income which is recognised in profit or loss.
Gains or losses on the fide-recognition of these equity securities are not transferred to profit or loss.
These assets are also not subject to the impairment requirements and therefore no amounts are recycled to the income statement.
Where the Barclays Group has not made the irrevocable election to present subsequent changes in the fair value of the instrument in other comprehensive income, equity securities are measured at fair value through profit or loss.

barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 17 Fair value of financial instruments Accounting for financial assets and liabilities fair values Financial instruments that are held for trading are recognised at fair value through profit or loss.
All financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date of initial recognition including transaction costs, other than financial instruments held at fair value through profit or loss and, depending on the classification of the asset or liability, may continue to be held at fair value either through profit or loss or other comprehensive income.
The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Wherever possible, fair value is determined by reference to a quoted market price for that instrument.
For many of the Barclays Groups financial assets and liabilities, especially derivatives, quoted prices are not available and valuation models are used to estimate fair value.
The models calculate the expected cash flows under the terms of each specific contract and then discount these values back to a present value.
These models use as their basis independently sourced market inputs including, for example, interest rate yield curves, equities and commodities prices, option volatilities and currency rates.
For financial liabilities measured at fair value, the carrying amount reflects the effect on fair value of changes in own credit spreads derived from observable market data such as in primary issuance and redemption activity for structured notes.
On initial recognition, it is presumed that the transaction price is the fair value unless there is observable information available in an active market to the contrary.
The best evidence of an instruments fair value on initial recognition is typically the transaction price.
However, if fair value can be evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument, or is based on a valuation technique whose inputs include only data from observable markets, then the instrument should be recognised at the fair value derived from such observable market data.
For valuations that have made use of unobservable inputs, the difference between the model valuation and the initial transaction price Day One profit is recognised in profit or loss either: on a straight-line basis over the term of the transaction: or over the period until all model inputs will become observable where appropriate: or released in full when previously unobservable inputs become observable.
Various factors influence the availability of observable inputs and these may vary from product to product and change over time.
Factors include the depth of activity in the relevant market, the type of product, whether the product is new and not widely traded in the marketplace, the maturity of market modelling and the nature of the transaction bespoke or generic.
To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are not observable in the market, the determination of fair value can be more subjective, dependent on the significance of the unobservable input to the overall valuation.
Unobservable inputs are determined based on the best information available, for example by reference to similar assets, similar maturities or other analytical techniques.
The sensitivity of valuations used in the financial statements to possible changes in significant unobservable inputs is shown on page 300.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The valuation of financial instruments often involves a significant degree of judgement and complexity, in particular where valuation models make use of unobservable inputs Level 3 assets and liabilities.
This note provides information on these instruments, including the related unrealised gains and losses recognised in the period, a description of significant valuation techniques and unobservable inputs, and a sensitivity analysis.
Valuation IFRS 13 Fair value measurement requires an entity to classify its assets and liabilities according to a hierarchy that reflects the observability of significant market inputs.
The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined below.
Quoted market prices Level 1 Assets and liabilities are classified as Level 1 if their value is observable in an active market.
Such instruments are valued by reference to unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets where the quoted price is readily available, and the price represents actual and regularly occurring market transactions.
An active market is one in which transactions occur with sufficient volume and frequency to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
Valuation technique using observable inputs Level 2 Assets and liabilities classified as Level 2 have been valued using models whose inputs are observable either directly or indirectly.
Valuations based on observable inputs include assets and liabilities such as swaps and forwards which are valued using market standard pricing techniques, and options that are commonly traded in markets where all the inputs to the market standard pricing models are observable.
Valuation technique using significant unobservable inputs Level 3 Assets and liabilities are classified as Level 3 if their valuation incorporates significant inputs that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
A valuation input is considered observable if it can be directly observed from transactions in an active market, or if there is compelling external evidence demonstrating an executable exit price.
Unobservable input levels are generally determined via reference to observable inputs, historical observations or using other analytical techniques.

Valuation techniques and sensitivity analysis Sensitivity analysis is performed on products with significant unobservable inputs Level 3 to generate a range of reasonably possible alternative valuations.
The sensitivity methodologies applied take account of the nature of the valuation techniques used, as well as the availability and reliability of observable proxy and historical data and the impact of using alternative models.
Sensitivities are dynamically calculated on a monthly basis.
The calculation is based on range or spread data of a reliable reference source or a scenario based on relevant market analysis alongside the impact of using alternative models.
Sensitivities are calculated without reflecting the impact of any diversification in the portfolio.
The valuation techniques used for the material products within Levels 2 and 3, and observability and sensitivity analysis for products within Level 3, are described below.
barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2018 293 Notes to the financial statements Assets and liabilities held at fair value 17 Fair value of financial instruments continued Interest rate derivatives Description: Derivatives linked to interest rates or inflation indices.
The category includes futures, interest rate and inflation swaps, swaptions, caps, floors, inflation options, balance guaranteed swaps and other exotic interest rate derivatives.
Valuation: Interest rate and inflation derivatives are generally valued using curves of forward rates constructed from market data to project and discount the expected future cash flows of trades.
Instruments with optionality are valued using volatilities implied from market inputs, and use industry standard or bespoke models depending on the product type.
Observability: In general, inputs are considered observable up to liquid maturities which are determined separately for each input and underlying.
Unobservable inputs are generally set by referencing liquid market instruments and applying extrapolation techniques or inferred via another reasonable method.
Level 3 sensitivity: Sensitivity to unobservable valuation inputs is based on the dispersion of consensus data services where available, or alternatively it is based on stress scenarios or historic data.
Foreign exchange derivatives Description: Derivatives linked to the foreign exchange FX market.
The category includes FX forward contracts, FX swaps and FX options.
The majority are traded as over the counter OTC derivatives.
Valuation: FX derivatives are valued using industry standard and bespoke models depending on the product type.
Valuation inputs include FX rates, interest rates, FX volatilities, interest rate volatilities, FX interest rate correlations and others as appropriate.
Observability: FX correlations, forwards and volatilities are generally observable up to liquid maturities which are determined separately for each input and underlying.
Unobservable inputs are set by referencing liquid market instruments and applying extrapolation techniques, or inferred via another reasonable method.
Level 3 sensitivity: Sensitivity relating to unobservable valuation inputs is primarily based on the dispersion of consensus data services.
Credit derivatives Description: Derivatives linked to the credit spread of a referenced entity, index or basket of referenced entities or a pool of referenced assets e. g. a securitised product.
The category includes single name and index credit default swaps CDS and asset backed CDS.
Valuation: CDS are valued on industry standard models using curves of credit spreads as the principal input.
Credit spreads are observed directly from broker data, third party vendors or priced to proxies.
Observability: CDS contracts referencing entities that are actively traded are generally considered observable.
Other valuation inputs are considered observable if products with significant sensitivity to the inputs are actively traded in a liquid market.
Unobservable valuation inputs are generally determined with reference to recent transactions or inferred from observable trades of the same issuer or similar entities.
Level 3 sensitivity: Sensitivity to unobservable CDS contracts is determined by applying a shift to credit spread curves based on the average range of pricing observed in the market for similar CDS.
Equity derivatives Description: Exchange traded or OTC derivatives linked to equity indices and single names.
The category includes vanilla and exotic equity products.
Valuation: Equity derivatives are valued using industry standard models.
Valuation inputs include stock prices, dividends, volatilities, interest rates, equity repurchase curves and, for multi-asset products, correlations.
Observability: In general, valuation inputs are observable up to liquid maturities which are determined separately for each input and underlying.
Level 3 sensitivity: Sensitivity is generally estimated using the dispersion of consensus data services.
Commodity derivatives Description: Exchange traded and OTC derivatives based on underlying commodities such as metals, crude oil and refined products, agricultural, power and natural gas.
Valuation: Commodity swaps and options are valued using models incorporating discounting of cash flows and other industry standard modelling techniques.
Valuation inputs include forward curves, volatilities implied from market observable inputs and correlations.
Observability: Commodity correlations, forwards and volatilities are generally observable up to liquid maturities which are determined separately for each input and underlying.
Unobservable inputs are set with reference to similar observable products, or by applying extrapolation techniques to observable inputs.
Level 3 sensitivity: Sensitivity is determined primarily by measuring historical variability over a period of years.
Where historical data is unavailable or uncertainty is due to volumetric risk, sensitivity is measured by applying appropriate stress scenarios or using proxy bid-offer spread levels.
294 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2018 home.
barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 17 Fair value of financial instruments continued Complex derivative instruments Valuation estimates made by counterparties with respect to complex derivative instruments, for the purpose of determining the amount of collateral to be posted, often differ, sometimes significantly, from Barclays own estimates.
In almost all cases, Barclays has been able to successfully resolve such differences or otherwise reach an accommodation with respect to collateral posting levels, including in certain cases by entering into compromise collateral arrangements.
Due to the ongoing nature of collateral calls, Barclays will often be engaged in discussion with one or more counterparties in respect of such differences at any given time.
Valuation estimates made by counterparties for collateral purposes are considered, like any other third party valuation, when determining Barclays fair value estimates.
Government and government sponsored debt Description: Government bonds, supra sovereign bonds and agency bonds.
Valuation: Liquid bonds that are actively traded through an exchange or clearing house are marked to the levels observed in these markets.
Other actively traded bonds are valued using observable market prices sourced from broker quotes, inter-dealer prices or other reliable pricing sources.
Observability: Prices for actively traded bonds are considered observable.
Unobservable bonds prices are generally determined by reference to bond yields for actively traded bonds from the same or a similar issuer.
Level 3 sensitivity: Sensitivity is generally determined by using a range of observable alternative prices.
Corporate debt Description: Primarily corporate bonds.
Valuation: Corporate bonds are valued using observable market prices sourced from broker quotes, inter-dealer prices or other reliable pricing sources.
Unobservable bonds prices are generally determined by reference to bond yields or CDS spreads for actively traded instruments issued by or referencing the same or a similar issuer.
Level 3 sensitivity: Sensitivity is generally determined by applying a shift to bond yields using the average ranges of external levels observed in the market for similar bonds.
Certificates of deposit, commercial paper and other money market instruments Description: Certificates of deposit, commercial paper and other money market instruments.
Valuation: Instruments are valued using observable market prices sourced from broker quotes, inter-dealer prices or other reliable pricing services.
Observability: Prices for actively traded instruments are considered observable.
Unobservable instrument prices are generally determined by reference to bond yields or CDS spreads for actively traded instruments issued by or referencing the same or a similar issuer.
Level 3 sensitivity: Sensitivity is generally calculated by using a range of observable alternative prices.
Margin Lending Description: Includes Prime Brokerage Margin Lending, and other similar secured lending agreements.
The agreements are primarily short-term in nature.
Valuation: Prime Brokerage Margin Lending transactions are generally valued by discounting the expected future cash flows using industry standard models that incorporate market interest rates and repurchase rates, based on the specific details of the transaction.
Observability: Inputs are deemed observable up to liquid maturities, and are determined based on the specific features of the transaction.
Unobservable inputs are generally set by referencing liquid market instruments and applying extrapolation techniques, or inferred via another reasonable method.
Level 3 sensitivity: Sensitivity is generally estimated using the dispersion of consensus data services, or historic trade data.
In general, the sensitivity of unobservable inputs is not significant to the overall valuation given the predominantly short-term nature of the agreements.
Reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements Description: Includes securities purchased under resale agreements, securities sold under repurchase agreements, and other similar secured lending agreements.
Valuation: Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements are generally valued by discounting the expected future cash flows using industry standard models that incorporate market interest rates and repurchase rates, based on the specific details of the transaction.
Level 3 sensitivity: Sensitivity is generally estimated using the dispersion of consensus data services, stress scenarios or historic data.
Non-asset backed loans Description: Largely made up of fixed rate loans.
Valuation: Fixed rate loans are valued using models that discount expected future cash flows based on interest rates and loan spreads.
Observability: Within this loan population, the loan spread is generally unobservable.
Unobservable loan spreads are determined by incorporating funding costs, the level of comparable assets such as gilts, issuer credit quality and other factors.
Level 3 sensitivity: The sensitivity of fixed rate loans is calculated by applying a shift to loan spreads.
barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2018 295 Notes to the financial statements Assets and liabilities held at fair value 17 Fair value of financial instruments continued Asset backed securities Description: Securities that are linked to the cash flows of a pool of referenced assets via securitisation.
The category includes residential mortgage backed securities, commercial mortgage backed securities, CDOs, collateralised loan obligations CLOs and other asset backed securities.
Valuation: Where available, valuations are based on observable market prices sourced from broker quotes and inter-dealer prices.
Otherwise, valuations are determined using industry standard discounted cash flow analysis that calculates the fair value based on valuation inputs such as constant default rate, conditional prepayment rate, loss given default and yield.
These inputs are determined by reference to a number of sources including proxying to observed transactions, market indices or market research, and by assessing underlying collateral performance.
Proxying to observed transactions, indices or research requires an assessment and comparison of the relevant securities underlying attributes including collateral, tranche, vintage, underlying asset composition historical losses, borrower characteristics and loan attributes such as loan to value ratio and geographic concentration and credit ratings original and current.
Observability: Where an asset backed product does not have an observable market price and the valuation is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis, the instrument is considered unobservable.
Level 3 sensitivity: The sensitivity analysis for asset backed products is based on externally sourced pricing dispersion or by stressing the inputs of discount cash flow analysis.
Issued debt Description: Debt notes issued by Barclays.
Valuation: Issued debt is valued using discounted cash flow techniques and industry standard models incorporating various inputs observed for each instrument.
Observability: Barclays issued notes are generally observable.
Structured notes are debt instruments containing embedded derivatives.
Where either an input to the embedded derivative or the debt instrument is deemed unobservable and significant to the overall valuation of the note, the structured note is classified as Level 3.
Level 3 sensitivity: Sensitivity to the unobservable input in the embedded derivative is calculated in line with the method used for the derivative instrument concerned.
Equity cash products Description: Includes listed equities, Exchange Traded Funds ETF and preference shares.
Valuation: Valuation of equity cash products is primarily determined through market observable prices.
Observability: Prices for actively traded equity cash products are considered observable.
Unobservable equity prices are generally determined by reference to actively traded instruments that are similar in nature, or inferred via another reasonable method.
Level 3 sensitivity: Sensitivity is generally calculated based on applying a shift to the valuation of the underlying asset.
Private equity investments Description: Includes private equity holdings and principal investments.
Valuation: Private equity investments are valued in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines which require the use of a number of individual pricing benchmarks such as the prices of recent transactions in the same or similar entities, discounted cash flow analysis and comparison with the earnings multiples of listed companies.
While the valuation of unquoted equity instruments is subjective by nature, the relevant methodologies are commonly applied by other market participants and have been consistently applied over time.
Observability: Inputs are considered observable if there is active trading in a liquid market of products with significant sensitivity to the inputs.
Unobservable inputs include earnings estimates, multiples of comparative companies, marketability discounts and discount rates.
Level 3 sensitivity: Private equity valuation models are each sensitive to a number of key assumptions, such as projected future earnings, comparator multiples, marketability discounts and discount rates.
Valuation sensitivity is generally estimated by shifting assumptions to reasonable alternative levels.
Assets and liabilities held for sale Description: Assets and liabilities held for sale consist of disposal groups Barclays intend to sell.
Valuation: Assets and liabilities held for sale are valued at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to sell.
Level 3 sensitivity: The disposal groups that are measured at fair value less cost to sell are valued at the agreed price less costs to sell and are not expected to display significant sensitivity.
The sensitivity of the assets and liabilities measured at carrying value is explained within the relevant product descriptions.

Assets and liabilities reclassified between Level 1 and Level 2 During the period, there were no material transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 period ended December 2017: 3,807m government bonds assets and 1,023m 950 m of commodity derivative assets and liabilities transferred from Level 1 to Level 2.
Level 3 movement analysis The following table summarises the movements in the Level 3 balances during the period.
Transfers have been reflected as if they had taken place at the beginning of the year.
Assets and liabilities included in disposal groups classified as held for sale and measured at fair value less cost to sell are not included as these are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.
Asset and liability transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 are primarily due to 1 an increase or decrease in observable market activity related to an input or 2 a change in the significance of the unobservable input, with assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 if an unobservable input is deemed significant.

A basis point equals 1 100th of 1%: for example, 150 basis points equals 1.5%.
b Certain derivative instruments are classified as Level 3 due to a significant unobservable credit spread input into the calculation of the Credit Valuation Adjustment for the instruments.
The range of significant unobservable credit spreads is between 6-897bps 2017: 31-596bps.
c A range has not been provided for Net Asset Value as there would be a wide range reflecting the diverse nature of the positions.
d Other includes commercial real estate loans, funds and fund-linked products, asset backed loans, physical commodities and investment property.
The following section describes the significant unobservable inputs identified in the table above, and the sensitivity of fair value measurement of the instruments categorised as Level 3 assets or liabilities to increases in significant unobservable inputs.
Where sensitivities are described, the inverse relationship will also generally apply.
Where reliable interrelationships can be identified between significant unobservable inputs used in fair value measurement, a description of those interrelationships is included below.
Forwards A price or rate that is applicable to a financial transaction that will take place in the future.
In general, a significant increase in a forward in isolation will result in a fair value increase for the contracted receiver of the underlying currency, bond, commodity, etc.
but the sensitivity is dependent on the specific terms of the instrument.
Credit spread Credit spreads typically represent the difference in yield between an instrument and a benchmark security or reference rate.
Credit spreads reflect the additional yield that a market participant demands for taking on exposure to the credit risk of an instrument and form part of the yield used in a discounted cash flow calculation.
In general, a significant increase in credit spread in isolation will result in a movement in a fair value decrease for a cash asset.
For a derivative instrument, a significant increase in credit spread in isolation can result in a fair value increase or decrease depending on the specific terms of the instrument.
barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2018 301 Notes to the financial statements Notes to the financial statements Assets and liabilities held at fair value 17 Fair value of financial instruments continued Volatility Volatility is a measure of the variability or uncertainty in return for a given derivative underlying.
It is an estimate of how much a particular underlying instrument input or index will change in value over time.
In general, volatilities are implied from observed option prices.
For unobservable options the implied volatility may reflect additional assumptions about the nature of the underlying risk, and the strike maturity profile of a specific contract.
In general a significant increase in volatility in isolation will result in a fair value increase for the holder of a simple option, but the sensitivity is dependent on the specific terms of the instrument.
There may be interrelationships between unobservable volatilities and other unobservable inputs e. g. when equity prices fall, implied equity volatilities generally rise but these are generally specific to individual markets and may vary over time.
Correlation Correlation is a measure of the relationship between the movements of two variables.
Correlation can be a significant input into valuation of derivative contracts with more than one underlying instrument.
Credit correlation generally refers to the correlation between default processes for the separate names that make up the reference pool of a CDO structure.
A significant increase in correlation in isolation can result in a fair value increase or decrease depending on the specific terms of the instrument.
Comparable price Comparable instrument prices are used in valuation by calculating an implied yield or spread over a liquid benchmark from the price of a comparable observable instrument, then adjusting that yield or spread to account for relevant differences such as maturity or credit quality.
Alternatively, a price-to-price basis can be assumed between the comparable and unobservable instruments in order to establish a value.
In general, a significant increase in comparable price in isolation will result in an increase in the price of the unobservable instrument.
For derivatives, a change in the comparable price in isolation can result in a fair value increase or decrease depending on the specific terms of the instrument.
Loan spread Loan spreads typically represent the difference in yield between an instrument and a benchmark security or reference rate.
Loan spreads typically reflect credit quality, the level of comparable assets such as gilts and other factors, and form part of the yield used in a discounted cash flow calculation.
The ESHLA portfolio primarily consists of long-dated fixed rate loans extended to counterparties in the UK Education, Social Housing and Local Authority sectors.
The loans are categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to their illiquid nature and the significance of unobservable loan spreads to the valuation.
Valuation uncertainty arises from the long-dated nature of the portfolio, the lack of secondary market in the loans and the lack of observable loan spreads.
The majority of ESHLA loans are to borrowers in heavily regulated sectors that are considered extremely low credit risk, and have a history of zero defaults since inception.
While the overall loan spread range is from 30bps to 531bps 2017: 30bps to 596bps, the vast majority of spreads are concentrated towards the bottom end of this range, with 99% of the loan notional being valued with spreads less than 200bps consistently for both years.
In general, a significant increase in loan spreads in isolation will result in a fair value decrease for a loan.
Loss given default Loss given default represents the expected loss upon liquidation of the collateral as a percentage of the balance outstanding.
In general, a significant increase in the loss given default in isolation will translate to lower recovery and lower projected cash flows to pay to the securitisation, resulting in a movement in fair value that is unfavourable for the holder of the securitised product.
EBITDA multiple EBITDA multiple is the ratio of the valuation of the investment to the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation.
In general, a significant increase in the multiple will result in a fair value increase for an investment.
Fair value adjustments Key balance sheet valuation adjustments are quantified below: 2018 2017 m m Exit price adjustments derived from market bid-offer spreads 457 391 Uncollateralised derivative funding 47 45 Derivative credit valuation adjustments 125 103 Derivative debit valuation adjustments 237 131 Exit price adjustments derived from market bid-offer spreads The Barclays Group uses mid-market pricing where it is a market maker and has the ability to transact at, or better than, mid price which is the case for certain equity, bond and vanilla derivative markets.
For other financial assets and liabilities, bid-offer adjustments are recorded to reflect the exit level for the expected close out strategy.
The methodology for determining the bid-offer adjustment for a derivative portfolio involves calculating the net risk exposure by offsetting long and short positions by strike and term in accordance with the risk management and hedging strategy.
Bid-offer levels are generally derived from market quotes such as broker data.
Less liquid instruments may not have a directly observable bid-offer level.
In such instances, an exit price adjustment may be derived from an observable bid-offer level for a comparable liquid instrument, or determined by calibrating to derivative prices, or by scenario or historical analysis.
Exit price adjustments derived from market bid-offer spreads have increased by 66m to 457m as a result of movements in market bid offer spreads.

barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 17 Fair value of financial instruments continued Discounting approaches for derivative instruments Collateralised In line with market practice, the methodology for discounting collateralised derivatives takes into account the nature and currency of the collateral that can be posted within the relevant credit support annex CSA.
The CSA aware discounting approach recognises the cheapest to deliver option that reflects the ability of the party posting collateral to change the currency of the collateral.
Uncollateralised A fair value adjustment of 47m is applied to account for the impact of incorporating the cost of funding into the valuation of uncollateralised and partially collateralised derivative portfolios and collateralised derivatives where the terms of the agreement do not allow the rehypothecation of collateral received.
This adjustment is referred to as the Funding Fair Value Adjustment FFVA.
FFVA has increased by 2m to 47m mainly as a result of change in Barclays funding spreads and trading activity.
FFVA is determined by calculating the net expected exposure at a counterparty level and applying a funding rate to the exposure that reflects the market cost of funding.
Barclays internal Treasury rates are used as an input to the calculation.
The approach takes into account the probability of default of each counterparty, as well as any mandatory break clauses.
FFVA incorporates a scaling factor which is an estimate of the extent to which the cost of funding is incorporated into observed traded levels.
On calibrating the scaling factor, it is with the assumption that Credit Valuation Adjustments CVA and Debit Valuation Adjustments DVA are retained as valuation components incorporated into such levels.
The effect of incorporating this scaling factor at 31 December 2018 was to reduce FFVA by 141m 2017: 138m.
The approach outlined above has been in use since 2012 with no significant changes.
Barclays continues to monitor market practices and activity to ensure the approach to uncollateralised derivative valuation remains appropriate.
Derivative credit and debit valuation adjustments CVA and DVA are incorporated into derivative valuations to reflect the impact on fair value of counterparty credit risk and Barclays own credit quality respectively.
These adjustments are calculated for uncollateralised and partially collateralised derivatives across all asset classes.
CVA and DVA are calculated using estimates of exposure at default, probability of default and recovery rates, at a counterparty level.
Counterparties include but are not limited to corporates, sovereigns and sovereign agencies and supranationals.
Exposure at default is generally estimated through the simulation of underlying risk factors through approximating with a more vanilla structure, or by using current or scenario-based mark to market as an estimate of future exposure.
Probability of default and recovery rate information is generally sourced from the CDS markets.
Where this information is not available, or considered unreliable, alternative approaches are taken based on mapping internal counterparty ratings onto historical or market-based default and recovery information.
In particular, this applies to sovereign related names where the effect of using the recovery assumptions implied in CDS levels would imply a 50m 2017: 50m increase in CVA.
Correlation between counterparty credit and underlying derivative risk factors, termed wrong-way, or right-way risk, is not systematically incorporated into the CVA calculation but is adjusted where the underlying exposure is directly related to the counterparty.
CVA increased by 22m to 125m, primarily due to widening of counterparty credit spreads, changes in non-credit factors impacting CVA and trading activity.
DVA increased by 106m to 237m, primarily as a result of Barclays credit spreads widening.
Portfolio exemptions The Barclays Group uses the portfolio exemption in IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement to measure the fair value of groups of financial assets and liabilities.
Instruments are measured using the price that would be received to sell a net long position i. e. an asset for a particular risk exposure or to transfer a net short position i. e. a liability for a particular risk exposure in an orderly transaction between market participants at the balance sheet date under current market conditions.
Accordingly, the Barclays Group measures the fair value of the group of financial assets and liabilities consistently with how market participants would price the net risk exposure at the measurement date.
Unrecognised gains as a result of the use of valuation models using unobservable inputs The amount that has yet to be recognised in income that relates to the difference between the transaction price the fair value at initial recognition and the amount that would have arisen had valuation models using unobservable inputs been used on initial recognition, less amounts subsequently recognised, is 141m 2017: 109m for financial instruments measured at fair value and 262m 2017: 253m for financial instruments carried at amortised cost.
There are additions of 65m 2017: 34m, and amortisation and releases of 33m 2017: 104m for financial instruments measured at fair value and additions of 29m 2017: 119m and amortisation and releases of 20m 2017: 22m for financial instruments measured at amortised cost.
Third party credit enhancements Structured and brokered certificates of deposit issued by Barclays are insured up to $250,000 per depositor by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC in the US.
The FDIC is funded by premiums that Barclays and other banks pay for deposit insurance coverage.
The carrying value of these issued certificates of deposit that are designated under the IFRS 9 fair value option includes this third party credit enhancement.
The on-balance sheet value of these brokered certificates of deposit amounted to 4,797m 2017: 4,070m.

b Disposal groups held for sale and measured at fair value less cost to sell are included in the fair value table.
The fair value is an estimate of the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
As a wide range of valuation techniques are available, it may not be appropriate to directly compare this fair value information to independent market sources or other financial institutions.
Different valuation methodologies and assumptions can have a significant impact on fair values which are based on unobservable inputs.
Financial assets The carrying value of financial assets held at amortised cost is determined in accordance with the relevant accounting policy in Note 19.
Loans and advances at amortised cost The fair value of loans and advances, for the purpose of this disclosure, is derived from discounting expected cash flows in a way that reflects the current market price for lending to issuers of similar credit quality.
Where market data or credit information on the underlying borrowers is unavailable, a number of proxy extrapolation techniques are employed to determine the appropriate discount rates.
For retail lending, i. e. home loans and credit cards, tailored discounted cash flow models are predominantly used to estimate the fair value of different product types.
For example, for home loans different models are used to estimate fair values of tracker, offset and fixed rate mortgage products.
Key inputs to these models are the differentials between historic and current product margins and estimated prepayment rates.
The discount of fair value to carrying amount for home loans has reduced to 0.9% 2017: 1.2% The fair value of corporate loans is calculated by the use of discounted cash flow techniques where the gross loan values are discounted at a rate of difference between contractual margins and hurdle rates or spreads where Barclays charges a margin over LIBOR depending on credit quality and loss given default and years to maturity.
The discount between the carrying and fair value remained constant at 1.5% 2017: 1.5%.
Reverse repurchase agreements The fair value of reverse repurchase agreements approximates carrying amount as these balances are generally short dated and fully collateralised.
304 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2018 home.
barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 17 Fair value of financial instruments continued Financial liabilities The carrying value of financial liabilities held at amortised cost is determined in accordance with the accounting policy in Note 1.
Deposits at amortised cost In many cases, the fair value disclosed approximates carrying value because the instruments are short term in nature or have interest rates that reprice frequently, such as customer accounts and other deposits and short-term debt securities.
The fair value for deposits with longer-term maturities, mainly time deposits, are estimated using discounted cash flows applying either market rates or current rates for deposits of similar remaining maturities.
Consequently, the fair value discount is minimal.
Debt securities in issue Fair values of other debt securities in issue are based on quoted prices where available, or where the instruments are short dated, carrying amount approximates fair value.
Repurchase agreements The fair value of repurchase agreements approximates carrying amounts as these balances are generally short dated.
Subordinated liabilities Fair values for dated and undated convertible and non-convertible loan capital are based on quoted market rates for the issuer concerned or issuers with similar terms and conditions.
18 Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities In accordance with IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation, the Barclays Group reports financial assets and financial liabilities on a net basis on the balance sheet only if there is a legally enforceable right to set-off the recognised amounts and there is intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
The following table shows the impact of netting arrangements on: all financial assets and liabilities that are reported net on the balance sheet all derivative financial instruments and reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements and other similar secured lending and borrowing agreements that are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements, but do not qualify for balance sheet netting.
The table identifies the amounts that have been offset in the balance sheet and also those amounts that are covered by enforceable netting arrangements offsetting arrangements and financial collateral but do not qualify for netting under the requirements of IAS 32 described above.
The Net amounts presented on the next page are not intended to represent the Barclays Groups actual exposure to credit risk, as a variety of credit mitigation strategies are employed in addition to netting and collateral arrangements.
Amounts offset for Derivative financial liabilities include cash collateral netted of 2,645m 2017: 1,820m.
Settlements assets and liabilities have been offset amounting to 23,095m 2017: 13,241m.
No other significant recognised financial assets and liabilities were offset in the balance sheet.
Therefore, the only balance sheet categories necessary for inclusion in the table are those shown above.
b Financial collateral of 36,904m 2017: 39,262m was received in respect of derivative assets, including 31,402m 2017: 33,092m of cash collateral and 5,502m 2017: 6,170m of noncash collateral.
Financial collateral of 32,959m 2017: 36,444m was placed in respect of derivative liabilities, including 29,842m 2017: 32,575m of cash collateral and 3,117m 2017: 3,869m of non-cash collateral.
The collateral amounts are limited to net balance sheet exposure so as to not include .
c This column includes contractual rights of set-off that are subject to uncertainty under the laws of the relevant jurisdiction.
d The balance sheet total is the sum of Net amounts reported on the balance sheet that are subject to enforceable netting arrangements and Amounts not subject to enforceable netting arrangements.
e Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase agreements include instruments at amortised cost and instruments designated at fair value through profit and loss.
Reverse repurchase agreements and other similar secured lending of 121,349m 2017: 112,586m is split by fair value 119,041m 2017: 100,040m and amortised cost 2,308m 2017: 12,546m.
Repurchase agreements and other similar secured borrowing of 157,062m 2017: 167,029m is split by fair value 138,484m 2017: 126,691m and amortised cost 18,578m 2017: 40,338m.
barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2018 305 Notes to the financial statements Assets and liabilities held at fair value 18 Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities continued Derivative assets and liabilities The Financial instruments column identifies financial assets and liabilities that are subject to set-off under netting agreements, such as the ISDA Master Agreement or derivative exchange or clearing counterparty agreements, whereby all outstanding transactions with the same counterparty can be offset and close-out netting applied across all outstanding transactions covered by the agreements if an event of default or other predetermined events occur.
Financial collateral refers to cash and non-cash collateral obtained, typically daily or weekly, to cover the net exposure between counterparties by enabling the collateral to be realised in an event of default or if other predetermined events occur.
Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements and other similar secured lending and borrowing The Amounts offset column identifies financial assets and liabilities that are subject to set-off under netting agreements, such as Global Master Repurchase Agreements and Global Master Securities Lending Agreements, whereby all outstanding transactions with the same counterparty can be offset and close-out netting applied across all outstanding transactions covered by the agreements if an event of default or other predetermined events occur.
Financial collateral typically comprises highly liquid securities which are legally transferred and can be liquidated in the event of counterparty default.
These offsetting and collateral arrangements and other credit risk mitigation strategies used by Barclays Group are further explained in the Credit risk mitigation section on page 138.

barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information Notes to the financial statements Financial instruments held at amortised cost The notes included in this section focus on assets that are held at amortised cost arising from the Barclays Groups retail and wholesale lending including loans and advances and deposits at amortised cost and finance leases.
Details regarding the Barclays Groups liquidity and capital position can be found on pages 181 to 204.
19 Loans and advances and deposits at amortised cost Accounting for loans and advances and deposits held at amortised cost under IFRS 9 effective from 1 January 2018 Loans and advances to customers and banks, customer accounts, debt securities and most financial liabilities, are held at amortised cost.
That is, the initial fair value which is normally the amount advanced or borrowed is adjusted for repayments and the amortisation of coupon, fees and expenses to represent the effective interest rate of the asset or liability.
Balances deferred on-balance sheet as effective interest rate adjustments are amortised to interest income over the life of the financial instrument to which they relate.
Financial assets that are held in a business model to collect the contractual cash flows and that contain contractual terms that give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI, are measured at amortised cost.
The carrying value of these financial assets at initial recognition includes any directly attributable transaction costs.
Refer to Note 1 for details on solely payments of principal and interest.
In determining whether the business model is a hold to collect model, the objective of the business model must be to hold the financial asset to collect contractual cash flows rather than holding the financial asset for trading or short-term profit taking purposes.
While the objective of the business model must be to hold the financial asset to collect contractual cash flows this does not mean Barclays Group is required to hold the financial assets until maturity.
When determining if the business model objective is to collect contractual cash flows Barclays Group will consider past sales and expectations about future sales.
Accounting for loans and advances and deposits held at amortised cost under IAS 39 for 2017 and 2016 Loans and advances to customers and banks, customer accounts, debt securities and most financial liabilities, are held at amortised cost.
In accordance with IAS 39, where the Barclays Group no longer intends to trade in financial assets it may transfer them out of the held for trading classification and measure them at amortised cost if they meet the definition of a loan.
The initial value used for the purposes of establishing amortised cost is fair value on the date of the transfer.

barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2018 307 Notes to the financial statements Financial instruments held at amortised cost 20 Finance leases Accounting for finance leases The Barclays Group applies IAS 17 Leases in accounting for finance leases, both where it is the lessor or the lessee.
A finance lease is a lease which confers substantially all the risks and rewards of the leased assets on the lessee.
Where the Barclays Group is the lessor, the leased asset is not held on the balance sheet: instead a finance lease receivable is recognised representing the minimum lease payments receivable under the terms of the lease, discounted at the rate of interest implicit in the lease.
Where the Barclays Group is the lessee, the leased asset is recognised in property, plant and equipment and a finance lease liability is recognised, representing the minimum lease payments payable under the lease, discounted at the rate of interest implicit in the lease.
Interest income or expense is recognised in interest receivable or payable, allocated to accounting periods to reflect a constant periodic rate of return.
Finance lease receivables Finance lease receivables are included within loans and advances at amortised cost.
The Barclays Group specialises in the provision of leasing and other asset finance facilities across a broad range of asset types to business customers.

barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information Notes to the financial statements Non-current assets and other investments The notes included in this section focus on the Barclays Groups non-current tangible and intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, which provide long-term future economic benefits.
21 Property, plant and equipment Accounting for property, plant and equipment The Barclays Group applies IAS 16 Property Plant and Equipment and IAS 40 Investment Properties.
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, which includes direct and incremental acquisition costs less accumulated depreciation and provisions for impairment, if required.
Subsequent costs are capitalised if these result in enhancement of the asset.
Depreciation is provided on the depreciable amount of items of property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives.
Depreciation rates, methods and the residual values underlying the calculation of depreciation of items of property, plant and equipment are kept under review to take account of any change in circumstances.
The Barclays Group uses the following annual rates in calculating depreciation: Annual rates in calculating depreciation Depreciation rate Freehold land Not depreciated Freehold buildings and long-leasehold property more than 50 years to run 2-3.3% Leasehold property over the remaining life of the lease less than 50 years to run Over the remaining life of the lease Costs of adaptation of freehold and leasehold property 6-10% Equipment installed in freehold and leasehold property 6-10% Computers and similar equipment 17-33% Fixtures and fittings and other equipment 9-20% Costs of adaptation and installed equipment are depreciated over the shorter of the life of the lease or the depreciation rates noted in the table above.
Investment property The Barclays Group initially recognises investment property at cost, and subsequently at fair value at each balance sheet date, reflecting market conditions at the reporting date.
Gains and losses on remeasurement are included in the income statement.

The fair value of investment property is determined by reference to current market prices for similar properties, adjusted as necessary for condition and location, or by reference to recent transactions updated to reflect current economic conditions.
Discounted cash flow techniques may be employed to calculate fair value where there have been no recent transactions, using current external market inputs such as market rents and interest rates.
Valuations are carried out by management with the support of appropriately qualified independent valuers.
Refer to Note 17 for further details.
22 Goodwill and intangible assets Accounting for goodwill and intangible assets Goodwill The carrying value of goodwill is determined in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations and IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the Barclays Groups share of the assets acquired and the liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed on the date of the acquisition.
Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment, or more frequently when there are indications that impairment may have occurred.
The test involves comparing the carrying value of goodwill with the present value of the pre-tax cash flows, discounted at a rate of interest that reflects the inherent risks, of the cash generating unit CGU to which the goodwill relates, or the CGUs fair value if this is higher.
Intangible assets Intangible assets other than goodwill are accounted for in accordance with IAS 38 Intangible Assets.
Intangible assets are initially recognised when they are separable or arise from contractual or other legal rights, the cost can be measured reliably and, in the case of intangible assets not acquired in a business combination, where it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the assets will flow from their use.
Intangible assets are stated at cost which is, in the case of assets acquired in a business combination, the acquisition date fair value less accumulated amortisation and provisions for impairment, if any, and are amortised over their useful lives in a manner that reflects the pattern to which they contribute to future cash flows, generally using the amortisation periods set out below: Annual rates in calculating amortisation Amortisation period Goodwill Not amortised a Internally generated software 12 months to 6 years Other software 12 months to 6 years Customer lists 12 months to 25 years Licences and other 12 months to 25 years Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when there are indications that impairment may have occurred.
Note a Exceptions to the above rate relate to useful lives of certain core banking platforms that are assessed individually and, if appropriate, amortised over longer periods ranging from 10 to 15 years.

This includes the identification of independent CGUs and the allocation of goodwill to these units based on which units are expected to benefit from the acquisition.
The allocation is reviewed following business reorganisations.
Cash flow projections necessarily take into account changes in the market in which a business operates including the level of growth, competitive activity, and the impacts of regulatory change.
Determining both the expected pre-tax cash flows and the risk adjusted interest rate appropriate to the operating unit requires the exercise of judgement.
The estimation of pre-tax cash flows is sensitive to the periods for which detailed forecasts are available and to assumptions regarding long-term sustainable cash flows.
Other intangible assets Determining the estimated useful lives of intangible assets such as those arising from contractual relationships requires an analysis of circumstances.
The assessment of whether an asset is exhibiting indicators of impairment as well as the calculation of impairment, which requires the estimate of future cash flows and fair values less costs to sell, also requires the preparation of cash flow forecasts and fair values for assets that may not be regularly bought and sold.
Impairment testing of goodwill During 2018, the Barclays Group recognised an impairment charge of nil 2017: nil.
Key assumptions The key assumptions used for impairment testing are set out below for each significant goodwill balance.
Other goodwill of 560m 2017: 769m was allocated to multiple CGUs which are not considered individually significant.
barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2018 311 Notes to the financial statements Non-current assets and other investments 22 Goodwill and intangible assets continued Barclays UK Goodwill within Personal Banking was 2,718m 2017: 2,718m of which 2,501m 2017: 2,501m was attributable to Woolwich and within Business Banking was 629m 2017: 629m, fully attributable to Woolwich.
The carrying value of the CGUs have been determined by using net asset values.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs, calculated as value in use, have been determined using cash flow predictions based on financial budgets approved by management, covering a five-year period, with a terminal growth rate of 1.8% 2017: 2% applied thereafter.
The forecasted cash flows have been discounted at a pre-tax rate of 13.7% 2017: 13.9%.
Based on these assumptions, the total recoverable amount exceeded the carrying amount including goodwill by 7,762m 2017: 5,262m.
A one percentage point change in the discount rate or terminal growth rate would increase or decrease the recoverable amount by 1,501m 2017: 1,128m and 980m 2017: 734m respectively.
A reduction in the forecasted cash flows of 10% per annum would reduce the recoverable amount by 1,828m 2017: 1,409m.
23 Operating leases Accounting for operating leases The Barclays Group applies IAS 17 Leases, for operating leases.
An operating lease is a lease where substantially all of the risks and rewards of the leased assets remain with the lessor.
Where the Barclays Group is the lessor, lease income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease unless another systematic basis is more appropriate.
The Barclays Group holds the leased assets on-balance sheet within property, plant and equipment.
Where the Barclays Group is the lessee, rentals payable are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless another systematic basis is more appropriate.
Operating lease commitments The Barclays Group leases various offices, branches and other premises under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements.
With such operating lease arrangements, the asset is kept on the lessors balance sheet and the Barclays Group reports the future minimum lease payments as an expense over the lease term.
The leases have various terms, escalation and renewal rights.
There are no contingent rents payable.
Operating lease rentals of 329m 2017: 342m have been included in administration and general expenses.
The future minimum lease payments by the Barclays Group under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: 2018 2017 Property Equipment Property Equipment m m m m Not more than one year 302 332 2 Over one year but not more than five years 786 844 21 Over five years 1,257 1,337 Total 2,345 2,513 23 Total future minimum sublease payments to be received under non-cancellable subleases was 28m 2017: 53m.

barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information Notes to the financial statements Accruals, provisions, contingent liabilities and legal proceedings The notes included in this section focus on the Barclays Groups accruals, provisions and contingent liabilities.
Provisions are recognised for present obligations arising as consequences of past events where it is probable that a transfer of economic benefit will be necessary to settle the obligation, and it can be reliably estimated.
Contingent liabilities reflect potential liabilities that are not recognised on the balance sheet.
24 Other liabilities 2018 2017 m m Accruals and deferred income 3,877 3,951 Other creditors 3,522 4,563 Items in the course of collection due to other banks 277 446 Obligations under finance leases refer to Note 20 22 20 Insurance contract liabilities, including unit-linked liabilities 18 31 Other liabilities 7,716 9,011 25 Provisions Accounting for provisions The Barclays Group applies IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets in accounting for non-financial liabilities.
Provisions are recognised for present obligations arising as consequences of past events where it is more likely than not that a transfer of economic benefit will be necessary to settle the obligation, which can be reliably estimated.
Provision is made for the anticipated cost of restructuring, including redundancy costs when an obligation exists: for example, when the Barclays Group has a detailed formal plan for restructuring a business and has raised valid expectations in those affected by the restructuring by announcing its main features or starting to implement the plan.
Provision is made for undrawn loan commitments if it is probable that the facility will be drawn and result in the recognition of an asset at an amount less than the amount advanced.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The financial reporting of provisions involves a significant degree of judgement and is complex.
Identifying whether a present obligation exists and estimating the probability, timing, nature and quantum of the outflows that may arise from past events requires judgements to be made based on the specific facts and circumstances relating to individual events and often requires specialist professional advice.
When matters are at an early stage, accounting judgements and estimates can be difficult because of the high degree of uncertainty involved.
Management continues to monitor matters as they develop to re-evaluate on an ongoing basis whether provisions should be recognised, however there can remain a wide range of possible outcomes and uncertainties, particularly in relation to legal, competition and regulatory matters, and as a result it is often not practicable to make meaningful estimates even when matters are at a more advanced stage.
The complexity of such matters often requires the input of specialist professional advice in making assessments to produce estimates.
Customer redress and legal, competition and regulatory matters are areas where a higher degree of professional judgement is required.
The amount that is recognised as a provision can also be very sensitive to the assumptions made in calculating it.
This gives rise to a large range of potential outcomes which require judgement in determining an appropriate provision level.
See below for information on payment protection redress and Note 27 for more detail of legal, competition and regulatory matters.

Onerous contracts Onerous contract provisions comprise an estimate of the costs involved with fulfilling the terms and conditions of contracts net of any expected benefits to be received.
Redundancy and restructuring These provisions comprise the estimated cost of restructuring, including redundancy costs where an obligation exists.
Additions made during the year relate to formal restructuring plans and have either been utilised, or reversed, where total costs are now expected to be lower than the original provision amount.
barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2018 313 Notes to the financial statements Accruals, provisions, contingent liabilities and legal proceedings 25 Provisions continued Undrawn contractually committed facilities and guarantees Impairment allowance under IFRS 9 considers both the drawn and the undrawn counterparty exposure.
For retail portfolios, the total impairment allowance is allocated to the drawn exposure to the extent that the allowance does not exceed the exposure as ECL is not reported separately.
Any excess is reported on the liability side of the balance sheet as a provision.
For wholesale portfolios, the impairment allowance on the undrawn exposure is reported on the liability side of the balance sheet as a provision.
Provisions are made if it is probable that a facility will be drawn and the resulting asset is expected to have a realisable value that is less than the amount advanced.
Customer redress Customer redress provisions comprise the estimated cost of making redress payments to customers, clients and counterparties for losses or damages associated with inappropriate judgement in the execution of Barclays Groups business activities.
Provisions for other customer redress include smaller provisions across the retail and corporate businesses which are likely to be utilised in the next 12 months.
Legal, competition and regulatory matters The Barclays Group is engaged in various legal proceedings, both in the UK and a number of other overseas jurisdictions, including the US.
For further information in relation to legal proceedings and discussion of the associated uncertainties, refer to Note 27.
Sundry provisions This category includes provisions that do not fit into any of the other categories, such as fraud losses and dilapidation provisions.
Payment Protection Insurance Redress As at 31 December 2018, Barclays Group had recognised cumulative provisions totalling 9.6bn 2017: 9.2bn, of which 0.4bn was recognised in Q1 2018, against the cost of Payment Protection Insurance PPI redress and associated processing costs.
Utilisation of the cumulative provisions to date is 8.7bn 2017: 7.6bn, leaving a residual provision of 0.9bn 2017: 1.6bn.
a Through to 31 December 2018, 2.4m 2017: 2.1m customer initiated claims had been received and processed.
The current provision reflects the estimated costs of PPI redress primarily relating to customer initiated complaints and ongoing remediation programmes, based on information at year end.
This also includes liabilities managed by third parties arising from portfolios previously sold where Barclays Group remains liable.
As at 31 December 2018, the provision of 0.9bn represents Barclays Groups best estimate of expected PPI redress reflecting the complaints deadline implemented by the FCA of 29 August 2019.
However, it is possible the eventual outcome may differ from the current estimate.
Barclays Group will continue to review the adequacy of provision level in respect of the future impacts.
The PPI provision is calculated using a number of key assumptions which continue to involve significant modelling and management judgement: Customer initiated claim volumes claims received but not yet processed plus an estimate of future claims initiated by customers, where the volume is anticipated to cease after the PPI deadline.
Average claim redress the expected average payment to customers for upheld claims based on the type and age of the policy policies.
Processing cost per claim the cost to Barclays Group of assessing and processing each valid claim.
These assumptions remain subjective, mainly due to the uncertainty associated with future claims levels, which include complaints driven by claims management company CMC activity and the FCA advertising campaign.
The following table outlines key forecast assumptions used in the provision calculation as at 31 December 2018 and a sensitivity analysis illustrating the impact on the provision if the future expected assumptions prove too high or too low.
Sensitivity analysis Cumulative increase actual to Future decrease in Assumption 31.12.18 expected provision a Customer initiated claims received and processed thousands 2,400 290 50k 117m b Average uphold rate per claim % 89 91 1% 6m c Average redress per valid claim 2,136 2,233 100 26m Notes a Total mis-selling claims received directly by Barclays Group, including those received via CMCs but excluding those for which no PPI policy exists and excluding responses to proactive mailing.

b Average uphold rate per customer initiated mis-selling claim received directly by Barclays Group and proactive mailings, excluding those for which no PPI policy exists.
The sensitivity analysis has been calculated to show the impact a 1% change in the average uphold rate per claim would have on the provision level.
c Average redress stated on a per policy basis for future customer initiated mis-selling complaints received directly by Barclays Group.
The sensitivity analysis has been calculated to show the impact a 100 increase or decrease in the average redress per claim would have on the provision level.

barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 26 Contingent liabilities and commitments Accounting for contingent liabilities Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only by uncertain future events, and present obligations where the transfer of economic resources is uncertain or cannot be reliably measured.
Contingent liabilities are not recognised on the balance sheet but are disclosed unless the likelihood of an outflow of economic resources is remote.
The following table summarises the nominal principal amount of contingent liabilities and commitments which are not recorded on-balance sheet: 2018 2017 m m Guarantees and letters of credit pledged as collateral security 15,805 14,275 Performance guarantees, acceptances and endorsements 4,498 4,737 Total contingent liabilities 20,303 19,012 Of which: Financial guarantees carried at fair value 4 Documentary credits and other short-term trade related transactions 1,741 812 a Standby facilities, credit lines and other commitments 322,482 314,761 Total commitments 324,223 315,573 Of which: Loan commitments carried at fair value 11,723 Provisions held against contingent liabilities and commitments equal 271m.

Further details on contingent liabilities relating to legal and competition and regulatory matters can be found in Note 27.
27 Legal, competition and regulatory matters Members of the Barclays Group face legal, competition and regulatory challenges, many of which are beyond our control.
The extent of the impact on Barclays of these matters cannot always be predicted but may materially impact our operations, financial results, condition and prospects.
Matters arising from a set of similar circumstances can give rise to either a contingent liability or a provision, or both, depending on the relevant facts and circumstances.
The recognition of provisions in relation to such matters involves critical accounting estimates and judgements in accordance with the relevant accounting policies as described in Note 25, Provisions.
We have not disclosed an estimate of the potential financial effect on Barclays of contingent liabilities where it is not currently practicable to do so.
In connection with the implementation of structural reform in the UK, on 1 April 2018, the UK banking business was transferred from Barclays Bank PLC to Barclays Bank UK PLC, a separate subsidiary of Barclays PLC.
Although the matters described below are relevant to Barclays PLC either on an individual or on a consolidated basis, certain matters may relate to either or both of Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Bank UK PLC.
Matters are ordered under headings corresponding to the financial statements in which they are disclosed.
Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC Investigations into certain advisory services agreements and other matters and civil action The UK Serious Fraud Office SFO, the Financial Conduct Authority FCA, the US Department of Justice DoJ and the US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC have been conducting investigations into two advisory services agreements entered into by Barclays Bank PLC.
These agreements were entered into with Qatar Holding LLC Qatar Holding in June and October 2008 the Agreements.
The FCA commenced an investigation into whether the Agreements may have related to Barclays PLCs capital raisings in June and November 2008 the Capital Raisings.
The existence of the June 2008 advisory services agreement was disclosed, but the entry into the advisory services agreement in October 2008 and the fees payable under the Agreements, which amounted to a total of 322m payable over a period of five years, were not disclosed in the announcements or public documents relating to the Capital Raisings.
The SFO also commenced an investigation into the Agreements and into a $3bn loan the Loan provided by Barclays Bank PLC in November 2008 to the State of Qatar.
SFO Proceedings In 2017, the SFO charged Barclays PLC with two offences of conspiring with certain former senior officers and employees of Barclays to commit fraud by false representations relating to the Agreements and one offence of unlawful financial assistance in relation to the Loan.
In February 2018, the SFO also charged Barclays Bank PLC with the same offence in respect of the Loan.
In May 2018, the Crown Court dismissed all charges against Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC, and in October 2018, the High Court denied the SFOs application to reinstate the charges, which were consequently dismissed.
barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2018 315 Notes to the financial statements Accruals, provisions, contingent liabilities and legal proceedings 27 Legal, competition and regulatory matters continued FCA Proceedings and other investigations In 2013, the FCA issued warning notices the Notices finding that, while Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC believed at the time of the execution of the Agreements that there should be at least some unspecified and undetermined value to be derived from them, the primary purpose of the Agreements was not to obtain advisory services but to make additional payments, which would not be disclosed, for the Qatari participation in the Capital Raisings.
The Notices concluded that Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC were in breach of certain disclosure-related listing rules and Barclays PLC was also in breach of Listing Principle 3 the requirement to act with integrity towards holders and potential holders of the Companys shares.
In this regard, the FCA considers that Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC acted recklessly.
The financial penalty provided in the Notices against Barclays is 50m.
Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC continue to contest the findings.
The FCA action has been stayed due to the SFO proceedings pending against certain former Barclays executives, trial in respect of which commenced in January 2019.
In addition, the DoJ and the SEC have been conducting investigations relating to the Agreements.
Civil Action In 2016, PCP Capital Partners LLP and PCP International Finance Limited PCP served a claim on Barclays Bank PLC seeking damages for fraudulent misrepresentation and deceit, arising from alleged statements made by Barclays Bank PLC to PCP in relation to the terms on which securities were to be issued to potential investors, allegedly including PCP, in the November 2008 capital raising.
PCP seeks damages of up to 1,477m plus interest from November 2017 and costs.
Barclays Bank PLC is defending the claim and trial is scheduled to commence in October 2019.
Claimed amounts Financial impact It is not currently practicable to provide an estimate of the financial impact of the actions described on Barclays or what effect they might have upon Barclays operating results, cash flows or financial position in any particular period.
The financial penalty provided in the FCAs Notices against Barclays is 50m.
PCP has made a claim against Barclays Bank PLC for damages of up to 1,477m plus interest and costs.
These amounts do not necessarily reflect Barclays potential financial exposure in respect of these matters.
Investigations into certain business relationships In 2012, the DoJ and SEC commenced investigations in relation to whether certain relationships with third parties who assist Barclays PLC to win or retain business are compliant with the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
Various regulators in other jurisdictions are also being briefed on the investigations.
Separately, Barclays is cooperating with the DoJ and SEC in relation to an investigation into certain of its hiring practices in Asia and elsewhere and is keeping certain regulators in other jurisdictions informed.
Investigations relating to whistleblowing systems and controls In 2017, the FCA and the Prudential Regulation Authority PRA commenced investigations into the Barclays Group Chief Executive Officer CEO, relating to his attempt in 2016 to identify the author of a letter that was treated by Barclays Bank PLC as a whistleblow, and into Barclays Bank PLC, as to its responsibilities relating to the attempt by the CEO to identify the author of the letter, as well as Barclays systems and controls and culture relating to whistleblowing.
In May 2018, the FCA and PRA published final notices confirming their finding that the CEOs actions in relation to this matter represented a breach of Individual Conduct Rule 2 requirement to act with due skill, care and diligence.
There were no findings by the FCA or PRA that the CEO acted with a lack of integrity nor any findings that he lacked fitness and propriety to continue to perform his role as Group Chief Executive Officer.
In respect of its investigation relating to Barclays Bank PLC, the FCA and PRA concluded that they would not take enforcement action in respect of this matter.
However, each of Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Bank UK PLC agreed to be subject to requirements to report to the FCA and PRA on certain aspects of their whistleblowing programmes.
The New York Department of Financial Services NYDFS and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York also conducted their own investigations in respect of this matter.
In December 2018, the NYDFS issued a consent order that imposed a $15m civil penalty on Barclays Bank PLC, which has been paid, for failings in its whistleblowing programme as well as certain remediation and reporting obligations related to its whistleblowing programme.
All regulatory investigations relating to these events are now concluded.
Claimed amounts Financial impact Aside from the settlement discussed above, there is no financial impact on Barclays operating results, cash flows or financial position.
Investigations into LIBOR and other benchmarks Regulators and law enforcement agencies, including certain competition authorities, from a number of governments have been conducting investigations relating to Barclays Bank PLCs involvement in manipulating certain financial benchmarks, such as LIBOR and EURIBOR.
In 2012, Barclays Bank PLC announced that it had reached settlements with the Financial Services Authority FSA as predecessor to the FCA, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC and the DoJ in relation to their investigations concerning certain benchmark interest rate submissions, and Barclays Bank PLC paid total penalties of 290m.
The settlement with the DoJ was made by entry into a Non-Prosecution Agreement NPA which has now expired.
Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Capital Inc. BCI have reached settlements with certain other regulators and law enforcement agencies.
Barclays Bank PLC continues to respond to requests for information from the SFO in relation to its ongoing LIBOR investigation, including in respect of Barclays Bank PLC.
Claimed amounts Financial impact Aside from the settlements discussed above, it is not currently practicable to provide an estimate of any further financial impact of the actions described on Barclays or what effect they might have upon Barclays operating results, cash flows or financial position in any particular period.
LIBOR and other benchmark civil actions Following settlement of the investigations referred to above in Investigations into LIBOR and other benchmarks, various individuals and corporates in a range of jurisdictions have threatened or brought civil actions against Barclays and other banks in relation to LIBOR and or other benchmarks.
While certain cases have been dismissed, settled or settled subject to final approval from the relevant court and in the case of class actions, the right of class members to opt out of the settlement and to seek to file their own claims, other actions remain pending and their ultimate impact is unclear.

Interest All undated subordinated liabilities bear a fixed rate of interest until the initial call date, with the exception of the 9% Bonds which are fixed for the life of the issue, and the Junior and Series 3 Undated Notes which are floating rate at rates fixed periodically in advance based on the related interbank rate.
After the initial call date, in the event that they are not redeemed, the 7.125%, 6.125% Undated Notes and the 9.25% Bonds will bear interest at rates fixed periodically in advance for five-year periods based on market rates.
All other undated subordinated liabilities will bear interest at rates fixed periodically in advance based on London interbank rates.
Payment of interest Barclays Bank PLC is not obliged to make a payment of interest on its Undated Notes, Bonds and Loans excluding the 9.25% Bonds if, in the preceding six months, a dividend has not been declared or paid on any class of shares of Barclays PLC or, in certain cases, any class of preference shares of Barclays Bank PLC.
Barclays Bank PLC is not obliged to make a payment of interest on its 9.25% Perpetual Subordinated Bonds if, in the immediately preceding 12 month interest period, a dividend has not been paid on any class of its share capital.
Interest not so paid becomes payable in each case if such a dividend is subsequently paid or in certain other circumstances.
During the year, Barclays Bank PLC declared and paid dividends on its ordinary shares and on all classes of preference shares.
No payment of principal or any interest may be made unless Barclays Bank PLC satisfies a specified solvency test.
Barclays Bank PLC may elect to defer any payment of interest on the RCIs.
Any such deferred payment of interest must be paid on the earlier of: i the date of redemption of the RCIs, ii the coupon payment date falling on or nearest to the tenth anniversary of the date of deferral of such payment, and iii in respect of the 14% RCIs only, substitution.
While such deferral is continuing, neither Barclays Bank PLC nor Barclays PLC may declare or pay a dividend, subject to certain exceptions, on any of its ordinary shares or preference shares.
Barclays Bank PLC may elect to defer any payment of interest on the TONs if it determines that it is, or such payment would result in it being, in non-compliance with capital adequacy requirements and policies of the PRA.
Any such deferred payment of interest will only be payable on a redemption of the TONs.
Until such time as Barclays Bank PLC next makes a payment of interest on the TONs, neither Barclays Bank PLC nor Barclays PLC may i declare or pay a dividend, subject to certain exceptions, on any of their respective ordinary shares or preference shares, or make payments of interest in respect of Barclays Bank PLCs Reserve Capital Instruments and ii certain restrictions on the redemption, purchase or reduction of their respective share capital and certain other securities also apply.
Repayment All undated subordinated liabilities are repayable at the option of Barclays Bank PLC, generally in whole, at the initial call date and on any subsequent coupon or interest payment date or in the case of the 7.125%, 6.125% Undated Notes and the 9.25% Bonds on any fifth anniversary after the initial call date.
In addition, each issue of undated subordinated liabilities is repayable, at the option of Barclays Bank PLC in whole for certain tax reasons, either at any time, or on an interest payment date.
There are no events of default except non-payment of principal or mandatory interest.
Any repayments require the prior approval of the PRA.
Other All issues of undated subordinated liabilities are non-convertible.

The principal terms of the dated subordinated liabilities are described below: Subordination Dated subordinated liabilities issued by Barclays PLC ranks behind the claims against Barclays PLC of unsecured unsubordinated creditors but before the claims of the holders of its equity.
All dated subordinated liabilities externally issued by Barclays Bank PLC rank behind the claims against the bank of depositors and other unsecured unsubordinated creditors but before the claims of the undated subordinated liabilities and the holders of its equity.
The dated subordinated liabilities externally issued by other subsidiaries are similarly subordinated as the external subordinated liabilities issued by Barclays Bank PLC.
Interest Interest on the Floating Rate Notes is fixed periodically in advance, based on the related interbank or local central bank rates.
Interest on the 2.625% Fixed Rate Subordinated Callable Notes, 4.836% Fixed Rate Subordinated Callable Notes, 2% Fixed Rate Subordinated Callable Notes and the 3.75% Fixed Rate Resetting Subordinated Callable Notes are fixed until the call date.
After the respective call dates, in the event that they are not redeemed, the interest rates will be reset and fixed until maturity based on a market rate.
Repayment Those subordinated liabilities with a call date are repayable at the option of the issuer, on conditions governing the respective debt obligations, some in whole or in part, and some only in whole.
The remaining dated subordinated liabilities outstanding at 31 December 2018 are redeemable only on maturity, subject in particular cases to provisions allowing an early redemption in the event of certain changes in tax law, or to certain changes in legislation or regulations.
Any repayments prior to maturity require, in the case of Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC, the prior approval of the PRA, or in the case of the overseas issues, the approval of the local regulator for that jurisdiction and of the PRA in certain circumstances.
There are no committed facilities in existence at the balance sheet date which permit the refinancing of debt beyond the date of maturity.

barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information Notes to the financial statements Employee benefits The notes included in this section focus on the costs and commitments associated with employing our staff.
32 Share-based payments Accounting for share-based payments The Barclays Group applies IFRS 2 Share-based Payments in accounting for employee remuneration in the form of shares.
Employee incentives include awards in the form of shares and share options, as well as offering employees the opportunity to purchase shares on favourable terms.
The cost of the employee services received in respect of the shares or share options granted is recognised in the income statement over the period that employees provide services.
The overall cost of the award is calculated using the number of shares and options expected to vest and the fair value of the shares or options at the date of grant.
The number of shares and options expected to vest takes into account the likelihood that performance and service conditions included in the terms of the awards will be met.
Failure to meet the non-vesting condition is treated as a cancellation, resulting in an acceleration of recognition of the cost of the employee services.
The fair value of shares is the market price ruling on the grant date, in some cases adjusted to reflect restrictions on transferability.
The fair value of options granted is determined using option pricing models to estimate the numbers of shares likely to vest.
These take into account the exercise price of the option, the current share price, the risk-free interest rate, the expected volatility of the share price over the life of the option and other relevant factors.
Market conditions that must be met in order for the award to vest are also reflected in the fair value of the award, as are any other non-vesting conditions such as continuing to make payments into a share-based savings scheme.
The charge for the year arising from share-based payment schemes was as follows: Charge for the year 2018 2017 2016 m m m Share Value Plan 45 153 473 Deferred Share Value Plan 217 166 Others 187 186 192 Total equity settled 449 505 665 Cash settled 1 3 1 Total share-based payments 450 508 666 The terms of the main current plans are as follows: Share Value Plan SVP The SVP was introduced in March 2010 and approved by shareholders for executive Director participation and use of new issue shares at the AGM in April 2011.
SVP awards are granted to participants in the form of a conditional right to receive Barclays PLC shares or provisional allocations of Barclays PLC shares which vest or are considered for release over a period of three, five or seven years.
Participants do not pay to receive an award or to receive a release of shares.
The grantor may also make a dividend equivalent payment to participants on release of a SVP award.
SVP awards are also made to eligible employees for recruitment purposes.
All awards are subject to potential forfeiture in certain leaver scenarios.
Deferred Share Value Plan DSVP The DSVP was introduced in February 2017.
The terms of the DSVP are materially the same as the terms of the SVP as described above, save that executive Directors are not eligible to participate in the DSVP and the DSVP operates over market purchase shares only.
Other schemes In addition to the SVP and DSVP, the Barclays Group operates a number of other schemes settled in Barclays PLC Shares including Sharesave both UK and Ireland, Sharepurchase both UK and overseas, and the Barclays Group Long Term Incentive Plan.
A delivery of upfront shares to Material Risk Takers can be made as Share Incentive Award.

The weighted average exercise price relates to Sharesave.
Certain of the Barclays Groups share option plans enable certain Directors and employees to subscribe for new ordinary shares of Barclays PLC.
For the accounting of treasury shares refer to Note 32.
There were no significant modifications to the share-based payments arrangements in 2018 and 2017.
As at 31 December 2018, the total liability arising from cash-settled share-based payments transactions was 2m 2017: 2m.
Holdings of Barclays PLC shares Various employee benefit trusts established by the Barclays Group hold shares in Barclays PLC to meet obligations under the Barclays share-based payment schemes.
The total number of Barclays PLC shares held in these employee benefit trusts at 31 December 2018 was 11.4 million 2017: 9.9 million.
Dividend rights have been waived on all these shares.
The total market value of the shares held in trust based on the year end share price of 1.51 2017: 2.03 was 17.2m 2017: 20.1m.
330 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2018 home.
barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 33 Pensions and post-retirement benefits Accounting for pensions and post-retirement benefits The Barclays Group operates a number of pension schemes and post-employment benefit schemes.
Defined contribution schemes the Barclays Group recognises contributions due in respect of the accounting period in the income statement.
Any contributions unpaid at the balance sheet date are included as a liability.
Defined benefit schemes the Barclays Group recognises its obligations to members of each scheme at the period end, less the fair value of the scheme assets after applying the asset ceiling test.
Each schemes obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit method.
Scheme assets are stated at fair value as at the period end.
Changes in pension scheme liabilities or assets remeasurements that do not arise from regular pension cost, net interest on net defined benefit liabilities or assets, past service costs, settlements or contributions to the scheme, are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Remeasurements comprise experience adjustments differences between previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred, the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions, return on scheme assets excluding amounts included in the interest on the assets and any changes in the effect of the asset ceiling restriction excluding amounts included in the interest on the restriction.
Post-employment benefit schemes the cost of providing healthcare benefits to retired employees is accrued as a liability in the financial statements over the period that the employees provide services to the Barclays Group, using a methodology similar to that for defined benefit pension schemes.
Pension schemes UK Retirement Fund UKRF The UKRF is the Barclays Groups main scheme, representing 97% of the Barclays Groups total retirement benefit obligations.
Barclays Bank PLC is the principal employer of the UKRF.
The UKRF was closed to new entrants on 1 October 2012, and comprises 10 sections, the two most significant of which are: Afterwork, which comprises a contributory cash balance defined benefit element, and a voluntary defined contribution element.
The cash balance element is accrued each year and revalued until Normal Retirement Age in line with the increase in Retail Price Index RPI up to a maximum of 5% p. a.. An increase of up to 2% a year may also be added at Barclays discretion.
Between 1 October 2003 and 1 October 2012 the majority of new UK employees except for the employees of the investment banking business within Barclays International were eligible to join this section.
The costs of ill-health retirements and death in service benefits for Afterwork members are borne by the UKRF.
The main risks that Barclays runs in relation to Afterwork are limited although additional contributions are required if pre-retirement investment returns are not sufficient to provide for the benefits.
Most employees recruited before July 1997 built up benefits in this non-contributory defined benefit scheme in respect of service up to 31 March 2010.
Pensions were calculated by reference to service and pensionable salary.
From 1 April 2010, members became eligible to accrue future service benefits in either Afterwork or the Pension Investment Plan PIP, a historic defined contribution section which is now closed to future contributions.
The risks that Barclays runs in relation to the 1964 section are typical of final salary pension schemes, principally that investment returns fall short of expectations, that inflation exceeds expectations, and that retirees live longer than expected.
Barclays Pension Savings Plan BPSP From 1 October 2012, a new UK pension scheme, the BPSP, was established to satisfy Auto Enrolment legislation.
The BPSP is a defined contribution scheme Group Personal Pension providing benefits for all new UK hires from 1 October 2012, employees of the investment banking business within Barclays International who were in PIP as at 1 October 2012, and also all UK employees who were not members of a pension scheme at that date.
As a defined contribution scheme, BPSP is not subject to the same investment return, inflation or life expectancy risks for Barclays that defined benefit schemes are.
Members benefits reflect contributions paid and the level of investment returns achieved.
Other Apart from the UKRF and the BPSP, Barclays operates a number of smaller pension and long-term employee benefits and post-retirement healthcare plans globally, the largest of which are the US defined benefit schemes.
Many of the schemes are funded, with assets backing the obligations held in separate legal vehicles such as trusts.
Others are operated on an unfunded basis.
The benefits provided, the approach to funding, and the legal basis of the schemes, reflect local environments.
Governance The UKRF operates under trust law and is managed and administered on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed and Rules and all relevant legislation.
The Corporate Trustee is Barclays Pension Funds Trustees Limited, a private limited company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Barclays Bank PLC.
The Trustee is the legal owner of the assets of the UKRF which are held separately from the assets of the Barclays Group.
The Trustee Board comprises six Management Directors selected by Barclays, of whom three are independent Directors with no relationship with Barclays and who are not members of the UKRF, plus three Member Nominated Directors selected from eligible active staff and pensioner members who apply for the role.
The BPSP is a Group Personal Pension arrangement which operates as a collection of personal pension plans.
Each personal pension plan is a direct contract between the employee and the BPSP provider Legal & General Assurance Society Limited, and is regulated by the FCA.
Similar principles of pension governance apply to the Barclays Groups other pension schemes, depending on local legislation.

As at 31 December 2018, the UKRFs scheme assets were in surplus versus IAS 19 obligations by 1,735m 2017: 952m.
The movement for the UKRF was driven by an increase in the discount rate and payment of deficit contributions, offset by lower than assumed asset returns and revised early retirement and cash commutation factors.
The Group has considered all of the implications of the High Court ruling in the Lloyds Banking Group Pension Trustees case on the requirement to equalise pensions in respect of Guaranteed Minimum Pensions GMP.
This resulted in a 140m increase in pension obligation which has been recognised as a Past service cost.
Any future clarifications to GMP equalisation leading to a change in financial assumptions are expected to be recognised in equity.
Of the 2,167m 2017: 4,927m UKRF benefits paid out, 1,420m 2017: 4,151m related to transfers out of the fund.
Where a schemes assets exceed its obligation, an asset is recognised to the extent that it does not exceed the present value of future contribution holidays or refunds of contributions the asset ceiling.
In the case of the UKRF the asset ceiling is not applied as, in certain specified circumstances such as wind-up, the Barclays Group expects to be able to recover any surplus.
The Trustee does not have a substantive right to augment benefits, nor do they have the right to wind up the plan except in the dissolution of the Barclays Group or termination of contributions by the Barclays Group.
The application of the asset ceiling to other plans is considered on an individual plan basis.

barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 33 Pensions and post-retirement benefits continued Critical accounting estimates and judgements Actuarial valuation of the schemes obligation is dependent upon a series of assumptions.
Below is a summary of the main financial and demographic assumptions adopted for the UKRF.
2018 2017 Key UKRF financial assumptions % p. a.
Discount rate 2.71 2.46 Inflation rate RPI 3.25 3.22 The UKRF discount rate assumption for 2018 was based on a variant of the standard Willis Towers Watson RATE Link model.
This variant includes all bonds rated AA by at least one of the four major ratings agencies, and assumes that yields after year 30 are flat.
The RPI inflation assumption for 2018 was set by reference to the Bank of Englands implied inflation spot curve, assuming the spot curve remains flat after 30 years.
The inflation assumption incorporates a deduction of 20 basis points as an allowance for an inflation risk premium.
The methodology used to derive the discount rate and price inflation assumptions is consistent with that used at the prior year end.
The UKRFs post-retirement mortality assumptions are based on a best estimate assumption derived from an analysis in 2016 of the Barclays Group own post-retirement mortality experience, and taking account of recent evidence from published mortality surveys.
An allowance has been made for future mortality improvements based on the 2017 core projection model published by the Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau subject to a long-term trend of 1.25% per annum in future improvements.
The methodology used is consistent with the prior year end, except that the 2016 core projection model was used at 2017.
The table below shows how the assumed life expectancy at 60, for members of the UKRF, has varied over the past three years: Assumed life expectancy 2018 2017 2016 Life expectancy at 60 for current pensioners years Males 27.7 27.8 27.9 Females 29.4 29.4 29.7 Life expectancy at 60 for future pensioners currently aged 40 years Males 29.2 29.3 29.7 Females 31.0 31.0 31.7 The assumption for future transfers out has been adjusted to reflect volumes experienced in 2018 which were lower than previously assumed.
The revised assumption is that 7.5% of the benefit obligation in respect of deferred members will transfer out during 2019, 5% in 2020, 2.5% in 2021, tapering down to 0% from 2022 onwards 2017:15% of the benefit obligation in respect of deferred members will transfer out during 2019, 10% in 2020, 5% in 2021, tapering down to 0% from 2022 onwards.
Sensitivity analysis on actuarial assumptions The sensitivity analysis has been calculated by valuing the UKRF liabilities using the amended assumptions shown in the table below and keeping the remaining assumptions the same as disclosed in the table above, except in the case of the inflation sensitivity where other assumptions that depend on assumed inflation have also been amended correspondingly.
The difference between the recalculated liability figure and that stated in the balance sheet reconciliation table above is the figure shown.
The selection of these movements to illustrate the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to key assumptions should not be interpreted as Barclays expressing any specific view of the probability of such movements happening.

barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2018 333 Notes to the financial statements Employee benefits 33 Pensions and post-retirement benefits continued The weighted average duration of the benefit payments reflected in the defined benefit obligation for the UKRF is 17 years.
Assets A long-term investment strategy has been set for the UKRF, with its asset allocation comprising a mixture of equities, bonds, property and other appropriate assets.
This recognises that different asset classes are likely to produce different long-term returns and some asset classes may be more volatile than others.
The long-term investment strategy ensures, among other aims, that investments are adequately diversified.
Asset managers are permitted some flexibility to vary the asset allocation from the long-term investment strategy within control ranges agreed with the Trustee from time to time.
The UKRF also employs derivative instruments, where appropriate, to achieve a desired exposure or return, or to match assets more closely to liabilities.
The value of assets shown reflects the assets held by the scheme, with any derivative holdings reflected on a fair value basis.
The value of the assets of the schemes and their percentage in relation to total scheme assets were as follows: Analysis of scheme assets Total Of which relates to UKRF % of total % of total fair value of fair value of scheme scheme Value assets Value assets m % m % As at 31 December 2018 Equities quoted 2,916 9.8 2,787 9.6 Equities non-quoted 1,995 6.7 1,995 6.9 a Bonds fixed government 4,099 13.8 3,840 13.2 a Bonds index-linked government 11,960 40.2 11,951 41.1 a Bonds corporate and other 5,653 19.0 5,479 18.9 b Property commercial 1,712 5.8 1,702 5.9 b Derivatives 266 0.9 266 0.9 c Other 1,121 3.8 1,016 3.5 Fair value of scheme assets 29,722 100.0 29,036 100.0 As at 31 December 2017 Equities quoted 4,377 14.1 4,151 13.8 Equities non-quoted 2,001 6.5 2,001 6.6 a Bonds fixed government 2,433 7.9 2,184 7.3 a Bonds index-linked government 13,089 42.3 13,078 43.4 a Bonds corporate and other 5,195 16.8 4,999 16.6 b Property commercial 1,911 6.2 1,902 6.3 b Derivatives 816 2.6 816 2.7 c Other 1,100 3.6 981 3.3 Fair value of scheme assets 30,922 100.0 30,112 100.0 Notes a Assets held are predominantly quoted.

Included within the fair value of scheme assets were: nil 2017: 0.1m relating to shares in Barclays PLC and nil 2017: 0.6m relating to bonds issued by Barclays PLC.
The UKRF also invests in pooled investment vehicles which may hold shares or debt issued by Barclays PLC.
The UKRF scheme assets also include 1m 2017: 15m relating to UK private equity investments and 1,994m 2017: 1,986m relating to overseas private equity investments.
These are disclosed above within Equities non-quoted.
Approximately 46% of the UKRF assets are invested in liability-driven investment strategies: primarily UK gilts as well as interest rate and inflation swaps.
These are used to better match the assets to its liabilities.
The swaps are used to reduce the schemes inflation and duration risks against its liabilities.
Funding The Scheme Actuary prepares an annual update of the UKRF funding position in addition to the full triennial actuarial valuation.
The latest annual update was carried out as at 30 September 2018 and showed a deficit of 4.04bn and a funding level of 88.4%.
The last triennial actuarial valuation of the UKRF had an effective date of 30 September 2016 and was completed in July 2017.
This valuation showed a funding deficit of 7.87bn and a funding level of 81.5%.
The improvement in funding position between 30 September 2016 and 30 September 2018 was largely due to payment of deficit contributions, higher than assumed asset returns, higher Government bond yields, and transfers out of the scheme.
334 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2018 home.
barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 33 Pensions and post-retirement benefits continued At the 2016 triennial actuarial valuation the Barclays Group and UKRF Trustee agreed a revised scheme-specific funding target, statement of funding principles, schedule of contributions, a recovery plan to seek to eliminate the deficit relative to the funding target and some additional support measures.
The agreement with the UKRF Trustee also takes into account the changes to the Barclays Group structure that were implemented as a result of ring-fencing.
The main differences between the funding and IAS 19 assumptions were a different approach to setting the discount rate and a more conservative longevity assumption for funding.
The deficit reduction contributions agreed with the UKRF Trustee as part of the 30 September 2016 valuation recovery plan are shown in the table below.
Deficit contributions 30 September 2016 valuation Year m 2017 740 2018 500 2019 500 2020 500 2021 to 2026 1,000 each year The deficit reduction contributions are in addition to the regular contributions to meet the Barclays Groups share of the cost of benefits accruing over each year.
The next funding valuation of the UKRF is due to be completed in 2020 with an effective date of 30 September 2019.
Other support measures agreed at the same time as the valuation Collateral The UKRF Trustee and Barclays Bank PLC have entered into an arrangement whereby a collateral pool has been put in place to provide security for the UKRF funding deficit as it increases or decreases over time, and associated deficit recovery contributions.
The collateral pool is currently made up of government securities.
Agreement was made with the Trustee to increase the proportion of the deficit covered from 88.5% to 100% effective from 26 March 2018 with an overall cap remaining of 9bn, at which date the collateral pool consisted of government securities only the Trustee and Barclays Bank PLC may agree alternative eligible collateral in the future.
The arrangement provides the UKRF Trustee with dedicated access to the pool of assets in the event of Barclays Bank PLC not paying a deficit reduction contribution to the UKRF or in the event of Barclays Bank PLCs insolvency.
These assets are included within Note 38.
Support from Barclays PLC In the event of Barclays Bank PLC not paying a deficit reduction contribution payment required under the 2016 valuation recovery plan by a specified pre-payment date, Barclays PLC has entered into an arrangement whereby it will be required to use, in first priority, dividends received from Barclays Bank UK PLC if any to invest the proceeds in Barclays Bank PLC up to the maximum amount of the deficit reduction contribution unpaid by Barclays Bank PLC.
The proceeds of the investment will be used to discharge Barclays Bank PLCs unpaid deficit reduction contribution.
Participation As permitted under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 Banking Reform Pensions Regulations 2015, Barclays Bank UK PLC is a participating employer in the UKRF and will remain so during a transitional phase until September 2025 as set out in a deed of participation.
Barclays Bank UK PLC will make contributions for the future service of its employees who are currently Afterwork members and, in the event of Barclays Bank PLCs insolvency during this period provision has been made to require Barclays Bank UK PLC to become the principal employer of the UKRF.
Barclays Bank PLCs Section 75 debt would be triggered by the insolvency the debt would be calculated after allowing for the payment to the UKRF of the collateral above.
Defined benefit contributions paid with respect to the UKRF were as follows: Contributions paid m 2018 741 2017 1,124 2016 634 There were nil 2017: 153m: 2016: 112m Section 75 contributions included within the Barclays Groups contributions paid as no participating employers left the UKRF scheme in 2018.
The Barclays Groups expected contribution to the UKRF in respect of defined benefits in 2019 is 725m 2018: 716m.
In addition, the expected contributions to UK defined contribution schemes in 2019 is 34m 2018: 35m to the UKRF and 168m 2018: 146m to the BPSP.
barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2018 335 Notes to the financial statements Scope of consolidation The section presents information on the Barclays Groups investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates and its interests in structured entities.
Detail is also given on securitisation transactions the Barclays Group has entered into and arrangements that are held off-balance sheet.
34 Principal subsidiaries The Barclays Group applies IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements.
The consolidated financial statements combine the financial statements of the Barclays Group and all its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Barclays Group has control.
Under IFRS 10, this is when the Barclays Group is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement in the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
The Barclays Group reassesses whether it controls an entity if facts and circumstances indicate that there have been changes to its power, its rights to variable returns or its ability to use its power to affect the amount of its returns.
Intra-group transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation and consistent accounting policies are used throughout the Barclays Group for the purposes of the consolidation.
Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions if they occur after control has been obtained and they do not result in loss of control.
The significant judgements used in applying this policy are set out below.
Accounting for investment in subsidiaries In the individual financial statements of Barclays PLC, investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less impairment.
Principal subsidiaries for the Barclays Group are set out below.
This includes those subsidiaries that are most significant in the context of the Barclays Groups business, results or financial position.
Non-controlling Non-controlling interests interests proportion of proportion of Percentage of ownership voting Principal place of business voting rights held interests interests Company name or incorporation Nature of business % % % Barclays Bank PLC England Banking, holding Company 100 3 Barclays Bank UK PLC England Banking, holding Company 100 Barclays Bank Ireland PLC Ireland Banking, holding Company 100 Barclays Services Limited England Service Company 100 Barclays Capital Inc. United States Securities dealing 100 Barclays Capital Securities Limited England Securities dealing 100 Barclays Securities Japan Limited Japan Securities dealing 100 Barclays Bank Delaware United States Credit card issuer 100 The country of registration or incorporation is also the principal area of operation of each of the above subsidiaries.
Ownership interests are in some cases different to voting interests due to the existence of non-voting equity interests, such as preference shares.
Refer to Note 31 for more information.
Determining whether the Barclays Group has control of an entity is generally straightforward based on ownership of the majority of the voting capital.
However, in certain instances, this determination will involve judgement, particularly in the case of structured entities where voting rights are often not the determining factor in decisions over the relevant activities.
This judgement will involve assessing the purpose and design of the entity.
It will also often be necessary to consider whether the Barclays Group, or another involved party with power over the relevant activities, is acting as a principal in its own right or as an agent on behalf of others.
There is also often considerable judgement involved in the ongoing assessment of control over structured entities.
In this regard, where market conditions have deteriorated such that the other investors exposures to the structures variable returns have been substantively eliminated, the Barclays Group may conclude that the managers of the structured entity are acting as its agent and therefore will consolidate the structured entity.
An interest in equity voting rights exceeding 50% would typically indicate that the Barclays Group has control of an entity.
However, the entity set out below is excluded from consolidation because the Barclays Group does not have exposure to its variable returns.

336 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2018 home.
barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 34 Principal subsidiaries continued Significant restrictions As is typical for a Group of its size and international scope, there are restrictions on the ability of Barclays PLC to obtain distributions of capital, access the assets or repay the liabilities of members of its Group due to the statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements of its subsidiaries and due to the protective rights of non-controlling interests.
Regulatory requirements Barclays principal subsidiary companies have assets and liabilities before intercompany eliminations of 1,399bn 2017: 1,407bn and 1,330bn 2017: 1,341bn respectively.
The assets and liabilities are subject to prudential regulation and regulatory capital requirements in the countries in which they are regulated.
These require entities to maintain minimum capital levels which cannot be returned to the Parent company, Barclays PLC on a going concern basis.
In order to meet capital requirements, subsidiaries may issue certain equity-accounted and debt-accounted financial instruments and non-equity instruments such as Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments and other forms of subordinated liabilities.
Refer to Note 28 and Note 29 for particulars of these instruments.
These instruments may be subject to cancellation clauses or preference share restrictions that would limit the ability of the entity to repatriate the capital on a timely basis.
Liquidity requirements Regulated subsidiaries of the Barclays Group are required to meet applicable PRA or local regulatory requirements pertaining to liquidity.
Some of the regulated subsidiaries include Barclays Bank PLC, Barclays Bank UK PLC, Barclays Capital Inc. and Barclays Bank Delaware.
See pages 183 to196 for further details of liquidity requirements, including those of the Barclays Groups significant subsidiaries.
Statutory requirements The Barclays Groups subsidiaries are subject to statutory requirements not to make distributions of capital and unrealised profits and generally to maintain solvency.
These requirements restrict the ability of subsidiaries to make remittances of dividends to Barclays PLC, the ultimate parent, except in the event of a legal capital reduction or liquidation.
In most cases, the regulatory restrictions referred to above exceed the statutory restrictions.
Contractual requirements Asset encumbrance The Barclays Group uses its financial assets to raise finance in the form of securitisations and through the liquidity schemes of central banks, as well as to provide security to the UK Retirement Fund.
Once encumbered, the assets are not available for transfer around the Barclays Group.
The assets typically affected are disclosed in Note 38.
Assets held by consolidated structured entities None of the assets 2017: nil included in the Barclays Groups balance sheet relate to consolidated investment funds, held to pay return and principal to the holders of units in the funds.
Other restrictions The Barclays Group is required to maintain balances with central banks and other regulatory authorities, and these amounted to 4,717m 2017: 3,360m.
35 Structured entities A structured entity is an entity in which voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding control.
Structured entities are generally created to achieve a narrow and well-defined objective with restrictions around their ongoing activities.
Depending on the Barclays Groups power over the activities of the entity and its exposure to and ability to influence its own returns, it may consolidate the entity.
In other cases, it may sponsor or have exposure to such an entity but not consolidate it.
Consolidated structured entities The Barclays Group has contractual arrangements which may require it to provide financial support to the following types of consolidated structured entities: Securitisation vehicles The Barclays Group uses securitisation as a source of financing and a means of risk transfer.
Refer to Note 37 for further detail.
The Barclays Group, in previous periods, has provided liquidity facilities to certain securitisation vehicles.
At 31 December 2018, there were no outstanding loan commitments to these entities 2017: nil.
Commercial paper CP and medium-term note conduits The Barclays Group provided 11.7bn 2017: 10.2bn in undrawn contractual backstop liquidity facilities to CP conduits.
Fund management entities In previous periods, the Barclays Group had contractually guaranteed the performance of certain cash investments in a number of managed investment funds which resulted in their consolidation.
As at 31 December 2018, the notional value of the guarantees were nil 2017: nil as the European Wealth Funds associated with these guarantees were either closed or ownership has been transferred outside the Barclays Group and they are no longer consolidated.
barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2018 337 Notes to the financial statements Scope of consolidation 35 Structured entities continued Employee benefit and other trusts Barclays PLC provides capital contributions to employee benefit trusts to enable them to meet obligations to the employees of Barclays PLC in relation to the Barclays Groups share-based remuneration arrangements.
During 2018, the Barclays Group provided undrawn liquidity facilities of 2.6bn 2017: 1.8bn to certain trusts.
Unconsolidated structured entities in which the Barclays Group has an interest An interest in a structured entity is any form of contractual or non-contractual involvement which creates variability in returns arising from the performance of the entity for the Barclays Group.
Such interests include holdings of debt or equity securities, derivatives that transfer financial risks from the entity to the Barclays Group, lending, loan commitments, financial guarantees and investment management agreements.
Interest rate swaps, foreign exchange derivatives that are not complex and which expose the Barclays Group to insignificant credit risk by being senior in the payment waterfall of a securitisation and derivatives that are determined to introduce risk or variability to a structured entity are not considered to be an interest in an entity and have been excluded from the disclosures below.
The nature and extent of the Barclays Groups interests in structured entities is summarised below: Summary of interests in unconsolidated structured entities Short-term Secured traded Traded Other financing interests derivatives interests Total m m m m m As at 31 December 2018 Assets Trading portfolio assets 12,206 12,206 Financial assets at fair value through the income statement 32,359 2,598 34,957 Derivative financial instruments 5,236 5,236 Loans and advances at amortised cost 17,341 17,341 Other assets 33 33 Total assets 32,359 12,206 5,236 19,972 69,773 Liabilities Derivative financial instruments 6,438 2,586 9,024 As at 31 December 2017 Assets Trading portfolio assets 10,788 699 11,487 Financial assets at fair value through the income statement 31,520 2,721 34,241 Derivative financial instruments 4,380 4,380 Loans and advances at amortised cost 5,481 17,386 22,867 Reverse repurchase agreements and other similar secured lending 753 753 Other assets 509 509 Total assets 37,754 10,788 4,380 21,315 74,237 Liabilities Derivative financial instruments 5,193 3,356 8,549 Secured financing arrangements, short-term traded interests and traded derivatives are typically managed under market risk management policies described on page 139 which includes an indication of the change of risk measures compared to last year.
For this reason, the total assets of these entities are not considered meaningful for the purposes of understanding the related risks and so have not been presented.
Other interests include conduits and lending where the interest is driven by normal customer demand.
Secured financing The Barclays Group routinely enters into reverse repurchase contracts, stock borrowing and similar arrangements on normal commercial terms where the counterparty to the arrangement is a structured entity.
Due to the nature of these arrangements, especially the transfer of collateral and ongoing margining, the Barclays Group has minimal exposure to the performance of the structured entity counterparty.
This includes margin lending which is presented under financial assets at fair value through the income statement to align to the balance sheet presentation.
Short-term traded interests The Barclays Group buys and sells interests in structured entities as part of its trading activities, for example, retail mortgage-backed securities, collateralised debt obligations and similar interests.
Such interests are typically held individually or as part of a larger portfolio for no more than 90 days.
In such cases, the Barclays Group typically has no other involvement with the structured entity other than the securities it holds as part of trading activities and its maximum exposure to loss is restricted to the carrying value of the asset.
As at 31 December 2018, 8,436m 2017: 9,645m of the Barclays Groups 12,206m 2017: 10,788m short-term traded interests were comprised of debt securities issued by asset securitisation vehicles.
338 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2018 home.
barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 35 Structured entities continued Traded derivatives The Barclays Group enters into a variety of derivative contracts with structured entities which reference market risk variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and credit indices among other things.
The main derivative types which are considered interests in structured entities include index-based and entity specific credit default swaps, balance guaranteed swaps, total return swaps, commodities swaps, and equity swaps.
A description of the types of derivatives and the risk management practices are detailed in Note 14.
The risk of loss may be mitigated through ongoing margining requirements as well as a right to cash flows from the structured entity which are senior in the payment waterfall.
Such margining requirements are consistent with market practice for many derivative arrangements and in line with the Barclays Groups normal credit policies.
Derivative transactions require the counterparty to provide cash or other collateral under margining agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk.
The Barclays Group is mainly exposed to settlement risk on these derivatives which is mitigated through daily margining.
Except for credit default swaps where the maximum exposure to loss is the swap notional amount, it is not possible to estimate the maximum exposure to loss in respect of derivative positions as the fair value of derivatives is subject to changes in market rates of interest, exchange rates and credit indices which by their nature are uncertain.
In addition, the Barclays Groups losses would be subject to mitigating action under its traded market risk and credit risk policies that require the counterparty to provide collateral in cash or other assets in most cases.
Other interests in unconsolidated structured entities The Barclays Groups interests in structured entities not held for the purposes of short-term trading activities are set out below, summarised by the purpose of the entities and limited to significant categories, based on maximum exposure to loss.

All loans are subject to the Barclays Groups credit sanctioning process.
Collateral arrangements are specific to the circumstances of each loan with additional guarantees and collateral sought from the sponsor of the structured entity for certain arrangements.
During the period the Barclays Group incurred an impairment of 67m 2017: 11m against such facilities.
Investment funds and trusts In the course of its fund management activities, the Barclays Group establishes pooled investment funds that comprise investments of various kinds, tailored to meet certain investors requirements.
The Barclays Groups interest in funds is generally restricted to a fund management fee, the value of which is typically based on the performance of the fund.
The Barclays Group acts as trustee to a number of trusts established by or on behalf of its clients.
The purpose of the trusts, which meet the definition of structured entities, is to hold assets on behalf of beneficiaries.
The Barclays Groups interest in trusts is generally restricted to unpaid fees which, depending on the trust, may be fixed or based on the value of the trust assets.
The Barclays Group has no other risk exposure to the trusts.
Other This includes fair value loans with structured entities where the market risk is materially hedged with corresponding derivative contracts, interests in debt securities issued by securitisation vehicles and drawn and undrawn loan facilities to these entities.

36 Investments in associates and joint ventures Accounting for associates and joint ventures The Barclays Group applies IAS 28 Investments in Associates and IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements.
Associates are entities in which the Barclays Group has significant influence, but not control, over the operating and financial policies.
Generally the Barclays Group holds more than 20%, but less than 50%, of their voting shares.
Joint ventures are arrangements where the Barclays Group has joint control and rights to the net assets of the entity.
The Barclays Groups investments in associates and joint ventures are initially recorded at cost and increased or decreased each year by the Barclays Groups share of the post acquisition profit loss.
The Barclays Group ceases to recognise its share of the losses of equity accounted associates when its share of the net assets and amounts due from the entity have been written off in full, unless it has a contractual or constructive obligation to make good its share of the losses.
In some cases, investments in these entities may be held at fair value through profit or loss, for example, those held by private equity businesses.
There are no individually significant investments in joint ventures or associates held by the Barclays Group.

barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 37 Securitisations Accounting for securitisations The Barclays Group uses securitisations as a source of finance and a means of risk transfer.
Such transactions generally result in the transfer of contractual cash flows from portfolios of financial assets to holders of issued debt securities.
Securitisations may, depending on the individual arrangement, result in continued recognition of the securitised assets and the recognition of the debt securities issued in the transaction: lead to partial continued recognition of the assets to the extent of the Barclays Groups continuing involvement in those assets or to derecognition of the assets and the separate recognition, as assets or liabilities, of any rights and obligations created or retained in the transfer.
Full derecognition only occurs when the Barclays Group transfers both its contractual right to receive cash flows from the financial assets, or retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows, but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to another party without material delay or reinvestment, and also transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, including credit risk, prepayment risk and interest rate risk.
In the course of its normal banking activities, the Barclays Group makes transfers of financial assets, either where legal rights to the cash flows from the asset are passed to the counterparty or beneficially, where the Barclays Group retains the rights to the cash flows but assumes a responsibility to transfer them to the counterparty.
Depending on the nature of the transaction, this may result in derecognition of the assets in their entirety, partial derecognition or no derecognition of the assets subject to the transfer.
A summary of the main transactions, and the assets and liabilities and the financial risks arising from these transactions, is set out below: Transfers of financial assets that do not result in derecognition Securitisations The Barclays Group was party to securitisation transactions involving its credit card balances.
In these transactions, the assets, interests in the assets, or beneficial interests in the cash flows arising from the assets, are transferred to a special purpose entity, which then issues interest bearing debt securities to third party investors.
Securitisations may, depending on the individual arrangement, result in continued recognition of the securitised assets and the recognition of the debt securities issued in the transaction.
Partial continued recognition of the assets to the extent of the Barclays Groups continuing involvement in those assets can also occur or derecognition of the assets and the separate recognition, as assets or liabilities, of any rights and obligations created or retained in the transfer.
The following table shows the carrying amount of securitised assets that have not resulted in full derecognition, together with the associated liabilities, for each category of asset on the balance sheet: 2018 2017 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Carrying Carrying Carrying Carrying amount Fair value amount Fair value amount Fair value amount Fair value m m m m m m m m Loans and advances at amortised cost Credit cards, unsecured and other retail lending 4,242 4,334 4,234 4,218 3,772 3,757 3,635 3,626 Balances included within loans and advances at amortised cost represent securitisations where substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset have been retained by the Barclays Group.
The relationship between the transferred assets and the associated liabilities is that holders of notes may only look to cash flows from the securitised assets for payments of principal and interest due to them under the terms of their notes, although the contractual terms of their notes may be different to the maturity and interest of the transferred assets.
For transfers of assets in relation to repurchase agreements, refer to Note 38. home.
barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2018 341 Notes to the financial statements Scope of consolidation 37 Securitisations continued Continuing involvement in financial assets that have been derecognised In some cases, the Barclays Group may have transferred a financial asset in its entirety but may have continuing involvement in it.
This arises in asset securitisations where loans and asset backed securities were derecognised as a result of the Barclays Groups involvement with commercial mortgage backed securities.
Continuing involvement largely arises from providing financing into these structures in the form of retained notes, which do not bear first losses.
The table below shows the potential financial implications of such continuing involvement: Gain loss from continuing a Continuing involvement involvement Maximum Carrying exposure to For the Cumulative to amount Fair value loss year ended 31 December Type of transfer m m m m m 2018 Commercial mortgage backed securities 135 135 135 2 3 2017 Commercial mortgage backed securities 94 94 94 1 1 Note a Assets which represent the Barclays Groups continuing involvement in derecognised assets are recorded in Loans and advances at amortised cost.
38 Assets pledged Assets are pledged as collateral to secure liabilities under repurchase agreements, securitisations and stock lending agreements or as security deposits relating to derivatives.
Assets pledged as collateral include all assets categorised as encumbered in the disclosure on page 188 unaudited, other than those held in commercial paper conduits.
In these transactions, Barclays Group will be required to step in to provide financing itself under a liquidity facility if the vehicle cannot access the commercial paper market.
The following table summarises the nature and carrying amount of the assets pledged as security against these liabilities: 2018 2017 m m Cash collateral 55,532 56,351 Loans and advances at amortised cost 42,683 41,772 Trading portfolio assets 63,143 73,899 Financial assets at fair value through the income statement 7,450 4,798 Financial investments 15,058 Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income 10,354 Assets pledged 179,162 191,878 Barclays Group has an additional 10bn 2017: 9bn of loans and advances within its asset backed funding programmes that can readily be used to raise additional secured funding and are available to support future issuances.
Total assets pledged includes a collateral pool put in place to provide security for the UKRF funding deficit.
Refer to Note 33 for further details.
Collateral held as security for assets Under certain transactions, including reverse repurchase agreements and stock borrowing transactions, the Barclays Group is allowed to resell or re-pledge the collateral held.
The fair value at the balance sheet date of collateral accepted and re-pledged to others was as follows: 2018 2017 m m Fair value of securities accepted as collateral 598,348 608,412 Of which fair value of securities re-pledged transferred to others 528,957 547,637 Additional disclosure has been included in collateral and other credit enhancements see pages 151 to 152.

41 Discontinued operations and assets included in disposal groups classified as held for sale and associated liabilities Accounting for non-current assets held for sale and associated liabilities The Barclays Group applies IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.
Non-current assets or disposal groups are classified as held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than continuing use.
In order to be classified as held for sale, the asset must be available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary and the sale must be highly probable.
Non-current assets or disposal groups held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell.
A component of the Barclays Group that has either been disposed of or is classified as held for sale is presented as a discontinued operation if it represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of the separate major line or geographical area of operations, or if it is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to re-sale.

These presentational changes have no effect on the measurement of these items and therefore had no impact on retained earnings or profit for any period.
The effect of these presentational changes on transition are noted below: Items in the course of collection from other banks and prepayments, accrued income and other assets are reported in other assets.
Equally, items in the course of collection due to other banks and accruals, deferred income and other liabilities are reported in other liabilities Loans and advances to banks and loans and advances to customers have been disaggregated and are now reported in loans and advances at amortised cost and cash collateral and settlement balances Deposits from banks and customer accounts have been disaggregated and are now reported in deposits at amortised cost and cash collateral and settlement balances Financial assets designated at fair value are now reported within financial assets at fair value through the income statement The majority of available for sale assets which were previously reported in financial investments are now reported in financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income Held to maturity assets which were previously reported in financial investments are now reported in loans and advances at amortised cost.
barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2018 349 Notes to the financial statements Other disclosure matters 42 Transition disclosures continued IFRS 15 impact On adoption of IFRS 15, Barclays Group changed its accounting treatment in relation to certain costs incurred in obtaining contracts with credit card customers.
The costs of acquiring such contracts had previously been recognised as operating expenses when they were incurred.
The adoption of IFRS 15 has resulted in the costs being capitalised as a cost to obtain an asset and recognised within other assets on the balance sheet.
The asset will be amortised over the expected life of the customer relationship, with the corresponding expense recognised in the income statement.
The cumulative effect of the change as of 1 January 2018 was an increase to retained earnings of 67m and the recognition of an asset of 89m.
There were no other material changes to fee recognition from the adoption of IFRS 15.
IFRS 9 classification and measurement This column represents the changes to the balance sheet from classification and measurement.
The net effect is a decrease in shareholders equity of 17m, with no significant offsetting movements.
The classification changes include the transfer of certain Barclays International Prime Services and Equities business positions from an amortised cost to a fair value approach.
There are no other changes in measurement category.
IFRS 9 impairment change Additional impairment from the adoption of IFRS 9 is shown in the impairment change column.
The increase in impairment results in the recognition of a deferred tax asset.
The post-tax impact is a reduction in shareholders equity of 2.2bn.
Impairment allowance under IFRS 9 considers both the drawn and the undrawn counterparty exposure.
For retail portfolios, the total impairment allowance is allocated to the drawn exposure to the extent that the allowance does not exceed the exposure.
For wholesale portfolios the impairment allowance on the undrawn exposure is reported on the liability side of the balance sheet as a provision.
