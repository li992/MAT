Accruals are made at the time of sale but the actual amounts paid are based on claims made some time after the initial recognition of the sale.
As the amounts are estimated, they may not fully reflect the final outcome and are subject to change dependent upon, amongst other things, the types of buying group and product sales mix.
The level of accrual is reviewed and adjusted quarterly in light of historical experience of actual amounts paid and any changes in arrangements.
Future events could cause the assumptions on which the accruals are based to change, which could affect the future results of the Group.
