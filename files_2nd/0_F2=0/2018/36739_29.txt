In March 2018, 87,017 of these shares were issued in settlement of awards to employees.
A further 87,500 shares were purchased in 2018 at a cost of 1.0m.
At 31 December 2018 a total of 90,453 shares are therefore held, at a cost of 1.0m.

com 103 Hill & Smith Holdings PLC Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2018 Group Accounting Policies Hill & Smith Holdings PLC is a company incorporated in the UK.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that are currently exercisable.
The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the Group Financial Statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
The Group Financial Statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRSs.
The Company has elected to prepare its Parent Company Financial Statements in accordance with FRS 101: these are presented on pages 149 to 159.
The Accounting Policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently in all periods presented in these Group Financial Statements.
Judgements made by the Directors in the application of these Accounting Policies that have a significant effect on the Group Financial Statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed in note 24.
Measurement convention The Group Financial Statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except where the measurement of balances at fair value is required as explained below.
Going concern and liquidity risk The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Operational & Financial Review on pages 18 to 28, together with the financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities.
In addition, note 20 to the Group Financial Statements includes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The businesses of the Group have long established relationships with customers and suppliers which, together with the Groups current financial strength, provide a solid foundation.
The Groups forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group should be able to operate within the level of its current bank facilities, of which the Groups principal debt facility is a multi-currency agreement with a value of 230.5m at 31 December 2018, expiring in April 2021.
As set out in the Operational & Financial Review on pages 18 to 28, on 10 January 2019 this facility was increased to 280m and the maturity date extended to January 2024.
The Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the current uncertain economic outlook.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and its subsidiaries have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and Financial Statements.
New IFRS standards and interpretations adopted during 2018 In 2018 the following amendments had been endorsed by the EU, became effective and therefore were adopted by the Group: IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Amendments to IFRS 2 Share Based Payments Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014-2016 Cycle IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration The impacts of IFRS 15 and IFRS 9 on the Groups results for the year are set out below.
The other amendments have not had a material impact on the financial statements.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers On 1 January 2018 the Group adopted IFRS 15, applying the modified retrospective approach.
IFRS 15 provides a principles-based approach to the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers, focusing on the identification of performance obligations in a contract and requiring revenue to be recognised when those performance obligations are satisfied.
The Group has chosen to apply the modified retrospective approach and so comparative information throughout these financial statements has not been restated i. e. it is presented as previously reported, under IAS 18 and related interpretations.
Additionally, the disclosure requirements in IFRS 15 have not generally been applied to comparative information.
The effect of initial application of IFRS 15 is mainly attributable to earlier revenue recognition from certain contracts entered into by businesses in the Infrastructure Products Utilities segment.
Under IAS 18, revenue for certain products manufactured by these businesses was recognised when the customer accepted the goods and the related risks and rewards of ownership transferred, usually on delivery depending on the Incoterms defined in the contract.
Under IFRS 15, revenue from products that are produced for specific customer requirements and therefore require a high degree of customisation is required to be recognised over the period of manufacture of those products i. e. before delivery to the customer.
Consequently the revenue for these products is recognised sooner under IFRS 15 than under IAS 18.
The impacts of these changes on items other than revenue are an increase in trade and other receivables, recognition of contract assets and a reduction in inventories.
The adoption of IFRS 15 has not had a material impact on businesses in the Infrastructure Products Roads segment, where products are generally of a more standard nature, or in the Galvanizing Services segment where revenue is generally recognised on completion of the galvanizing process.
Further details are set out in the Revenue accounting policy on page 110.
104 Stock Code HILS Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Shareholder Information Hill & Smith Holdings PLC Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2018 The impact on retained earnings at 1 January 2018, net of tax, on transition to IFRS 15 was an increase of 0.9m.
The following tables summarise the impacts on the Groups statement of financial position as at 31 December 2018 and its income statement for the year then ended for each of the line items affected.
There was no material impact on the Groups statement of cash flows for the year ended 31 December 2018.

The new standard addresses the classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and liabilities, introduces new rules for hedge accounting and a new impairment model for financial assets.
The Group has adopted IFRS 9 from 1 January 2018 and has used the exemption not to restate comparative information for prior periods with respect to classification and measurement including impairment requirements.
Differences in the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 are recognised in retained earnings and reserves as at 1 January 2018.
Accordingly, the information presented for 2017 does not generally reflect the requirements of IFRS 9, but rather those of IAS 39.
Classification and measurement IFRS 9 largely retains the existing requirements in IAS 39 for the classification and measurement of financial liabilities: however it eliminates the previous IAS 39 category for financial assets of loans and receivables.
The effect of this change on the Group is to amend the classification of trade and other receivables from loans and receivables to amortised cost.
This change of classification has not had any impact on the carrying amount of trade and other receivables.
Refinancing IFRS 9 requires that when a financial liability measured at amortised cost is modified without being derecognised, a modification gain or loss should be recognised in the income statement.
This represents a change from IAS 39, under which no gain or loss was recognised.
The Groups principal funding facility, which is a financial liability, is a multicurrency revolving credit agreement that was originally established in 2011, but subsequently amended and extended in 2014 and 2016, each of which was accounted for as a modification without derecognition under IAS 39.
On transition to IFRS 9, the modification gain that would have arisen on each of those modifications, when treated in accordance with IFRS 9, has been calculated and applied retrospectively resulting in a credit to equity at 1 January 2018 of 1.8m comprising a reduction of 2.1m in the carrying value of the financial instrument, which is included in the Groups definition of net debt, and recognition of a deferred tax liability of 0.3m.
The following tables summarise the impacts on the Groups income statement and statement of financial position.
There was no impact on the Groups cash flow statement.

It applies to financial assets at amortised cost which include trade and other receivables, contract assets arising under IFRS 15 and lease receivables amongst others.
For trade receivables, the Group applies the simplified approach set out in IFRS 9 to measure expected credit losses using a lifetime expected credit loss allowance.
This change in impairment methodology did not have a material impact on the Groups financial results.
New IFRS standards and interpretations to be adopted in the future The following standards and interpretations which are not yet effective or endorsed by the EU and have not been early adopted by the Group will be adopted in future accounting periods: IFRS 16 Leases effective 1 January 2019 IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments effective 1 January 2019 Amendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments effective 1 January 2019 Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2015-2017 cycle Amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 With the exception of IFRS 16, the above changes are not expected to have a material impact on the Group.
IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 was issued by the IASB in January 2016 and replaces IAS 17 and its related interpretations.
The new standard sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both the lessee and the lessor.
For lessees, IFRS 16 eliminates the classification of leases as either operating or finance leases and introduces a single lessee accounting model with some exemptions for short term and low value leases.
The lessee recognises a right-of-use asset, representing its right to use the underlying asset, and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments.
It also includes an election which permits a lessee not to separate non-lease components e. g. maintenance from lease components and instead to capitalise both the lease cost and associated non-lease cost.
For lessors, IFRS 16 substantially carries forward the accounting treatment under IAS 17 and is not therefore expected to have a material impact on the Groups contracts in which it is a lessor.
The standard will primarily affect the accounting for the Groups operating leases.
The application of IFRS 16 will result in the recognition of additional assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position, while in the income statement it will replace the operating lease expense with a depreciation charge on the right-of-use asset and an interest expense on the lease liabilities.
In addition, the Group will no longer recognise provisions for operating leases that it considers are onerous and will instead perform impairment testing on the right-of-use asset.
106 Stock Code HILS Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Shareholder Information Hill & Smith Holdings PLC Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2018 The Groups non-cancellable operating lease commitments on an undiscounted basis at 31 December 2018 are 38.5m see note 22, which provides an indication of the scale of leases held by the Group.
Within this amount, 26.9m relates to approximately 50 properties that the Group leases for its manufacturing and distribution activities, with the balance of 11.6m relating to other items, the majority of which are plant and machinery and vehicle leases.
The actual impact of applying IFRS 16 will depend on a number of factors including the discount rates for each lease calculated as at 1 January 2019, the expected lease term including renewal options and any exemptions for short-term and low-value leases.
IFRS 16 requires future lease liabilities to be discounted and therefore the amount that the Group will recognise as a right-of-use asset at 1 January 2019 will be lower than the undiscounted commitment of 38.5m at 31 December 2018.
The Group has implemented a new accounting process and an accounting software solution to manage the transition to IFRS 16.
Based on the information currently available for the operating leases that will be recognised in the statement of financial position at 1 January 2019, the estimated impact on the key amounts in the Groups financial statements that will be affected is as follows: Property, plant and equipment Increase c. 20% Net debt Increase c. 25% EBITDA Increase c. 10% Operating profit Increase c. 1% Profit before tax and EPS Increase Marginal Transition The Group will apply IFRS 16 from its effective date using the modified retrospective approach, under which the cumulative effect of adoption will be recognised as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at 1 January 2019, with no restatement of comparative information.
The Group will apply the practical expedient to grandfather the definition of a lease on transition.
This means that it will apply IFRS 16 to all contracts entered into before 1 January 2019 and identified as leases in accordance with IAS 17 and related interpretations.
Intangible assets IFRS 3 was revised in 2010 such that acquisition costs cannot be capitalised for investments made on or after 1 January 2010.
Acquisitions prior to this date have had these costs included with the purchase consideration and as such the goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries comprises the excess of this fair value of the purchase consideration over the Groups share of the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired.
On an ongoing basis the goodwill is measured at cost less impairment losses see accounting policy Impairment of assets.
Fair value adjustments are always considered to be provisional at the first year end date after the acquisition to allow the maximum time to elapse for management to make a reliable estimate.
Goodwill prior to 1 October 1998 was written off to reserves.
Goodwill from 1 October 1998 to 31 December 2003 was amortised in line with UK GAAP.
From 1 January 2004 this goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Brands and customer lists that are acquired by the Group as part of a business combination are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses see accounting policy Impairment of assets.
Cost reflects managements judgement of the fair value of the individual intangible asset calculated by reference to the net present value of future benefits accruing to the Group from the utilisation of the asset, discounted at an appropriate discount rate.
Certain US brands are considered to have an indefinite life and therefore are subject to annual impairment testing see accounting policy Impairment of assets.
In determining that these brands have indefinite lives, consideration was given to the extent of their trading history, which in all cases exceeds 50 years, their prominence in the markets in which they operate and the nature of the products sold under those brands in the context of potential for future development.
For other brands and customer lists, amortisation is provided equally over the estimated useful economic life of the assets concerned, currently up to 20 years.
Expenditure on development activities is capitalised if the product or process is considered to be technically and commercially viable and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate amount of directly attributable overheads.
Other development expenditure is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as an expense as incurred.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation is provided equally over the estimated useful economic life of the assets concerned, currently up to seven years.
Trade licences are amortised over the specific term granted to each individual licence.
com 107 Hill & Smith Holdings PLC Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2018 Group Accounting Policies continued Property, plant, equipment and depreciation Depreciation is provided to write off the cost or deemed cost less the estimated residual value of property, plant and equipment by equal instalments over their estimated useful economic lives as follows: Freehold buildings 5 to 50 years Leasehold buildings life of the lease Plant, machinery and vehicles 4 to 20 years No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
The Group has chosen to take the first time adoption exemption available under IFRS1 to use a previous revaluation for certain land and buildings as its deemed cost at the transition date.
All other items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost unless it is felt that this value should be impaired.
Assets held for sale A non-current asset is classified as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use, it is available for immediate sale and sale is highly probable within one year.
On initial classification as held for sale, non-current assets and disposal groups are measured at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell with any adjustments taken to the income statement.
The same applies to gains and losses on subsequent remeasurement.
Financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Groups Consolidated Statement of Financial Position when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Groups investments in equity securities and certain debt securities are classified as fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI financial assets.
Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes therein, other than impairment losses and foreign exchange gains and losses on FVOCI monetary items, are recognised directly in equity.
When an investment is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss in equity is transferred to profit or loss.
Trade receivables and trade payables are initially measured at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, they are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Derivative financial instruments of the Group are used to hedge its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risks arising from operational, financing and investment activities.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments, as follows: Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
The unhedged gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the year end date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
The fair value of foreign exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate such contracts at the year end date, taking into account the forward exchange rates prevailing at that date.
Where derivative financial instruments are used to hedge cash flow risk, such as interest rate swaps, the effective part of any gain or loss on the fair value of cash flow hedges is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and in the hedge reserve, while any ineffective part is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Amounts recorded in the hedge reserve are subsequently reclassified to the Consolidated Income Statement when the interest expense is actually recognised.
To qualify for hedge accounting the hedging relationship must meet several conditions with respect to documentation, probability of occurrence, hedge effectiveness and reliability of measurement.
At the inception of the transaction, the Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction.
This process includes linking all derivatives designated as hedges to specific assets and liabilities or to specific firm commitments or forecast transactions.
The Group also documents its assessment, at hedge inception and on a half yearly basis, as to whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been, and are likely to continue to be, effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of hedged items.
Interest bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
108 Stock Code HILS Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Shareholder Information Hill & Smith Holdings PLC Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2018 Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Any gain or loss on translation of monetary foreign currency assets and liabilities arising from a movement in exchange rates subsequent to initial measurement is included as an exchange gain or loss in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiary undertakings, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated at the closing exchange rate.
Income statements and cash flows of such undertakings are translated into Sterling at weighted average rates of exchange, other than substantial transactions that are translated at the rate on the date of the transaction.
The adjustments to period end rates are taken to the cumulative translation reserve in equity and reported in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
When an overseas operation is disposed of, in part or in full, the relevant amount in the translation reserve is transferred to profit or loss.
Foreign currency differences arising on the retranslation of a financial liability designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation are recognised directly in equity and reported in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, to the extent that the hedge is effective.
To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, such differences are recognised in profit or loss.
When the hedged part of a net investment is disposed of, the associated cumulative amount in the translation reserve is transferred to profit or loss as an adjustment to the profit or loss on disposal.

In determining the cost of raw materials, consumables and goods purchased for resale, either the FIFO or average cost method is used depending on the nature of the inventory.
Cost for work in progress and finished goods comprises direct materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of attributable overheads.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring either has commenced or has been announced publicly.
Future operating costs are not provided for.
In accordance with the Groups environmental policy and applicable legal requirements, a provision for site restoration in respect of contaminated land is recognised as an obligation arises.
The estimated cost of returning properties held under leases to their original condition in accordance with the terms of specific lease contracts is recognised as soon as such costs are able to be reliably estimated.
Impairment of assets The carrying amounts of the Groups non-financial assets, other than inventories see accounting policy Inventories and deferred tax balances see accounting policy Deferred taxation, are reviewed at each year end date to determine whether there is an indication of impairment.
Impairment reviews are undertaken at the level of each significant cash generating unit, which are no larger than operating segments as defined in IFRS8 Segmental reporting.
If such an indication exists, the relevant assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of the asset or its cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
For goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite life, the recoverable amount is assessed at each year end date and an impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
com 109 Hill & Smith Holdings PLC Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2018 Group Accounting Policies continued Leases Leases for which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Upon initial recognition the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset.
Other leases are classified as operating leases and the leased assets are not recognised on the Groups Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expense, over the term of the lease.
Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction of the outstanding liability.
The finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Rental income from operating leases is recognised as revenue in the Consolidated Income Statement on an accruals basis.
Revenue Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer for the provision of goods and services.
The amount recognised excludes sales taxes and is adjusted for any discounts or volume rebates that are included in the contract.
The Group does not routinely offer discounts or volume rebates, but where it does the variable element of revenue is based on the most likely amount of consideration that the Group believes it will receive.
The Group recognises revenue when it transfers control over a good or service to a customer.
The following information sets out the Groups approach to the nature and timing of the satisfaction of performance obligations in contracts with customers in each of its operating segments and the related revenue recognition policies.
Infrastructure Products Utilities and Roads For standard products that are manufactured, revenue is recognised when goods are accepted by customers, which is usually on delivery depending on the Incoterms defined in the contract.
The Group also enters into certain contracts which require customers to inspect and accept goods that have been manufactured but retained in the Groups facilities: in these cases the customer is deemed to have accepted the product when they have provided evidence of their acceptance and revenue is therefore recognised at that point, assuming that the other criteria set out in IFRS 15 have been met.
Certain of the Groups businesses in the Utilities segment manufacture non-standard products that are specific to customer requirements and therefore require a high degree of customisation.
The Group has determined that in these cases a product with no alternative use is created.
Where the contractual terms are such that if the contract is terminated by the customer then the Group has a right to reimbursement of the costs incurred including a reasonable margin, revenue is recognised over time i. e. before the completed goods are delivered to the customers premises.
Progress is generally determined using input methods such as costs incurred, unless the circumstances of the contract are such that output methods such as milestones reached are considered more appropriate.
In some cases the Group provides installation of its products to customers as an additional service.
Revenue from installation services is recognised over the period that the installation takes place, which is generally less than one month.
Certain of the Groups Roads businesses provide rental assets to customers.
Revenue from these rental agreements is recognised over the period over which the assets are available to the customer.
Galvanizing Services Contracts with customers in the Galvanizing Services segment are generally simple.
Revenue is recognised at a point in time, which is when the galvanizing process has been completed and the customers goods are available to them.
Contract assets Contract assets primarily relate to the rights to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date.
Contract assets are transferred to receivables when the rights become unconditional.
Guarantees The Groups policy is to not give external guarantees.
110 Stock Code HILS Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Shareholder Information Hill & Smith Holdings PLC Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2018 Retirement benefits The Group operates pension schemes under which contributions by employees and by the sponsoring companies are held in trust funds separated from the Groups finances.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Income Statement as incurred.
The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension schemes is calculated separately for each scheme by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
This benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any scheme assets is deducted.
The discount rate is the yield at the year end date on AA rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
Scheme assets are valued at bid price.
In the Consolidated Income Statement current and past service costs are recognised in operating profit and the interest cost on the net defined benefit obligations is included in financial expense.
All actuarial gains and losses in calculating the Groups obligation in respect of defined benefit schemes are recognised annually in reserves and reported in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Share-based payment transactions The fair value of shares options granted is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity reserves.
The fair value is calculated at the grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the shares options.
The BlackScholes model has been adopted as the method of evaluating the fair value of the options where vesting is based on non-market conditions, while a Monte Carlo Simulation is used where vesting is based on market conditions.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the related service and nonmarket performance conditions at the vesting date.
For share-based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based payment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no adjustment for differences between expected and actual outcomes.
The fair value of amounts payable to employees in respect of share appreciation rights settled in cash is recognised as an employee expense and corresponding increase in liabilities.
The fair value of the liability is remeasured at each reporting date and spread over the period during which employees become unconditionally entitled to the payment.
Financial income and expense Financial income comprises interest income on funds invested and gains on the fair value of financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
Interest income is recognised as it accrues in the Consolidated Income Statement using the effective interest method.
Financial expense comprises interest expense on borrowings, interest cost on net pension scheme obligations, unwinding of discounts, losses on the fair value of financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, the interest expense component of finance lease payments and financial expenses related to refinancing.
All borrowing costs are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement using the effective interest method with the exception of those meeting the criteria for capitalisation set out in IAS 23.
Non-underlying items Non-underlying items are disclosed separately in the Consolidated Income Statement where the quantum, nature or volatility of such items would otherwise distort the underlying trading performance of the Group.
The following are included by the Group in its assessment of nonunderlying items: Gains or losses arising on disposal, closure, restructuring or reorganisation of businesses that do not meet the definition of discontinued operations.
Amortisation of intangible fixed assets arising on acquisitions, which can vary depending on the nature, size and frequency of acquisitions in each financial year.
Expenses associated with acquisitions, comprising professional fees incurred and any consideration, which, under IFRS 3 Revised, is required to be treated as a post-acquisition employment expense.
Impairment charges in respect of tangible or intangible fixed assets.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments.
Significant past service items or curtailments and settlements relating to defined benefit pension obligations resulting from material changes in the terms of the schemes.
Net financing costs or returns on defined benefit pension obligations.
Costs incurred as part of significant refinancing activities.
The non-underlying tax charge or credit comprises the tax effect of the above non-underlying items.
Details in respect of the non-underlying items recognised in the current and prior year are set out in note 3 to the Financial Statements.
com 111 Hill & Smith Holdings PLC Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2018 Group Accounting Policies continued Income tax Income tax on the profit or loss for the year represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement except to the extent that it relates to items either recognised in Other Comprehensive Income or directly in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Consolidated Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are not taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the year end date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is provided in full using the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position liability method and represents the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, the initial recognition of assets and liabilities not resulting from a business combination that affects neither accounting or taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the year end date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each year end date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Ordinary dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Own shares held by Employee Benefit Trust EBT Transactions of the Group-sponsored EBT are included in the Group Financial Statements.
In particular, the Trusts purchases of shares in the Company are debited directly to equity.

Segmental information Business segment analysis The Group has three reportable segments which are Infrastructure Products Utilities, Infrastructure Products Roads and Galvanizing Services.
Several operating segments that have similar economic characteristics have been aggregated into these reporting segments.
The Groups internal management structure and financial reporting systems differentiate between these segments, and, in reporting, management have taken the view that they comprise a segment on the basis of the following economic characteristics: The Infrastructure Products Utilities segment contains a group of businesses supplying products characterised by a degree of engineering expertise, to public and private customers involved in the construction of facilities serving the Utilities markets or in the maintenance of such facilities: The Infrastructure Products Roads segment contains a group of companies supplying permanent and temporary safety products to customers involved in the construction or maintenance of national roads infrastructure: and The Galvanizing Services segment contains a group of companies supplying galvanizing and related materials coating services to companies in a wide range of markets including construction, agriculture and infrastructure.

Non-underlying items Non-underlying items included in operating profit comprise the following: Business reorganisation costs of 0.7m 2017: 2.8m relating to two restructuring actions taken by the Group: During the year the Group undertook a restructuring of its UK Industrial Flooring business, part of the Infrastructure Products Utilities segment, a decision taken in light of weaker market conditions in the first half of the year.
The restructuring has improved the efficiency and productivity of the business and supported an improved performance in the second half of the year.
Following the acquisition of Tower Tech in August 2017, the Group commenced a programme to close Tower Techs facility in Oklahoma City and relocate the business to the existing Creative Pultrusions site in Pennsylvania, resulting in a prior year charge of 0.4m.
A further charge of 0.2m has been recognised in 2018 representing additional closure costs that will be incurred.
Amortisation of acquired intangible fixed assets of 4.8m 2017: 4.0m.
Acquisition expenses of 2.2m 2017: 0.6m relating to acquisitions completed during the period.
The costs include 0.4m 2017: nil relating to future consideration payments to previous owners of the acquired businesses, the terms of which require those costs to be treated as a post-acquisition employment expense in accordance with IFRS 3 Revised.
An impairment charge of 6.0m in respect of goodwill and acquired intangible assets relating to the Groups acquisition of Technocover Limited in July 2016.
As set out in the Operational and Financial Review on pages 18 to 28, despite a reasonable performance in 2017, albeit marginally below expectations, in 2018 the business has experienced a further deterioration in its results due principally to a lack of activity in the niche areas of the water industry market that the business services.
As a result, an impairment review was performed at 31 December 2018 resulting in a full impairment of the goodwill and remaining book value of acquired intangible assets, reflecting a short medium term outlook for the business that is below that anticipated at the time of the acquisition.
A past service cost of 1.1m in respect of defined benefit pension schemes.
In October 2018 the High Court handed down a judgement requiring businesses with defined benefit pension schemes to equalise historical Guaranteed Minimum Pensions GMPs between male and female members.
The Group has taken professional advice as to the impact of this judgement and concluded that a cost of 1.0m is likely to be incurred in equalising GMPs arising in prior years.
In drawing this conclusion the Group has taken into account the four potential approaches that the judgement ruled to be suitable for calculating the equalisation cost, and has calculated that the range of outcomes under each of these approaches is likely to be between 0.9m and 1.2m.
The charge has been treated as a non-underlying item in accordance with the Groups definitions of such items.
A further charge of 0.1m was incurred in respect of changes to the terms of the Groups pension schemes in France.
An impairment charge of 0.1m in respect of assets held for sale note 12, reflecting a loss on the disposal of that property during the year.
In April 2017 the Group sold its traffic data collection business, CA Traffic Limited, to TagMaster AB for net consideration of 2.6m.
Net assets disposed were 2.0m resulting in a profit on disposal of 0.6m.

Impairment tests on the carrying values of goodwill and certain brand names of 7.9m 2017: 7.5m, which are the Groups only other indefinite life intangible assets, are performed by analysing the carrying value allocated to each significant cash generating unit against its value in use.
All goodwill is allocated to specific cash generating units which are in all cases no larger than operating segments.
Value in use is calculated for each cash generating unit as the net present value of that units discounted future cash flows.
These cash flows are based on budget cash flow information for a period of one year, and an average growth rate of 3% applied subsequently based on managements estimate for revenue and associated cost growth.
Budgets and strategic plans are prepared taking into account a range of factors including past experience, the forecast future trading environment and macroeconomic conditions in the Groups key markets.
The long-term growth rate assumption reflects the historical long-term growth rates of the developed economies in which the Group principally operates.
These assumptions are applied to all CGUs with the exception of the France Galva SA CGU.
The France Galva SA impairment review was prepared based on the following key assumptions: Budgeted cash flows for 2019, which assume a 0.8% reduction in galvanizing volumes compared with 2018.
For the period 2020-2023 the calculations assume annual growth in galvanizing volumes of 1%.
This assumption is considered appropriate as, in the Groups experience, galvanizing volumes are closely linked to growth in activity in industrial markets, itself closely linked to country GDP growth.
The current GDP growth projections for France issued by the IMF exceed 1% between 2019 and 2023.
For the period from 2024 onwards the calculations assume annual growth in cash flows of 3%, consistent with the historical long-term growth rates in France.
The calculated headroom between value in use and carrying value of each of the cash generating units with significant amounts of goodwill, together with the pre-tax discount rates applied, is set out below.
com 127 Hill & Smith Holdings PLC Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2018 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 10.
Intangible assets continued The pre-tax discount rates detailed above are derived from a market participants cost of capital and risk adjusted for individual cash generating units circumstances.
Similar discount rates are applied in determining the recoverable amounts of other cash generating units.
Using the method set out above with a pre-tax discount rate of 14.3%, the impairment review in respect of Technocover Limited concluded that the carrying values of the assets of the business were less than their recoverable amount by 6.0m, allocated to the goodwill 1.9m and the remaining book value of acquired intangible fixed assets 4.1m arising on the acquisition.
The Group has therefore recognised an impairment charge of 6.0m in respect of Technocover Limited, as further explained in note 3 on page 116.
The Group has applied sensitivities to assess whether any reasonable possible changes in assumptions could cause an impairment that would be material to these Consolidated Financial Statements.
The sensitivity analysis did not identify any material impairments with the exception of Technocover Limited as described above, however the calculations in respect of the goodwill attributable to France Galva SA are relatively sensitive to the assumptions adopted.
France Galva SA Galvanizing volumes, future cash flows and the discount rate are the key assumptions on which the goodwill impairment review is most sensitive.

Financial instruments a Management of financial risks Overview The Group has exposure to a number of risks associated with its use of financial instruments.
This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of these risks, the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Groups management of capital.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The Groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The Group Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
A programme of commercial, operating, financial and third party reviews is in place to assist the Group Audit Committee with its assessment of the effectiveness of risk management and internal control procedures.
com 133 Hill & Smith Holdings PLC Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2018 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 20.
Financial instruments continued Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and principally from the Groups receivables from customers.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for receivables and other financial assets is represented by their carrying amount.
It is the Groups policy to insure a substantial part of the Groups trade receivables.
Any residual risk is spread across a significant number of customers.
As such the impairment losses are not significant.
Purchase limits are established for each customer, which represent the maximum open amount without requiring approval from the Board and are reviewed regularly.
Customers that fail to meet the Groups benchmark creditworthiness may transact with the Group only on a prepayment basis.
The Groups UK companies represent the most significant geographical trade receivable at 31 December 2018 with 47% 2017: 56% and currently the only geographical region that does not generally insure trade receivables is the USA, which represents 31% 2017: 23% of the Groups trade receivables.
Subsidiaries in the USA have a policy of taking out trade references before granting credit limits and selectively insuring where it is deemed appropriate by management.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
It is the Groups policy to minimise its liquidity risk in terms of limiting the amounts of borrowings maturing within the next 12 months.
As at 31 December 2018 all such debt was covered by cash and cash equivalents netting to 36.5m positive current liquidity 2017: 16.1m.
The Groups principal UK revolving credit facility is a multicurrency agreement with a value at 31 December 2018 of 230.5m 2017: 225.5m, based on year end exchange rates.
As set out on page 25, on 10 January 2019 the size of this facility was increased to 280m and the maturity date extended to January 2024.
Along with various other on demand lines of credit, including bank overdrafts and finance leases, the Group has access to facilities of 244.0m at 31 December 2018 2017: 237.3m.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
The Group buys and sells derivatives in the ordinary course of business, and also incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage market risks.
All such transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by the Board.
Counterparty risk A group of relationship banks provides the bulk of the banking services, with pre-approved credit limits set for each institution.
Financial derivatives are entered into with these core banks and the underlying credit exposure to these instruments is included when considering the credit exposure to the counterparties.
At the end of 2018 credit exposure including cash deposited did not exceed 13.6m with any single institution 2017: 4.8m.
Currency risk The Group publishes its Consolidated Financial Statements in Sterling, but conducts business in several foreign currencies, including significant operations based in Continental Europe and the USA.
This results in foreign currency exchange risk due to exchange rate movements which will affect the Groups transaction costs and the translation of the results and net assets of its foreign operations.
The trading currency of each operation is predominantly in the same denomination, however, the Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge the majority of exposures that do exist.
The Group does not apply hedge accounting to these derivative financial instruments.
The Group has hedged its investment in US and European operations by way of financing the acquisitions through like denominations of its multi-currency banking facility.
The Groups investments in other subsidiaries are not hedged because fluctuations on translation of their assets into Sterling are not significant to the Group.
Interest rate risk The Group adopts interest rate swaps when engaging in long-term specific investments or contracts in order to more reliably assess the financial implications of these procurements.
However, the Group currently feels that using fixed interest rates for short-term day-to-day trading is not appropriate.
The Groups policy is to enter into interest rate swaps in order to fix interest rates on up to 40% of its outstanding gross borrowings.
At 31 December 2018 the proportion of gross borrowings subject to fixed interest rate swaps was 0% 2017: 0%.
Insurance The Group purchases insurance for commercial, legal and contractual reasons.
The Group retains insurable risk where external insurance is not commercially viable.

Financial instruments continued Capital management The Board maintains a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Board monitors both the demographic spread of shareholders, as well as the return on capital, which the Group defines as total shareholders equity and the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.
The Board seeks to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.
There are financial covenants associated with the Groups borrowings, which are interest cover and EBITDA to net debt.
The Group comfortably complied with these covenants in 2018 and 2017, as set out in the Operational and Financial Review on pages 18 to 28.

Financial instruments continued At 31 December 2018 the Group did not have any liabilities classified at Level 1 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
There have been no transfers in any direction in the year.
The Groups financial assets, excluding short term receivables, consist mainly of cash and call deposit accounts.
Where cash surpluses arise in the short term, interest is earned based on a floating rate related to bank base rate or LIBOR EURIBOR US LIBOR.
Where the Groups funding requirements allow longer term investment of surplus cash, management will review available options to obtain the best possible return whilst maintaining an appropriate degree of access to the funds.
The Groups financial liabilities, excluding short term creditors, are set out below.
Fixed rate financial liabilities comprise Sterling and US Dollar denominated finance leases.
Floating rate financial liabilities comprise Sterling, Euro and US Dollar bank loans and overdrafts, and Sterling finance leases and hire purchase agreements.
The floating rate financial liabilities bear interest at rates related to bank base rates or LIBOR EURIBOR US LIBOR.
Each subsidiary has financial assets and liabilities which are predominantly in the same denomination as that subsidiarys functional currency.
Excluding the UK Parent Company, the financial assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency of these entities are insignificant to the Group.
The UK Parent Company and certain of its UK subsidiaries hold Euro 17.7m 2017: 10.7m and US Dollar 74.2m 2017: 49.6m denominated interest bearing loans, which are predominantly used to fund the Groups European and United States operations and include 91.9m 2017: 60.3m designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation.
The foreign currency loss of 4.7m 2017: gain of 4.9m for the effective portion was recognised directly in equity netted against exchange differences on translation of foreign operations.
Any ineffective portion recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement is insignificant.

Over the longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates may have an impact on consolidated earnings.
At the end of the reporting periods, the effects of hypothetical changes in interest and currency rates are as follows: Based on average month end net debt balances, if interest rates had varied throughout the year by 1% the positive or negative variation on the years result would have been 1.7m 2017: 1.4m, which would directly impact on the Consolidated Income Statement.
Based on a 10% weakening in Sterling against all currencies throughout the year, the impact on the Consolidated Income Statement would have been a gain of 4.3m 2017: 3.9m and the impact on equity would have been an increase of 25.4m 2017: 19.3m.
Based on a 10% strengthening in Sterling against all currencies throughout the year, the impact on the Consolidated Income Statement would have been a loss of 3.5m 2017: 3.2m and the impact on equity would have been a decrease of 20.7m 2017: 16.4m.

The assets of the Scheme are administered by Trustees and are kept entirely separate from those of the Group.
Independent actuarial valuations are carried out every three years.
Contribution rates are determined on the basis of advice from an independent professionally qualified actuary, with the objective of providing the funds required to meet pension obligations as they fall due.
There are also separate personal pension plans.

com 141 Hill & Smith Holdings PLC Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2018 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 23.
Pensions continued The Scheme exposes the Group to a number of risks, the most significant being: Risk Description Volatile asset returns The defined benefit obligation is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to high quality corporate bond yields.
If assets underperform against this discount rate, this will create a plan deficit.
The Scheme holds a proportion of its assets in equity funds and other growth assets which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term.
However, returns are likely to be volatile in the short term, potentially resulting in short term cash requirements and an increase in the defined benefit obligation recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the Schemes long term objectives.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the funding and accounting liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Schemes investments in Liability Driven Investment and bond funds.
Inflation risk A significant proportion of the defined benefit obligation is indexed in line with price inflation, with higher inflation leading to higher liabilities.
This risk will be partially offset by the Schemes Liability Driven Investments, which will increase in value in line with market inflation expectations.
Life expectancy The majority of the Schemes obligations are to provide a pension for the life of each of the members, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.
A full actuarial valuation of the Scheme was last carried out as at 5 April 2016 and was updated to 31 December 2018 by a qualified actuary.
All actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

The intention of the revised strategy for the Scheme is to reduce a proportion of interest rate and inflation risk by investing a portion of the Schemes assets in Liability Driven Investment funds.
This strategy resulted in an initial shift between bonds and LDI funds in the asset categories in 2017.
Continuation of the strategy in the year to 31 December 2018 has resulted in a further increase in LDI funds and a reduction in equities.
Assets in the bonds, equities and LDI funds categories, which account for approximately 97% of total Scheme assets, have quoted market prices in active markets.

The Group has considered the requirements of IFRIC 14.
The terms of the Scheme give the Group the right to recover any surplus assets in the Scheme upon wind up and therefore management have concluded that there is no impact on the amounts recognised in respect of retirement benefit obligations.

Pensions continued Overseas In France the Group provides certain long term benefits and operates post employment defined benefit plans which provide lump sum benefits at retirement in accordance with collective labour agreements.
Some of those plans are funded with insurance companies.
In the USA Bergen Pipe Supports, Inc. operates a defined benefit pension plan comprising current and deferred pensioners such that no future benefits accrue.
The Group also operates defined contribution plans in a number of other overseas operations.
The amount contributed to these plans during the year was 1.3m 2017: 0.8m.
The Consolidated Income Statement for the year includes a pension charge within operating profit of 1.7m 2017: 1.1m, which includes the costs of the defined contribution schemes and the defined benefit schemes.
Composition of the schemes The Group operates defined benefit schemes in France and the USA.
Actuarial valuations of the schemes were carried out by independent actuaries as at 31 December 2018.
2002 TF 00-02 Assets and liabilities The fair values of scheme assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the value of the scheme liabilities, which is derived from cash flow projections over long periods and which is therefore inherently uncertain, are as follows: Market Market Market Market Market value value value value value 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 m m m m m Assets Cash and other insured fixed interest assets 2.9 3.0 3.2 2.6 2.7 Total fair value of scheme assets 2.9 3.0 3.2 2.6 2.7 Present value of scheme funded obligations 8.0 7.6 7.9 6.0 5.9 Present value of scheme unfunded obligations 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.1 0.2 Retirement benefit obligation 5.4 4.8 4.9 3.5 3.4 Cash and other insured fixed interest assets where assets are held in cash or a policy with a fixed interest asset allocation, the expected long term rate of return is taken to be the yields generally prevailing on such assets as at the year end date.

Accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions The principal accounting judgements, estimates and related assumptions employed in the preparation of these Consolidated Group Financial Statements which could affect the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities at the year end date are set out below.
Actuarial assumptions on pension obligations Estimates In determining the valuation of the defined benefit pension deficit, certain estimates and assumptions about the scheme have been made, notably the expected return on assets, inflation, discount rates, mortality and pension increases.
The factors affecting these assumptions are influenced by wider macro-economic factors that are largely outside of the Groups control.
A sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in key assumptions is set out in note 23.
Impairment of goodwill Estimates The determination of whether goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets should be impaired requires the estimation of future cash flows and growth factors adopted by each cash generating unit.
Furthermore, discount rates applied to these cash flows are determined by reference to the markets in which they operate and are risk adjusted to reflect risks and opportunities existing for each cash generating unit.
These factors are all affected by prevailing market and economic factors outside the Groups control.
Further information on this issue, including sensitivity analysis, is included in note 10.
Taxation Judgements Liabilities for uncertain tax positions require management judgements in respect of tax audit issues and exposures in each of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
Where management judges that a tax position is uncertain, a current tax liability is held for anticipated taxes that are considered to be probable based on the information available.
The key judgement area for the Group is the pricing of intercompany goods and services between subsidiaries in different countries.
com 147 Hill & Smith Holdings PLC Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2018 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 24.
Accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions continued Estimates Management is required to make an estimate of the current tax liability together with an assessment of the temporary differences which arise as a consequence of different accounting and tax treatments.
Liabilities for uncertain tax positions also require management estimates in respect of the amount of tax that may become payable.
Management engages with professional advisors in making its assessment and, if appropriate, will liaise with the relevant taxation authorities to resolve the matter.
The tax liability is reassessed in each period to reflect managements best estimate in light of the information available.
Included in the current tax payable is a liability of 8.3m 2017: 7.8m for uncertain tax positions.
The liability includes an amount of 4.6m 2017: 4.2m relating to the pricing of intercompany goods and services between subsidiaries in different countries.
Depending on the conclusions of any tax audits conducted by the tax authorities in the various jurisdictions in which the Group operates, management estimate the range of possible outcomes to be between nil and 10.0m 2017: nil to 7.7m and therefore it is possible that, if the outcomes are different to those estimated by management, the difference may materially impact the income tax charge credit in the year in which the matter is concluded.
Management does not believe that the range of possible outcomes for the other items included in the liability for uncertain tax positions could have a material effect on the financial statements in the next 12 months.
Further information is set out in note 7 and note 13.
Contingent liability In October 2017, the European Commission opened a state aid investigation into the Group Financing Exemption in the UK controlled foreign company legislation.
In common with other UK-based international companies, the Group may be affected by the outcome of this investigation and is therefore monitoring developments.
If the preliminary findings of the European Commissions investigations into the UK legislation are upheld, we have estimated the Groups maximum potential liability to be 2.5m as at 31 December 2018 2017: 1.7m.
Based on the current status of the investigation, we have concluded that no provision is required in relation to this amount.
Related party transactions The key management are considered to be the Board of Directors of Hill & Smith Holdings PLC, whose remuneration can be seen in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 73 to 82 and in note 4 to the financial statements on page 117.
Subsequent events On 10 January 2019, the Group completed an amendment to its principal UK revolving credit facility, extending the term to January 2024 and increasing the size of the facility by 50m to c. 280m.
Further details are set out in note 20.
On 22 February 2019, the Group announced the acquisition of 100% of the share capital of Cobaco Holdings Limited, the parent company of ATG Access Limited ATG for a cash consideration of 22.5m.
Based in the UK and exporting to over 30 countries, ATG specialises in the development, manufacture and installation of hostile vehicle mitigation perimeter security solutions including bollards, road blockers, barriers and gates.
The combination of our existing security products with those of ATG provides a strong platform to accelerate the expansion of both our existing UK and international roads businesses.
Under IAS 10 Events After the Reporting Period, this has been treated as a nonadjusting event as no conditions existed at the end of the reporting period.
There is no impact to the going concern basis of accounting due to this event.
This transaction will be treated as a business combination under IFRS 3 and full details of the financial effects will be included in the Groups next set of financial statements, as the Group have yet to finalise the initial accounting and to agree this with the vendors.
