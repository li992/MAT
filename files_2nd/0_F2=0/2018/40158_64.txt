Goodwill and intangible assets Accounting policy Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets and contingent liabilities of the acquired subsidiary, associate or joint venture at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in Intangible assets.
Goodwill on acquisitions of associates is included in Investments in associates.
Goodwill included in intangible assets is assessed at each balance sheet date for impairment and carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Detailed calculations are performed based on discounting expected cash flows of the relevant cash generating units CGUs and discounting these at an appropriate discount rate, the determination of which requires the exercise of judgement.
Goodwill is allocated to CGUs for the purpose of impairment testing.
CGUs represent the lowest level within the Group which generate separate cash inflows and at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
These are equal to or smaller than the Groups reportable segments as set out in Note 2 as the Group views its reportable segments on a global basis.
The major CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are set out in the CGU table page 298.
Significant accounting estimates and judgements The carrying amount of goodwill is based on the application of judgements including the basis of goodwill impairment calculation assumptions.
Judgement is also applied in determination of cash generating units.
Estimates include forecasts used for determining cash flows for CGUs and discount rates which factor in country risk free rates and applicable risk premiums.
The Group undertakes an annual assessment to evaluate whether the carrying value of goodwill on-balance sheet is impaired.
The estimation of future cash flows and the level to which they are discounted is inherently uncertain and requires significant judgement and subject to potential change over time.
Acquired intangibles At the date of acquisition of a subsidiary or associate, intangible assets which are deemed separable and that arise from contractual or other legal rights are capitalised and included within the net identifiable assets acquired.
These intangible assets are initially measured at fair value, which reflects market expectations of the probability that the future economic benefits embodied in the asset will flow to the entity, and are amortised on the basis of their expected useful lives 4 to 16 years.
At each balance sheet date, these assets are assessed for indicators of impairment.
In the event that an assets carrying amount is determined to be greater than its recoverable amount, the asset is written down immediately.
Computer software Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software.
Direct costs of the development of separately identifiable internally generated software are capitalised where it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow from its use internally generated software.
These costs include salaries and wages, materials, service providers and contractors, and directly attributable overheads.
Costs incurred in the ongoing maintenance of software are expensed immediately when incurred.
Internally generated software is amortised over a three to five year time period.
