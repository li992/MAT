The group manages liquidity risk associated with derivative contracts, other than derivative hedging instruments, based on the expected maturities of both derivative assets and liabilities as indicated in Note 30.
Management does not currently anticipate any cash flows that could be of a significantly different amount or could occur earlier than the expected maturity analysis provided.
The table below shows the timing of cash outflows for derivative financial instruments entered into for the purpose of managing interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk associated with finance debt, whether or not hedge accounting is applied, based upon contractual payment dates.
The amounts reflect the gross settlement amount where the pay leg of a derivative will be settled separately from the receive leg, as in the case of cross-currency swaps hedging non-US dollar finance debt.
The swaps are with high investment-grade counterparties and therefore the settlement-day risk exposure is considered to be negligible.
Not shown in the table are the gross settlement amounts inflows for the receive leg of derivatives that are settled separately from the pay leg, which amount to $22,453 million at 31December2018 2017 $21,484 million to be received on the same day as the related cash outflows.
For further information on our derivative financial instruments, see Note 30.
Derivative financial instruments In the normal course of business the group enters into derivative financial instruments derivatives to manage its normal business exposures in relation to commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, including management of the balance between floating rate and fixed rate debt, consistent with risk management policies and objectives.
An outline of the groups financial risks and the objectives and policies pursued in relation to those risks is set out in Note 29.
Additionally, the group has a well-established entrepreneurial trading operation that is undertaken in conjunction with these activities using a similar range of contracts.
For information on significant estimates and judgements made in relation to the valuation of derivatives see Derivative financial instruments within Note 1.
The fair values of derivative financial instruments at 31December are set out below.
Exchange traded derivatives are valued using closing prices provided by the exchange as at the balance sheet date.
These derivatives are categorized within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
Exchange traded derivatives are typically considered settled through the normally daily payment or receipt of variation margin.
Over-the-counter OTC financial swaps and physical commodity sale and purchase contracts are generally valued using readily available information in the public markets and quotations provided by brokers and price index developers.
These quotes are corroborated with market data and are categorized within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
In certain less liquid markets, or for longer-term contracts, forward prices are not as readily available.
In these circumstances, OTC financial swaps and physical commodity sale and purchase contracts are valued using internally developed methodologies that consider historical relationships between various commodities, and that result in managements best estimate of fair value.
These contracts are categorized within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
Financial OTC and physical commodity options are valued using industry standard models that consider various assumptions, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic factors.
The degree to which these inputs are observable in the forward markets determines whether the option is categorized within level 2 or level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

The contracts may be entered into for risk management purposes, to satisfy supply requirements or for entrepreneurial trading.
Certain contracts are classified as held for trading, regardless of their original business objective, and are recognized at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the income statement.
Trading activities are undertaken by using a range of contract types in combination to create incremental gains by arbitraging prices between markets, locations and time periods.
The net of these exposures is monitored using market value-at-risk techniques as described in Note 29.

Derivative gains and losses The group enters into derivative contracts including futures, options, swaps and certain forward sales and forward purchases contracts, relating to both currency and commodity trading activities.
Gains or losses arise on contracts entered into for risk management purposes, optimization activity and entrepreneurial trading.
They also arise on certain contracts that are for normal procurement or sales activity for the group but that are required to be fair valued under accounting standards.
These gains and losses are included within sales and other operating revenues in the income statement.
Also included within this line item are gains and losses on inventory held for trading purposes.
The total amount relating to all these items excluding gains and losses on realized physical derivative contracts that have been reflected gross in the income statement within sales and purchases was a net gain of $2,504 million 2017 $1,983 million net gain and 2016 $1,435 million net gain.
This number does not include gains and losses on realized physical derivative contracts that have been reflected gross in the income statement within sales and purchases or the change in value of transportation and storage contracts which are not recognized under IFRS, but does include the associated financially settled contracts.
The net amounts for actual gains and losses relating to these derivative contracts and all related items therefore differ significantly from the amounts disclosed above.
The group also enters into derivative contracts including futures, options, swaps and certain forward sales and forward purchase contracts primarily relating to foreign currency risk management activities.
Gains and losses on these contracts are included within production and manufacturing expenses in the income statement.
The change in the unrealized value of these contracts was a net loss of $351 million 2017 $1,420 million net gain and 2016 $154 million net loss, however the gains and losses in each year are largely offset by opposing net foreign exchange differences on retranslation of the associated non-US dollar debt.
Cash flow hedges i Foreign currency risk of highly probable forecast capital expenditure At 31December2018, the group held currency forwards designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedge relationships of highly probable forecast non-US dollar capital expenditure.
Note 29 outlines the groups approach to foreign currency exchange risk management.
When the highly probable forecast capital expenditure designated as a hedged item occurs, a non-financial asset is recognized and is presented within the fixed asset section of the balance sheet.
The group claims hedge accounting only for the spot value of the currency exposure in line with the strategy to fix the volatility in the spot exchange rate element.
The fair value on the instrument attributable to forward points is taken immediately to the income statement.
The group applies hedge accounting where there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument.
The existence of an economic relationship is determined at inception and prospectively by comparing the critical terms of the hedging instrument and those of the hedged item.
The group enters into hedging derivatives that match the currency and notional of the hedged items on a 1:1 hedge ratio basis.
The hedge ratio is determined by comparing the notional amount of the derivative with the notional designated on the forecast transaction.
The group determines the extent to which it hedges highly probable forecast capital expenditures on a project by project basis.
The group has identified the following sources of ineffectiveness, which are not expected to be material: counterparty's credit risk, the group mitigates counterparty credit risk by entering into derivative transactions with high credit quality counterparties: and differences in settlement timing between the derivative and hedged items.
The latter impacts the discount factor used in the calculation of the hedge ineffectiveness.
The group mitigates differences in timing between the derivatives and hedged items by applying a rolling strategy and by hedging currency pairs from stable economies i. e. sterling US dollar, Euro US dollar, Norwegian krone US dollar, Korean won US dollar.
The group's cash flow hedge designations are highly effective as the sources of ineffectiveness identified are expected to result in minimal hedge ineffectiveness.
The group has not designated any net positions as hedged items in cash flow hedges of foreign currency risk.
Derivative financial instruments continued ii Commodity price risk of highly probable forecast sales At 31 December 2018, the group held Henry Hub NYMEX futures designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedge relationships of certain highly probable forecast future sales.
The group is exposed to the variability in the gas price, but only applies hedge accounting to the risk of Henry Hub price movements for a percentage of future gas sales from its BPX Energy business previously known as US Lower 48 business.
Hedge accounting may be applied to such sales for up to the following two calendar years.
The group applies hedge accounting in relation to these highly probable future sales where there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument.
The group enters into hedging derivatives that match the notional amounts of the hedged items on a 1:1 hedge ratio basis.
The hedge ratio is determined by comparing the notional amount of the derivative with the notional amount designated on the forecast transaction.
The hedge is expected to be highly effective due to the price index of the hedging instruments matching the price index of the hedged item and the derivative assets or liabilities recognized in respect of exchange-traded instruments reflect the impact of daily margin payments and receipts.
The group has not designated any net positions as hedged items in cash flow hedges of commodity price risk.
The table below summarizes the change in the fair value of hedging instruments and the hedged item used to calculate ineffectiveness in the period.

Derivative financial instruments continued Fair value hedges At 31December2018, the group held interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swap contracts as fair value hedges of the interest rate risk and foreign currency risk arising from group fixed rate debt issuances.
The interest rate swaps are used to convert US dollar denominated fixed rate borrowings into floating rate debt.
The cross-currency interest rate swaps are used to convert sterling, euro, Swiss franc, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar and Norwegian krone denominated fixed rate borrowings into US dollar floating rate debt.
The group manages all risks derived from debt issuance, such as credit risk, however, the group applies hedge accounting only to certain components of interest rate and foreign currency risk in order to minimize hedge ineffectiveness.
Note 29 outlines the groups approach to interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk management.
The interest rate and foreign currency exposures are identified and hedged on an  basis.
For interest rate exposures, the group designates as a fair value hedge the benchmark interest rate component only.
This is an observable and reliably measurable component of interest rate risk.
For foreign currency exposures, the group excludes from the designation the foreign currency basis spread component implicit in the cross-currency interest rate swaps.
This is separately calculated at hedge designation, is recognized in other comprehensive income over the life of the hedge and amortized to the income statement on a straight-line basis, in accordance with the groups policy on costs of hedging.
The group applies hedge accounting where there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument.
The existence of an economic relationship is determined initially by comparing the critical terms of the hedging instrument and those of the hedged item and it is prospectively assessed using linear regression analysis.
The group issues fixed rate debt and enters into interest rate and crosscurrency interest rate swaps with critical terms that match those of the debt and on a 1:1 hedge ratio basis.
The hedge ratio is determined by comparing the notional amount of the derivative with the notional amount of the debt.
The hedge relationship is designated for the full term and notional value of the debt.
Both the hedging instrument and the hedged item are expected to be held to maturity.
The group has identified the following sources of ineffectiveness, which are not expected to be material: derivative counterpartys credit risk which is not offset by the hedged item.
This risk is mitigated by entering into derivative transactions only with high credit quality counterparties: and sensitivity to interest rate between the hedged item and the derivatives.
This is driven by differences in payment frequencies between the instrument and the bond.
