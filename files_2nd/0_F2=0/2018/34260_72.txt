Capital disclosures and analysis of changes in net debt The group defines capital as total equity.
We maintain our financial framework to support the pursuit of value growth for shareholders, while ensuring a secure financial base.
The group monitors capital on the basis of the net debt ratio, that is, the ratio of net debt to net debt plus equity.
Net debt is calculated as gross finance debt, as shown in the balance sheet, plus the fair value of associated derivative financial instruments that are used to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate risks relating to finance debt, for which hedge accounting is applied, less cash and cash equivalents.
Net debt and net debt ratio are non-GAAP measures.
BP believes these measures provide useful information to investors.
Net debt enables investors to see the economic effect of gross debt, related hedges and cash and cash equivalents in total.
The net debt ratio enables investors to see how significant net debt is relative to equity from shareholders.
The derivatives are reported on the balance sheet within the headings Derivative financial instruments.
All components of equity are included in the denominator of the calculation.
We aim to manage the net debt ratio within a 20-30% band and maintain a significant liquidity buffer.
