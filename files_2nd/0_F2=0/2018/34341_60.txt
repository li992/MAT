Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information 16 Derivative financial instruments The fair values of derivatives are determined based on market data primarily yield curves, implied volatilities and exchange rates to calculate the present value of all estimated flows associated with each derivative at the balance sheet date.
In the absence of sufficient market data, fair values would be based on the quoted market price of similar derivatives.
The classification of these derivative assets and liabilities under the IFRS13 fair value hierarchy is given in note 23.

These derivatives principally consist of forward foreign currency contracts which have not been designated as hedges due to their value changes offsetting with other components of net finance costs relating to financial assets and financial liabilities.
The Group do not use derivatives for speculative purposes.
All derivatives are undertaken for risk management purposes.
For cash flow hedges, the timing of expected cash flows is as follows: assets of 210 million 2017: 270 million of which 59 million 2017: 73 million is expected within one year and 149 million 2017: 165 million beyond five years and liabilities of 196 million 2017: 73 million of which 39 million 2017: 69 million is expected within one year and 113 million 2017: nil beyond five years.
The Groups cash flow hedges are principally in respect of sales or purchases of inventory and certain debt instruments.
A certain number of forward foreign currency contracts were used to manage the currency profile of external borrowings and are reflected in the currency table in note 20.
Interest rate swaps have been used to manage the interest rate profile of external borrowings and are reflected in the re-pricing table innote 20.
