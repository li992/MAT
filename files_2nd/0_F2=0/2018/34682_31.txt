We have audited the Consolidated Segmental Statement of Centrica plc and its Licensees as listed in footnote i the Group for the year ended 31 December 2018 in accordance with the terms of our engagement letter dated 7 December 2018.
The Consolidated Segmental Statement has been prepared by the Directors of Centrica plc and its Licensees based on the requirements of Ofgems Standard Condition 19A and the Gas and Electricity Supply Licenses and Standard Condition 16B of the Electricity Generation Licences together, the Licences and the basis of preparation on pages 229 to 231.
Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing UK ISAs UK and applicable law.
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditors responsibilities for the audit of the CSS section of our report.
We are independent of the Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the CSS in the United Kingdom, including the Financial Reporting Councils the FRCs Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Emphasis of matter -- ba - sis of accounting We draw attention to pages 229 to 231 of the CSS which describes the basis of accounting.
The CSS is prepared to assist the Company in complying with the requirements of Ofgems Standard Condition 19A of the Gas and Electricity Supply Licences and Standard Condition 16B of the Electricity Generation Licences established by the Regulator Ofgem.
The basis of preparation is not the same as segmental reporting under IFRS and or statutory reporting.
As a result, the CSS may not be suitable for another purpose.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.
Conclusions relating to going concern We are required by ISAs UK to report in respect of the following matters where: the Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation of the CSS is not appropriate: or the Directors have not disclosed in the CSS any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the Groups ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the CSS is authorised for issue.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Other information The Directors are responsible for the other information.
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the Financial Statements and CSS and our auditors report thereon.
Our opinion on the CSS does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the CSS, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the CSS or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the CSS or a material misstatement of the other information.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
Responsibilities of the Directors The Directors are responsible for the preparation of the CSS in accordance with the Licences and the basis of preparation on pages 229 to 231 and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the CSS that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the CSS, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Groups ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors responsibilities for the audit of the CSS Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the CSS as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs UK will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this CSS.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the CSS is located on the Financial Reporting Councils website at: frc.
This description forms part of our auditors report.

Centrica plc operational reporting structure Below is a summary of the Centrica plc Groups Group operational reporting structure.
The CSS financial data has been extracted from the Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 operating segments rather than with reference to specific legal entities.
Certain activities included in the Groups operating segments have been excluded from the Generation and Supply segments of the CSS on the basis they are non-licensed activities for example Business Services and trading activity unrelated to Generation or Supply as illustrated below.
The Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 provides operating segment results in note 4.
A full reconciliation between the relevant operating segment results and those disclosed for Domestic Supply, Non-Domestic Supply and Generation in this CSS is provided at the end of the report.
224 Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Centrica plc operational reporting structure Centrica plc is the ultimate parent company of all 100% owned licensees.
The individual supply and generation licences are held in legal entities whose licensed activities are reported as part of the Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 within the operating segments shown above.
The individual supply and generation licences held in subsidiaries, joint ventures or associates of Centrica plc during 2018 are detailed below: Licensee Licence Ownership British Gas Trading Limited Supply 100% i Neas Energy Limited Supply 100% Centrica Brigg Limited Exempt 100% Centrica Barry Limited Generation 100% Centrica KPS Limited Generation 100% Centrica Distributed Generation Limited formerly Centrica RPS Limited Exempt 100% Centrica PB Limited Generation 100% Centrica KL Limited Generation 100% ii EDF Energy Nuclear Generation Limited Generation 20% Associate i Neas Energy holds a supply licence but currently does not supply any UK customers.
ii The Group holds a 20% investment in Lake Acquisitions Limited which indirectly owns 100% of EDF Energy Nuclear Generation Limited.
For the Thermal sub-segment, the cost of carbon emissions is added to direct fuel costs before dividing by the generated volume.
EBITDA is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, and is calculated by subtracting total operating costs from revenue.
DA is depreciation and amortisation.
EBIT is earnings before interest and tax, and is calculated by subtracting total operating costs, depreciation and amortisation from total revenue.
Supply EBIT margin is a profit margin expressed as a percentage and calculated by dividing EBIT by total revenue and multiplying by 100 for the Supply segment.
Supply PAT is profit after tax but before interest and is calculated by subtracting Group adjusted tax from EBIT for the Supply segment.
Supply PAT margin is a profit margin expressed as a percentage and calculated by dividing Supply PAT by total revenue and multiplying by 100 for the Supply segment.
Volume for Supply is supplier volumes at the meter point i. e. net of losses : Generation volume is the volume of power that can actually be sold in the wholesale market i. e. generation volumes after losses up to the point where power is received under the Balancing and Settlement Code but before subsequent losses.
Average customer numbers sites are calculated by adding average monthly customer numbers sites as defined in the basis of preparation and dividing by 12.
Scheduling decisions means the decision to run individual generation units.
Responsible for interactions with the Balancing Market means interactions with the Balancing Mechanism in electricity.
Interacts with wider market participants to buy sell energy means the business unit is responsible for interacting with wider market participants to buy sell energy, not the entity responsible for the buy sell decision itself, which falls under Responsible for implementing hedging policy makes decisions to buy sell energy.
Matches own generation with own supply means where there is some internal matching of generation and supply before either generation or supply interact with the wider market.
Forecasts total system demand means forecasting total system electricity demand or total system gas demand.
Forecasts customer demand means forecasting the total demand of own supply customers.
Bears shape risk after initial hedge until market allows full hedge means the business unit which bears financial risk associated with hedges made before the market allows fully shaped hedging.
Bears short-term risk for variance between demand and forecast means the business unit which bears financial risk associated with too little or too much supply for own customer demand.

228 Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Basis of preparation The following notes provide a summary of the basis of preparation of the 2018 submission.
The Ofgem CSS segments our Supply and Generation activities and provides a measure of profitability, weighted average cost of fuel, and volumes, in order to increase energy market transparency for consumers and other stakeholders.
These statements have been prepared by the Directors of Centrica plc and its Licensees in accordance with Standard Condition 16B of the Electricity Generation Licences and Standard Condition 19A of the Electricity and Gas Supply Licences and the basis of preparation.
Throughout the basis of preparation the first paragraph number relates to the generation licence and the second to the supply licence conditions respectively.
The financial data provided has been taken from the relevant licensees and affiliates financial information for the year ended 31 December 2018, included in the Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 which have been prepared under IFRS as adopted by the EU in accordance with paragraph 3 19A.
The CSS has been prepared on a going concern basis, as described in the Directors Report and note 24 b in the Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018.
For the Generation segment, we have included the financial results from all activities that relate to our generation licences.
For clarity the following judgements have been made: the Group has a long-term tolling contract in respect of the Spalding power station, but does not specifically hold the generation licence.
This arrangement provides the Group with the right to nominate 100% of the plant capacity in return for a mix of capacity payments and operating payments.
We do not own the power station and the Group does not control the physical dispatch of the asset.
This contractual arrangement has been accounted for as a finance lease under IFRS and therefore the financial result and volume has been included in the Thermal subsegment, within the Generation segment: Brigg and Roosecote power stations had their licences revoked on 2 July 2015 at their request because they no longer required an electricity generation licence and are now exempt.
Whilst we do not specifically hold a generation licence for these power stations, the financial results from these businesses have been included in the Thermal sub-segment and hence within the Generation segment: the Group has a 20% equity interest in Lake Acquisitions Limited, which owns eight nuclear power stations through its indirect investment in EDF Energy Nuclear Generation Limited.
Although we do not specifically hold a generation licence for any of the nuclear stations, our gross share of the financial result from this business including any contractual arrangements has been included in the Nuclear sub-segment and hence within the Generation segment: and where power is purchased from third parties for example from wind farms, power stations or other bilateral arrangements and we do not have an equity interest in, or a finance leasing arrangement from an IFRS perspective over the assets that generate this power, the result related to these activities is excluded from the Generation segment.
In all cases, the Generation segment reports direct fuel costs and generation volumes on a consistent basis if the purchase cost is a direct fuel cost, then the electricity generated is reported in volume.
In previous years, Generation sub-segments for example Nuclear or Thermal included the net revenue and results of trades undertaken by the Energy, Marketing & Trading business to optimise the results of underlying generation, as the trades were considered to be related to our generation.
In the current year, this optimisation activity continues to be reported in the Generation sub-segments, but is now directly reported within the Distributed Energy & Power and Central Power Generation segments within the Centrica plc accounts.
Domestic Supply represents the revenue and associated costs in supplying gas and electricity to residential customers in the UK.
NonDomestic Supply represents the revenue and associated costs in supplying gas and electricity to business customers in the UK.
As a voluntary disclosure, to aid comparability, a summarised 2017 CSS with margins has been included within the report.
Revenues Revenues, costs and profits of the Licensees have been defined below and prepared in compliance with the Groups accounting policies as detailed in notes 2, 3 and S2 of the Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018, except for joint ventures and associates which are presented gross in accordance with paragraph 4 a 19A.
Revenue from sales of electricity and gas for the Supply segment is recognised on the basis of gas and electricity supplied during the year to both domestic and non-domestic customers.
Revenue from sales of electricity and gas includes an assessment of energy supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading and the year end unread.
For the respective Supply segments this means electricity and gas sales.
Revenue for domestic supply is after deducting dual fuel discounts where applicable, with the discount split evenly between electricity and gas.
Government mandated social tariffs and discounts, such as the Warm Home Discount, and other social discounts, have also been deducted from Domestic Supply revenues directly, charged specifically to each fuel.
Revenue from sales of electricity for the Generation segment is recognised on the basis of power supplied during the year.
Power purchases and sales entered into to optimise the performance of each of the power Generation segments are presented net within revenue.
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 229 Ofgem Consolidated Segmental Statement Basis of preparation The financial risks and rewards of owning and using the Groups power stations reside entirely in the reported Generation segment.
Other respective segmental revenues not related to the sale of gas or power have been separately disclosed.
Other revenues include: 89.0 million 2017: 90.8 million in Domestic Electricity Supply and 80.4 million 2017: 81.0 million in Domestic Gas Supply primarily relating to New Housing Connections and smart meter installations: 19.5 million 2017: 26.8 million in Thermal principally relating to Supplementary Balancing Reserve SBR, Short Term Operating Reserve STOR, Triad revenue and Capacity Market income: and 13.3 million 2017: 11.0 million revenue in Nuclear not directly related to energy sales, such as capacity market income and provision of miscellaneous services.
Direct fuel costs Direct fuel costs for both Generation and Supply include electricity, gas, nuclear fuel and imbalance costs.
Energy supply to Domestic and Non-Domestic energy customers is procured at a market referenced price, through a combination of bilateral, over-the-counter OTC and exchange-based trades contracts see table below.
Where energy is procured from within the Group it is also at a market referenced price on an OTC basis.
The market referenced prices used are those prevailing at the time of procurement, which may differ from the price prevailing at the time of supply.
Domestic and Non-Domestic fixed price products are hedged based upon anticipated demand at the start of the contract period.
The majority of the gas and power for Non-Domestic energy and Domestic energy tariff products is purchased in advance see table below.
The exact Domestic and Non-Domestic purchasing patterns vary in response to the outlook for commodity markets and commercial factors.
The Generation segment purchases gas and sells all of its energy at market referenced prices.
Gas for turbines engines is procured at market referenced prices through a combination of OTC and exchange-based trades contracts.
The cost to the power stations will reflect market referenced prices at the time of procurement, and so may differ from the price prevailing at the time of physical supply.
How we procure electricity, gas and carbon: Long form bilateral Individually negotiated contracts with non-standardised terms and conditions which may relate to size, duration or contracts bilateral flexibility.
Pricing is predominantly indexed to published market referenced prices, adjusted for transfer of risks, cost of carry and administration.
OTC Broker supported market of standardised products, predominantly performed via screen-based trading.
These transactions are between two parties, leaving both parties exposed to the others default with no necessary intermediation of any exchange.
An internal OTC price may be provided where market liquidity prevents external trading, with prices that are reflective of market conditions at the time of execution.
Exchange Regulated electronic platform notably ICE, APX, and N2EX where standardised products are traded on exchange through the intermediary of the clearing house which becomes the counterparty to the trade.
Membership of a clearing house is required which entails posting of cash or collateral as margin.
WACOF WACOE WACOG For Generation this represents the weighted average input cost of gas, carbon and nuclear fuel, shown as MWh, used by the Generation business.
For Supply this covers the wholesale energy cost, the energy element of reconciliation by difference RBD costs and balancing and shaping costs incurred by the Supply licensees.
Again, gas and electricity is procured at market referenced prices through a combination of bilateral, OTC and exchange-based trades contracts.
The cost for the Supply business will reflect market referenced prices at the time of procurement, and so may differ from the price prevailing at the time of physical supply.
Where gas is procured using predominantly indexed bilateral contracts, the fuel cost is then allocated between Domestic and Non-Domestic Supply using annually updated fixed percentages based on the historical split of tariff book volumes.
Gas and Electricity balancing costs are allocated between Domestic and Non-Domestic Supply based on their respective volumes multiplied by an appropriate industry referenced price for example APX or SAP.
For electricity Supply the weighted average cost of electricity is shown as MWh.
For gas Supply, the weighted average cost of gas is shown as p th.
Direct costs Direct costs for Supply and Generation are broken down into network costs, environmental and social obligation costs and other direct costs.
Network costs for Supply and Generation include transportation costs, BSUOS and the transport element of RBD costs.
Supply transportation costs include transportation and LNG costs, including 38.3 million incurred by Gas Domestic Supply in 2018, which enables the segment to secure supply by giving the ability to bring gas into the UK from overseas 2017: 38.4 million.
Environmental and social obligation costs for Domestic Supply include ROCs, FIT, ECO and UK Capacity Market costs.
Non-Domestic Supply includes the cost of LECs, ROCs, FIT and UK Capacity Market costs.
Within the Domestic and Non-Domestic segments, the costs of LECs, FIT, ROCs and UK Capacity Market costs are included within Electricity, and ECO is allocated between Electricity and Gas based on the relevant legislation.
Environmental and social obligation costs for the Generation segment relate to EU ETS carbon emission costs and carbon tax.
Other direct costs for Generation include employee and maintenance costs.
230 Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Basis of preparation Other direct costs for Supply include brokers costs and sales commissions when the costs have given rise directly to revenue, that is, producing a sale.
They also include Elexon and Xoserve market participation and wider Smart metering programme costs.
Indirect costs Indirect costs for Supply and Generation include operating costs such as sales and marketing, bad debt costs, costs to serve, IT, HR, finance, property, staffing and billing and metering costs including smart meter costs.
Indirect costs for the Generation, Domestic and Non-Domestic Supply segments including corporate and business unit recharges are allocated based on relevant drivers, which include turnover, headcount, operating profit, net book value of fixed assets and proportionate use benefit.
For Supply, indirect costs including corporate recharges but excluding bad debt costs are primarily allocated between Electricity and Gas on the basis of customer numbers Domestic and sites Non-Domestic.
Bad debt costs are allocated between Electricity and Gas on the basis of actual bad debt cost by individual contract in the billing system Domestic and on the basis of revenues Non-Domestic.
Other For Supply, depreciation and amortisation is allocated between Electricity and Gas on the basis of customer numbers Domestic and sites Non-Domestic.
For the purposes of Supply PAT, tax is allocated between Gas and Electricity within both Domestic and Non-Domestic Supply based on their relative proportions of EBIT.
Note 4 c of the Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 provides details of the adjusted operating profit after tax of the relevant operating segments.
For the Domestic Supply segment, customer numbers are stated based on the number of district meter point reference numbers MPRNs and meter point administration numbers MPANs in our billing system for gas and electricity respectively, where it shows an active point of delivery and a meter installation.
As a result, our customer numbers do not include those meter points where a meter may recently have been installed but the associated industry registration process has yet to complete, as the meter information will not be present in our billing system.
For the Non-Domestic Supply segment, sites are based on the number of distinct MPRNs and MPANs in our billing system for gas and electricity respectively.
Transfer pricing for electricity, gas and generation licensees in accordance with paragraph 4 d 19A.
4 d There are no specific energy supply agreements between the Generation and Supply segments, other than the occasional immaterial arms length arrangement between Thermal power stations and Supply 2018 revenue: 2 million.
The Group continues to ensure transfer pricing methodologies are appropriate and up to date.
In order to meet this requirement, the Group ensured all transfer pricing and cost allocation methodologies were internally reviewed, updated and collated in a central repository.
Treatment of joint ventures and associates The share of results of joint ventures and associates for the year ended 31 December 2018 principally arises from the Groups interests in the entities listed on page 225.
Under paragraph 5 of the Conditions, the information provided in the CSS includes our gross share of revenues, costs, profits and volumes of joint ventures and associates.
In preparing the CSS, joint ventures and associates which hold a UK generation licence or exemption are accounted for as follows: our proportionate share of revenues of joint ventures and associates has been included within revenue: our proportionate share of the profit before tax of joint ventures and associates has been included within EBIT and EBITDA: and our proportionate share of the generation volumes of joint ventures and associates has been included within the generation volumes.
For each of the above items, our share of the income and expenses of the joint ventures or associates has been combined line-by-line within the relevant item of the CSS.
The Supply segment has investments in associates but because the investees businesses do not relate to the sale of gas and electricity, the share of result revenue of nil 2017: 0.1 million, EBIT of nil 2017: 0.1 million loss has been included net within indirect costs rather than gross, on a line-by-line basis.
Exceptional items and certain re-measurements Restructuring costs, impairment charges and onerous provisions that have been identified as exceptional items, and mark-to-market adjustments in the Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018, are excluded from the CSS.
For further details of excluded exceptional items and certain re-measurements see note 7 in the Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018.
The Nuclear sub-segment result includes a 9.7 million 2017: 17.0 million profit from the revaluation of contingent valuation rights, related to the original acquisition of the Nuclear investment.
A reconciliation of the Segmental Statement revenue, EBIT, depreciation and Supply PAT to the 2018 audited Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts has been included in accordance with paragraphs 4 b & c 19A.
