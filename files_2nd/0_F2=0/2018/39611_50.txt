Notes on the consolidated accounts 14 Loan impairment provisions continued IFRS 9 ECL model design principles Critical accounting policy: Loan impairment provisions To meet IFRS 9 requirements for ECL estimation, PD, LGD and EAD The Group's 2017 loan impairment provisions were established in used in the calculations must be: accordance with IAS 39 in respect of incurred losses.
They comprised Unbiased - material regulatory conservatism has been removed individual and collective components as more fully explained in the to produce unbiased model estimates: 2017 Annual Report and Accounts.
In 2018 the loan impairment Point-in-time - recognise current economic conditions: provisions have been established in accordance with IFRS 9.
Forward-looking - incorporated into PD estimates and, where Accounting policy 14 sets out how the expected loss approach is appropriate, EAD and LGD estimates: and applied.
At 31 December 2018, customer loan impairment provisions For the life of the loan - all models produce a term structure to amounted to 3,368 million 2017 - 3,814 million.
A loan is impaired allow a lifetime calculation for assets in Stage 2 and Stage 3. when there is objective evidence that the cash flows will not occur in the manner expected when the loan was advanced.
Such evidence IFRS 9 requires that at each reporting date, an entity shall assess includes changes in the credit rating of a borrower, the failure to make whether the credit risk on an account has increased significantly since payments in accordance with the loan agreement: significant reduction initial recognition.
Part of this assessment requires a comparison to be in the value of any security: breach of limits or covenants: and made between the current lifetime PD i. e. the current probability of observable data about relevant macroeconomic measures.
default over the remaining lifetime with the equivalent lifetime PD as determined at the date of initial recognition.
The impairment loss is the difference between the carrying value of the loan and the present value of estimated future cash flows at the loan's The general approach for the IFRS 9 LGD models has been to original effective interest rate.
leverage the Basel LGD models with bespoke IFRS 9 adjustments to ensure unbiased estimates, i. e. use of effective interest rate as the The measurement of credit impairment under the IFRS expected loss discount rate and the removal of: downturn calibration, indirect costs, model depends on managements assessment of any potential other conservatism and regulatory floors.

All For Wholesale, while conversion ratios in the historical data show three elements require judgments that are potentially significant to the temporal variations, these cannot unlike in the case of PD and some estimate of impairment losses.

Therefore point-in-time best estimates measures for EAD are derived by estimating the regulatory model specification on a rolling five year window.
Approach for multiple economic scenarios MES The base scenario plays a greater part in the calculation of ECL than the approach to MES.
