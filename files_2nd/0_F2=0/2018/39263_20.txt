RELX PLC and its subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are together known as RELX.
Up until the corporate simplification, consolidated accounts were prepared on the basis that all shareholders were regarded as having interests in a single economic entity, and as such the dual parent Group formed a single reporting entity for the presentation of consolidated financial statements.
The corporate simplification as described on page 72 therefore has had no impact on the basis of preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, subsidiaries are accounted for under the acquisition method and investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method.
All intra-group transactions and balances are eliminated.
On acquisition of a subsidiary, or interest in an associate or joint venture, fair values, reflecting conditions at the date of acquisition, are attributed to the net assets, including identifiable intangible assets acquired.
Adjustments are made to bring accounting policies into line with those of the Group.
The results of subsidiaries sold or acquired are included in the consolidated financial statements up to or from the date that control passes from or to the Group.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of the Group are identified separately from shareholders equity.
Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original acquisition and the non-controlling share of changes in equity since the date of acquisition.
The Directors of RELX PLC, having made appropriate enquiries, consider that adequate resources exist for the Group to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and that, therefore, it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018.
Accounting policies The Groups consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union and as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
The accounting policies under IFRS are included in the relevant notes to the consolidated financial statements.
The accounting policies below are applied throughout the financial statements and are unchanged from those applied in preparing the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 and 2016, with the exception of policies relating to the adoption of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 16 Leases.
Restatement The consolidated financial statements have been restated for the retrospective adoption of IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and IFRS 16.
Each note identifies where comparatives have been restated.
Foreign exchange translation The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at historical cost in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
At each statement of financial position date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate prevailing on the statement of financial position date.
Exchange differences arising are recorded in the income statement other than where hedge accounting applies, as set out on pages 150 to 155.
Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the statement of financial position date.
Income and expense items and cash flows of foreign operations are translated at the average exchange rate for the period.
Significant individual items of income and expense and cash flows in foreign operations are translated at the rate prevailing on the date of transaction.
Exchange differences arising are classified as equity and transferred to the translation reserve.
When foreign operations are disposed of, the related cumulative translation differences are recognised within the income statement in the period.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, primarily forward contracts, to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks.
Details of the Groups accounting policies in respect of derivative financial instruments are set out on page 150.
Critical judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty The most significant accounting policies in determining the financial condition and results of the Group, and those requiring the most subjective or complex judgement, relate to and are included in the following notes: valuation of goodwill and intangible assets notes 14 and 15: capitalisation of development spend note 15: taxation note 9: and accounting for defined benefit pension schemes note 6.
Overview Business review Financial review Governance Financial statements and other information RELX Annual report and financial statements 2018 | Notes to the consolidated financial statements 127 1 Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued Other significant accounting policies The accounting policy in respect of revenue recognition is also significant in determining the financial condition and results of the Group, although the application of this policy is more straightforward.
This policy is included in note 2.
Standards and amendments effective for the year New accounting standards and amendments effective for the period and adopted by the Group in 2018 are IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
IFRS 16 Leases has also been adopted in the period, a year earlier than its mandatory effective date of 1 January 2019.
The impact of the adoption of these standards on the full year 2016 and full year 2017 results is as follows: 2016 as IFRS 9 IFRS 15 IFRS 16 2016 as reported impact impact impact restated m m m m m Income statement Revenue 6,895 6 6,889 Reported operating profit 1,708 6 6 1,708 Net finance costs 195 2 16 213 Reported net profit attributable to RELX PLC shareholders 1,161 2 4 5 1,150 Reported EPS 56.3p 0.1p 0.2p 0.2p 55.8p Statement of financial position Right-of-use assets 20 306 326 Borrowings including lease liability 4,843 17 430 5,256 Finance lease receivable 63 63 Deferred income 1,941 67 2,008 2017 as IFRS 9 IFRS 15 IFRS 16 2017 as reported impact impact impact restated m m m m m Income statement Revenue 7,355 14 7,341 Adjusted operating profit 2,284 11 11 2,284 Reported operating profit 1,905 11 11 1,905 Net finance costs 182 2 15 199 Adjusted net profit attributable to RELX PLC shareholders 1,635 2 9 4 1,620 Reported net profit attributable to RELX PLC shareholders 1,659 2 9 1,648 Adjusted EPS 81.0p 0.1p 0.5p 0.2p 80.2p Reported EPS 82.2p 0.1p 0.5p 81.6p Statement of financial position Right-of-use assets 16 271 287 Borrowings including lease liability 4,886 14 381 5,253 Finance lease receivable 57 57 Deferred income 1,834 76 1,910 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9 replaces the classification and measurement requirements in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
RELX has applied IFRS 9 retrospectively, with the exception of hedge accounting, which has been applied prospectively.
The main impact on previously reported numbers results in a reduction to borrowings of 14m as at 31 December 2017 31 December 2016: reduction of 17m, arising from a retrospective change in the treatment under IFRS 9 of certain debt modifications undertaken in 2012 and 2013.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 provides a single point of reference for revenue recognition, including guidance in relation to identification of the contract and licensing arrangements.
RELX has adopted IFRS 15 on a fully retrospective basis.
The main impact of IFRS 15 is a change in the timing of revenue recognition as a result of the guidance on identification and satisfaction of performance obligations under IFRS 15.
The impact on the income statement for the 12 months to 31 December 2017 is a decrease of 11m to both reported and adjusted operating profit 31 December 2016: decrease of 6m to reported operating profit.
128 RELX Annual report and financial statements 2018 | Financial statements and other information Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018 1 Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued IFRS 16 Leases early adopted and therefore effective for the 2018 financial year IFRS 16 eliminates the distinction between operating and finance leases and requires lessees to recognise all leases with a lease term of greater than 12 months in the statement of financial position.
RELX has adopted this standard a year earlier than the mandatory effective date of 1 January 2019.
IFRS 16 has been adopted on a fully retrospective basis.
The change in accounting standard results in both an asset and liability being brought onto the statement of financial position for the majority of leases where RELX is a lessee.
The asset is then depreciated, and interest expense recognised over the life of the lease.
The standard also gives guidance on the recognition of subleases, which results in finance sublease receivables being recognised on the balance sheet.
As at 31 December 2017, the restated statement of financial position includes additional right-of-use assets of 271m, finance lease receivables of 57m and additional lease liabilities of 381m 31 December 2016:right-of-use assets of 306m, finance lease receivables of 63m and lease liabilities of 430m.
The impact on the income statement for the 12 months to 31 December 2017 is an increase of 11m to both reported and adjusted operating profit 31 December 2016: 6m increase to reported operating profit offset by a net increase to finance costs of 15m 31 December 2016: 16m.
After taking into account additional gains from disposals of right-of-use assets, there is no impact on reported net profit.
Opening balance sheet adjustment An opening balance sheet adjustment has been made at 1 January 2016 to reflect the impact of adoption on prior years.
The adjustment reduces opening retained earnings by 36m.
This mainly relates to the recognition of lease expense earlier on in the lease under IFRS 16 and the deferral of revenue into future periods under IFRS 15.
Additionally, the other interpretations and amendments to IFRS effective for 2018 have not had a significant impact on the Groups accounting policies or reporting.
Standards, amendments and interpretations not yet effective A number of amendments and interpretations have been issued which are not expected to have any significant impact on the accounting policies and reporting.
2 Revenue and segment analysis Accounting policy The Groups reported segments are based on the internal reporting structure and financial information provided to the Board.
Adjusted operating profit is the key segmental profit measure used by the Group in assessing performance.
Adjusted operating profit is reconciled to operating profit on page 131.
Revenue arises from the provision of products and services under contracts with customers.
In all cases, revenue is recognised to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services, and is recognised when the customer obtains control of the good or service.
Revenue is stated at the transaction price, which includes allowance for anticipated discounts and returns and excludes customer sales taxes and other amounts to be collected on behalf of third parties.
Where the goods or services promised within a contract are distinct, they are identified as separate performance obligations and are accounted for separately.
Where separate performance obligations are identified, total revenue is allocated on the basis of relative stand-alone selling prices or managements best estimate of relative value where stand-alone selling prices do not exist.
Management estimates may include a cost-plus method or comparable product approach, but must be supported by objective evidence.
A residual approach may be applied where it is not possible to derive a reliable management estimate for a specific component.
Revenue is recognised for the various categories as follows: Subscriptions revenue comprises income derived from the periodic distribution or update of a product.
Subscription revenue is generally invoiced in advance and recognised systematically over the period of the subscription.
Recognition is either on a straight-line basis where the transaction involves the transfer of goods and services to the customer in a consistent manner over a specific period of time: or based on the value received by the customer where the goods and services are not delivered in a consistent manner.
Transactional revenue is recognised when control of the product is passed to the customer or the service has been performed.
For exhibitions, revenue primarily comprises income from exhibitors and attendees at exhibitions.
Exhibition revenue is recognised on occurrence of the exhibition.
Advertising revenue is recognised on publication or over the period of online display.

There are a number of multi-year contracts, mainly in Risk & Business Analytics, where revenue is recognised on the achievement of delivery milestones or other specified performance obligations.
As at 31 December 2018, the aggregate amount of the transaction price of such contracts which relates to performance obligations which have not yet been delivered was approximately 210m.
It is expected that revenue will be recognised in relation to this amount over the next ten years.

3 Operating profit Accounting policy Share based remuneration The fair value of share based remuneration is determined at the date of grant and recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, taking account of the estimated number of shares that are expected to vest.
Market based performance criteria are taken into account when determining the fair value at the date of grant.
Non-market based performance criteria are taken into account when estimating the number of shares expected to vest.
The fair value of share based remuneration is determined by use of a binomial or Monte Carlo simulation model as appropriate.
All of the Groups share based remuneration is equity settled.

Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Past service costs and credits are recognised immediately at the earlier of when plan amendments or curtailments occur and when related restructuring costs or termination benefits are recognised.
Settlements are recognised when they occur.
Net pension obligations in respect of defined benefit schemes are included in the statement of financial position at the present value of scheme liabilities, less the fair value of scheme assets.
Where schemes are in surplus, i. e. assets exceed liabilities, the net pension assets are separately included in the statement of financial position.
Any net pension asset is limited to the extent that the asset is recoverable.
The expense of defined contribution pension schemes and other employee benefits is charged in the income statement as incurred.
Critical judgement and key source of estimation uncertainty At 31 December 2018, the Group operates defined benefit pension schemes in the UK and the US.
These schemes require management to exercise judgement in estimating the ultimate cost of providing post-employment benefits, especially given the length of each schemes liabilities.
Accounting for defined benefit pension schemes involves judgement about uncertain events, including the life expectancy of the members, salary and pension increases, inflation, the future operation of each scheme and the rate at which the future pension payments are discounted.
Estimates for these factors are used in determining the pension cost and liabilities reported in the financial statements.
The estimates made around future developments of each of the critical assumptions are made in conjunction with independent actuaries, and each scheme is subject to a periodic review by independent actuaries.
Information regarding the more significant assumptions used for valuation is provided below, together with a sensitivity analysis.
A number of pension schemes are operated around the world.
The largest defined benefit schemes as at 31 December 2018 are in the UK and the US.
Major defined benefit schemes in place at 31 December 2018 The UK scheme is a final salary scheme and is closed to new hires.
Members accrue a portion of their final pensionable earnings based on the number of years of service.
The US scheme is a cash balance scheme and is closed to new hires.
Members earn pay credits dependent on age and years of service up to certain limits which are added to an account balance that accrues interest at specified minimum rates.
The US scheme was closed to future accruals effective 1 January 2019.
Each of the major defined benefit schemes is administered by a separate fund that is legally separated from the Group.
The trustees of the pension funds in the UK and plan fiduciaries of the US scheme are required by law to act in the interest of the funds beneficiaries.
In the UK, the trustees of the pension fund are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund.
The board of trustees consists of an equal number of company-appointed and member-nominated Directors.
In the US, the fiduciary duties for the scheme are allocated between committees which are staffed by senior employees of the Group: the investment committee has the primary responsibility for the investment and management of plan assets.
The funding of the Groups major schemes reflects the different rules within each jurisdiction.
134 RELX Annual report and financial statements 2018 | Financial statements and other information Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018 6 Pension schemes continued In the UK, the level of funding is determined by statutory triennial actuarial valuations in accordance with pensions legislation.
Where the scheme falls below 100% funded status, the Group and the scheme trustees must agree on how the deficit is to be remedied.
The UK Pensions Regulator has significant powers and sets out in codes and guidance the parameters for scheme funding.
The US scheme has an annual statutory valuation which forms the basis for establishing the employer contribution each year subject to ERISA and IRS minimums.
Should the statutory funded status fall to below 100%, the US Pension Protection Act requires the deficit to be rectified with additional contributions over a seven-year period.
The Group and the scheme trustees have completed the 2018 triennial valuation under which the Group has committed to providing 176m of deficit funding contributions to the scheme over the period 2019 to 2022.
Employer cash contributions to defined benefit pension schemes in respect of 2019 are expected to be approximately 62m including a 44m pension deficit funding contribution relating to the UK scheme recovery plan.
The pension expense in total, including amounts in relation to the UK and US defined benefit schemes, defined contribution schemes and GMP equalisation cost, recognised in the income statement consists of: 2018 2017 2016 m m m Defined benefit pension expense including past service cost for GMP equalisation in 2018 47 4 36 Defined contribution pension expense 95 91 75 Total 142 95 111 135m 2017: 95m: 2016: 111m of the total pension cost is recognised within operating profit.
In 2018 a past service cost was recognised to account for the impact of GMP equalisation in the UK.
In 2017 settlement and past service credits primarily relate to changes to the UK scheme.
The amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of defined benefit pension schemes during the year are presented by major scheme as follows: 2018 2017 2016 UK US Total UK US Total UK US Total m m m m m m m m m Service cost 27 9 36 33 14 47 27 14 41 Settlement and past service cost credits 11 11 42 1 43 5 5 Defined benefit pension expense 38 9 47 9 13 4 27 9 36 Net interest on net defined benefit obligation 6 3 9 10 5 15 9 5 14 Net defined benefit pension expense 44 12 56 1 18 19 36 14 50 Net interest on net defined benefit pension scheme liabilities is presented within net finance costs in the income statement.
The significant valuation assumptions, determined for each major scheme in conjunction with the respective independent actuaries, are presented below.
The net defined benefit pension expense for each year is based on the assumptions and scheme valuations set at 31 December of the prior year.
Mortality assumptions make allowance for future improvements in longevity and have been determined by reference to applicable mortality statistics.

The weighted average duration of defined benefit scheme liabilities is 19 years in the UK 2017: 20 years and 12 years in the US 2017: 13 years.
Deferred tax assets of 86m 2017: 66m are recognised in respect of the pension scheme deficits.
A net pension asset has been recognised in relation to the US funded scheme after considering the guidance in IAS 19 Employee Benefits and IFRIC 14.

In particular, adverse changes to asset values, discount rates or inflation could increase future pension costs and funding requirements.
Typically, the Groups schemes are exposed to: investment risks, whereby actual rates of return on plan assets may be below those rates used to determine the defined benefit obligations, and interest rate risks, whereby scheme deficits may increase if bond yields in the UK and the US decline and are not offset by returns in government and corporate bond portfolios.
The schemes are also exposed to other risks, such as unanticipated future increases in member longevity patterns and inflation, all potentially leading to an increase in scheme liabilities.
Investment policies of each scheme are intended to ensure continuous payment of defined benefit pensions in the short-term and long-term.
Efforts are made to limit risks on marketable securities by adopting investment policies that diversify assets across geographies and among equities, government and corporate bonds, property funds and cash.
Asset allocations are dependent on a variety of factors including the duration of scheme liabilities and the funded position of the plan.
All equities, government and corporate bonds have quoted prices in active markets.
Sensitivity analysis The valuation of the Groups pension scheme liabilities involves significant actuarial assumptions, being the life expectancy of the members, inflation and the rate at which the future pension payments are discounted.
Differences arising from actual experience or future changes in assumptions may materially affect future pension charges.
In particular, changes in assumptions for discount rates, inflation and life expectancies that are reasonably possible would have the following approximate effects on the defined benefit pension obligations: m Increase decrease of 0.25% in discount rate 207 Increase decrease of 0.25% in the expected inflation rate 94 Increase decrease of one year in assumed life expectancy 177 The above analysis has been calculated on the same basis used to determine the defined benefit obligation recognised in the statement of financial position.
There has been no change in the methods used to prepare the analysis compared with prior years.
This sensitivity analysis may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that changes in the above assumptions would occur in isolation as some of the assumptions may be correlated.

8 Disposals and other non-operating items Accounting policy Assets of businesses that are available for immediate sale in their current condition and for which a sales process is considered highly probable to complete are classified as assets held for sale and are carried at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to sell.
Fair value is based on anticipated disposal proceeds, typically derived from firm or indicative offers from potential acquirers.
Non-current assets are not amortised or depreciated following their classification as held for sale.
Liabilities of businesses held for sale are also separately classified on the statement of financial position.
Fair value movements in the venture capital portfolio are reported within disposals and other items see note 16.

Current and deferred tax are charged or credited in the income statement except to the extent that the tax arises from a transaction or event which is recognised, in the same or a different period, outside the income statement either in other comprehensive income, directly in equity, or through a business combination, in which case the tax appears in the same statement as the transaction that gave rise to it.
Current tax is the amount of corporate income taxes expected to be payable or recoverable based on the profit for the period as adjusted for items that are not taxable or not deductible, and is calculated using tax rates and laws that were enacted or substantively enacted at the date of the statement of financial position.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation.
Provisions are established where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Current tax includes amounts provided in respect of uncertain tax positions when management expects that, upon examination of the uncertainty by a tax authority in possession of all relevant knowledge, it is more likely than not that an economic outflow will occur.
Changes in facts and circumstances underlying these provisions are reassessed at the date of each statement of financial position, and the provisions are remeasured as required to reflect current information.
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the statement of financial position.
Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period, and which are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences but not recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures where the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised on temporary differences that arise from goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised, and are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised in respect of temporary differences that arise on initial recognition of assets and liabilities acquired other than in a business combination.
Deferred tax is not discounted.
Critical judgement and key source of estimation uncertainty The Group is subject to tax in numerous jurisdictions, giving rise to complex tax issues that require management to exercise judgement in making tax determinations.
As a multinational enterprise, our tax returns in the countries in which we operate are subject to tax authority audits as a matter of routine.
While the Group is confident that tax returns are appropriately prepared and filed, amounts are provided in respect of uncertain tax positions that reflect the risk with respect to tax matters under active discussion with tax authorities, or which are otherwise considered to involve uncertainty.
Provisions against uncertain tax positions are measured using one of the following methods, depending on which of the methods management expects will better predict the amount it will pay over to the tax authority: The Single Best Estimate where there is a single outcome that is more likely than not to occur.
This will happen, for example, where the tax outcome is binary such as whether an entity can deduct an item of expenditure or the range of possible outcomes is narrow or concentrated on a single value.
The most likely outcome may be that no tax is expected to be payable, in which case the provision is nil: or A Probability-Weighted Expected Value where, on the balance of probabilities, something will be paid to the tax authority but the possible outcomes are widely dispersed with low individual probabilities i. e. there is no single outcome more likely than not to occur.
In this case, the provision is the sum of the probability-weighted amounts in the range.
In assessing provisions against uncertain tax positions, management uses in-house tax experts, professional firms and previous experience to inform the evaluation of risk.
However, it remains possible that uncertainties will ultimately be resolved at amounts greater or smaller than the liabilities recorded.
In particular, although we report cross-border transactions undertaken between Group subsidiaries on an arms-length basis in tax returns in accordance with OECD guidelines, transfer pricing relies on the exercise of judgement and it is frequently possible for there to be a range of legitimate and reasonable views.
This means that it is impossible to be certain that the returns basis will be sustained on examination.
Discussions with tax authorities relating to cross-border transactions and other matters are ongoing in each of our major trading jurisdictions.
Although the timing and amount of final resolution of these uncertain tax positions cannot be reliably predicted, no significant impact on the profitability of the Group is expected in the near term.
Estimation of income taxes also includes assessments of the recoverability of deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that they are considered recoverable based on existing tax laws and forecasts of future taxable profits against which the underlying tax deductions can be utilised.
The recoverability of these assets is reassessed at the end of each reporting period, and changes in recognition of deferred tax assets will affect the tax liability in the period of that reassessment.
Overview Business review Financial review Governance Financial statements and other information RELX Annual report and financial statements 2018 | Notes to the consolidated financial statements 139 9 Taxation continued Restated Restated 2018 2017 2016 m m m Current tax United Kingdom 71 104 80 The Netherlands 72 77 51 Rest of world 154 258 243 Total current tax charge 297 439 374 Deferred tax 5 374 73 Tax expense 292 65 301 Cash tax paid in the year was 415m 2017: 449m: 2016: 402m, which is different to the tax expense for the year set out above.
There are a number of reasons why the cash tax payments in a particular year will be different from the tax expense in the accounts: Deferred tax: Tax expense includes deferred tax, which is an accounting adjustment arising from temporary differences: Temporary differences occur when an item has to be included in the income statement in one year but is taxed in another year: and For the purposes of acquisition accounting only, the Group recognises deferred tax liabilities arising on intangible assets.
Any unwind of these deferred tax liabilities from the amortisation of intangible assets does not result in cash tax payments.
Timing differences: Tax payments relating to a particular years profits are typically due partly in the year and partly in the following year.
Prior period adjustments: Current tax expense is the best estimate at the end of the period of cash tax expected to be paid: and To the extent the final liability is higher or lower than that estimate, any cash tax impact will occur in a later period.
Items recorded in equity and other comprehensive income: Some of the benefits of tax deductions related to share based payments, pensions and hedging are credited to equity or other comprehensive income rather than to tax expense, and so the cash tax liability will be different to the current tax expense in the income statement in years when those deductions are available.
Set out below is a reconciliation of the difference between tax expense for the period and the theoretical expense calculated by multiplying accounting profit by the applicable tax rate.
We believe the most meaningful applicable rate is that obtained by multiplying the accounting profits and losses of all consolidated entities by the applicable domestic rate in each of those entities jurisdictions.
The net tax expense charged on profit before tax differs from the theoretical amount that would arise using the weighted average of tax rates applicable to accounting profits and losses of the consolidated entities, as follows: Restated Restated 2018 2017 2016 m % m % m % Profit before tax 1,720 1,721 1,459 Tax at average applicable rates 342 19.9% 389 22.6% 326 22.4% Tax effect of share of results of joint ventures 8 0.5 % 7 0.4 % 7 0.5 % Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 24 1.4% 15 0.9% 19 1.3% US state taxes 19 1.1% 18 1.0% 13 0.9% Non-deductible costs of share based remuneration 1 0.1% 1 0.1% 1 0.1% Non-deductible disposal-related gains and losses 0.0% 36 2.1% 8 0.5% Deferred tax assets of the period not recognised 24 1.4% 10 0.6% 2 0.1% Change in recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities 15 0.9% 16 0.9 % 33 2.3 % Other adjustments in respect of prior periods 13 0.8 % 35 2.1 % 28 1.9 % Exceptional tax credit 112 6.5 % 346 20.1 % 0.0% Tax expense 292 17.0% 65 3.8% 301 20.6% The weighted average applicable tax rate for the year was 19.9% 2017: 22.6%, 2016: 22.4%, reflecting the applicable rates in the countries where the Group operates.

140 RELX Annual report and financial statements 2018 | Financial statements and other information Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018 9 Taxation continued In the UK, a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 19% to 17% from April 2020 was enacted in September 2016.
In the US, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which included a reduction in the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% from January 2018 was enacted in December 2017.
In the Netherlands, a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 25% to 22.55% from 2020 and to 20.5% from 2021 was substantively enacted in December 2018.
In total, the deferred tax effect of changes in tax rates for the year was a tax credit of 8m 2017: 346m, 2016: 1m.
The effective tax rate of 17% 2017: 3.8%, 2016: 20.6% is lower than the weighted average applicable tax rate mainly because of an exceptional tax credit arising from the substantial resolution of certain prior year tax matters and the deferred tax effect of tax rate reductions in the Netherlands and the US.
In 2017, the exceptional tax credit related to a one-off non-cash credit from a deferred tax adjustment arising from the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
On the basis of their size and non-recurring nature, the exceptional tax credits have been excluded from adjusted earnings.

Other deferred tax assets include temporary differences in respect of share based remuneration provisions and financial instruments.
As a result of exemptions on dividends from subsidiaries and capital gains on disposal there are no significant taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and interests in joint arrangements.
Overview Business review Financial review Governance Financial statements and other information RELX Annual report and financial statements 2018 | Notes to the consolidated financial statements 141 9 Taxation continued Deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses and other deductible temporary differences have only been recognised to the extent that it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow the asset to be recovered.
Accordingly, no deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of unused trading losses and interest expenses of approximately 213m 2017: 143m carried forward at year end.
The deferred tax asset not recognised in respect of these losses and interest expenses is approximately 52m 2017: 34m.
Of the unrecognised losses and interest expenses, 93m 2017: 30m will expire if not utilised within ten years and 121m 2017: 113m will expire after more than ten years.
Deferred tax assets of approximately 4m 2017: 4m have not been recognised in respect of tax losses and other temporary differences carried forward of 24m 2017: 23m, which can only be used to offset future capital gains.

Overview Business review Financial review Governance Financial statements and other information RELX Annual report and financial statements 2018 | Notes to the consolidated financial statements 143 12 Acquisitions During the year, a number of acquisitions were made.
The net assets of the businesses acquired are incorporated at their fair value to the Group.

ThreatMetrixs technology analyses connections among devices, locations, anonymised identity information and threat intelligence, and combines this data with behavioural analytics to identify high-risk digital behaviour and transactions in real time.
The total consideration for this acquisition, net of cash acquired, was 585m, which represents the fair value of the consideration translated at the acquisition date foreign exchange rate.
The main assets and liabilities recognised on acquisition were 373m relating to goodwill, 279m relating to intangible assets, 41m relating to trade and other payables and 34m of net deferred tax liability.
These balances are included in the table above.
Goodwill, being the excess of the consideration over the net tangible and intangible assets acquired, represents benefits which do not qualify for recognition as intangible assets, including: the ability of a business to generate higher returns than individual assets: skilled workforces: and acquisition synergies that are specific to the Group.
In addition, goodwill arises on the recognition of deferred tax liabilities in respect of intangible assets for which amortisation does not qualify for tax deductions.
The fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired in the last 12 months are provisional pending the completion of the valuation exercises.
Final fair values will be incorporated in the 2019 consolidated financial statements.
There were no significant adjustments to the provisional fair values of prior year acquisitions established in 2017.
The businesses acquired in 2018 contributed 98m to revenue, increased adjusted operating profit by 7m, decreased net profit by 34m after charging 41m of integration costs and amortisation of acquired intangibles and contributed 4m to net cash outflow from operating activities for the part year under the Groups ownership and before taking account of acquisition financing costs.
Had the businesses been acquired at the beginning of the year, on a pro forma basis the Group revenues, adjusted operating profit and net profit attributable to RELX PLC shareholders for the year would have been 7,531m, 2,347m and 1,420m respectively, before taking account of acquisition financing costs.
Subsequent to the 31 December 2018, Reed Exhibitions acquired Mack Brooks.

The total cost of funding the proposed final dividend is expected to be 583m, for which no liability has been recognised at the statement of financial position date.

This waiver has been applied to dividends paid in 2018, 2017 and 2016.
14 Goodwill Accounting policy On the acquisition of a subsidiary or business, the purchase consideration is allocated between the net tangible and intangible assets on a fair value basis, with any excess purchase consideration representing goodwill.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions also includes amounts corresponding to deferred tax liabilities recognised in respect of acquired intangible assets.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment when there is an indicator that the asset may be impaired and at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary or business, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
At each statement of financial position date, the carrying amounts of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill are reviewed to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell, of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent, if any, of the impairment loss.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, value in use estimates are made based on the cash flows of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is any indication that the asset may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is estimated to be less than its net carrying amount, the net carrying amount of the asset or cash generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised immediately in the income statement in administration and other expenses.
Critical judgement and key source of estimation uncertainty The carrying amounts of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in each business are reviewed for impairment at least annually.
The carrying amounts of all other intangible assets are reviewed where there are indications of possible impairment.
An impairment review involves a comparison of the carrying value of the asset with estimated values in use based on the latest management cash flow projections, approved by the Board.
Key areas of judgement in estimating the values in use of businesses are the growth in cash flows over a forecast period of up to five years, the long-term growth rate assumed thereafter and the discount rate applied to the forecast cash flows.
A description of the key assumptions and sensitivities is provided below.

The carrying amount of goodwill is after cumulative amortisation of 1,222m 2017: 1,173m, which was charged prior to the adoption of IFRS, and 9m 2017: 9m of subsequent impairment charges recorded in prior years.
Overview Business review Financial review Governance Financial statements and other information RELX Annual report and financial statements 2018 | Notes to the consolidated financial statements 145 14 Goodwill continued Impairment review Impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets is performed at least annually in accordance with the methodology described above.
There were no charges for impairment of goodwill in 2018 2017: nil.
Goodwill is compiled and assessed among groups of cash generating units, which represent the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored by management.
Typically, acquisitions are integrated into existing business units, and the goodwill arising is allocated to the groups of cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition.
As the business areas have become increasingly integrated and globalised, the current CGU allocation reflects the global leverage of assets, skills, knowledge and technology platforms, and the monitoring of goodwill by management.

Nominal long-term market growth rates, which are applied after the forecast period of up to five years, do not exceed the long-term average growth prospects for the sectors and territories in which the businesses operate.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed based on changes in key assumptions considered to be reasonably possible by management: an increase in the discount rate of 0.5%, a decrease in the compound annual growth rate for cash flow in the five-year forecast period of 2.0%, and a decrease in the nominal long-term market growth rates of 0.5%.
The sensitivity analysis shows that no impairment charges would result from these scenarios.
146 RELX Annual report and financial statements 2018 | Financial statements and other information Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018 15 Intangible assets Accounting policy Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are stated in the statement of financial position at their fair value as at the date of acquisition, less accumulated amortisation.
Internally generated intangible assets are stated in the statement of financial position at the directly attributable cost of creation of the asset, less accumulated amortisation.
Intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations comprise: market-related assets e. g. trademarks, imprints, brands : customer-related assets e. g. subscription bases, customer lists, customer relationships : editorial content: software and systems e. g. application infrastructure, product delivery platforms, in-process research and development : contract-based assets e. g. publishing rights, exhibition rights, supply contracts : and other intangible assets.
Internally generated intangible assets typically comprise software and systems development where an identifiable asset is created that is probable to generate future economic benefits.
Intangible assets, other than journal titles determined to have indefinite lives, are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
The estimated useful lives of intangible assets with finite lives are as follows: market and customer-related assets 3 to 40 years: content, software and other acquired intangible assets 3 to 20 years: and internally developed intangible assets 3 to 10 years.
Journal titles determined to have indefinite lives are not amortised and are subject to impairment review at least annually, including a review of events and circumstances to ensure that they continue to support an indefinite useful life.
Critical judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty On acquisition of a subsidiary or business, the purchase consideration is allocated between the net tangible and intangible assets other than goodwill on a fair value basis, with any excess purchase consideration representing goodwill.
The valuation of acquired intangible assets represents the estimated economic value in use, using standard valuation methodologies, including as appropriate, discounted cash flow, relief from royalty and comparable market transactions.
Acquired intangible assets are capitalised and amortised systematically over their estimated useful lives, subject to impairment review.
The assumptions used are subject to management judgement.
Appropriate amortisation periods are selected based on assessments of the longevity of the brands and imprints, the strength and stability of customer relationships, the market positions of the acquired assets and the technological and competitive risks that they face.
Certain intangible assets in relation to acquired science and medical publishing businesses have been determined to have indefinite lives.
The longevity of these assets is evidenced by their long-established and well-regarded journal titles, and their characteristically stable market positions.
Development spend encompasses investment in new products and other initiatives, ranging from the building of online delivery platforms, to launch costs of new services, to building new infrastructure and applications.
Launch costs and other ongoing operating expenses of new products and services are expensed as incurred.
The costs of building product applications, platforms and infrastructure are capitalised as intangible assets, where the investment they represent has demonstrable value and the technical and commercial feasibility is assured.
Costs eligible for capitalisation must be incremental, clearly identified and directly attributable to a particular project.
The resulting assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives.
Impairment reviews are carried out at least annually where indicators of impairment are identified.
Judgement is required in the assessment of the potential value of a development project, the identification of costs eligible for capitalisation and the selection of appropriate asset lives.

150 RELX Annual report and financial statements 2018 | Financial statements and other information Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018 18 Financial instruments Accounting policy Financial instruments comprise investments other than investments in joint ventures or associates, trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, payables and accruals, borrowings and derivative financial instruments.
Investments other than investments in joint ventures and associates are described in note 16.
The fair value of such investments is based on standard valuation techniques, including market comparisons and discounts of future cash flows, having regard to maximising the use of observable inputs and adjusting for risk.
These investments are typically classified as either Level 2 or 3 in the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy.
Trade receivables are carried in the statement of financial position at invoiced value less allowance for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Irrecoverable amounts are estimated based on the ageing of trade receivables, experience and circumstance.
Borrowings and payables are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost other than fixed rate borrowings in designated hedging relationships for which the carrying amount of the hedged portion of the borrowings is subsequently adjusted for the gain or loss attributable to the hedged risk.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge interest rate and foreign exchange risks.
Where an effective hedge is in place against changes in the fair value of fixed rate borrowings, the hedged borrowings are adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged with a corresponding income or expense included in the income statement within finance costs.
The offsetting gains or losses from remeasuring the fair value of the related derivatives are also recognised in the income statement within finance costs.
When the related derivative expires, is sold or terminated, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged borrowing is amortised in the income statement over the period to maturity of the borrowing using the effective interest method.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised net of tax in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedge reserve.
With effect from 1 January 2018, the fair value amounts relating to foreign currency basis spreads are recorded in a separate component of equity in the cost of hedging reserve.
If a hedged firm commitment or forecasted transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, then, at the time that the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in the hedge reserve are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit or loss.
Any ineffective portion of hedges is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued when a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in other comprehensive income is either retained in the hedge reserve until the firm commitment or forecasted transaction occurs, or, where a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, is immediately credited or expensed in the income statement.
Derivative financial instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in the statement of financial position at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
The fair values of derivative financial instruments represent the replacement costs calculated using observable market rates of interest and exchange.
The fair value of long-term borrowings is calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at observable market rates.
These instruments are accordingly classified as Level 2 in the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy.
The main financial risks faced by the Group are liquidity risk, market risk comprising interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk and credit risk.
Financial instruments are used to finance the Group's businesses and to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risks.
The Groups businesses do not enter into speculative derivative transactions.
Details of financial instruments subject to liquidity, market and credit risks are described below.
Liquidity risk The Group maintains a range of borrowing facilities and debt programmes to fund its requirements at competitive rates.
The balance of long-term debt, short-term debt and committed bank facilities is managed to provide security of funding, taking into account the cash generation cycle of the business and the uncertain size and timing of acquisition spend.
To accommodate the significant free cash flow generated by the Group and to capitalise on an inexpensive source of funding, a meaningful portion of the overall debt portfolio is typically kept short-term as long as there exists acceptable liquidity in the commercial paper markets and sufficient capacity under committed credit lines.
The Group's treasury policies ensure adequate liquidity by requiring that a no more than $1.5bn of term debt matures in any 12-month period, b the sum of term debt maturing over the ensuing 12 months plus short-term borrowings is less than the sum of available cash plus committed facilities and c minimum levels of borrowing with maturities over three and five years are maintained.
The treasury policies ensure debt efficiency by a targeting certain levels of short-term borrowings across a given year, b maintaining a weighted average maturity of the gross debt portfolio of approximately five years and c minimising surplus cash balances.
From time to time, based on cash flow and market conditions, the Group may redeem term debt early or repurchase outstanding debt in the open market.
Overview Business review Financial review Governance Financial statements and other information RELX Annual report and financial statements 2018 | Notes to the consolidated financial statements 151 18 Financial instruments continued Debt is issued to meet the funding requirements of various jurisdictions and in the currencies that are needed.
It is recognised that debt can act as a natural translation hedge of earnings, net assets and net cash flow in currencies other than the reporting currency.
For this reason, the majority of the Groups net debt is denominated in US dollars and euros, reflecting the Groups largest geographical markets.
There were no changes to the Groups long-term approach to capital and liquidity management during the year.
The remaining contractual maturities for borrowings and derivative financial instruments are shown in the table below.
The table shows undiscounted principal and interest cash flows and includes contractual gross cash flows to be exchanged as part of cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts where there is a legal right of set-off.

152 RELX Annual report and financial statements 2018 | Financial statements and other information Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018 18 Financial instruments continued At 31 December 2018, the Group had access to a $3,000m committed bank facility, consisting of a $1,750m tranche maturing in July 2023 and a $1,250m tranche maturing in July 2021, which was undrawn.
This facility backs up short-term borrowings.
All borrowings that mature within the next two years can be covered by the facility and by utilising available cash resources.
The committed bank facility is subject to a financial covenant typical to the Groups size and financial strength.
The Group had significant headroom within this covenant for the year ended 31 December 2018.
There are no financial covenants in any outstanding public bonds.
Market risk The Groups primary market risks are interest rate fluctuations and exchange rate movements.
Derivatives are used to manage the risks associated with interest rate and exchange rate movements and the Group does not enter into speculative derivatives.
Where the impact of derivatives on the income statement and the statement of financial position could be significant, hedge accounting is applied subject to satisfying the required criteria as described in Hedge accounting below.
Derivatives used by the Group for hedging a particular risk are not specialised and are generally available from numerous sources.
The impact of market risks on net postemployment benefit obligations and taxation is excluded from the following market risk sensitivity analysis.
Interest rate exposure management The Groups interest rate exposure management policy aims to minimise interest costs with an acceptable level of year on year volatility.
To achieve this, the Group uses fixed rate term debt and interest rate swaps to give a target mix of fixed rate and floating rate borrowings.
Interest rate derivatives are used only to hedge an underlying risk and no net market positions are held.
At 31 December 2018, 45% of gross bank and bond borrowings were at fixed rate.
A 100 basis point reduction in interest rates would result in an estimated decrease in net finance costs of 32m 2017: 26m, based on the composition of financial instruments including cash, cash equivalents, bank loans and commercial paper borrowings at 31 December 2018.
A 100 basis point rise in interest rates would result in an estimated increase in net finance costs of 32m 2017: 26m.
The impact on net equity of a theoretical change in interest rates as at 31 December 2018 is restricted to the change in carrying value of floating rate to fixed rate interest rate derivatives in a designated cash flow hedge relationship and undesignated interest rate derivatives.
A 100 basis point reduction in interest rates would result in an estimated increase in net equity of 1m 2017: 2m and a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would reduce net equity by an estimated 1m 2017: 2m.
The impact of a change in interest rates on the carrying value of fixed rate borrowings in a designated fair value hedge relationship would be offset by the change in carrying value of the related interest rate derivative.
Fixed rate borrowings not in a designated hedging relationship are carried at amortised cost.
Foreign currency exposure management Translation exposures arise on the earnings and net assets of individual businesses whose operational currencies are other than sterling.
Some of these exposures are offset by denominating borrowings in US dollars, euros and other currencies.
Currency exposures on transactions denominated in a foreign currency are generally hedged using forward contracts.
In addition, recurring transactions and future investment exposures may be hedged, in advance of becoming contractual.
The precise policy differs according to the specific circumstances of the individual businesses.
Highly predictable future cash flows may be covered for transactions expected to occur during the next 24 months 50 months for the Scientific, Technical & Medical subscription businesses within limits defined according to the period before the transaction is expected to become contractual.
Cover takes the form of foreign exchange forward contracts.
Further information is provided in Cash flow hedges below.
A theoretical weakening of all currencies by 10% against sterling at 31 December 2018 would decrease the carrying value of net assets, excluding net borrowings, by 782m 2017: 650m.
This would be offset to a degree by a decrease in net borrowings of 625m 2017: 473m.
A strengthening of all currencies by 10% against sterling at 31 December 2018 would increase the carrying value of net assets, excluding net borrowings, by 782m 2017: 650m and increase net borrowings by 625m 2017: 473m.
A retranslation of the Group's net profit for the year, assuming a 10% weakening of all foreign currencies against sterling but excluding transactional exposures, would reduce net profit by 127m 2017: 147m.
A 10% strengthening of all foreign currencies against sterling on this basis would increase net profit for the year by 127m 2017: 147m.
Overview Business review Financial review Governance Financial statements and other information RELX Annual report and financial statements 2018 | Notes to the consolidated financial statements 153 18 Financial instruments continued Credit risk The Group seeks to manage interest rate risk and limit foreign exchange risks described above by the use of financial instruments and as a result has a credit risk from the potential non-performance by the counterparties to these financial instruments, which are unsecured.
The amount of this credit risk is normally restricted to the amounts of any hedge gain and not the principal amount being hedged.
The Group also has a credit exposure to counterparties for the full principal amount of cash and cash equivalents.
Credit risks are controlled by monitoring the credit quality of these counterparties, principally licensed commercial banks and investment banks with strong long-term credit ratings, and the amounts outstanding with each of them.
The Group has treasury policies in place which do not allow concentrations of risk with individual counterparties and do not allow significant treasury exposures with counterparties which are rated lower than AA3 by Standard & Poors, Moodys and Fitch.
At 31 December 2018, cash and cash equivalents totalled 114m 2017: 111m, of which 93% 2017: 90% was held with banks rated AA3 or better.
The Group also has credit risk with respect to trade receivables due from its customers, which include national and state governments, academic institutions and large and small enterprises including law firms, book stores and wholesalers.
The concentration of credit risk from trade receivables is limited due to the large and broad customer base.
Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the business units where they arise.
Where appropriate, business units seek to minimise this exposure by taking payment in advance and through management of credit terms.
Allowance is made for bad and doubtful debts based on managements assessment of the risk taking into account the ageing profile, experience and circumstance.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, recorded in the statement of financial position.
Included within trade receivables are the following amounts which are past due, before considering loss allowance: past due up to one month 181m 2017: 220m : past due two to three months 93m 2017: 97m : past due four to six months 37m 2017: 44m : and past due greater than six months 35m 2017: 40m.
Hedge accounting The hedging relationships that are designated under IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with effect from 1 January 2018, and or that were previously designated under IAS 39 Financial Instruments are described below.
Fair value hedges The Group has entered into interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed rate borrowings due to interest rate and foreign currency movements which could affect the income statement.
The table below details the designated fair value hedge relationships that were in place at 31 December 2018, swapping fixed rate term debt issues denominated in US dollars USD and euros to floating rate USD and euro debt respectively for the whole or part of their term, together with the related fixed and floating rates.

The related derivatives were closed out on fide-designation with a cash inflow of 62m.
3m 2017: 3m of these fair value adjustments were amortised in the year as a reduction to finance costs.
Cash flow hedges As part of the Groups interest rate exposure management, it has entered into certain cross-currency interest rate derivatives, individual components of which have been accounted for as cash flow hedges with the remaining components accounted for as fair value hedges, as described above.
These comprised the following: 1 Interest rate derivatives which swapped a fixed rate CHF 275m bond, issued in June 2013 and maturing in December 2018, to floating rate USD debt for the whole of its term.
The component relating to the swap of fixed rate CHF coupons to fixed rate USD cash flows was accounted for as a cash flow hedge under IAS 39 and was fide-designated on 31 December 2017.
The gains which had accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve up to the date of fide-designation were reclassified to the income statement as part of finance costs during 2018.
2 Interest rate derivatives which swapped a fixed rate 600m bond, issued in May 2015 and maturing in May 2025, to floating rate USD debt for the whole of its term.
The component relating to the swap of floating rate euro cash flows to floating rate USD cash flows including credit margin was accounted for as a cash flow hedge under IAS 39 up to 31 December 2017.
From 1 January 2018 the component relating to the swap of the euro credit margin to USD is being accounted for a cash flow hedge under IFRS 9, with the amount associated with foreign currency basis spreads recorded in the cost of hedging reserve.
As part of the Groups foreign currency exposure management, it has entered into forward foreign exchange contracts which fix the exchange rate on a portion of future foreign currency subscription revenues forecast by the businesses for up to 50 months.
These have been accounted for as cash flow hedges under IAS 39 and under IFRS 9 of the forecast foreign currency revenues, with gains and losses on the forward contracts deferred in the hedge reserve until the related revenue is recognised, at which time the accumulated gains and losses are reclassified to the income statement.
Movements in the hedge reserve in 2017 and 2018 and, with effect from 1 January 2018, the cost of hedging reserve, including gains and losses on cash flow hedging instruments, were as follows: Foreign Cost of currency Interest rate hedging hedge hedge reserve reserve reserve Total m m m m Hedge reserve at 1 January 2017: gains losses deferred 8 169 161 Gains arising in 2017 63 74 137 Amounts recognised in income statement 65 90 25 Exchange translation differences 1 2 3 Hedge reserve at 31 December 2017: gains losses deferred 5 7 2 Reclassification on 1 January 2018 1 1 Losses arising in 2018 8 51 59 Amounts recognised in income statement 3 20 17 Exchange translation differences Hedge reserve at 31 December 2018: gains losses deferred 1 7 38 44 All cash flow hedges were highly effective throughout the two years ended 31 December 2018.
A deferred tax credit of 8m 2017: charge of 1m in respect of the above gains and losses at 31 December 2018 was also deferred in the hedge reserve.
Of the amounts recognised in the income statement in the year, losses of 20m 2017: 90m were recognised in revenue, and gains of 3m 2017: 65m were recognised in finance costs.
A tax credit of 3m 2017: 1m was recognised in relation to these items.
The deferred gains and losses on foreign currency cash flow hedges at 31 December 2018 are currently expected to be recognised in the income statement in future years as shown in the table below, together with the principal amount of hedges relating to each year and their total carrying values included within derivative assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position: Foreign Principal currency amount of Carrying hedge reserve hedges values m m m 2019 14 481 20 2020 13 486 13 2021 10 228 10 2022 1 64 1 Total 38 1,259 44 The cash flows for these hedges are expected to occur in line with the recognition of the gains and losses in the income statement, or in the preceding year.

23 Lease arrangements Accounting policy All leases where RELX is the lessee with the exception of short-term and low-value leases are recognised in the statement of financial position.
A lease liability is recognised based on the present value of the future lease payments, and a corresponding right-of-use asset is recognised.
The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the asset.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and a reduction of the lease liability.
Low-value items and short-term leases with a term of 12 months or less are not required to be recognised on the balance sheet and payments made in relation to these leases are recognised on a straight-line basis in the income statement.
The leases held by the Group can be split into two categories: property and non-property.
The Group leases various properties, principally offices, which have varying terms and renewal rights that are typical to the territory in which they are located.
Non-property includes all other leases, such as cars and printers.

RELX subleases vacant space available within its leased properties.
