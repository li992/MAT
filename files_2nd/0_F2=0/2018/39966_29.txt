The total tax charge for the year differs from the expected tax using a weighted average tax rate which reflects the applicable statutory corporate tax rates on the accounting profits losses in the countries in which the Group operates.
The differences are explained in the following aggregated reconciliation of the income tax expense: 2017 2018 Restated m % m % Profit loss before tax 28.5 54.7 Expected tax charge credit 8.8 30.9 2.6 4.8 Factors affecting the income tax expense for the year: - expenses not deductible for tax purposes 3.5 12.3 3.9 7.1 - non-taxable income 3.7 13.0 1.8 3.3 - impairment and disposal charges not deductible for tax purposes 2.7 9.5 9.1 16.6 - losses arising in the year not recognised for deferred tax purposes 0.5 0.9 release of deferred tax asset no longer recognised 0.3 1.1 losses utilised not previously recognised for deferred tax purposes 0.6 2.1 - other adjustments in respect of previous years 0.2 0.7 6.2 11.3 - tax on branch profits 0.1 0.4 0.6 1.1 - effect of change in rate on deferred tax 0.3 1.1 1.0 1.8 Total income tax expense 10.6 37.2 4.5 8.2 The majority of the Groups expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes are primarily in relation to the divestments of businesses, impairments of property and non-deductible interest payments.

136 SIG plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2018 FINANCIALS FINANCIALS The effective tax rate for the Group on the total profit before tax of 28.5m is 37.2% 2017: negative 8.2%.
The effective tax charge for the Group on profit before tax before Other items of 75.3m is 26.3% 2017: 25.5%, which comprises a tax charge of 26.6% 2017: 27.5% in respect of current year profits and a tax credit of 0.3% 2016: 2.0% in respect of prior years.
Factors affecting the Group's future total tax charge as a percentage of underlying profits are: - the mix of profits and losses between the tax jurisdictions in which the Group operates: in particular the tax rates in France, Germany and Belgium are relatively high when compared to the Group's underlying effective rate: - the impact of non-deductible expenditure and non-taxable income: - agreement of open tax computations with the respective tax authorities: and - the recognition or utilisation with corresponding reduction in cash tax payments of unrecognised deferred tax assets see Note 23.
On 26 October 2017, the European Commission EC announced an investigation into the UKs controlled foreign company CFC rules.
The UKs CFC rules provide an exemption for 75% of the CFC charge where the CFC is carrying out financing activities.
The EC is investigating whether the UKs exemption is in breach of EU State Aid rules.
This exemption has been claimed by SIG and the Group is monitoring developments in relation to the ECs investigation.
The Group does not currently consider that a provision against the potential liability is required.
In addition to the amounts charged to the Consolidated Income Statement, the following amounts in relation to taxes have been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income with the exception of deferred tax on share options which has been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.

b Management Incentive Plan MIP On 16 May 2018 the Management Incentive Plan MIP was approved.
Under this Plan, senior leadership and wider leadership team members can be awarded an annual grant of restricted and deferred share options up to a certain percentage of base salary.
Restricted share options have no performance conditions other than the employee remaining in employment for the three year vesting period.
The deferred share options are formally granted 12 months after the granting of the restricted share options, with the number of options granted based on the achievement of certain performance criteria for the relevant financial year.
The deferred share options vest after a further two years provided the employee remains in employment.
The vesting period for both options is considered to be the three years from the granting of the restricted share options as this is the date on which both parties have a shared understanding of the terms and conditions of the arrangement.
There were 1,529,155 awards of restricted and deferred shares in 2018.

c Share Incentive Plan SIP The SIP is offered to UK employees.
The SIP is a HM Revenue & Customs approved scheme and operates by inviting participants, including Executive Directors, to purchase shares in the Company in a tax efficient manner on a monthly basis.
The Company gives one matching share for each share purchased by the employee up to a maximum of 20 each month.
No performance criteria are attached to these matching shares, other than to avoid forfeiture the participants must remain within the plan for a minimum of two years.
In 2018, 69,619 2017: 138,366 matching shares were granted during the year.
Given the nature of the scheme, the fair value of the matching shares equates to the cost of the Company acquiring these shares.

com Stock code: SHI 145 Notes to the Financial Statements Summary analysis The recoverable amounts of goodwill in respect of all CGUs are fully supported by the value in use calculations in the year and are as follows: 2018 2017 m m UK Distribution 91.3 97.5 UK Exteriors 68.2 68.2 Building Solutions 11.0 12.7 Larivire 72.1 71.5 France 10.7 10.6 Germany 2.9 3.3 Poland 1.2 1.2 Air Handling 22.3 22.1 Benelux 14.2 14.1 Other CGUs 11.0 Total goodwill 293.9 312.2 Impairment review process The Group tests goodwill and the associated intangible assets and property, plant and equipment of CGUs annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that an impairment may be required.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for these calculations are those regarding discount rates, sales and operating profit growth rates.
These assumptions have been revised in the year in light of the current economic environment.
The directors estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money for the Group.
In respect of the other assumptions, external data and management's best estimates are applied.
For all the CGUs, the Group performs goodwill impairment reviews by forecasting cash flows based upon the following year's budget, which anticipates sales growth, and a projection of sales and cash flows based upon industry growth expectations 0%-2.9% over a further period of four years.
Where detailed five-year forecasts for a CGU have been prepared and approved by the Board, which can include higher growth rates or varied results reflecting specific economic factors, these are used in preparing cash flow forecasts for impairment review purposes.
The forecasts used in the annual impairment reviews have been prepared taking into account current economic conditions.
After this period, the sales growth rates applied to the cash flow forecasts are no more than 1% and operating profit growth no more than 2.5% in perpetuity.
Long-term operating profit Post-tax discount growth rate % rate % UK 2.0 9.8 France 1.9 8.4 Germany 2.0 7.8 Poland 2.5 10.3 Air Handling 2.1 8.5 Benelux 2.1 8.5 2018 impairment review results In the prior year, a goodwill impairment charge of 1.0m was recognised in relation to the wind down of the Metechno business and 5.0m was recognised in relation to the post year end disposal of the GRM and IBSL businesses.
The results of the 2018 impairment review indicate that the carrying values of all ongoing CGUs remain supportable.
146 SIG plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2018 FINANCIALS FINANCIALS Sensitivity analysis A number of reasonably possible sensitivities have been performed on the Group's CGUs to highlight the changes in market conditions that would lead to the value in use equalling the carrying value.
For the more sensitive CGUs, the table below sets out the amount that the assumption would have to change by for there to be no headroom.
The results are as follows: 2018 Like-for-like market Long-term operating volume average % per profit growth rate annum Discount rate % Gross margin % average % per annum Headroom Assumption Sensitivity Assumption Sensitivity Assumption Sensitivity Assumption Sensitivity UK Distribution 175.8m 2.0 11.7 9.8 9.4 25.1 2.4 2.0 18.3 UK Exteriors 48.5m 0.2 5.9 9.8 3.6 29.6 1.5 2.0 5.3 Building Solutions 26.2m 14.5 15.0 9.8 8.6 28.7 3.6 2.0 15.8 Larivire 39.5m 1.7 4.1 8.4 2.0 24.9 0.8 1.9 2.7 Germany 43.4m 2.7 3.2 7.8 5.3 28.0 0.8 2.0 7.8 2017 Long-term operating profit Like-for-like market volume growth rate average % per average % per annum Discount rate % Gross margin % annum Headroom Assumption Sensitivity Assumption Sensitivity Assumption Sensitivity Assumption Sensitivity UK Distribution 22.8m 0.2 1.4 9.2 1.2 24.0 0.3 1.8 1.1 UK Exteriors 88.6m 1.8 9.2 9.2 6.6 29.5 2.3 1.8 6.3 Building Solutions 6.3m 2.6 3.2 9.2 2.3 29.9 0.8 1.8 2.2 Larivire 9.3m 0.9 1.1 8.7 0.5 23.4 0.2 1.4 0.7 Germany 20.3m 0.9 1.8 8.1 2.5 26.8 0.4 1.4 2.4 Poland PLN 20.3m 1.9 10.7 4.4 19.4 0.3 3.4 4.2 The sensitivities noted above are the amounts by which the related assumption would have to vary before an impairment is indicated.
"Gross margin is the key assumption in the forecasts used in the goodwill impairment reviews, and therefore a 50bps reduction in gross margin has been determined as a reasonably possible change for the purposes of the disclosure requirements of IAS 36 ""Impairment of assets""."
If a 50bps reduction in gross margin were to arise from that forecast in the goodwill impairment reviews, no impairments would arise.
If this was combined with a 200bps reduction in sales, the Larivire CGU would show an impairment of 3.6m.
Brexit uncertainty has resolved the Construction Products Association CPA to downgrade its UK construction output forecast from growth of 2.3% in autumn 2018 to 0.3%, driven largely by a decline in the commercial sector, partially offset by continued growth in private housing construction.
As such, a decline in trading profit per annum of 2% was modelled across the UK and Ireland CGUs and this showed no impairment across the Group.
The extent to which these risks materialise will depend on the nature of the eventual Brexit deal and it is considered that there is sufficient headroom in the UK businesses to cover the increased risk and uncertainty from Brexit.
For further details on the considerations of Brexit on the business see page 45.
The Board has actively reviewed the forecasts associated with the CGUs noting the conservative assumptions used, the continued pattern of strong results in challenging economic environments in which they operate, and is satisfied that no impairments are necessary.

Included within prepayments and accrued income is 59.3m 2017: 55.2m due in relation to supplier rebates where there is no right to offset against trade payable balances.
The remainder of the balance relates to prepayments.
Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are generally on terms of 30 to 90 days.
The average credit period on sale of goods and services for underlying operations on a constant currency basis is 44 days 2017: 39 days.

The expected loss rates have been assessed by each operating segment and are based on the payment profiles of sales over a period prior to 31 December 2018, the availability of credit insurance and the historical credit losses experiences within this period.
The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables and any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date and makes a provision for impairment accordingly.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
The directors therefore believe that no further credit provision is required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.

Transfer of trade receivables The Group sold without recourse trade receivables to banks and other financial institutions for cash proceeds.
These trade receivables of 49.7m 2017: 48.7m have been derecognised from the Consolidated Balance Sheet, because the Group has transferred the risks and rewards.
Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations, resulting in financial loss to the Group.
Trade receivable credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are set, reviewed and approved by operational management on a regular basis.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of typically small to medium-sized customers, spread across a number of different market sectors and geographical areas.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and, where appropriate, credit guarantee insurance cover is purchased.

The private placement debt in the table above is valued before application of the cross-currency swaps associated with the US Dollar denominated debt but after application of the interest rate swap associated with the Sterling denominated private placement debt, and therefore differs from the value of private placement debt of 183.8m as disclosed in Note 19 Financial assets and financial liabilities.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of non-current liabilities approximates to their fair value, with the exception of the private placements notes, the fair value of which is disclosed in Note 19 on page 155.
Financial assets and financial liabilities The Group's principal financial liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise loans and borrowings and trade and other payables.
The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Group's operations.
The Group's principal financial assets include trade receivables, deferred consideration and cash and cash equivalents that derive directly from its operations.
The Group is exposed to credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate and foreign currency risk.
The Group Board oversees the management of these risks.
The Board manages the risks through implementation of the Group Treasury Policy, supported by the Group Tax and Treasury Committee, which monitors and reviews the activities of the Group Treasury Function to ensure they are performed in accordance with the policy and reports to the Group Board on a regular basis.
"The ""Treasury risk management"" section of the Financial Review on pages 37 and 38 includes a review of all treasury, liquidity, interest rate and foreign currency risks, and provides an explanation of the role that derivative financial instruments have had during the year in creating or changing the risks the Group faces in its activities."
The capital structure of the Group is outlined in the Financial Review on page 37. Credit risk is discussed further in Note 16. www.

The interest received on cash deposits is at variable rates of interest of up to 1.5% 2017: 1.6%.
The directors consider that the fair values of cash at bank and on hand, trade receivables and deferred consideration approximate their carrying value, largely due to the short term maturities of these instruments.
All of the deferred consideration relates to vendor loan notes in connection with the sale of businesses in 2017 and 2018 Note 11.
The fair value is not significantly different to the carrying amount.
The Group's credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.

These amount to an asset of 20.9m and a liability of 26.6m.
The fair value of these derivatives was a net liability of 3.5m which is included in the Sterling value of other borrowings in the table above.
The Groups net debt at 31 December 2018 was 189.4m and, after taking account of these cross-currency derivatives, the Group had net Euro financial liabilities of 159.1m.
Of the above finance lease contracts, 10.3m 2017: 9.9m, are secured on the underlying assets.
The directors consider the fair value of the Group's floating rate financial liabilities to materially approximate to the book value shown in the table above.
The fair value of the Group's private placement notes at 31 December 2018 is estimated to be 217.3m 2017: c. 240m and is classified as a Level 2 fair value measurement for disclosure purposes.

These amounted to an asset of 20.9m and a liability of 26.6m.
The fair value of these derivatives was a liability of 2.7m which is included in the Sterling value of other borrowings in the table above.
The Groups net debt at 31 December 2017 was 258.7m and, after taking account of these cross-currency derivatives, the Group had net Euro financial liabilities of 142.1m.
In both 2018 and 2017, the interest rate on floating rate financial liabilities is based upon appropriate local market rates.
com Stock code: SHI 155 Notes to the Financial Statements c Hedging activities and derivatives The Group is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations.
The primary risks managed using derivative instruments are foreign currency risk and interest rate risk.
The Group's risk management strategy and how it is applied to manage risk is explained in the 'Management of treasury risks' section of the Financial review.
The Group does not trade in derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Where derivatives meet the hedge accounting criteria under the rules of IFRS 9, movements in the fair values of these derivative financial instruments for cash flow and net investment hedges are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Where the criteria for hedge accounting are not met, they are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss.
They are presented as current assets or liabilities to the extent they are expected to be settled within 12 months after the end of the reporting period.
In order to manage the Group's exposure to interest rate and exchange rate changes, the Group utilises both currency and interest rate derivative financial instruments.
The fair values of these derivative financial instruments are calculated by discounting the associated future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
The Group is required to analyse financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: - Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
- Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All of the financial instruments below are categorised as Level 2. i Net investment hedges The Group has investments in Euro-denominated subsidiaries.
As at 31 December 2018 the Group held two 31 December 2017: two cross-currency derivative financial instruments which receive fixed 20.9m and pay fixed 26.6m.
These derivative financial instruments were designated as the hedging instruments in the net investment hedge of the Groups Euro-denominated net assets.
Fair value changes on those derivatives are recognised in other comprehensive income hedging and translation reserve to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in the subsidiaries.
At 31 December 2018 the Group also held 185.0m 2017: 181.0m of direct Euro-denominated debt through its revolving credit facility and bilateral private placement debt.
This borrowing is being used to hedge the Group's exposure to the Euro foreign exchange risk on investments in Euro-denominated subsidiaries.
Gains or losses on retranslation of the borrowing are transferred to other comprehensive income to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in the subsidiaries.
There is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instruments as the net investment in Euro-denominated assets creates a translation risk that will match the foreign exchange risk on the Euro-denominated debt.
The Group has established a hedge ratio of 1:1 as the underlying risk of the hedging instrument is identical to the hedged risk component.
Hedge ineffectiveness will arise when the amount of the investment in Euro-denominated subsidiaries becomes lower than the amount of the cross-currency derivative.
The impact of the hedging instruments on the statement of financial position is as follows: Change in fair value used for measuring Notional Carrying Line item in the statement of ineffectiveness for the amount amount financial position period m m m At 31 December 2018 Cross-currency swap 26.6 3.5 Derivative financial instruments 0.8 Foreign currency denominated borrowing 181.0 162.5 Private placement notes 1.6 4.0 3.6 Bank loans Foreign currency denominated borrowing At 31 December 2017 Cross-currency swap 26.6 2.7 Derivative financial instruments 0.6 Foreign currency denominated borrowing 181.0 160.9 Private placement notes 6.5 Foreign currency denominated borrowing Bank loans 1.8 156 SIG plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2018 FINANCIALS FINANCIALS The impact of the hedged item on the Statement of Financial Position is as follows: 31 December 2018 31 December 2017 Change in fair value Hedging and Hedging and Change in fair value used for measuring translation Cost of hedging translation Cost of hedging used for measuring ineffectiveness reserve reserve reserve reserve ineffectiveness m m m m m m Net investment in foreign subsidiaries 2.4 2.0 8.9 7.4 The hedging gain recognised in OCI before tax is equal to the change in fair value used for measuring effectiveness.
There is no ineffectiveness recognised in profit or loss.

The cash flow hedges described below are expected to impact upon both profit and loss and cash flow annually over the life of the hedging instrument and the related debt as interest falls due, and upon maturity of the debt and related hedging instrument.
Foreign currency risk The Group faces a translation risk from the US Dollar in respect of interest on its private placement borrowings.
As at 31 December 2018, the Group held two 31 December 2017: two cross-currency derivative financial instruments which swap fixed US Dollar-denominated debt held in the UK into fixed Sterling-denominated debt.
These derivative financial instruments form a cash flow hedge as they fix the functional currency cash flows of the Group.
These derivative financial instruments are designated and effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value movement has therefore been deferred in equity via the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
At 31 December 2018, the weighted average maturity date of these swaps is 7.6 years 2017: 8.6 years.

The Group also uses foreign exchange forward contracts to manage the exposures arising from cross-currency transactions.
At 31 December 2018 the Group held a number of short term forward contracts designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedges of forecast purchases in Euros.
The forecast transactions are highly probable.
Foreign exchange forward contract balances vary with the level of expected foreign currency transactions and changes in foreign exchange forward rates.
Included within current assets are derivative financial instruments of nil 2017: 0.1m relating to forward foreign exchange contracts.
Interest rate risk The Group has floating rate debt and its interest rate costs will increase in the event of rising interest rates.
As at 31 December 2018, the Group held one 31 December 2017: two interest rate derivative financial instrument which swaps variable rate debt into fixed rate debt thereby fixing the functional currency cash flows of the Group.
This interest rate derivative financial instrument is designated and effective as a cash flow hedge and the fair value movement has therefore been deferred in equity via the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
At 31 December 2018, the weighted average maturity date of these swaps is 1.6 years 2017: 2.1 years.
2018 2017 Hedge of the Group's interest cash flows m m Liability at 1 January 0.8 1.5 Fair value gains losses recognised in equity 0.5 0.7 Liability at 31 December 0.3 0.8 www.
com Stock code: SHI 157 Notes to the Financial Statements There is an economic relationship between the hedged items and hedging instruments as the terms of the cross-currency and interest rate swaps match the terms of the debt i. e. notional amount, maturity and payment dates and the terms of the foreign exchange forward contracts match the terms of the highly probably forecast transactions i. e. notional amount and expected payment date.
The Group has established a hedge ratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships as the underlying risk of the cross-currency swaps, interest rate swap and foreign exchange forward contracts are identical to the hedged risk components.
To test the hedge effectiveness, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method and compares the changes in fair value of the hedging instruments against the changes in fair value of the hedged items attributable to the hedged risks.
Hedge ineffectiveness can arise from differences in the timing of the cash flows of the hedged items and the hedging instruments: the counterparties' credit risk differently impacting the fair value movements of the hedging instruments and hedge items: and changes to the forecasted amount of cash flows of hedged items and hedging instruments.

iii Fair value hedges The Group does not have any fair value hedges at 31 December 2018.
At 31 December 2017, the Group held one derivative financial instrument, which was used to hedge against changes in the fair value of the fixed interest private placement notes drawn down on 1 February 2007 attributable to movements in market interest rates.
This interest rate derivative financial instrument was designated and effective as a fair value hedge and the fair value movement was therefore recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
There was an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument as the terms of the interest rate swap matched the terms of the fixed rate loan notional amount, maturity and payment dates.
To test the hedge effectiveness, the Group used the hypothetical derivative method and compared the changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument against the changes in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.
Hedge ineffectiveness could arise from different interest rate curve applied to discount the hedged item and hedging instrument: differences in timing of cash flows of the hedged item and hedging instrument: and the counterparties' credit risk differently impacting the fair value movements of the hedging instrument and the hedged item.
The ineffectiveness recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement was immaterial.

Sensitivity analysis IFRS 7 requires the disclosure of a sensitivity analysis that details the effects on the Group's profit or loss and other equity of reasonably possible fluctuations in market rates.
This sensitivity analysis has been prepared to illustrate the effect of the following hypothetical variations in market rates on the fair value of the Group's financial assets and liabilities: i a 1% 100 basis points increase or decrease in market interest rates: and ii a 10% strengthening or weakening of Sterling against all other currencies to which the Group is exposed.
a Interest rate sensitivity The Group is currently exposed to Sterling, Euro and US Dollar interest rates.
The Group also has a minimal exposure to Polish Zloty interest rates.
In order to illustrate the Group's sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations, the following table details the Group's sensitivity to a 100 basis point change in each respective interest rate.
The sensitivity analysis of the Group's exposure to interest rate risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the reporting period.
A positive number indicates an increase in profit or loss and other equity.

The provision has been calculated after taking into account both the periods over which the properties are likely to remain vacant and the likely income from existing and future sub-lease agreements on a contract-by-contract basis.
The provision covers potential transfer of economic benefit over the full range of current lease commitments disclosed in Note 29b.
Leasehold dilapidations This provision relates to contractual obligations to reinstate leasehold properties to their original state of repair.
The provision is calculated based on both the liability to rectify or reinstate leasehold improvements and modifications carried out on the inception of the lease recognised on inception with corresponding fixed asset and the liability to rectify general wear and tear which is recognised as incurred over the life of the lease.
The transfer of economic benefits will be made both at the end of the leases as set out in Note 29b reinstated and during the lease term wear and tear.
Other amounts Other amounts relate principally to claims and warranty provisions.
The transfer of economic benefit is expected to be made between one and four years' time.

Of the deferred tax asset of 14.6m, 3.3m relates to unused tax losses carried forward which have been recognised on the basis that realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable.
The directors have considered whether it is appropriate to recognise deferred tax assets given the results in the current and prior year.
Given current and forecast trading the directors consider the recognition of deferred tax assets to be appropriate.
The majority of the deferred tax asset associated with the retirement benefit obligations is in respect of the UK defined benefit scheme.
Payments against the deficit will be deductible for tax purposes on a paid basis and the Group expects to receive the tax benefit, therefore the associated deferred tax asset has been recognised.
Deferred tax has not been recognised on 7m of tax losses being carried forward on the basis that the realisation of their future economic benefit is uncertain.
The unrecognised potential deferred tax asset in relation to these tax losses is 1.7m 2017: 1.7m.
At the balance sheet date, no deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences relating to 163m of undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

com Stock code: SHI 169 Notes to the Financial Statements c Pension schemes The Group operates a number of pension schemes, six 2017: six of which provide defined benefits based on final pensionable salary.
Of these schemes, one 2017: one has assets held in a separate trustee-administered fund and five 2017: five are overseas book reserve schemes.
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution schemes, all of which are independently managed.
The Trustees of the pension fund are required by law to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the scheme.
The Trustees of the pension fund are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund.
In The Netherlands, the Company participates in the industry-wide pension plan for the construction materials industry BPF HiBiN.
The pension plan classifies as a multi-employer defined benefit scheme under IAS 19, but is recognised in the Financial Statements as a defined contribution scheme since the pension fund is not able to provide sufficient information to allow SIG's share of the assets and liabilities to be separately identified.
Therefore, the Group's annual pension expense for this scheme is equal to the required contribution each year.
The coverage ratio of the multi-employer union plan increased to 104.9% as at 31 December 2018 2017: 103.4%.
No change was made to the pension premium percentage of 22.2% 2017: 22.2%.
The coverage ratio is calculated by dividing the funds assets by the total sum of pension liabilities and is based upon market interest rates.
The Group's total pension charge for the year, including amounts charged to interest and Other items, was 9.4m 2017: 8.9m, of which a charge of 1.5m 2017: 1.1m related to defined benefit pension schemes and 7.9m 2017: 7.8m related to defined contribution schemes.
Defined benefit pension scheme valuations In accordance with IAS 19 the Group recognises all actuarial gains and losses in full in the period in which they arise in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The actuarial valuations of the defined benefit pension schemes are assessed by an independent actuary every three years who recommends the rate of contribution payable each year.
The last formal actuarial valuation of the SIG plc Retirement Benefits Plan, the UK scheme, was conducted at 31 December 2016 and showed that the market value of the schemes assets was 164.1m and their actuarial value covered 97% of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable salaries.
The other five schemes are book reserve schemes whereby the sponsoring company does not hold any separate assets to fund the pension scheme but makes a reserve in its accounts.
Therefore, these schemes do not hold separate scheme assets.
The liabilities of the schemes are met by the sponsoring companies.
The schemes typically expose the Group to actuarial risks such as: investment risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and salary risk.
The risk relating to benefits to be paid to the dependants of scheme members on death in service is reinsured by an external insurance company.
Investment risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to high quality corporate bond yields: if the return on plan assets falls below this rate, it will create a plan deficit.
Currently the plan has relatively balanced investments in line with the Trustees' Statement of Investment Principles between equity securities and debt instruments.
Due to the long-term nature of the plan liabilities, the Trustees of the pension fund consider it appropriate that a reasonable portion of the plan assets should be invested in growth assets to leverage the return generated by the fund.
Interest rate risk A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability but this will be partially offset by an increase in the return on the plans bond holdings.
Longevity risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment.
An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plans liability.
Salary risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan participants.
As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plans liability.
However, a pensionable salary cap was introduced from 1 July 2012 of 2.5% per annum.
Consolidated Income Statement charges The pension charge for the year, including amounts charged to interest of 0.4m 2017: 0.7m relating to the defined benefit pension schemes, was 1.5m 2017: 1.1m.
This charge also includes 1.0m in relation to the estimated liability impact of equalising Guaranteed Minimum Pensions GMP, which has been calculated by the pensions management company using the C2 methodology as set out in the Lloyds Bank High Court Case judgement.
This estimated increase in the liability has been charged to Other items within the Consolidated Income Statement.
In accordance with IAS 19, the charge for the defined benefit schemes has been calculated as the sum of the cost of benefits accruing in the year, the increase in the value of benefits already accrued and the expected return on assets.
The actuarial valuations described previously have been updated at 31 December 2018 by a qualified actuary using revised assumptions that are consistent with the requirements of IAS 19.
Investments have been valued, for this purpose, at fair value.
The UK defined benefit scheme is closed to new members and has an age profile that is rising.
The five overseas book reserve schemes remain open to new members.
170 SIG plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2018 FINANCIALS FINANCIALS Consolidated Balance Sheet liability The balance sheet position in respect of the six defined benefit schemes can be summarised as follows: 2018 2017 m m Pension liability before taxation 28.7 30.4 Related deferred tax asset 5.4 5.9 Pension liability after taxation 23.3 24.5 The actuarial gain of 0.1m 2017: 5.5m for the year, together with the associated deferred tax credit of 0.1m 2017: charge of 0.9m has been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
In addition, a deferred tax charge of 0.6m 2017: 0.3m has been recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
In the prior year there was an additional deferred tax charge of 0.2m in respect of the change in the French standard rate of corporation tax.
Of the above pension liability before taxation, 17.2m 2017: 19.1m relates to wholly or partly funded schemes and 11.5m 2017: 11.3m relates to the overseas unfunded schemes.
The movement in the pension liability before taxation in the year can be summarised as follows: 2018 2017 m m Pension liability at 1 January 30.4 37.1 Current service cost 0.1 0.4 Payment of unfunded benefits 0.3 Contributions 3.1 2.5 Net finance cost 0.4 0.7 GMP equalisation ruling 1.0 Actuarial gain 0.1 5.5 Effect of changes in exchange rates 0.5 Pension liability at 31 December 28.7 30.4 On 30 June 2016 the UK defined benefit pension scheme was closed to future benefit accrual.
However, the Group is contracted to pay contributions of 2.5m per annum to January 2019.
The contribution during 2018 was higher due to S75 debt in respect of the departure of SIG Trading Ireland from the plan.
The principal assumptions used for the IAS 19 actuarial valuation of the schemes were: 2018 2017 % % Rate of increase in salaries n a n a Rate of fixed increase of pensions in payment 1.7 1.7 Rate of increase of LPI pensions in payment 3.0 3.0 Discount rate 3.0 2.6 Inflation assumption 3.2 3.2 Upon closure of the UK defined benefit scheme to future benefit accrual the accrued benefits of active members ceased to be linked to their final salary and will instead revalue in deferment broadly in line with movements in the Consumer Price Index.
Deferred pensions are revalued to retirement in line with the schemes' rules and statutory requirements, with the inflation assumption used for LPI revaluation in deferment.
Within the principal plan the life expectancy for a male employee beyond the normal retirement age of 65 is 21.9 years 2017: 22.1 years.
The life expectancy on retirement at age 65 of a male employee currently aged 45 years is 23.3 years 2017: 23.5 years.
The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, whilst holding all other assumptions constant.
If the discount rate were to be increased decreased by 0.1%, this would decrease increase the Group's gross pension scheme deficit by 2.7m.
If the rate of inflation increased decreased by 0.1% this would increase decrease the Group's gross pension scheme deficit by 1.3m.
If the life expectancy for employees increased by one year the Group's gross pension scheme deficit would increase by 6.7m.
The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the changes in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
The average duration of the defined benefit scheme obligation at 31 December 2018 is 19 years 2017: 19 years.

As a condition of the exemption, the Company has guaranteed the year end liabilities of the relevant subsidiaries until they are settled in full.
As part of the disposal of Building Plastics a guarantee was provided to the landlord of the leasehold properties transferred with the business covering rentals over the remaining term of the leases in the event that the acquiring company enters into administration before the end of the lease term.
The maximum liability that could arise from this would be approximately 7.4m.
