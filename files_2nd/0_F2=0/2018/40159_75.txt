Interest income and expense IFRS IFRS 9 Interest income and expense is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument.
When calculating the effective interest rate, the Group estimates cash ows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument but does not consider future credit losses.
The calculation includes all fees and points paid or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts.
Indian GAAP IAS 9 Revenue Recognition As per IAS 9, interest is recognised on a time proportion basis taking into account the amount outstanding and the rate applicable.
In the absence of a specic effective interest rate requirement, premiums and discounts are usually amortised on a straight-line basis over the term of the instrument.
