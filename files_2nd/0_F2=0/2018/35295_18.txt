The remaining components of net cash flow from investing activities that do not form part of free cash flow, as defined by the groups management, are in respect of the acquisition and sale of businesses and non-working capital loans to and from associates.
The groups management regards the purchase and disposal of property, plant and equipment and computer software as ultimately non-discretionary since ongoing investment in plant, machinery and technology is required to support the day-to-day operations, whereas acquisitions and sales of businesses are discretionary.
Where appropriate, separate explanations are given for the impacts of acquisitions and sale of businesses, dividends paid and the purchase of own shares, each of which arises from decisions that are independent from the running of the ongoing underlying business.
