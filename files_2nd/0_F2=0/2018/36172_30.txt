160 NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2018 39.
Accounting information and policies Basis of preparation The Parent Company Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101, Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101 and the Companies Act 2006 the Act.
FRS 101 sets out a reduced disclosure framework for a qualifying entity as defined in the standard, which addresses the financial reporting requirements and disclosure exemptions in the individual financial statements of qualifying entities that otherwise apply the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of EU-adopted IFRSs.
The Company Financial Statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and financial liabilities and in accordance with the Act.
The Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, as set out in note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements of Genus plc.
The accounting policies set out below and stated in the relevant notes have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Financial Statements.
The Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under FRS 101 in relation to share-based payments, business combinations, financial instruments, presentation of comparative information in respect of certain assets, presentation of a cash flow statement, standards issued not yet effective, impairment of assets and related party transactions.
Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the Consolidated Financial Statements of Genus plc.
As permitted by section 408 of the Act, the Company has not presented its own income statement in this Annual Report.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty Preparing Company Financial Statements in conformity with FRS 101 requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Company Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods, if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The areas of judgement that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are the review for impairment of investment carrying values and the valuation of share-based payments.
Pensions A number of our employees are members of defined contribution pension schemes.
We charge contributions to profit and loss as they become payable under the schemes rules.
We show differences between the contributions payable and the amounts actually paid as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
The schemes assets are held separately from those of theCompany.
Certain former employees of the Company are members of one of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes, further details of which are given in note 27 of the Group Financial Statements.
The schemes are all multi-employer defined benefit schemes, whose assets and liabilities are held independently from the Group but within their sponsored Group company.
Significant accounting policies applied in the current reporting period that relate to the Financial Statements asawhole Taxation We provide for current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, at the amounts we expect to pay or recover, using the tax rates and the laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Foreign currencies We record transactions in foreign currencies at the rate ruling at the transaction date or at the contracted rate, if the transaction is covered by a forward foreign currency contract.
We retranslate monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the prevailing rate of exchange at the balance sheet date or, if appropriate, at the forward contract rate.
All differences are taken to the income statement.
Own shares The Company has adopted FRS 101, which requires us to recognise the assets and liabilities associated with the Companys investment in its own shares in the Companys Financial Statements, where there is fide facto control of the assets and liabilities.
The Companys own shares held by a Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust remain deducted from shareholders funds until they vest unconditionally with employees.

Accounting information and policies continued Employee share schemes The Companys Executive Directors and Chief Operating Officers receive part of their remuneration in the form of share awards, which vest upon meeting performance criteria over a three-year period.
We measure the cost of these awards by reference to the shares fair value at the award date.
At the end of each financial reporting period, we estimate the extent to which the performance criteria will be met at the end of three years and record an appropriate charge in the profit and loss account, together with a corresponding credit to profit and loss reserves.
Changes in estimates of the number of shares vesting may result in charges or credits to the profit and loss account in subsequent periods.
Share-based payments We have implemented the generally accepted accounting principle for accounting for share-based payments with subsidiary undertakings under FRS 101, whereby the Company has granted rights to its shares to employees of its subsidiary undertakings under an equity-settled arrangement, and the subsidiaries have not reimbursed the Company for these rights.
Under this arrangement, the Company treats the share-based payment recognised in the subsidiarys Financial Statements as a cost of investment in the subsidiary and credits equity with an equal amount.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging Our activities expose us primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
We use interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk.
We also use forward foreign currency contracts, implemented through a medium-term US Dollar cross currency borrowing and related interest rate swap, to hedge exposure to translation risk associated with US Dollar net assets of subsidiaries.
Forward foreign currency contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting in the Parent Company Financial Statements, as the hedged item is not in its balance sheet.
Our use of financial derivative instruments is governed by the Groups policies, which are approved by the Board of Directors.
The notes to the Group Financial Statements include information about the Groups financial risks and their management, and its use of financial instruments and their impact on the Groups risk profile, performance and financial condition.
The fair value of the US Dollar and interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that we would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, which is the present value of the quoted forward price.
Cash flow hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as hedging the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, we recognise the effective part of any gain or loss on the instrument directly in the hedging reserve.
We recognise any ineffective portion of the hedge immediately in the profit and loss account.
If we hedge a forecast transaction that subsequently results in our recognising a financial asset or liability, then we reclassify the associated gains and losses that we had recognised directly in equity into profit or loss.
We do this in the same period or periods that the asset or liability affects profit or loss, which are the periods when we recognise the interest income or expense.
If we expect a hedged forecast transaction to occur but the hedging instrument has expired, been sold, terminated or exercised, or we have revoked the designation of the hedge relationship, then the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and we recognise it in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs.
If we no longer expect the hedged transaction to occur, we immediately recognise in the profit and loss account the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or we revoke designation of the hedge relationship, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity until we dispose of the investment it relates to.
We treat derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts as separate derivatives, when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value, with unrealised gains and losses reported in the income statement.

Intangible assets Accounting policies Patents, licences and software are stated at acquisition cost less accumulated amortisation.
The amortisation period is determined by reference to expected useful life, which is reviewed at least annually.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life.
Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates.

Tangible assets Accounting policies We state fixed assets at cost, together with any incidental acquisition expenses, or at their latest valuation, less depreciation and any provision for impairment.
We calculate depreciation on a straight-line basis, to write the assets down to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives.
The rates of annual depreciation on tangible fixed assets are as follows: Leasehold improvements period of lease Equipment 3 to 20 years We review the carrying value of fixed assets for impairment, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

Investments in subsidiaries Accounting policies Shares in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable.
If any such indication of impairment exists, then we estimate the recoverable amount.
If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the value of the investment, it is considered to be impaired and we write it down to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.

Other investments Accounting policies Listed equity investments are stated at fair value.
Unlisted equity investments that do not have a quoted market price in an active market and whose fair value cannot be reliably measured are measured at cost less any identified impairment losses at the end of each reporting period.

Of the amounts owed by Group undertakings, 333.3m 2017: 334.7m is interest bearing.
Deferred taxation Accounting policies We recognise deferred taxation in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in future or a right to pay less tax in future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
We only recognise deferred taxation assets if we consider it more likely than not that we will have suitable profits from which we can deduct the future reversal of the underlying timing differences.
Timing differences are differences arising between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the Financial Statements, and which are capable of reversing in one or more subsequent periods.
We only recognise deferred taxation in respect of the future remittance of retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable.
We measure deferred taxation on a non-discounted basis, at the tax rates we expect to apply in the periods in which we expect the timing differences to reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The movements in deferred taxation are as follows: 2018 2017 m m At the start of the year 1.5 1.6 Recognised in income statement 0.1 Release in equity 0.2 At the end of the year 1.5 1.5 Genus plc | Annual Report 2018 S TR ATE G I C C OR P OR AT E F I NAN C I AL AD D I T I O final 165 R E P OR T G O V E R NAN C E S TAT EM EN T S IN F OR M AT I ON 46.

Loans and borrowings Accounting policies We initially state debt at the amount of the net proceeds, after deducting issue costs.

Genus plc | Annual Report 2018 168 NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2018 55.
Pensions, guarantees and contingencies On 23 June 2017, NMR withdrew from the MPF under a Flexible Apportionment Arrangement FAA between NMR, Genus and the Trustees of the MPF.
In return for the right to withdraw from the MPF, NMR made a one-off, lump sum cash payment of 10.1m to the MPF, equivalent to the undiscounted value of all NMRs future payments under the existing MPF recovery plan which extends to March 2026.
NMR also made a payment to Genus of 4.7m, with 1.4m being satisfied by the issue of NMR shares.
As a result of the NMR withdrawal, Genus plc has recognised in the prior year 5.7m as an exceptional credit, with 4.5m 4.7m payment net of fees being received directly from NMR, and 1.2m from the MPF pension scheme, reflecting the impact of NMR paying undiscounted amounts into the scheme.
During the year, the NMR pension assigned to Genus plc under the FAA recorded an actuarial gain of 2.8m, which was restricted in accordance with IFRIC 14 to nil, as the Company does not have unilateral right to this surplus.
For additional information on the MPF pension scheme to which NMR was one of the participating employers, please see note 27.
The retirement benefit obligations referred to in note 27 include obligations relating to the Milk Pension Fund defined benefit scheme.
Genus, together with other participating employers, is joint and severally liable for the schemes obligations.
Genus has accounted for its section and its share of any orphan assets and liabilities, collectively representing approximately 86% 2017: 85% of the MPF.
As a result of the joint and several liability, Genus has a contingent liability for the schemes obligations that it has not accounted for.
The total deficit of the MPF scheme from the most recent triennial valuation can be found in note 27.
Certain UK subsidiaries which are detailed in note 35 will take advantage of the audit exemption set out within section 479A of the Companies Act 2006 for the year ended 30 June 2018, The Company has assessed the probability of loss under the guarantee as remote.
At 30 June 2018, we had entered into bank guarantees totalling 1.0m.
