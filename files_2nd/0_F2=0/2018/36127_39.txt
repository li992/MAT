The effective interest rate on non-current loans to related parties is charged at LIBOR plus 1% in both periods.
All non-current receivables are due within five years of the balance sheet date.
Trade receivables are recorded at amortised cost, reduced by estimated allowances for doubtful debts.
The fair value of trade and other receivables does not differ materially from the book value.
There is no significant concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables as the Group has a large number of customers which are internationally dispersed.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date is the carrying value of each class of asset above.
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
Trade receivables that are more than three months past due are considered to be impaired unless a payment plan has been agreed with the customer and is being adhered to.
Trade receivables that are less than three months past due are not considered impaired unless amounts are specifically identified as irrecoverable.
