The level of fair value hierarchy within the financial assets or financial liabilities is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are classied in their entirety into only one of the following 3 levels: Level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 inputs for assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
The determination of what constitutes observable requires significant judgement by the Group.
The Group considers observable data to be market data that is readily available, regularly distributed or updated, reliable and veriable, not proprietary, and provided by independent sources that are actively involved in the relevant market.
The only financial instruments held at fair value are the instruments held by the Group in the SPVs, which are fair valued at each reporting date.
The Groups investments have been classied within level 3 as the investments are not traded and contain unobservable inputs.
The Companys investments are all considered to be level 3 assets.
As the fair value of the Companys equity and loan investments in Holdco is ultimately determined by the underlying fair values of the SPV investments, the Companys sensitivity analysis of reasonably possible alternative input assumptions is the same as for the Group.
Due to the nature of the investments, they are always expected to be classied as level 3.
There have been no transfers between levels during the year ended 31 December 2018.
Any transfers between the levels would be accounted for on the last day of each financial period.
Valuations are derived using a discounted cashow methodology in line with IPEV Valuation Guidelines and take into account, inter alia, the following: due diligence findings where relevant: the terms of any material contracts including PPAs: asset performance: power price forecast from a leading market consultant: and the economic, taxation or regulatory environment.
The DCF valuation of the Groups investments represents the largest component of GAV and the key sensitivities are considered to be the discount rate used in the DCF valuation and assumptions in relation to ination, energy yield, power price and asset life.
As there is no debt at wind farm level, the DCF valuation is produced by discounting the individual wind farm cashows on an unlevered basis.
The equivalent levered discount rate would be approximately 2 per cent.
higher than the blended portfolio discount rate.
60 GREENCOAT U K W I N D Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2018 9.
Investments at fair value through profit or loss continued For the year end DCF valuation, an upgraded discounting methodology has been applied.
Previously, each wind farms cashows were discounted at a single discount rate, irrespective of their nature.
Different discount rates are now applied, tailored to the nature of the underlying cashows: for example, one discount rate for xed ROC cashows and a higher discount rate for merchant power cashows.
The blended portfolio discount rate, assuming a 25 year asset life see below, remains unchanged from 31 December 2017 at 7.7 per cent..
In addition to but separate from the upgraded discounting methodology, the asset life assumption used in the year end DCF valuation has been increased from 25 to 30 years, following a third party technical assessment of the portfolio.
The technical asset life for many wind farms signicantly exceeds 30 years and appropriate assumptions have been made in relation to the continued good management of the assets, lease extensions and other factors.
A 30 year asset life assumption is a more appropriate assumption to be used to determine the fair value of the portfolio.
Amending the asset life and associated assumptions increased NAV per share by 6.7 pence.
It also means that the blended portfolio discount rate has increased from 7.7 per cent.
as a result of including a higher proportion of higher discount rate merchant power cashows in years 26-30.
is considered to be a reasonable range of alternative assumptions for discount rate.
The base case long term RPI assumption is 3.0 per cent.

The assumption was increased from 2.75 per cent.

probability of exceedance over a 10 year period sensitivities reect the future variability of wind and the uncertainty associated with the long term data source being representative of the long term mean.
Given their basis on long term operating data, it is not anticipated that base case energy yield assumptions will be adjusted other than any wind energy true-ups with compensating purchase price adjustments.
Long term power price forecasts are provided by a leading market consultant, updated quarterly and may be adjusted by the Investment Manager where more conservative assumptions are considered appropriate.
Base case real power prices increase from approximately 48 MWh 2020 to approximately 58 MWh 2040.
The sensitivity below assumes a 10 per cent.

Sensitivity analysis The fair value of the Groups investments is 1,871,207,321 2017: 1,405,724,491.
The analysis below is provided to illustrate the sensitivity of the fair value of investments to an individual input, while all other variables remain constant.
The Board considers these changes in inputs to be within reasonable expected ranges.
This is not intended to imply the likelihood of change or that possible changes in value would be restricted to this range.
