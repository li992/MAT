In this note we outline the accounting policies, movements in the year on the deferred tax account and the net deferred tax asset or liability at the year end.
A deferred tax asset represents a tax reduction that is expected to arise in a future period.
A deferred tax liability represents taxes which will become payable in a future period as a result of a current or an earlier transaction.
Accounting policy Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.
Tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right and there is an intention to settle the balances net.

Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of tax losses and other temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets because it is probable that these assets will be recovered.
Each of these assets are reviewed to ensure there is sufficient evidence to support their recognition.
All underlying temporary differences where a deferred tax liability arising from investments in subsidiaries and associates have been appropriately recognised where it is probable the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future.
In particular, there are tax losses carried forward in respect of Brazilian entities generating a potential net tax asset of 36m.
An element of this asset has been recognised in the financial statements 12m with the remainder of the asset being unrecognised 24m.
Whilst the relevant entities have suffered a loss in the current period, there is sufficient supporting evidence of future profitability which is available to allow for the recognition of this asset.
This evidence includes detailed financial projections for each individual entity as adjusted for tax sensitive items.
The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities prior to the offsetting of balances within the same jurisdiction as permitted by IAS 12, Income Taxes, during the year are shown below.
The offsetting of these balances is shown within the reclassification line of the notes below.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities categorised as other deferred tax of 36m 2017: 34m includes various balances in relation to accounting provisions accruals asset 31m 2017: 38m, goodwill amortisation liability 13m 2017: 30m, deferred revenue asset 16m 2017: 16m and other sundry amounts asset 2m 2017: 10m.
