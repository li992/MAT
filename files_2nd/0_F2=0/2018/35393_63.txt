Guarantees and contingent liabilities The Group has given a formal undertaking with Hotelopia Holidays S. L. U, the Civil Aviation Authority CAA and the Trustees of the Air Travel Trust that it will guarantee easyJet bookings made on its behalf by Hotelopia.
In the event the CAA publishes a notice of failure in respect of Hotelopia, the Group will honour all easyJet related bookings or enter into alternative arrangements for the bookings to be fulfilled or compensated.
easyJet is involved in a number of disputes and litigation which arose in the normal course of business.
The likely outcome of these disputes and litigation cannot be predicted, and in complex cases reliable estimates of any potential obligation may not be possible.
Having reviewed the information currently available, management considers that the ultimate resolution of these disputes and litigation is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on easyJets results, cash flows or financial position.
As at 30 September 2018 easyJet had no agreements with third parties for which fees were contingent upon the completion of acquisition activities 2017: 4 million.
At 30 September 2018 easyJet had outstanding letters of credit and performance bonds totalling 33 million 2017: 44 million, of which 12 million 2017: 21 million expire within one year.
The fair value of these instruments at each year end was negligible.
No amount is recognised on the statement of financial position in respect of any of these financial instruments as it is not probable that there will be an outflow of resources.
