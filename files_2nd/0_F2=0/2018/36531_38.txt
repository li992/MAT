There are no dilutive or potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
Adjusted earnings are calculated as earnings from continuing operations excluding the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets: acquisition items: restructuring costs: profit or loss on disposal of operations: the associated taxation thereon: and the effect of the US tax reform measures.
The Directors consider that adjusted earnings, which constitute an alternative performance measure, represent a more consistent measure of underlying performance.
A reconciliation of earnings and the effect on basic and diluted earnings per share figures is as follows: Per ordinary share Year ended 52 weeks to Year ended 52 weeks to 31 March 1 April 31 March 1 April 2018 2018 2017 2017 000 000 pence pence Earnings from continuing operations 154,228 129,689 40.69 34.25 Amortisation of acquired intangible assets after tax 25,988 21,452 6.85 5.66 Impairment of acquired intangible assets after tax 9,322 2.46 Acquisition transaction costs after tax 2,452 240 0.65 0.06 Adjustments to contingent consideration after tax 1,919 10,650 0.51 2.81 Release of fair value adjustments to inventory after tax 2,613 569 0.69 0.15 Disposal of operations and restructuring after tax 719 1,648 0.19 0.44 Impact of US tax reform measures note 21 14,947 3.94 Adjusted earnings 171,534 152,270 45.26 40.21 3 Alternative performance measures The Board uses certain alternative performance measures to help it effectively monitor the performance of the Group.
The Directors consider that these represent a more consistent measure of underlying performance by removing non-trading items that are not closely related to the Groups trading or operating cash flows.
These measures include Return on Total Invested Capital ROTIC, Return on Capital Employed ROCE, organic growth at constant currency, Adjusted operating profit and Adjusted operating cash flow.

3 The ROTIC and ROCE measures are expressed as a percentage of the average of the current and prior years Total Invested Capital and Capital Employed respectively.
Using an average as the denominator is considered to be more representative.
The March 2016 Total Invested Capital and Capital Employed balances were 891,071,000 and 258,648,000 respectively.
4 The ROTIC and ROCE measures are calculated as Adjusted profit after tax divided by Average Total Invested Capital and Adjusted operating profit after share of results of associates divided by Average Capital Employed respectively.

This measure equalises the effect of acquisitions by: a. removing from the year of acquisition their entire revenue and profit before taxation: and b. in the following year, removing the revenue and profit for the number of months equivalent to the pre-acquisition period in the prior year.
The results of disposals are removed from the prior period reported revenue and profit before taxation.
Constant currency measures the change in revenue and profit excluding the effects of currency movements.
The measure restates the current years revenue and profit at last years exchange rates.

The Groups future Effective Tax Rate ETR will mainly depend on the geographic mix of profits and whether there are any changes to tax legislation in the Groups most significant countries of operations.
Phased reductions in the UK corporation tax rate to 19% from 1 April 2017 and 17% from 1 April 2020 have been substantively enacted which have impacted the ETR in the current period.
A reduction in the US federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective from 1 January 2018, was enacted as part of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on 22 December 2017.
Effect of US tax reform measures, above, refers to the one-off deferred tax credit of 14,947,000 see note 21 Deferred Tax arising from the re-measurement of deferred tax balances at a lower blended federal and state tax rate, with a federal tax element of 21%.
This has been recognised as a credit in adjusting items in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The Group does not expect the future ETR to be materially impacted by the changes to the international tax landscape resulting from the package of measures developed under the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project and the investigations and proposals of the European Commission.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
Before recognition of any impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to CGU groups as follows: 31 March 1 April 2018 2017 000 000 Process Safety Gas Detection Bursting Discs 8,232 9,251 Safety Interlocks and Corrosion Monitoring 54,964 60,975 63,196 70,226 Infrastructure Safety Fire 63,325 53,664 Doors, Security and Elevators 80,355 71,859 143,680 125,523 Medical Health Optics 170,265 172,923 Fluid Technology 38,134 41,333 Sensor Technologies 65,720 73,857 274,119 288,113 Environmental & Analysis Water 71,295 30,405 Photonics 66,652 74,430 Environmental Monitoring 13,220 14,856 151,167 119,691 Total Group 632,162 603,553 Goodwill values have been tested for impairment by comparing them against the value in use in perpetuity of the relevant CGU group.
The value in use calculations were based on projected cash flows, derived from the latest budget approved by the Board, discounted at CGU specific, risk adjusted, discount rates to calculate their net present value.
Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 safer | cleaner | healthier 147 147 Financial Statements Notes to the Accounts continued Notes to the Accountscontinued 11 Goodwill continued Key assumptions used in value in use calculations The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the following assumptions: - CGU specific operating assumptions that are reflected in the budget period for the financial year to March 2019: - Discount rates: and - Growth rates used to extrapolate risk adjusted cash flows beyond the budget period.
CGU specific operating assumptions are applicable to the budgeted cash flows for the year to March 2019 and relate to revenue forecasts, expected project outcomes and forecast operating margins in each of the operating companies.
The relative value ascribed to each assumption will vary between CGUs as the budgets are built up from the underlying operating companies within each CGU group.
A short-term growth rate is applied to the March 2019 budget to derive the cash flows arising in the years to March 2020 and March 2021.
A long-term rate is applied to these values for the year to March 2022 and onwards.
Short-term growth rates for years 2020 and 2021 for all CGU groups, with the exception of Sensor Technologies, are based on sector strategic plans.
Long-term growth rates are capped at the weighted average GDP growth rates of the markets that the CGU Group sells into.
Short-term growth rates for Sensor Technologies are applied out to 2023, based on CGU specific revenue growth rates and margins which reflect the acquisition case updated for latest expectations of performance.
These CGU specific growth rates reflect the rapid growth potential of this early stage life-cycle, technology-based business through further penetration into the USA, internationally and, in the longer term, through new applications in other sectors.
Long-term growth rates thereafter are capped at the weighted average GDP growth rates of the markets that the CGU sells into.
Discount rates are based on estimations of the assumptions that market participants operating in similar sectors to Halma would make, using the Groups economic profile as a starting point and adjusting appropriately.
The Directors do not currently expect any significant change in the present base discount rate of 9.42% 2017: 9.04%.
The base discount rate, which is pre-tax and is based on short-term variables, may differ from the Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC.
Discount rates are adjusted for economic risks that are not already captured in the specific operating assumptions for each CGU group.
This results in the impairment testing using discount rates ranging from 8.32% to 12.04% 2017: 8.75% to 12.50% across the CGU groups.
CGU groups to which 10% or more of the total goodwill balance is allocated are deemed to be significant.
The assumptions used to determine value in use for these CGU groups are: Risk adjusted Short-term Long-term discount rate growth rates growth rates 31 March 1 April 31 March 1 April 31 March 1 April Significant CGU groups 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 Safety Interlocks and Corrosion Monitoring 11.34% 11.15% 5.00% 8.23% 2.71% 2.60% Doors, Security and Elevators 12.04% 11.08% 8.10% 6.93% 1.95% 1.98% Health Optics 11.63% 12.50% 7.50% 5.15% 2.29% 2.14% Sensor Technologies 10.65% 12.46% 20.00% 20.00% 2.00% 2.00% Photonics 9.55% 9.67% 7.50% 19.29% 1.77% 1.85% Sensitivity to changes in assumptions In Sensor Technologies, if future growth was not as currently forecast this could result in the value in use of goodwill falling below its carrying value.
For this to happen, forecast revenue growth to 2023 would have to fall to 3% and to 2% thereafter.
For all other CGU groups, management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of any unit to exceed its recoverable amount.

In the case of trade receivables that are past due, management makes an assessment of the risk of non-collection, taking into account factors such as previous default experience, any disputes or other factors delaying payment and the risk of bankruptcy or other failure of the customer to meet their obligations.
For trade receivables that are not past due, taking into account good historical collection experience, management records an impairment charge only where there is a specific risk of non-collection.
During the year, one large, previously provided for, debtor of 730,000 was written off.
The fair value of trade and other receivables approximates to book value due to the short-term maturities associated with these items.
There is no impairment risk identified with regards to prepayments and accrued income or other receivables where no amounts are past due.

The 9,411,000 addition arising on acquisition relates to the acquisitions during the year of CasMed NIBP, Cardios and Mini-Cam.
The amount utilised during the year comprises 308,000 US$409,000 for the first earn out period for FluxData covering the three-month stub period to March 2017 and 278,000 336,000 representing the first year Royalty earn out on sales to a specific customer for Visiometrics.
This was the only payment under the Royalty earn out arrangement.
403,000 was also paid as final settlement of the payable due for VAS.
The 2,564,000 additions relate to revisions to the estimates of the earn outs for CasMed NIBP 725,000 and Visiometrics 1,839,000.
CasMed NIBP has exceeded expectations post-acquisition following a better than expected integration and return of buying patterns by a key customer.
The remaining amount due for Visiometrics 8,668,000 represents the final earn out period under the Core element which is payable on a multiple of EBITDA for each calendar year to December 2018.
Due to the size of the multiple, this balance is sensitive to changes in business performance.
Improvements in trading following a strategic review in the business under new management has led to an increase in the estimated provision.
Any earn out amount will be released to the vendors subject to collection of all related outstanding debtors no later than 30 June 2019.
Nothing was paid in relation to the second earn out period to December 2017.
The 1,535,000 release of provision relates to a revision to the estimate of the FluxData earn out to 6,384,000.
This is as a result of a delay in a major project from a specific customer.
Of the closing total provision of 25,013,000, 3,697,000 is payable within one year.
3,160,000 payable for the second earn out period for FluxData is due for settlement, the remainder relates to the acquisition of Cardios.
The balance due after more than one year comprises 1,327,000 payable for the year to March 2019 for the acquisition of CasMed NIBP, 3,224,000 payable for the final earn out period to March 2019 for FluxData, 8,097,000 payable over two earn out periods for the acquisition of Mini-Cam and 8,668,000 payable for the final earn out element of Visiometrics.
Dilapidations and vacant property Dilapidations and vacant property provisions exist where the Group has lease contracts under which the unavoidable costs of meeting its obligations under the contracts exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under them.
The provisions comprise the Directors best estimates of future payments: a to restore the fabric of buildings to their original condition where it is a condition of the leases prior to return of the properties: and b on vacant properties, the rental costs of which are not expected to be recoverable from subleasing the properties.
These commitments cover the period from 2018 to 2028 though they predominantly fall due within five years.
Product warranty Product warranty provisions reflect commitments made to customers on the sale of goods in the ordinary course of business and included within the Group companies standard terms and conditions.
Warranty commitments cover a period of between one and five years and typically apply for a 12-month period.
The provision represents the Directors best estimate of the Groups liability based on past experience.
Legal, contractual and other Legal, contractual and other provisions comprise mainly amounts reserved against open legal and contractual disputes.
The Company has on occasion been required to take legal or other actions to defend itself against proceedings brought by other parties.
Provisions are made for the expected costs associated with such matters, based on past experience of similar items and other known factors, taking into account professional advice received, and represent Directors best estimate of the likely outcome.
The timing of utilisation of these provisions is frequently uncertain reflecting the complexity of issues and the outcome of various court proceedings and negotiations.
Contractual and other provisions represent the Directors best estimate of the cost of settling future obligations.

The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: 31 March 1 April 2018 2017 000 000 Deferred tax liability 66,983 100,121 Deferred tax asset 36,977 56,866 Net deferred tax liability 30,006 43,255 Movement in net deferred tax liability: 31 March 1 April 2018 2017 000 000 At beginning of year 43,255 48,942 Charge credit to Consolidated Income Statement: UK 1,614 2,392 Overseas 22,486 9,144 Charge credit to Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income 2,438 5,849 Charge credit to equity 449 65 Acquired note 24 11,509 15 Exchange adjustments 6,773 6,964 At end of year 30,006 43,255 Phased reductions in the UK corporation tax rate to 19% effective from 1 April 2017 and 17% effective from 1 April 2020 were substantively enacted in the UK Finance No.
2 Act 2015 and UK Finance Act 2016, respectively.
A reduction in the US federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective from 1 January 2018, was enacted as part of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on 22 December 2017.
As a result, the US deferred tax assets and liabilities at 1 April 2017 have been re-measured based on the lower blended federal and state rate, with a federal tax element of 21%.
This results in a reduction in the net deferred tax liability arising on the acquired intangible assets, accelerated tax depreciation, short-term timing difference and goodwill timing differences of 14,947,000, which has been recognised as a credit in the Consolidated Income Statement.
It is likely that the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries would qualify for the UK dividend exemption such that no UK tax would be due upon remitting those earnings to the UK.
However, 36,197,000 2017: 35,788,000 of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of the dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate.
These tax liabilities are not expected to exceed 3,853,000 2017: 3,595,000 of which only 732,000 has been provided as the Group is able to control the timing of the dividends.
It is not expected that further amounts will crystallise in the foreseeable future.
Temporary timing differences in connection with the interest in associate are insignificant.
At 31 March 2018 the Group had unused capital tax losses of 285,000 2017: 318,000 for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised.

168 safer | cleaner | healthier Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 168 Financial Statements Notes to the Accounts continued 26 Financial instruments Policy The Groups treasury policies seek to minimise financial risks and to ensure sufficient liquidity for the Groups operations and strategic plans.
No complex derivative financial instruments are used, and no trading or speculative transactions in financial instruments are undertaken.
Where the Group does use financial instruments, these are mainly to manage the currency risks arising from normal operations and its financing.
Operations are financed mainly through retained profits and, in certain geographic locations, bank borrowings.
Foreign currency risk is the most significant aspect for the Group in the area of financial instruments.
It is exposed to a lesser extent to other risks such as interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and these policies are summarised below.
The Groups policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the financial year.
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the bases of recognition of income and expenses for each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in the Accounting Policies note.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 18 to the Accounts, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk as a consequence of both trading with foreign companies and owning subsidiaries located in foreign countries.
The Group earns a significant proportion of its profit in currencies other than Sterling.
This gives rise to translational currency risk, where the Sterling value of profits earned by the Groups foreign subsidiaries fluctuates with the strength of Sterling relative to their operating or functional currencies.
The Group does not hedge this risk, so its reported profit is sensitive to the strength of Sterling, particularly against the US Dollar and Euro.
The Group also has transactional currency exposures.
These arise on sales or purchases by operating companies in currencies other than the companies operating or functional currency.
Significant sales and purchases are matched where possible and a proportion of the net exposure is hedged by means of forward foreign currency contracts.
The Group has significant investments in overseas operations in the USA and EU, with further investments in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Switzerland, Brazil, China and India.
As a result, the Groups balance sheet can be affected by movements in these countries exchange rates.
Where significant and appropriate, currency denominated net assets are hedged by currency borrowings.
These currency exposures are reviewed regularly.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings and cash deposits.
Where bank borrowings are used to finance operations they tend to be short term with floating interest rates.
Longer-term funding is provided by the Groups bank loan facilities which are at floating rates, or by the Groups fixed rate United States Private Placement completed in November 2015.
Surplus funds are placed on short-term fixed rate deposit or in floating rate deposit accounts.
Credit risk Credit risk is defined as the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.
Credit ratings are supplied by independent agencies where available, and if not available, the Group uses other publicly available financial information and its own trading records to rate its major customers.
The Groups exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties.
Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed regularly.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographic areas.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and, where appropriate, credit guarantee insurance cover is purchased.
The carrying amount of trade, tax and other receivables, derivative financial instruments and cash of 290,769,000 2017: 261,486,000 represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk as no collateral or other credit enhancements are held.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 safer | cleaner | healthier 169 169 Financial Statements Notes to the Accounts continued Notes to the Accountscontinued 26 Financial instruments continued Liquidity risk The Group has a syndicated multi-currency revolving credit facility which was refinanced in November 2016 and remains at 550,000,000.
The facility, in Sterling, US Dollar, Euro, and Swiss Franc, currently runs to November 2022 subsequent to a one-year extension option exercised during the current year.
In addition, in November 2015 the Group completed a United States Private Placement and issued US$250,000,000 of loan notes in January 2016, repayable at five, seven and ten-year intervals.
These facilities are the main sources of long-term funding for the Group.
The Group has a strong cash flow and the funds generated by operating companies are managed regionally based on geographic location.
Funds are placed on deposit with secure, highly-rated banks.
For short-term working capital purposes, most operating companies utilise local bank overdrafts.
These practices allow a balance to be maintained between continuity of funding, security and flexibility.
Because of the nature of their use, the facilities are typically on demand and as such uncommitted.
Overdraft facilities are typically renewed annually.
Currency exposures Translational exposures It is estimated, by reference to the Groups US Dollar and Euro denominated profits, that a one per cent change in the value of the US Dollar relative to Sterling would have had a 933,000 2017: 823,000 impact on the Groups reported profit before tax: and a one per cent change in the value of the Euro relative to Sterling would have had a 290,000 2017: 286,000 impact on the Groups profit before tax for the year ended 31 March 2018.
Transactional exposures The Group has net foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities that are assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency of the underlying company.
These comprise cash and overdrafts as well as certain trade receivable and payable balances.
These foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as a result of movement in exchange rates.
The exposures are predominantly US Dollar and Euro.
Group policy is for a significant portion of foreign currency exposures, including sales and purchases, to be hedged by forward foreign exchange contracts in the company in which the transaction is recorded.
Interest rate risk profile The Groups financial assets which are subject to interest rate fluctuations comprise interest bearing cash equivalents which totalled 4,547,000 at 31 March 2018 2017: 2,974,000.
These comprised Sterling denominated deposits of 1,000,000 2017: 187,000, and Euro, US Dollar and Renminbi deposits of 3,547,000 2017: 2,787,000 which are placed on local money markets and earn interest at market rates.
Cash balances of 66,174,000 2017: 63,853,000 earn interest at local market rates.
The financial liabilities which are subject to interest rate fluctuations comprise bank loans, bank overdrafts, and certain unsecured loans, which totalled 114,356,000 at 31 March 2018 2017: 81,951,000.
All bank loans bear interest at floating rates where the fixed period is typically no more than three months.
Interest rates are based on the LIBOR of the currency in which the liabilities arise plus a small margin.
Bank overdrafts bear interest at local base rates.
The loan notes related to the acquisition of Advanced Electronics Limited outstanding at 31 March 2018 attract interest at a fixed rate of 1%.
The loan notes related to the United States Private Placement attract interest at a weighted average fixed rate of 2.5%.
The Groups weighted average interest cost on net debt for the year was 2.83% 2017: 2.49%.

The Revolving Credit Facility was refinanced in November 2016 and initially ran to November 2021.
Effective November 2017, the Group extended this facility for a further year to November 2022.
A United States Private Placement of US$250,000,000 completed in November 2015.
The unsecured loan notes under the United States Private Placement were drawn on 6 January 2016 as 82,000,000, 56,000,000 and US$64,000,000 at a weighted average fixed interest rate of 2.5%.
The loan notes mature at five, seven and ten-year intervals.
Interest is payable half yearly.
The Group has additional short-term unsecured and committed US bank facilities of 17,768,000 which mature in November 2018 and were undrawn at 31 March 2018.
Other short-term operational funding is provided by cash generated from operations and by local bank overdrafts.
These overdraft facilities are uncommitted and are generally renewed on an annual or ongoing basis and hence the facilities expire within one year or less.
The Groups undrawn committed facilities available at 31 March 2018 were 436,696,000 2017: 469,239,000 of which nil 2017: nil matures within one year and 436,696,000 2017: 469,239,000 between two and five years.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities With the exception of the Groups fixed rate loan notes, there were no significant differences between the book value and fair value as determined by market value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities.
The fair value of floating borrowings approximates to the carrying value because interest rates are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.
The fair value of the Groups fixed rate loan notes arising from the United States Private Placement completed in January 2016 is estimated to be 175,787,000 2017: 181,525,000.
The fair value is estimated by discounting the future contracted cash flow using readily available market data and represents a level 2 measurement in the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is estimated by discounting the future contracted cash flow, using readily available market data, and represents a level 2 measurement in the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7.
The fair value of deferred contingent consideration arising on acquisitions is estimated by discounting the possible future cash flows using probability adjusted forecasts for the acquired company, and represents a level 3 measurement in the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7.
The fair value is sensitive to the weighting assigned to the expected future cash flows.

The Group enters into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk, including: - forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on the export of goods to and from the USA, Mainland Europe and the UK: and - foreign exchange loans to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on translation of the Groups investment in foreign operations which have the Euro, US Dollar and Swiss Franc as their functional currencies.
Market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis as described below.
There has been no change to the Groups exposure to market risks or in the manner in which these risks are managed and measured.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Group is mainly exposed to the currency of the USA US Dollar and the currency of Mainland Europe Euro.
The carrying amount of the Groups US Dollar and Euro denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are as follows: Assets Liabilities 31 March 1 April 31 March 1 April 2018 2017 2018 2017 000 000 000 000 US Dollar 678,135 750,301 202,519 263,247 Euro 232,323 183,415 89,893 72,956 If Sterling increased by 10% against the US Dollar and the Euro, profits before taxation and other equity would decrease as follows: US Dollar Euro 31 March 1 April 31 March 1 April 2018 2017 2018 2017 000 000 000 000 Profit 8,568 7,557 2,666 2,622 Other equity 43,238 44,278 12,948 10,042 The profit sensitivity arises mainly from the translation of overseas profits earned during the year.
10% is the sensitivity rate which management assesses to be a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.
The Groups profit sensitivity has increased against the US Dollar because more of the Groups profits is earned in this currency.

The Halma Group Pension Plan and the Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan both UK have defined benefit sections with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
Both of these sections had already closed to new entrants in 2002 03 and closed to future benefit accruals for 2014 15.
From that date, the former defined benefit members joined the existing defined contribution section within the Halma Group Pension Plan.
Overseas subsidiaries have adopted mainly defined contribution plans, with the exception of two small defined benefit plans in the Swiss entities of Medicel AG, and Robutec AG.
Total pension costs of 10,121,000 2017: 9,864,000 recognised in employee costs note 7, comprise 9,803,000 2017: 9,463,000 related to defined contribution plans and 318,000 2017: 401,000 related to defined benefit plans.
Defined contribution plans The amount charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in respect of defined contribution plans was 9,803,000 2017: 9,463,000 and represents contributions payable to these plans by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.
The assets of the plans are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
Where there are employees who leave the plans prior to vesting fully in the contributions, the ancillary contributions payable by the Group may be reduced by the amount of forfeited contributions.
Defined benefit plans The Groups significant defined benefit plans are for qualifying employees of its UK subsidiaries.
Under the plans, the employees are entitled to retirement benefits of up to two thirds of final pensionable salary on attainment of a retirement age of 60, for members of the Executive Board, and 65, for all other qualifying employees.
No other post-retirement benefits are provided.
The plans are funded plans.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Halma Group Pension Plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation was carried out at 1 December 2014 by Mr. Adrian Gibbons, Fellow of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, was measured using the projected unit credit method.
The projected unit credit method is an accrued benefits valuation method in which the plan liabilities make allowance for projected earnings.
Mr. Gibbons also carried out the 1 April 2015 actuarial valuation of the Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan on the same basis.
The current triennial valuations for both schemes, are underway as at 1 December 2017 and 1 April 2018 respectively.
An alternative to the projected unit credit method is a valuation on a solvency basis, often estimated using the cost of buying out benefits at the balance sheet date with a suitable insurance company.
This amount represents the amount that would be required to settle the plan liabilities at the balance sheet date rather than the Group continuing to fund the ongoing liabilities of the plan.

The results of these reviews are used to assist the trustees and the Group to determine the optimal long-term asset allocation with regard to the structure of the liabilities of the plan.
They are also used to assist the trustees in managing the volatility in the underlying investment performance and risk of a significant increase in the defined benefit deficit by providing information used to determine the plans investment strategy.
As a consequence, the Group is progressively giving more emphasis to a closer return matching of plan assets and liabilities, both to ensure the long-term security of its defined benefit commitment and to reduce earnings and balance sheet volatility.
The five-year history of experience adjustments was as follows: 31 March 1 April 2 April 28 March 29 March 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 000 000 000 000 000 Present value of defined benefit obligations 325,628 339,889 274,186 291,596 227,358 Fair value of plan assets 271,732 265,033 221,863 224,806 190,509 Deficit in the plan 53,896 74,856 52,323 66,790 36,849 Experience adjustments on plan liabilities Amount 1,004 263 2,709 4,271 Percentage of plan liabilities 0% 0% 1 % 1% Experience adjustments on plan assets Amount 209 32,610 10,128 22,031 30 Percentage of plan assets 0% 12% 5 % 10% Based on the most recent actuarial valuation, the estimated amount of contributions expected to be paid to the UK and Swiss plans during the year ended 31 March 2018 is 11,700,000.
The levels of contributions are based on the current service cost and the expected future cash flows of the defined benefit pension plans.
The Group estimates the plan liabilities on average to fall due over 20 and 25 years, respectively, for the Halma and Apollo plans.
The Group has considered the requirements of IFRIC 14 with respect to the UK plans and in particular the need to recognise an additional liability in respect of any minimum funding requirements.
The Group has determined that it has an unconditional right to a refund under the plans and hence no additional liabilities are required.
29 Disposal of operations and restructuring The profit on disposal of operations shown in the year of 719,000 relates to a deemed disposal in the Groups associate, Optomed.
On 27 March 2018, Optomed completed a new share offering for 5,500,000 in which the Group did not participate.
This diluted our ownership interest to 23.3% from 26.7% realising a gain for the Group which is included as an adjusting item in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The share issue was used to fund the acquisition of a digital software company, Commit Oy.
Optomed continues to meet the tests for an associate.
During the prior year the Group restructured non-core operations in its subsidiary, Pixelteq.
The 1,910,000 loss on restructuring included in operating profit comprised fixed asset and inventory write downs and severance costs.

No final decision has yet been published, and may anyway be challenged by the UK tax authorities.
The Group has benefited from the FCPE in 2018 and prior periods by approximately 12m in respect of tax and approximately 300,000 in respect of interest.
At present the group believes no provision is required in respect of this issue.
Other contingent liabilities The Group has widespread global operations and is consequently a defendant in many legal, tax and customs proceedings incidental to those operations.
In addition, there are contingent liabilities arising in the normal course of business in respect of indemnities, warrantees and guarantees.
These contingent liabilities are not considered to be unusual in the context of the normal operating activities of the Group.
Provisions have been recognised in accordance with the Group accounting policies where required.
None of these claims are expected to result in a material gain or loss to the Group.
