The resulting valuations are cross-checked against the equivalent yields and the fair Reversionary yield Decrease Increase market values per square foot derived from comparable recent market transactions on arms length terms.
True equivalent yield Decrease Increase For properties under construction, the fair value is calculated by estimating the fair value of the completed property using the income capitalisation technique less estimated costs to completion and a risk premium.
There are inter-relationships between these inputs as they are partially determined by market conditions.
An increase in the reversionary yield may accompany an increase in gross ERV and would mitigate its impact on the fair value measurement.
These techniques are consistent with the principles in IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement and use significant unobservable inputs such that thefair value measurement of each property within the portfolio has been classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
A sensitivity analysis was performed to ascertain the impact on the fair value of a 25 basis point shift in true equivalent yield and a 2.50 psf shift in ERV.
There were no transfers between Levels 1 and 2 or between Levels 2 and 3 in the fair value hierarchy during either 2018 or 2017.
