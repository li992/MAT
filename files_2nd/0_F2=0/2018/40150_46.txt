Tokens are typically redeemed within five years of issue.
The insurance provisions relate to insurance reserves on incurred accidents up to the year-end in each year where claims have not been settled.
These are based on actuarial reviews and prior claims history.
Claims are typically settled within five years of origination.
Information on estimation uncertainty regarding insurance provisions is included in note 1.
The environmental provisions relate to legal or constructive obligations to undertake environmental work, such as an obligation to rectify land which has been contaminated by fuel or to eliminate the presence of asbestos.
The provision is based on the estimated cost of undertaking the work required, and is expected to be utilised over the next five years.
The redundancy provision relates to planned redundancies and is expected to be utilised within one year.
Provisions for onerous contracts relate to contracts where the anticipated costs of fulfilling the contract outweigh the economic benefits to be received, which includes contracts that have been acquired through business combinations that have been identified as being on unfavourable terms at the relevant acquisition date.
Of the onerous contract provision as at 28 April 2018, 59.1m 2017: 84.1m relates to the subsidiary, East Coast Main Line Company Limited, which traded as Virgin Trains East Coast.
Further details on this are provided in note 15.
Note 23Retirement benefits a Description of retirement benefit arrangements United Kingdom funded schemes The Group participates in a number of pension schemes.
The principal defined benefit schemes are as follows: Date as at which last scheme valuation was prepared The Stagecoach Group Pension Scheme SPS : 30 April 2014 The South West Trains section of the Railways Pension Scheme RPS until August 2017 : 31 December 2013 The Island Line section of the Railways Pension Scheme RPS until August 2017 : 31 December 2013 The East Midlands Trains section of the Railways Pension Scheme RPS : 31 December 2013 The East Coast Main Line section of the Railways Pension Scheme RPS until June 2018 : and 31 December 2013 A number of UK Local Government Pension Schemes LGPS.
31 March 2016 The Stagecoach Group Pension Scheme is comprised of two sections, the main section and a separate East London and Selkent section.
The Stagecoach Group Pension Scheme and the Local Government Pension Schemes are closed to new members from the Group.
The main section of the Stagecoach Group Pension Scheme closed to future accrual in April 2017.
The East London and Selkent section is closed to new entrants but is open to future accrual for the existing remaining members.
All relevant sections of the Railways Pension Schemes are open to new members.
For the defined benefit schemes, benefits are related to length of service and pensionable salary.
Pensionable salary for the Stagecoach Group Pension Scheme is subject to capped increases.
The weighted average duration as at 28 April 2018 of the expected benefit payments across all UK defined benefit schemes is estimated at 16 years 2017: 20 years.
The Directors believe that separate consideration should be given to the RPS as the Group has no rights or obligations in respect of the relevant sections of the scheme following expiry of the related rail franchises.
In addition, under the terms of the RPS, any fund deficit or surplus is shared by the employer 60% and the employees 40% in accordance with the shared cost nature of the RPS.
The employees share of the deficit or surplus is reflected as an adjustment to the RPS liabilities or assets.
Therefore the liability or asset recognised for the relevant sections of the RPS reflects that part of the net deficit or surplus of each section that the employer is expected to fund or expected to recover over the life of the franchise to which the section relates.
The adjusting entry referred to as the franchise adjustment represents that proportion of the deficit or surplus that is expected to exist at the end of the franchise and which the Group would not be obliged to fund or entitled to recover.
The directors consider that the accounting policy for the Group's participation in the RPS involves significant accounting judgements as explained in note 1.
The Group is a participant in the Omnibus section of the RPS and this section is not open to new members.
The Groups obligations to the Omnibus section are not time-limited in the way explained above for other sections of the RPS.
In the tables in this note 23, the Omnibus section is included within the figures for Other schemes.
United Kingdom funded schemes The Group is a participating employer in a number of UK Local Government Pension Schemes, and has limited influence over the operations of these schemes.
Active membership of these schemes is small and represents 1.3% 2017: 1.2% of the pensions charge in the consolidated income statement, but historic liabilities mean that these schemes represent around 10.4% 2017: 7.6% of the gross present value of pension obligations as at 28 April 2018 shown in the consolidated balance sheet.
The Group liaises with the administering authorities to seek to set contributions at appropriate levels to fund the benefits and deficit recovery payments over a reasonable period of time.
There is no right for the Group to receive any surplus in the schemes, although there is an obligation on the Group to fully fund the benefits.
To reflect this, the Group would only recognise existing surpluses relating to these schemes, to the extent that these surpluses could be recouped through the reduction of future contributions.
The contributions schedules for the LGPS include deficit contributions and the present value of these contributions are reflected in the net deficit shown on the balance sheet for the Group's participation in the LGPS.
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution schemes covering UK employees, for which the Group has no further payment obligation once the contributions are paid other than lump-sum death in service benefits that are provided for certain UK employees.

The Group also operates defined contribution schemes which are open to eligible North American employees, for which the Group has no further payment obligation once the contributions are paid.
Unfunded schemes The Group provides benefits under an unapproved employer-financed retirement benefit scheme EFRBS in the UK and a non qualifying defined contribution scheme NQDC in the US.
In each case, the liabilities of these schemes are unfunded, as no contributions are made to any scheme, but the Group has set aside assets to meet its obligations under the schemes.
In the case of the EFRBS, the scheme may hold a guarantee over the assets which the Group has set aside.
The Group considers that the assets set aside are in substance pensions assets and so the amounts of those assets are included within the net pension amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet.
The carrying value of those assets as at 28 April 2018 was 7.2m 2017: 6.5m.
Other unfunded benefits are provided to a small number of former employees with the net liabilities included within the unfunded balance reported in the tables that follow.
b Principal actuarial assumptions The principal actuarial assumptions used in determining the pensions amounts as at 28 April 2018 and 29 April 2017 are shown below: 2018 2017 Discount rate 2.8% 2.8% Retail Prices inflation assumption 3.2% 3.4% Consumer Prices inflation assumption 2.0% 2.1% Rate of increase in pensionable salaries SPS 0.5% 0.5% Others 2.5% 2.6% Rate of increase of pensions in payment SPS 3.1% 3.3% Others 2.0% 2.1% Life expectancies in years Current pensioners at 65 male 20.6 20.5 Current pensioners at 65 female 22.8 22.7 Future pensioners at 65 aged 45 now male 22.0 21.9 Future pensioners at 65 aged 45 now female 24.4 24.3 Future accrual is limited to participation in the East London and Selkent section of SPS, where annual increases in pensionable salaries are capped at 0.5%.
The Directors consider pension assumptions, such as those summarised above, to be a key source of estimation uncertainty as explained in note 1.
The assumptions shown above are chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the long-term nature of the schemes, may not be borne out in practice.
The discount rate assumption is not determined using a cash-weighted method and is based on market yields on high quality corporate bonds at the year end, adjusted to reflect the duration of the schemes liabilities.
The post-retirement life expectancy assumptions have been chosen with regard to the latest available published tables adjusted to reflect the experience of the Group and its sector and allow for expected increases in life expectations.

The LGPS assets are not sectionalised and so assets are effectively co-mingled with other participating employers.
Therefore, the Companys asset value is a notional value based on a share of fund calculation which is undertaken by the LGPS Fund Actuary.
The vast majority of assets held by the LGPS arrangements are invested in pooled funds with a quoted market price.
We have therefore allocated our holdings between the various asset categories in proportion to that of the overall LGPS funds in which we participate.

Trustees are required to regularly review investment strategy in light of the term and nature of the schemes liabilities.
The regulatory framework in the UK requires the Trustees of the Stagecoach Group Pension Scheme and the Group to agree upon the assumptions underlying the funding target, and then to agree upon the contributions necessary to fund the benefits, including any deficit recovery amounts, over a reasonable period of time.
A Pensions Oversight Committee has been established comprising the Finance Director, a Non-Executive Director and other senior executives, to oversee the Groups overall pensions strategy.
The Board participates in major decisions on the funding and design of pension schemes.
There is a risk to the Group that adverse experience could lead to a requirement for the Group to make additional contributions to fund deficits.
The defined benefit pension schemes typically expose the Group to actuarial funding risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk, and life expectancy risk.
There are particular funding risks with the Local Government Pension Schemes to which the Group contributes.
The Group has limited ability to influence the funding strategy of these schemes.
Furthermore, the contributions that the Group is required to make to the schemes are determined by the schemes, which tend to take a cautious approach in setting contribution rates for non-government employers.
This can result in the Group being required to make higher levels of contributions than it believes is necessary or desirable.
Known future contribution levels are taken account of in determining the reported deficit or surplus in each scheme in these consolidated financial statements.
8.3 of this Annual Report, the Directors are focused on maintaining an investment grade credit rating and the three main credit rating agencies continue to assign investment grade credit ratings to the Group.
Each of the credit rating agencies include pension amounts as debt in assessing the Groups credit worthiness and consider pensions funding risks as part of their wider risk assessment.
Pension contributions are determined with the advice of independent qualified actuaries on the basis of regular valuations using the projected unit method.
The actuarial valuation for the East London and Selkent Pension Scheme was completed in 2015, and showed that as at 5 April 2013, the scheme was 100% funded on the Trustees technical provisions basis.
The 5 April 2013 valuation was the final valuation for the scheme prior to its merger with the Stagecoach Group Pension Scheme.
Actuarial valuations were completed for the Local Government Pension Schemes, showing that the schemes were underfunded on the technical provisions basis as at 31 March 2016 with deficit contributions payable.
The actuarial valuation for the Stagecoach Group Pension Scheme showed that as at 30 April 2014, the scheme was 111% funded on the Trustees technical provisions basis.
The Group forecasts to contribute 18.9m forecast at 29 April 2017 for year ended 28 April 2018: 42.1m to its defined benefit schemes in the financial year ending 27 April 2019. e Changes in net retirement benefit obligations The change in net liabilities recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit schemes is comprised as follows: Funded schemes Unfunded SPS RPS LGPS Other schemes Total Year ended 28 April 2018 m m m m m m At beginning of year liability asset 251.8 45.1 17.5 4.0 4.3 232.5 Expense charged to consolidated income statement 12.0 41.7 1.2 2.2 0.1 57.2 Recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 134.7 27.8 0.9 0.5 0.2 106.7 Employers contributions and settlements 3.5 28.6 7.6 0.9 0.2 40.8 At end of year liability asset 125.6 4.2 12.0 4.8 4.0 142.2 Funded schemes Unfunded SPS RPS LGPS Other schemes Total Year ended 29 April 2017 m m m m m m At beginning of year liability asset 110.2 24.4 4.3 2.8 3.8 96.7 Expense charged to consolidated income statement 22.5 48.6 1.1 1.7 0.1 74.0 Recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 135.3 28.8 19.9 0.5 0.7 127.6 Employers contributions and settlements 16.2 40.5 7.8 1.0 0.3 65.8 At end of year liability asset 251.8 45.1 17.5 4.0 4.3 232.5 page 114 | Stagecoach Group plc 159166 STC AR18 Back PRINT 159166 STC AR18 Back v19 05 07 2018 16:01 Page 115 Note 23Retirement benefits continued f Sensitivity of retirement benefit obligations to changes in assumptions The measurement of the defined benefit obligations is particularly sensitive to changes in key assumptions as described below: The discount rate has been selected following actuarial advice and taking into account the duration of the liabilities.
A 10 basis points increase in the discount rate would result in a 20.2m decrease in the net pension liabilities as at 28 April 2018 2017: 28.3m.
A 10 basis points decrease in the discount rate would result in a 19.4m increase in the net pension liabilities as at 28 April 2018 2017: 28.9m.
The inflation assumption adopted is consistent with the discount rate used.
It is used to set the assumptions for pension increases, pensionable salary increases and deferred revaluations.
A 10 basis points increase in the inflation rate would result in a 21.5m increase in the net pension liabilities as at 28 April 2018 2017: 22.2m.
A 10 basis points decrease in the inflation rate would result in a 21.3m decrease in the net pension liabilities as at 28 April 2018 2017: 21.9m.
A 10 basis point increase in the rate of increase in pensionable salaries would result in a 1.0m increase in the net pension liabilities as at 28 April 2018 2017: 1.8m.
A 10 basis point decrease in the rate of increase in pensionable salaries would result in a 1.0m decrease in the net pension liabilities as at 28 April 2018 2017: 1.8m.
A 10 basis point increase in the rate of increase of pensions in payment would result in a 12.0m increase in the net pension liabilities as at 28 April 2018 2017: 12.0m.
A 10 basis point decrease in the rate of increase of pensions in payment would result in a 12.0m decrease in the net pension liabilities as at 28 April 2018 2017: 12.0m.
The life expectancy assumptions adopted are a best estimate of the life expectancies of scheme members both during and after employment, and are based on the most recent life expectancy data available from actuarial valuations.
If life expectancy of the relevant individuals was to increase by one year, this would result in an increase of 52.4m in the net pension liabilities as at 28 April 2018 2017: 56.5m.
If life expectancy of the relevant individuals was to decrease by one year, this would result in a decrease of 52.4m in the net pension liabilities as at 28 April 2018 2017: 56.3m.
These sensitivities have been calculated to show the movement in the net liability in isolation, and assuming no other changes in market conditions at the balance sheet date.
In practice, a change in discount rate is unlikely to occur without any movement in the value of the invested assets held by the schemes.
