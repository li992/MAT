The Groups market risk is managed by the Investment Manager in accordance with the policies and procedures in place.

Financial risk management continued Price risk Price risk is dened as the risk that the fair value of a financial instrument held by the Group will uctuate.
Investments are measured at fair value through profit or loss and are valued on an unlevered, discounted cashow basis.
Therefore, the value of these investments will be amongst other risk factors a function of the discounted value of their expected cashows and, as such, will vary with movements in interest rates and competition for such assets.
As disclosed in note 9, the discount factors are subjective and therefore it is feasible that a reasonable alternative assumption may be used resulting in a different valuation for these investments.
Interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk on interest bearing financial assets is limited to interest earned on cash.
The Groups only other exposure to interest rate risk is due to oating interest rates required to service external borrowings through the revolving credit facility.
represents the Investment Managers assessment of a reasonably possible change in interest rates.
Should the LIBOR rate increase from 0.7 per cent.
the annual interest due on the facility would increase by 800,000 2017: 1,650,000.
The Investment Manager regularly monitors interest rates to ensure the Group has adequate provisions in place in the event of significant uctuations.
The associated interest rate swaps on amounts drawn under the CBA, CIBC and NAB term debt facilities effectively sets interest payable at a xed rate for the full term of the loans, thereby mitigating the risks associated with the variability of cashows arising from interest rate uctuations.
The Board considers that, as shareholder loan investments bear interest at a xed rate, they do not carry any interest rate risk.
