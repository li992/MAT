Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information 149 Notes to the Financial Statements E. Alternative Performance Measures Definitions and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures The Group uses a number of measures to present the financial performance of the business which are not GAAP measures as defined under IFRS.
Management believes these measures provide valuable additional information for users of the financial statements in order to understand the underlying trading performance.
The Groups internal strategic planning process is also based on these measures and they are used for incentive purposes.
They should be viewed as complements to, and not replacements for, the comparable GAAP measures.
Constant exchange rates CER Given the international nature of the Groups operations, foreign exchange movements can have a significant impact on the reported results of the Group when they are translated into sterling the functional reporting currency of the Group.
In order to help understand the underlying trading performance of the business, unless otherwise stated, percentage movements for revenue and profit measures are presented at constant exchange rates CER.
Constant exchange rates are calculated by retranslating current year reported numbers at the full year average exchange rates for the prior year, in order to give management and other users of the accounts better visibility of underlying trading performance against the prior period.
Comparisons are to the year ended 31 December 2017 2017 unless otherwise stated.
Ongoing Revenue and Ongoing Operating Profit Ongoing Revenue and Ongoing Operating Profit represent the performance of the continuing operations of the Group including acquisitions after removing the effect of disposed or closed businesses.
Ongoing Operating Profit is an adjusted measure and is presented before amortisation and impairment of intangible assets excluding computer software, one-off items see below, gain or loss on disposal of businesses, and add-back of depreciation on held-for-sale assets.
Ongoing measures enable the users of the accounts to focus on the performance of the businesses retained by the Group and that will therefore contribute to future performance.
Ongoing Revenue and Ongoing Operating Profit are presented at CER unless otherwise stated.
A reconciliation of Ongoing Revenue and Ongoing Operating Profit measures to the equivalent GAAP measure is provided in the table below and in the segmental analysis in Note A1.
Adjusted profit and earnings per share measures Adjusted profit measures are used to give management and other users of the accounts a clear understanding of the underlying profitability of the business over time.
Adjusted profit measures are calculated by adding the following items back to the equivalent GAAP profit measure: Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets excluding computer software One-off items operating and associates including the pension settlement on buy out of the UK RIPS Net profit on disposal of businesses Net interest credit from pensions Interest fair value adjustments Intangible assets excluding computer software are recognised on the acquisition of businesses which, by their nature, can vary by size and amount each year.
As a result, amortisation of intangibles is added back to assist with the understanding of the underlying trading performance of the business and to allow comparability across regions and categories.
One-off items are significant expenses or income which will have a distortive impact on the underlying profitability of the Group.
Typical examples are costs related to the acquisition of businesses including aborted acquisitions, gain or loss on disposal or closure of a business, material gains or losses on disposal of fixed assets, adjustments to legacy property-related provisions vacant property and environmental liabilities, and payments or receipts as a result of legal disputes.
Similar adjustments where appropriate are also made to the share of profits from associates.
Other non-cash gains and losses that can cause material fluctuations and distort understanding of the performance of the business such as net interest on pension schemes and interest fair value adjustments are also adjusted.
The net profit on disposal of businesses of nil 2017: 449.0m and the pension settlement non-cash of 341.6m 2017: nil have been separately presented on the face of the profit and loss below operating profit.
Restructuring costs are presented in the segmental analysis in order to provide comparability.
Adjusted earnings per share is calculated by dividing adjusted profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue.
Note A2 shows the adjustments made in arriving at adjusted profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the Company.
