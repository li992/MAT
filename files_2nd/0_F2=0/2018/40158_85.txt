Investments in subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates Accounting policy Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are all entities, including structured entities, which the Group controls.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
The assessment of power is based on the Groups practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the entity unilaterally for the Groups own benefit and is subject to reassessment if and when one or more of the elements of control change.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which the Group effectively obtains control.
They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases, and where any interest in the subsidiary remains, this is remeasured to its fair value and the change in carrying amount is recognised in the income statement.
Associates and joint arrangements Joint arrangements are where two or more parties either have rights to the assets, and obligations of the joint arrangement joint operations, or have rights to the net assets of the joint arrangement joint venture.
The Group evaluates the contractual terms of joint arrangements to determine whether a joint arrangement is a joint operation or a joint venture.
As at 31 December 2017, the Group did not have any contractual interest in joint operations.
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost.
The Groups investment in associates and joint ventures includes goodwill identified on acquisition net of any accumulated impairment loss.
The Groups share of its associates and joint ventures post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the income statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in reserves.
The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment.
When the Groups share of losses in an associate or a joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.
Unrealised gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the associates and joint ventures.
At each balance sheet date the Group assesses whether there is any objective evidence of impairment in the investment in associates and joint ventures.
Such evidence includes a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the Groups investment in an associate or joint venture below its cost, among other factors.
Significant accounting estimates and judgements The Group applies judgement in determining if it has control, joint control or significant influence over subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates respectively.
These judgements are based upon identifying the relevant activities of counterparties, being those activities that significantly affect the entities returns, and further making a decision of if the Group has control over those entities, joint control, or has significant influence being the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions but not control them.
These judgements are at times determined by equity holdings, and the voting rights associated with those holdings.
However, further considerations including but not limited to board seats, advisory committee members and specialist knowledge of some decision-makers are also taken into account.
Impairment testing of investments in associates and joint arrangements is based on estimates including forecasting the expected cash flows from the investments and the discount rate used in calculation of the present values of those cash flows.
The estimation of future cash flows and the level to which they are discounted is inherently uncertain and requires significant judgement.
