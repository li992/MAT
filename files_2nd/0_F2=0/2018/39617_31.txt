The tax-only adjustments comprise: the impact of the closure of the RMPP to future accrual from 31 March 2018 of 78 million credit 2016-17: nil million : the impact of property transactions of 2 million credit 2016-17: 2 million credit : and the impact of changes in tax law of 4 million charge 2016-17: 9 million credit.
Effective tax rate The Group reported tax in the income statement was a credit of 46 million on a reported profit of 212 million.
This arises mainly due to the one-off deferred tax credit of 78 million related to the closure of the RMPP to future accrual after 31 March 2018.
GLS pays tax in a number of territories.
The majority of its profits in the reporting year to 25 March 2018 were earned in territories where the tax rate is above the UK statutory tax rate.
Certain subsidiaries, notably GLS France, continue to not recognise deferred tax credits on losses made during the reporting year as they are not sufficiently certain of their capacity to utilise them in the future.
These factors contribute to GLS having a higher effective tax rate for the year than the UK statutory rate.

Taxation continued The deferred tax position shows a decreased overall liability in the reporting year to 25 March 2018.
This decrease in the liability is primarily as a result of the closure of the RMPP to future accrual after 31 March 2018.
GLS has deferred tax assets and liabilities in various jurisdictions which cannot be offset against one another.
The main elements of the liability relate to goodwill and intangible assets in GLS Germany, for which the Group has already taken tax deductions, and intangible assets in relation to acquisitions in Spain and the US.
At 25 March 2018, the Group had unrecognised deferred tax assets of 83 million 2016-17: 73 million comprising 78 million 2016-17: 68 million relating to tax losses of 300 million 2016-17: 259 million, mainly in GLS, that are available for offset against future profits if generated in the relevant GLS companies, and 5 million 2016-17: 5 million in relation to 29 million 2016-17: 30 million of UK capital losses carried forward.
The Group has not recognised these deferred tax assets on the basis that it is not sufficiently certain of its capacity to utilise them in the future.
The Group also has temporary differences in respect of 202 million 2016-17: 211 million of capital losses, the tax effect of which is 34 million 2016-17: 36 million in respect of assets previously qualifying for industrial buildings allowances.
Further temporary differences exist in relation to 406 million 2016-17: 212 million of gains for which rollover relief has been claimed, the tax effect of which is 69 million 2016-17: 36 million.
No tax liability would be expected to crystallise on the basis that, were the assets into which the gains have been rolled over to be sold at their residual values, no capital gain would arise.
Changes to UK corporation tax rate The UK corporation tax rate reduced from 20 per cent to 19 per cent on 1 April 2017 and it will reduce to 17 per cent on 1 April 2020.
In the future, this will reduce the Groups current tax charge accordingly.
In accordance with accounting standards, the effect of these rate reductions on deferred tax balances has been reflected in these financial statements, dependent upon when temporary differences are expected to reverse.
Earnings per share This Note explains the calculation of the Groups earnings per share.
The adjusted earnings per share a non-IFRS measure is a key indicator used by Management to assess earnings performance.

2 The employer contribution cash flow rate 17.1 per cent in both the current and prior year forms part of the payroll expense and is paid in respect of the RMPP.
This includes payments into RMPP pension escrow investments.
The contribution rate is set following each actuarial funding valuation, usually every three years.

Retirement benefit plans continued In the period, the Group operated the following plans.
UK Defined Contribution plan Royal Mail Group Limited, the Companys main operating subsidiary, operates the Royal Mail Defined Contribution Plan RMDCP.
This plan was launched in April 2009 and is open to employees who joined the Group from 31 March 2008, following closure of the RMPP to new members.
Ongoing UK defined contribution plan costs have increased from 82 million in 2016-17 to 93 million including 36 million PSE costs.
This is mainly due to the continued increase in plan membership and an increase in the average employers contribution rate from 6.0 per cent in 2016-17 to 6.3 per cent in 2017-18.
UK Defined Benefit plans Royal Mail Pension Plan RMPP The RMPP is funded by the payment of contributions to separate trustee administered funds.
RMPP includes sections A, B and C, each with different terms and conditions.
Benefits provided are based on final salary in respect of service to 31 March 2008, and on career salary blocks for each year of service, revalued annually, for service from 1 April 2008.
Royal Mail Pensions Trustees Limited acts as the corporate Trustee to the RMPP.
Within the Trustee, there is a Trustee Board of nine nominated Trustee Directors.
The Trustee Board is supported by an executive team of pension management professionals.
They provide day-to-day plan management, advise the Trustee on its responsibilities and ensure that decisions are fully implemented.
The Trustee has several responsibilities.
It must always act in the best interests of all RMPP beneficiaries including active members, deferred members, pensioners and beneficiaries.
Specifically, it must pay all benefits as they fall due under the Trust Deed and Rules.
The Trustee is responsible for: monitoring the RMPP - to help protect benefits, the Trustee monitors the financial strength of the participating employers: investing contributions - the Trustee invests the member and employer contributions in a mix of equities, bonds, property and other investments including derivatives.
It holds the contributions and investments on behalf of the members: and keeping members informed - the Trustee sends active members an annual benefit illustration together with a summary of the RMPPs annual report and accounts.
Royal Mail Senior Executives Pension Plan RMSEPP Royal Mail Group Limited also contributes to a smaller defined benefit plan for executives: RMSEPP.
This closed in December 2012 to future accrual, therefore the Group makes no regular future service contributions.
Under the February 2013 Funding Agreement with the Trustee, the Group agreed to make deficit correction payments of 10 million per annum until at least the date on which the 2018 valuation is completed.
Deficit correction payments in 2017-18 were 10 million 2016-17: 10 million.
The Group has now agreed a new Funding Agreement dated 27 March 2018.
Consistent with that, a new Schedule of Contributions was agreed for the period 29 March 2018 to 31 March 2025.
No further deficit payments will be paid in respect of the period after 31 March 2018.
Payments of 1 million per annum will be paid for the period 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2025 in respect of the continued provision of death-in-service lump sum benefits and expenses of administering the Plan.
In April 2016, the RMSEPP Trustee purchased a buy-in policy of insurance in respect of pensions in payment to its oldest members.
This is considered an asset of the RMSEPP and does not confer any rights to individual members.
All benefit payments due from the RMSEPP remain unchanged.
The insurance policy exactly matches the value and timing of the benefits payable under the RMSEPP for the oldest members.
The fair value is deemed to be the present value of the related obligation.
The buy-in policy valued at 148 million is included as a pension asset and a pension liability at 25 March 2018.
A liability of 2 million 2016-17: 2 million has been recognised for future payment of pension benefits to a past Director.
2018 Pensions Review In January 2017, the Company consulted RMPP members about its proposal for the future of the RMPP.
The consultation closed on 10 March 2017.
Following a review of member feedback, on 13 April 2017, the Company announced that it had not found an affordable way to keep the RMPP open 3 in its current form after March 2018.
It therefore made the decision to close the RMPP to future accrual in its current form on 31 March 2018.
On 8 May 2017, after the 2016-17 balance sheet date, agreement was reached between the Company and the RMPP Trustee on the March 2015 actuarial funding valuation and a revised Schedule of Contributions.
In accordance with this Schedule of Contributions, the service contribution rate for 2017-18 remained at 17.1 per cent.
The March 2015 valuation continued to show the plan in surplus and therefore no deficit correction payments were required.
An agreement has been made with the Pension Trustee to ringfence certain employer contributions in an escrow arrangement in order to give the Trustee and the Company more flexibility over how these assets are best used for the benefit of members in future.
3 The decision was made to close Sections B and C of the RMPP to future defined benefit pension accrual.
Section A of the Plan which has a small number of active members remains open to future accrual.
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017-18 | 121 Royal Mail plc | Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 9.
Retirement benefit plans continued One week of RMPP service contributions was paid during 2018-19 up to when the scheme closed on 31 March 2018.
This payment was paid at 17.1 per cent in accordance with the 8 May 2017 Schedule of Contributions.
As the March 2015 valuation continued to show the scheme in surplus, no deficit correction payments are expected to be made.
Future pension arrangements A new Defined Benefit Cash Balance Scheme DBCBS has been put in place from 1 April 2018.
This is a transitional arrangement until the proposed Collective Defined Contribution CDC scheme can be established.
Improvements to the RMDCP are also being made.
Further details can be found in the Financial Review.
The Company signed a new Schedule of Contributions on 27 March 2018.
This covers the period of five years from the date of certification of the schedule i. e. until March 2023.
In accordance with this schedule, the Company is required to make payments totalling 15.6 per cent per annum in respect of DBCBS.
In 2018-19 the Company expects to contribute around 400 million in respect of all UK pension schemes.
This amount comprises 350 million in respect of RMPP, RMSEPP and DBCBS and 50 million in respect of RMDCP.
Employees are expected to contribute around 135 million, including through PSE.
Accounting and actuarial funding surplus position RMPP and RMSEPP In addition to the accounting valuations calculated in accordance with IAS 19, actuarial funding valuations are carried out every three years by actuaries commissioned by trustees for purposes of calculating contributions and funding requirements.
The main difference between the accounting and actuarial funding valuations is that different rates are used to discount the projected scheme liabilities.
The accounting valuation uses yields on high quality corporate bonds.
The actuarial funding valuation uses gilt yields.
The combined plans assets and liabilities on an accounting IAS 19 basis and on an actuarial funding basis based on an approximate update of the principles and assumptions relevant to the 2015 actuarial funding valuation are shown below.
Accounting IAS 19 Actuarial funding At 25 March At 26 March At 31 March At 31 March 2018 2017 2018 2017 m m m m 4 Fair value of plans assets 9 b below 10,361 9,847 10,461 10,066 Present value of plans liabilities 7,038 5,992 10,318 8,984 Surplus in plans pre IFRIC 14 adjustment 3,323 3,855 143 1,082 IFRIC 14 adjustment 1,160 16 n a n a Surplus in plans 2,163 3,839 143 1,082 4 Difference between accounting and actuarial funding asset fair values arises from the different year end dates used for the valuation of the assets under both methods.
There is no element of the present value of the plans liabilities above that arises from plans that are wholly unfunded.
The Directors do not believe that the current excess of plans assets over the liabilities on an accounting basis will result in an excess of pension assets on an actuarial funding basis.
However, the Directors are required to account for the plans based on their legal right to benefit from a surplus, using long-term actuarial funding assumptions current at the reporting date, as required by IFRS.
As the Group has a legal right to benefit from a surplus, under IAS 19 and IFRIC 14, it must recognise the economic benefit assumed to arise from either a reduction to its future contributions or a refund of the surplus.
This is a technical adjustment made on an accounting basis.
There is no cash benefit from the surplus.
The legal right to benefit from a surplus has not changed as a result of the Companys decision to close the RMPP from 31 March 2018.
However, after that date, any surplus will no longer be assumed to be recoverable as a reduction to future employer contributions.
Therefore, at 25 March 2018 only one week of economic benefit is recoverable as a reduction to future employer contributions.
The remaining surplus is assumed to be available as a refund.
This surplus is presented net of an IFRIC 14 adjustment of 1,134 million 2016-17: nil million on the balance sheet, which represents the taxation that would be withheld on the surplus amount.
Included in the IAS 19 figures in the table above is an RMSEPP surplus at 25 March 2018 of 73 million pre IFRIC 14 2016-17: 47 million surplus.
As RMSEPP is closed to future accrual, the surplus is assumed to be available as a refund as per IFRIC 14 and, as such, is shown net of taxation withheld in both years.

Retirement benefit plans continued The following disclosures relate to the major assumptions, sensitivities, assets and liabilities in the RMPP and RMSEPP and DBCBS assumptions.
a Major long-term assumptions used for accounting IAS 19 purposes RMPP, RMSEPP and DBCBS IAS 19 assumptions will be derived separately for the legacy RMPP and DBCBS, in particular taking into account the different weighted durations of the future benefit payments.
RMSEPP will continue in line with legacy RMPP benefits.
The major assumptions used to calculate the accounting position of the pension plans are as follows: At 25 March At 26 March 2018 2017 Retail Price Index RPI 3.1% 3.2% Consumer Price Index CPI 2.1% 2.2% 5 Discount rate nominal 2.4% 2.5% real nominal less RPI 0.7% 0.7% 6 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries RPI0.1% RPI0.1% Rate of increase for deferred pensions CPI CPI Rate of pension increases RMPP Sections A B CPI CPI 6 Rate of pension increases RMPP Section C RPI0.1% RPI0.1% Rate of pension increases RMSEPP members transferred from Section A or B of RMPP CPI CPI 6 Rate of pension increases RMSEPP all other members RPI0.1% RPI0.1% Rate of pension increases DBCBS benefits CPI 2.0% - Life expectancy from age 60 for a current 40 60 year old male RMPP member 28 26 years 28 26 years Life expectancy from age 60 for a current 40 60 year old female RMPP member 31 29 years 31 29 years 5 The discount rate reflects the long average duration of the RMPP of around 30 years.
Whilst DBCBS benefits have a significantly shorter average duration 11 years, the same discount rate is justified.
6 The rate of increase in salaries, and the rate of pension increase for Section C members who joined RMPP on or after April 1987 and RMSEPP all other members, is capped at five per cent, which results in the average long-term pension increase assumption being 10 basis points lower than the RPI long-term assumption.
Mortality The RMPP assumptions are based on the latest Self-Administered Pension Scheme SAPS S2 mortality tables with appropriate scaling factors 116 per cent for male pensioners and 109 per cent for female pensioners.
Future improvements are based on the CMI 2015 core projections with a long-term trend of 1.5 per cent per annum.
Sensitivity analysis for RMPP liabilities The RMPP liabilities are sensitive to changes in key assumptions.
The potential impact of the largest sensitivities on the RMPP liabilities is as follows: Potential increase in liabilities Key assumption change m Additional one year of life expectancy 240 Increase in inflation rate both RPI and CPI simultaneously of 0.1% p. a.
180 Decrease in discount rate of 0.1% p. a.
180 Increase in CPI assumption assuming RPI remains constant of 0.1% p. a.
35 This sensitivity analysis has been determined based on a method that assesses the impact on the defined benefit obligation, resulting from reasonable changes in key assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting year.
Changes inverse to those in the table e. g. an increase in discount rate would have the opposite effect on liabilities.
The average duration of the RMPP obligation is 30 years 2016-17: 30 years.
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017-18 | 123 Royal Mail plc | Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 9.
6 billion 2016-17: 5 billion of HM Government Bonds are primarily included in Unit Trusts above.
The plans assets do not include property or assets used by the Group, but do include shares of the Royal Mail plc with an approximate market value of 84,000 at 25 March 2018 2016-17: 21,000.
Risk exposure and investment strategy The investment strategy of the RMPP Trustee aims to safeguard the assets of the Plan and to provide, together with contributions, the financial resource from which benefits are paid.
Investments are inevitably exposed to risks.
The risks inherent in the investment markets are partially mitigated by pursuing a widely diversified approach across asset classes and investment managers.
The RMPP uses derivatives such as swaps, forwards and options, from time to time to reduce risks whilst maintaining expected investment returns.
The RMPP Trustee recognises that there is a natural conflict between improving the potential for positive return and limiting the potential for poor return.
The RMPP Trustee has specified objectives for the investment policy that seeks to balance these requirements.
RMPPs liabilities and assets are impacted by movements in interest rates and inflation.
In order to reduce the risk of movements in these rates driving the RMPP into a funding deficit, the RMPP Trustee has hedged the funding liabilities which it was estimated would be built up by March 2018.
It has done this predominantly through investment in index-linked gilts and derivatives interest rate and inflation rate swaps and Gilt repurchase agreements held in Unit Trust pooled investments providing economic exposure to gilts and swap rates.
The change in value of the liability-hedging assets is predominantly reflected in the Unit Trust values above, which have increased from 6,004 million at 26 March 2017 to 6,682 million at 25 March 2018.
The notional value covered by the inflation rate swaps full exposure to the relevant asset class incurred by entering into a derivative contract held in a specific managed portfolio for this purpose at 25 March 2018 was 2.4 billion 2016-17: 2.3 billion.
The notional value covered by the interest rate swaps at 25 March 2018 was 3.2 billion 2016-17: 1.9 billion.
The equity exposure of RMPP has been reduced by means of a short Total Return Swap TRS.
This is a derivative that can be used to reduce exposure to a particular asset class without selling the physical assets held.
TRS were introduced in order to reduce downside risk whilst broadly maintaining the existing expected returns.
The TRS have a market value as at 25 March 2018 of 21 million 2016-17: 17 million included in the derivative values above.
The TRS economically offset 257 million as at 25 March 2018 2016-17: 260 million of the Plans global equity market exposure.
The spread of investments continues to balance security and growth in order to pay the RMPP benefits when they become due.
In addition to holding return-seeking assets, RMSEPP holds long-dated index linked gilts of 175 million 2016-17: 26 million and the buy-in annuity policy of 148 million at 25 March 2018 2016-17: 151 million to match its liabilities.
In order to increase the level of interest rate and inflation hedging, RMSEPP has borrowed 115 million 2016-17: nil million of the UK Government Bonds it holds via Gilt repurchase agreements.
These are included in the derivative values above.

Acquisition of businesses This Note provides details of the Groups business acquisitions which relate to the acquisitions by GLS of Postal Express in the United States of America and Redyser Transporte Redyser in Spain.
Acquisitions made in the year for a total consideration of 16 million in respect of Postal Express and Redyser are detailed below.
This information includes the provisional fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities recognised as at the date of acquisition.

An initial review of trade debtors has not indicated any recoverability issues.
The intangible assets recognised at fair value on acquisition relate to customer lists, software and brands.
The goodwill of 11 million arising on these acquisitions is indicative of the acquired business knowledge of products and markets, and synergies that are expected through the integration of services.
No material fair value adjustments have been identified in respect of the remaining assets and liabilities acquired in the year.
Revenue generated from these entities since the date of acquisition is 29 million and the combined loss is 5 million.
If these combinations had taken place at the beginning of the financial year, revenue generated would have been 64 million and the combined loss would have been 4 million.
The profitability of these entities was impacted by higher operating costs as a result of integration activity.
There are no non-controlling interests in relation to these acquisitions.

The carrying value of the GLS European network, excluding interest-bearing and tax-related assets and liabilities, is 719 million 2016-17: 642 million.
The operating profit before transformation costs is 193 million 2016-17: 164 million for the year.
The carrying value of the GLS European network of 719 million represents a multiple of 3.7 2016-17: 3.9 of operating profit before transformation costs.
The recoverable amount of this CGU, being its net realisable value i. e. fair value less costs to sell for the purposes of the impairment review, has been assessed with reference to EBITDA earnings multiples for quoted entities in a similar sector of 7.3 fair value hierarchy level 2 input.
On this basis, the CGUs net realisable value has been assessed to be in excess of the carrying value.
The earnings multiples referenced would need to reduce by more than 59 per cent to 3.0 to reduce the net realisable value to below the carrying value.
A further 46 million 2016-17: 48 million of goodwill relates to the GLS US network.
This is a second GLS CGU comprising Golden State Overnight Delivery Services Inc. GSO and Postal Express.
An internal assessment by GLS management has determined that the recoverable amount of the US network, including goodwill of 46 million 2016-17 48 million, exceeds the carrying value of this CGU.
The recoverable amount of GLS US network is based on value in use, using five-year forecast cash flows, including terminal growth rates of two per cent and a pre-tax discount rate of 12.5 per cent, including a risk premium for the US.
The forecast cash flows would need to reduce by more than 30 per cent to reduce the value in use to below the carrying value.
The remaining goodwill of 17 million 2016-17: 17 million arising from an aggregation of goodwill on business acquisitions, each being a separate CGU within the UKPIL business unit, is not material in the context of the Groups total goodwill.

Employee Free Shares Employee Free Shares are held on behalf of employees in a tax-advantaged Share Incentive Plan SIP.
The shares are held in a Trust administered by Equiniti Share Plan Trustees Limited Equiniti and may only be distributed to, or for the benefit of, eligible employees.
The Trust is funded by the Company and has therefore been consolidated within these financial statements.
2013 and 2014 SIP 613 shares were awarded in October 2013 to each eligible full-time employee.
A further 116 shares were allocated to eligible full-time employees in April 2014.
Part-time eligible employees were allocated a pro-rata number of shares in both allocations.
For both full-time and part-time eligible employees, the award of shares is subject to them remaining employees of Royal Mail Group Limited over the vesting period.
The vesting period for each award is three years from the award date with all allocated shares to be equity-settled.
2015 SIP On 5 October 2015, ordinary shares representing one per cent of the Company were granted free of charge to eligible full-time employees by HM Government.
This was in addition to a portion of the unallocated shares arising from earlier SIP schemes.
Accordingly, each eligible full-time employee received 103 shares as their 2015 SIP allocation with part-time eligible employees being allocated a pro-rata number of shares.
All allocated shares will be equity-settled.
2016 SIP On 6 October 2016, ordinary shares representing one per cent of the Company were granted free of charge to eligible full-time employees by HM Government.
Accordingly, each eligible full-time employee received 81 shares as their 2016 SIP allocation with part-time eligible employees being allocated a pro-rata number of shares.

Save As You Earn SAYE share option scheme On 24 July 2014, a SAYE share option scheme was introduced for eligible employees.
Under the terms of the scheme, the Board permits the grant of options in respect of ordinary shares in the Company to those employees who enter into an HMRC-approved SAYE savings contract.
These contracts are for a term of three years, with contributions from employees of an amount between 5 and 59 each month.
The options purchased may be exercised during the six month period following the end of the contract at an exercise price of not less than 80 per cent of the average of the mid-market quotations of an ordinary Share over the three dealing days immediately preceding the offer date.
A charge to the income statement of 1 million has been made for the year ended 25 March 2018 2016-17: 2 million in relation to the SAYE scheme.
The fair values of the options have been calculated using the Black-Scholes share option pricing model.
The table below shows the movements in share options during the reporting year.
Number of options Balance at the beginning of the reporting year 12,871,610 Options exercised 8,968,438 Options expired 381,677 Options forfeited 749,015 Balance at the end of the reporting year 2,772,480 For SAYE options exercised during the year by good leavers, the weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 433.3 pence.
The weighted average exercise price for each of the above categories of share options is 360 pence.
As a result of reaching the end of the contribution period and scheme rules in relation to good leavers, 2,748,990 2016-17: 130,360 share options were exercisable at 25 March 2018 at a weighted average exercise price of 360 pence.

Assets held for sale This Note provides details of the assets classified as held for sale at the beginning and end of the reporting year.
Assets and liabilities are classified in this way when their carrying value is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable.
Their value in the balance sheet is the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
At the reporting date of 25 March 2018, only certain surplus property assets are held for sale.
The balance sheet values of the assets held for sale during the reporting year are shown below.
At 25 March At 26 March 2018 2017 m m Property assets held for sale 50 37 Total 50 37 Property assets held for sale Non-current assets held for sale of 50 million 2016-17: 37 million relate to land and buildings in UKPIL which are being actively marketed with a view to a sale within 12 months.
The carrying value relates primarily to the remaining plots at the Nine Elms site and the in-year increase represents expenditure to enhance the site.
An assessment of the fair value of the properties was made at the time of their reclassification to held for sale and no adjustment to the carrying amount of these properties was necessary.
Current trade and other receivables The following information relates to amounts owed to the Group by third-parties and also the loss allowance for bad and doubtful debts that the Group has provided for in the financial statements.

Loans and borrowings continued The 500 million bond, issued in July 2014, is shown net of issue discount and fees and at a closing spot rate of 1 1.145.
The effective interest rate on the bond 2.5 per cent consists of the interest coupon of 2.375 per cent plus the unwinding of the discount and fees on issuing the bond 0.08 per cent.
The bond is designated as a hedge of the net investment in GLS, which has the Euro as its functional currency.
During the year, a loss of 5 million 2016-17: 38 million on the retranslation of this borrowing was transferred to other comprehensive income, which offsets the gains on translation of the net investment in GLS.
There was no hedge ineffectiveness in the current or comparative reporting years.
The syndicated bank loan facility can be cancelled and any loans drawn under the facility can become repayable immediately on the occurrence of an event of default under the loan agreements.
These events of default include non-payment, insolvency and breach of covenant relating to interest excluding arrangement fees, adjusted net debt and EBITDA.
It is not anticipated that the Group is at risk of breaching any of these obligations.
The covenants require the Group to maintain the leverage ratio of adjusted net debt to EBITDA below 3:1 and EBITDA to interest excluding certain arrangement fees above 3.5:1.
Adjusted net debt consists of net debt plus Letters of Credit contingent liabilities in respect of the UKPIL insurance programme, where the possibility of an outflow of economic benefits is considered remote and is adjusted for exchange rate movements during the year.
The Groups ratio of EBITDA to interest excluding certain arrangement fees at 25 March 2018 is 38.6:1 2016-17: 53.1:1.
Accordingly, the Group comfortably meets the covenants tests within its syndicated bank loan facilities agreement.
The interest rate chargeable on the syndicated bank loan facility would increase if more than one third of the facility was drawn and also if the Group's leverage ratio exceeded 1:1.
Under the loan agreement, the maximum interest rate chargeable would be LIBOR plus 1.45 per cent.
The 500 million bond becomes repayable immediately on the occurrence of an event of default under the bond agreement.
These events of default include non-payment and insolvency.
The undrawn committed facilities, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at the balance sheet date, were 1,050 million of which 952 million are maturing in March 2022 with the remaining 98 million maturing in March 2020 2016-17: 1,018 million of which 923 million are maturing in March 2022 and 95 million maturing in March 2020.
There is no security in place under the syndicated bank loan facilities or the bond.
Financial assets and liabilities and risk management In considering the financial assets and liabilities of the Group, Management use judgment to assess the materiality to users of the financial statements, at a Group level, of each of the disclosure areas highlighted in IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures.
This assessment is based on both the magnitude and nature of the financial instruments involved and informs the level of disclosure of the risk management objectives and policies in place across the Group provided in this Note.
The following table summarises the disclosures: Disclosure requirement a Classification, carrying amount and fair values of financial assets and liabilities - Carrying amounts and fair value of each category of financial assets and liabilities.
b Movement in liabilities arising from financing activities A reconciliation of the opening and closing balances of liabilities arising from financing activities.

They were previously classified as Loans and receivables.
There was no change in their carrying or fair value on transition.
The Level classification in the above table is explained in the Fair value measurement of financial instruments section of Significant accounting policies.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance and manage the liquidity needs of the business operations.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly from operations and are not considered further in this Note.
No speculative trading in financial instruments has been undertaken during the current or comparative reporting years, in line with Group policy.

GLS functional currency is the Euro.
It also has some exposure to non-Euro currencies, principally in emerging European markets, and to the US Dollar.
Where possible, exposures are netted internally.
Any remaining exposure is hedged using a combination of external spot and forward purchase and sale contracts.
Hedging will not normally be considered for exposures of less than 1 million.
Hedging is normally confined to 80 per cent of the forecast exposure, where forecast cash flows are highly probable.
The following table shows for each hedge programme, the risk and the percentage hedged of the next 12 months exposure: Percentage of next 12 months exposure that has been hedged At 25 March At 26 March Hedge programme Risk 2018 2017 Capital programmes exchange rate movements 91% 96% Overseas postal administrations SDR exchange rate movements 21% 40% The next 12 months exposure is calculated as the combination of the cost of settling liabilities during the next 12 months and the cost of revaluing unsettled liabilities at the end of 12 months.
Foreign currency translational risk The Groups functional currency is Sterling.
GLS Euro profits are converted at the average exchange rate for the year which can result in reported growth or decline that does not relate to underlying performance.
GLS balance sheet is converted at year end exchange rates and movements related to foreign currency translation are taken to equity.
The 500 million bond issued in July 2014 acts as a hedge of part of the translation exposure created by the net assets of GLS.
Royal Mail also entered into 31 million of Euro-denominated finance leases during the year 2016-17: 30 million.
This similarly acts as a hedge of the net assets of GLS.
The remaining net assets of GLS in excess of the bond and lease payables are not hedged.
Foreign currency exchange differences arising from the translation of the net assets of GLS, the 500 million bond and the Euro-denominated finance lease payables, at closing Sterling Euro exchange rates, are deferred into equity.
These exchange differences would be released from equity to the income statement as part of the gain or loss if GLS was sold.
During the year, foreign currency exchange losses on the bond of 5 million 2016-17: 38 million and foreign exchange losses on the lease payables of 1 million 2016-17: 4 million were deferred into equity.
There was no hedge ineffectiveness in the current or prior reporting years.

Financial assets and liabilities and risk management continued The net total financial assets and liabilities are held in various different currencies as summarised in the table below.
The majority of the non-Sterling financial assets and liabilities other than the 500 million bond and 78 million of finance leases are held within cash or derivatives.

The Groups fuel risk management strategy aims to reduce uncertainty created by the movements in the oil and foreign currency markets.
The strategy uses forward commodity price swaps in US Dollar or Sterling and forward currency purchase contracts to manage these exposures.
In addition, the Group is exposed to the commodity price risk of purchasing electricity and gas.
The Groups risk management strategy aims to reduce uncertainty created by the movements in the electricity and gas markets.
These exposures are managed by locking into fixed price contracts with suppliers and using forward commodity price swaps in Sterling.
As the GLS business relies on the use of subcontractors, responsible for purchasing their own fuel, GLS has no direct exposure to diesel costs.
The only other significant commodity exposure within GLS is electricity, which is fragmented across its European bases.
In view of the other highly hedged positions, the Group takes the view that the unhedged exposure arising from the commodities in GLS does not add significant risk to the Group.
e Interest rate risk management The Groups policy is to manage its net interest expense using an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate financial instruments, combined with external hedging of interest rate risk, as appropriate, to keep a high percentage of its gross debt fixed.
At 25 March 2018, there was no external hedge of interest rate risk 2016-17: none.
Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is re-priced at intervals of less than one year.
Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
The analysis below sets out the carrying amount of the Groups financial instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk.

There are no balances outstanding at 25 March 2018 2016-17: 32 million.
The total interest-bearing financial assets of the Group excluding the RMPP and RMSEPP pension escrow investments of 477 million 2016-17: 211 million, which consist of the fixed and floating rate cash and cash equivalent investments, plus current financial asset investments, are at short-dated fixed or variable interest rates with an average maturity of four days 2016-17: an average maturity of one day.
These short-dated financial instruments are maturity-managed to obtain the best value out of the interest yield curve.
Obligations under finance leases are either unsecured or secured on the leased assets.
The average interest rate is 2.7 per cent 2016-17: 2.8 per cent.
The average maturity date is more than five years 2016-17: more than five years.
The RMPP pension escrow investment of 178 million 2016-17: nil million represents a money market fund investment, established with the agreement of the Pension Trustee for the benefit of members.
The RMSEPP pension escrow investment of 20 million 2016-17: 20 million represents a money market fund investment established to provide security to the Royal Mail Senior Executives Pension Plan RMSEPP, in support of a deficit recovery plan agreed with the Trustee in June 2013 and updated in 2018.
The next scheduled review point in the agreement is in 2025 and the investment is therefore disclosed as maturing in more than five years.
f Liquidity risk management The Groups primary objective is to ensure that the Group has sufficient funds available to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
This is achieved by aligning short-term investments and borrowing facilities with forecast cash flows.
Borrowing facilities are regularly reviewed to ensure continuity of funding.
The unused facilities for the Group of 1,050 million expire in 2020-22 2016-17: 1,018 million expiring in 2020-22.
Below is a summary of the gross undiscounted contractual cash flows of the Groups financial liabilities.
The cash flows for the 500 million bond and Euro-denominated finance leases represent the undiscounted total amounts payable interest and nominal repayment which have been converted to Sterling at 25 March 2018 market forward exchange rates.
For derivatives that are settled gross, these cash flows represent the undiscounted gross payment due and do not reflect the accompanying inflow.
For derivatives that are settled net, these cash flows represent the undiscounted forecast outflow.

The credit policy is applied rigidly within the regulated products area to ensure that UKPIL is not in breach of compliance legislation.
Assessment of credit for non-regulated products is based on commercial factors, commensurate with the Groups appetite for risk.
An analysis of aged debt is included within Note 17.
The Groups exposure to credit risk from other financial assets arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.
At 25 March 2018, 73 per cent of financial assets 2016-17: 95 per cent were held with AA or above rated counterparties.
GLS operates a decentralised credit management model, with each country responsible for managing the credit risk associated with its customers.
Where appropriate, external credit checks are performed for new and existing customers, taking into account the customer profile, expected volume of business and consequent risk to the respective GLS companies.
None of the financial assets is either past due or considered to be impaired.
h Sensitivity analysis As a result of the mix of fixed and variable rate financial instruments and the currency and commodity hedge programmes in place, the Group has no material exposure to 2017-18 operating profit risk from interest rate risk or commodity price risk 2016-17: nil million risk.
Further details of the Groups exposure to commodity price risk can be found in the Financial Review.
The Group has an exposure to the exchange rate risk on translating the GLS profits: on trading with overseas postal administrations: on various purchase contracts and on the interest on the 500 million bond and Euro-denominated finance leases.
The impact of a ten per cent strengthening of Sterling across all currencies on forecast profits trade during 2017-18 would be to reduce the Group operating profit by 3 million 2016-17: 4 million.
However, changes in exchange rates could also cause other impacts on operating profit including a change in import export volumes.
140 | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017-18 Strategic report | Governance | Financial statements | Other information Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 21.
Financial assets and liabilities and risk management continued The Group has an exposure to the exchange rate risk on translating the GLS net assets into Sterling on consolidation.
This is partially offset by an exposure on translating the 500 million bond and Euro-denominated finance leases into Sterling at each balance sheet date.
The impact of a ten per cent strengthening of Sterling against all currencies at 25 March 2018 would have been to reduce the Group net assets by 24 million 2016-17: 19 million.

Provisions continued The potential liability for industrial diseases claims relating to both current and former employees of the Group arose in 2010 as a result of a Court of Appeal judgement that held the Group liable for diseases claims brought by individuals who were employed in the General Post Office telecommunications division and whose employment ceased prior to October 1981.
Consequently, a provision was first recognised in 2010-11.
The Group has derived its current provision by using estimates and ranges calculated by its actuarial adviser, which are based on current experience of claims, and an assessment of potential future claims, the majority of which are expected to be received over the next 25 to 30 years.
The Group has a rigorous process of ensuring that only valid claims are accepted.

This disclosure has been included on the basis that the Group may be subject to a financial penalty, dependent on a future Ofcom decision.
On 28 July 2015, the Group received a Statement of Objections setting out Ofcom's provisional, preliminary findings of anti-competitive conduct in relation to certain Contract Change Notices issued by the Group in January 2014.
Ofcoms investigation was launched in February 2014 following a complaint brought by TNT Post UK now Whistl.
The Group has robustly defended its conduct in written and oral representations made to Ofcom and continues to defend itself.
In its annual concurrency report published on 30 April the Competition and Markets Authority stated that Ofcom expects to make a decision in this case before Summer 2018.
However, Ofcom has not published a formal timetable or provided any such timetable to Royal Mail.
The Group continues to maintain that it has not infringed competition law and its representations to Ofcom have been made on that basis.

The original contract dated back to 2000 when the Post Office, then in State ownership, acquired German Parcel.
It gave Mr Back certain management control rights relating to the governance of what subsequently became GLS, in order to retain its entrepreneurial focus.
They included right of veto on decisions and membership of GLS management board.
In addition, Mr Back was only required to give the Company three months notice and there were substantial payments for termination of his employment in certain circumstances.
This arrangement was rooted in the fact that Mr Back was a shareholder in German Parcel, and its Managing Director, at the time of its acquisition by the Post Office.
The Board came to the conclusion that some of the provisions of the original contract were increasingly inappropriate and needed to be removed.
The growing importance of GLS for Royal Mail Group and our greater investment to accelerate its growth makes it important that it is integrated more closely with the rest of the Group, while maintaining its overall entrepreneurial focus and ethos.
In addition, as part of the buyout, Mr Backs fixed pay was rebased downwards.
Key management are considered to be the Executive and Non-Executive Directors of Royal Mail plc, all other members of the Chief Executives Committee see page 62 and the remainder of the Persons Discharging Managerial Responsibilities.
