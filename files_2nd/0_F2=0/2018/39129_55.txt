Further, the surplus of the with-profits funds is ring-fenced from the shareholder balance sheet with restrictions as to its distribution.
Distributions from the with-profits funds to shareholders continue to reflect the shareholders one-ninth share of the cost of declared policyholders bonuses.
For Jackson, capital retention is maintained at a level consistent with an appropriate rating by Standard & Poors.
Currently Jackson is rated AA.
Jackson can pay dividends on its capital stock only out of earned surplus unless prior regulatory approval is obtained.
Furthermore, dividends that exceed the greater of statutory net gain from operations less net realised investments losses for the prior year or 10 per cent of Jacksons prior year end statutory surplus, excluding any increase arising from the application of permitted practices, require prior regulatory approval.
For Asia subsidiaries, the amounts retained within the companies are at levels that provide an appropriate level of capital strength in excess of the local regulatory minimum.
The businesses in Asia may, in general, remit dividends to UK parent entities, provided the statutory insurance fund meets the local regulatory solvency requirements.
For with-profits funds, the excess of assets over liabilities is retained within the funds, with distribution to shareholders tied to the shareholders share of declared bonuses.
Available capital of the non-insurance business units is transferable after taking account of an appropriate level of operating capital, based on local regulatory solvency requirements, over and above base liabilities.
