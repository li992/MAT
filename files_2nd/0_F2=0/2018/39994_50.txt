v Mobile handset financing During the year, the Group entered into a securitisation facility with a third party for the sale of mobile handset receivables.
The Group does not have control over the securitisation entity, and has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the receivables.
As a result, the receivables have been derecognised and the securitisation entity is not consolidated within the Groups financial statements, such that the transfer of handset receivables is treated as a sale.
Sales of mobile handset receivables resulted in proceeds of 86 million being recognised in cash flows from operating activities and associated costs of 11 million being recognised in financing costs in the year.
The securitisation entity was set up for the purpose of financing the purchase of mobile handset receivables from the Group.
It is funded through the issue of two tranches of debt and a quasi-equity cash investment from the entitys control party.
The debt comprises a senior tranche that is issued to a bank and the other, a junior tranche, which is issued to the Group.
The senior debt is funded by the banks conduit, which in turn secures its funding in the commercial paper market.
The Group receives a fixed rate of interest on its junior tranche, which is subordinated below the senior tranche but above the control partys investment and the entitys reserves.
