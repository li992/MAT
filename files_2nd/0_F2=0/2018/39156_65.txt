Deferred income taxes at the Balance Sheet date have been measured at the tax rate expected to be applicable at the date the deferred income tax assets and liabilities are realised.
For UK deferred income tax, management has performed an assessment, for all material deferred income tax assets and liabilities, to determine the period over which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are forecast to be realised.
This resulted in a UK deferred income tax rate of 17.0% being used to measure all deferred tax balances as at 31 May 2018 2017: 17.0%.
Unremitted earnings may be liable to overseas withholding taxes if distributed as dividends.
No deferred tax liability has been provided for unremitted earnings of Group companies overseas as these are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the UK.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with investment in subsidiaries and joint ventures for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised totalled approximately 16.6m as at 31 May 2018 2017: 18.3m.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for tax losses brought forward to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable.
At the Balance Sheet date, the Group had 6.4m recognised unused tax losses 2017: nil.
