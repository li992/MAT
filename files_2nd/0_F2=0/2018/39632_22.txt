Strategic report | Corporate governance | Financial statements 75 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As at 31 December 2018 Corporate information Sabre Insurance Group plc is a company incorporated in England and Wales.
The address of the registered office is Sabre House, 150 South Street, Dorking, Surrey, RH4 2YY, England.
The nature of the Groups operations is the writing of general insurance for motor vehicles.
The Companys principal activity is that of a holding company.
Accounting policies 1.1 Corporate reorganisation Sabre Insurance Group plc was incorporated as a limited company on 21 September 2017.
On 11 December 2017, Sabre Insurance Group plc acquired the entire share capital of the former ultimate holding company of the Group, Barbados TopCo Limited.
Sabre Insurance Group plc was introduced as a new parent to the Sabre Insurance Group by the principal investors who were the same before and after the reorganisation.
Sabre Insurance Group plcs ordinary shares were admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange on 11 December 2017.
On the basis that the transaction was effected by creating a new parent that is itself not a business, the transaction is considered to be outside the scope of IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
It has therefore been accounted for using the pooling of interest method as a continuation of the existing Group.
The result is that the Consolidated Financial Statements of Sabre Insurance Group plc are the same as those previously presented by Barbados TopCo Limited, except for the share capital being that of Sabre Insurance Group plc.
1.2 Basis of preparation These financial statements present the Sabre Insurance Group plc Group financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018, comprising the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of financial position, consolidated statement of changes in equity, consolidated statement of cash flows and related notes, as well as the comparatives.
The financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance and fully comply with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs, as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and adopted by the EU.
The financial statements have been prepared on an historical cost basis, except for investment properties and those financial assets that have been measured at fair value.
The financial statements values are presented in Pounds Sterling rounded to the nearest thousand k, unless otherwise indicated.
The Group presents its statement of financial position in order of liquidity.
An analysis regarding recovery or settlement within 12 months after the reporting date current and more than 12 months after the reporting date non-current is presented in the respective notes.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position only when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settled the liability simultaneously.
As permitted by IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts, the Group continues to apply the existing accounting policies that were applied prior to the adoption of IFRS, with certain modifications allowed by the standard effective subsequent to adoption for its insurance contracts.
The Group has applied IFRS 15: Revenue from contracts with customers when preparing the financial statements.
The new standard has no material impact on the financial statements.
1.3 Summary of significant accounting policies a Premiums Insurance and reinsurance written premiums comprise all amounts during the financial year in respect of contracts entered into regardless of the fact that such amounts may relate in whole or in part to a later financial year.
All premiums are shown gross of commission payable to intermediaries where applicable and are exclusive of taxes, duties and levies thereon.
Insurance and reinsurance premiums are adjusted by an unearned premium provision which represents the proportion of premiums that relate to periods of cover after the balance sheet date as described in b below.
b Insurance liabilities Claims incurred include all losses occurring through the year, whether reported or not, related handling costs and any adjustments to claims outstanding from previous years.
Significant delays are experienced in the notification and settlement of certain claims, particularly in respect of liability claims, the ultimate cost of which cannot be known with certainty at the balance sheet date.
Reinsurance recoveries or amounts due from reinsurers are accounted for in the same period as the related claim.
i Unearned premiums are those proportions of the premiums written in a year that relate to the periods of risk subsequent to the balance sheet date.
They are computed principally on a daily pro-rata basis.
Sabre Insurance Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 76 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED As at 31 December 2018 1.
Accounting policies continued ii The provision for claims outstanding includes individual case estimates, an incurred but not reported IBNR provision and a provision for related claims handling costs.
When claims are initially reported, case estimates are set at fixed levels based on previous average claims settlements.
As soon as sufficient information becomes available, the case estimate is amended by a claim handler within the Claims Department to reflect the expected ultimate settlement cost of the claim, including external claims handling costs.
The case estimate will be amended throughout the life of a claim as further information emerges.
Case estimates generally do not allow for possible reductions in our liability due to contributory negligence, favourable court judgments or settlements until these are known to a high probability.
The IBNR provision includes the estimated cost of claims incurred, but not reported, at the balance sheet date pure IBNR and any difference between the case estimates and the estimated ultimate cost of reported claims IBNER.
The IBNR is set after considering the results of various statistical methods based on, inter alia, historical claims development trends, average claims costs and expected inflation rates.
The provision for claims handling costs is estimated based on the number of outstanding claims at the balance sheet date and the estimated average internal cost of settling claims.
The provision for claims outstanding is based on information available at the balance sheet date.
Significant delays are experienced in the notification and settlement of certain claims and accordingly the ultimate cost of such claims cannot be known with certainty at the balance sheet date.
Subsequent information and events may result in the ultimate liability being less than, or greater than, the amount provided.
Any differences between provisions and subsequent settlements are dealt with in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Claims provisions are not discounted, with the exception of PPOs periodic payment orders, which are discussed more fully in Note 2.1. iii Provision is made for unexpired risks when, after taking account of an element of attributable investment income, it is anticipated that the unearned premiums will be insufficient to cover future claims and expenses on existing contracts.
The expected claims are calculated having regard to events which have occurred prior to the balance sheet date.
Unexpired risk surpluses and deficits are offset when business classes are managed together and a provision is made if an aggregate deficit arises.
c Deferred acquisition costs Deferred acquisition costs represent a proportion of commission and other acquisition costs that relate to policies that are in force at the year end.
Deferred acquisition costs are amortised over the period in which the related premiums are earned.
Such costs are identified as being directly attributable to the acquisition of business, or are indirectly attributed to acquisition activity through an allocation exercise.
d Investment income, realised and unrealised investment gains and losses Investment income consists of interest receivable for the year.
Income is credited to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income at the amounts receivable, with no associated tax credit for income from the United Kingdom.
Interest receivable is accounted for on an accruals basis.
Net realised gains losses on investments are calculated as the difference between net sales proceeds and the cost of acquisition.
Unrealised gains losses on investments represent the difference between the carrying value at the year end and the carrying value at the previous year end or purchase value during the year.
Net movements in the year are taken to the profit and loss account and disclosed as unrealised gains losses on investments.
e Investment expense and charges Investment expenses and charges consist of the expenses relating to the management of the investment portfolio.
f Taxation The taxation charge in the income statement is based on the taxable profits for the year.
It is Company policy to relieve profits where possible by the surrender of losses from Group companies with payment for value.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more, tax, with the following exception.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the Directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
g Valuation of investments Listed securities and equities at market bid price at the date of the statement of financial position less accrued interest where applicable.
Financial investments are classified according to their nature and use.
All financial investments held by the Company are classified as being held at fair value through the statement of comprehensive income.
While it is the Companys intention to hold the bonds within its portfolio to maturity, the Company recognises that certain assets may be sold in the normal course of business in order to enhance short-term liquidity.
The Company invests only in financial assets which are quoted on liquid markets, therefore all investments are classified as Level 1 under the IFRS hierarchy.
h Tangible assets Expenditure on computer equipment and fixtures and fittings is capitalised and depreciated over five years, the estimated useful economic lives of the assets on a straight line basis.
Depreciation is charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and is included in administrative expenses.
Owner-occupied property is held at fair value, with subsequent revaluation gains taken through other comprehensive income.
A fair value assessment of the owner-occupied property is undertaken at each reporting date with any material changes in fair value recognised.
Owner-occupied property is also revalued by an external qualified surveyor, at least every three years.
Sabre Insurance Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic report | Corporate governance | Financial statements 77 i Goodwill Goodwill only arises upon a business combination and is initially measured as the residual cost of the business combination after recognising the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Groups cash generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
j Intangible assets Acquired businesses are reviewed to identify assets that meet the definition of an intangible asset in accordance with IAS 38 Intangible Assets.
The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value at the date of acquisition.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
The useful economic lives of intangibles assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite.
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.
The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at each financial year end.
Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates.
The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the expense category consistent with the function of the intangible asset.
Intangible assets relating to customer relationships are amortised over a five-year period.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually either individually or at the cash generating unit level.
Such intangibles are not amortised.
The useful life of an intangible asset with an indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether indefinite life assessment continues to be supportable.
If not, the change in the useful life assessment from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income when the asset is derecognised.
k Pensions For staff who were employees on 8 February 2002, the Company operates a non-contributory defined contribution Company personal pension scheme.
The contribution by the Company depends on the age of the employee.
For employees joining since 8 February 2002, the Company operates a matched contribution Company personal pension scheme where the Company contributes an amount matching the contribution made by the staff member.
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they become payable.
l Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits with banks together with short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and subject to insignificant risk of change in value.
m Insurance and other receivables Insurance and other receivables are recognised when due and measured on initial recognition at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.
Subsequent to initial recognition, insurance receivables are measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
The carrying value of insurance receivables is reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, with the impairment loss recorded in the statement of comprehensive income.
n Trade and other payables, including insurance payables Trade and other payables consist primarily of reinsurance balances and indirect taxes due.
Reinsurance payables represent premiums payable to reinsurers in respect of contracts which have been entered into at the date of the financial position.
o Instalment income Instalment income comprises the interest income earned on policyholder receivables, where outstanding premiums are settled by a series of instalment payments.
Interest is earned over the term of the policy using the effective interest method.
p Other operating income Other operating income consists of marketing fees, commissions resulting from the sale of ancillary products connected to the Groups direct business, and other non-insurance income such as administrative fees charged on direct business.
Such income is recognised once the related service has been performed.
Typically, this will be at the point of sale of the product.
q Basis of consolidation The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has control.
Subsidiary companies are consolidated using the acquisition method.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtained control, and continue to be consolidated until the date when such control ceases.
In preparing these consolidated financial statements, any intra-group balances, unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group trading are eliminated.
Where accounting policies used in individual financial statements of a subsidiary company differ from Group policies, adjustments are made to bring these policies in line with Group policies.
Sabre Insurance Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 78 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED As at 31 December 2018 1.
Accounting policies continued r Share-based payments The fair value of equity instruments granted under share-based payment plans is recognised as an expense and spread over the vesting period of the instrument.
The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the awards made at the grant date, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
At the date of each statement of financial position, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments that are expected to become exercisable.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, and a corresponding adjustment is made to equity over the remaining vesting period.
The fair value of the awards and ultimate expense are not adjusted on a change in market vesting conditions during the vesting period.
s Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing profit after tax attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.
Diluted earnings per share requires that the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
These arise from awards made under share-based incentive schemes.
Share awards with performance conditions attaching to them are not considered to be dilutive unless these conditions have been met at the reporting date.
Shares held in employee share trusts are excluded from the weighted average number of shares in issue until they have vested unconditionally with the employees.
1.4 New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet effective and not early adopted At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations were assessed to be relevant and are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019: Description Effective date period beginning IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2021 Deferred elected IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts 1 January 2021 The Group intends to adopt the standards and interpretations in the reporting period when they become effective.
The Board does not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will materially impact the Groups financial results in the period of initial application although there will be revised presentations to the financial statements and additional disclosures.
The Group has not early adopted these standards and their impact is yet to be fully assessed.
However, based on the Directors current assessment, the impact is not expected to be significant.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments In July 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments that replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and all previous versions of IFRS 9 and which was endorsed by the EU in 2016.
IFRS 9 addresses the classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, introduces new rules for hedge accounting and a new impairment model for financial assets and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
The Board does not anticipate that the introduction of this standard would have a material impact on the Groups financial results.
In September 2016, the IASB published amendments to IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts that address the accounting consequences of the application of IFRS 9 to insurers prior to the adoption of IFRS 17, the forthcoming accounting standard for insurance contracts.
The amendments to IFRS 4 include a deferral approach that provides an entity, if eligible, with a temporary exemption from applying IFRS 9 until 1 January 2021.
The Group is eligible to apply the temporary exemption from IFRS 9 because its activities are entirely connected with insurance.
As at 31 December 2015, all the Groups gross liabilities arising from contracts are within the scope of IFRS 4.
Since 31 December 2015 there has been no change in the activities of the Group that requires reassessment of the use of the temporary exemption.
Sabre Insurance Plc as a standalone entity has no impact from IFRS 9.
The table below presents an analysis of the fair value of classes of financial assets as at the end of the 2018 reporting period.
The movement in the year represents the change in fair value during the reporting period.
The financial assets are divided into two categories: Assets for which their contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest SPPI All financial assets other than those specified in SPPI.
Group Company Fair Fair value Fair Fair value value change value change Asset type 000 000 000 000 Financial assets managed and evaluated on a fair value basis Corporate 518 29 Sovereign 286,624 43,140 Total financial assets managed and evaluated on a fair value basis 287,142 43,111 Financial assets meeting the SPPI test Cash and cash equivalent 22,822 11,423 1,208 1,208 Total financial assets meeting SPPI test 22,822 11,423 1,208 1,208 IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts The effective date for IFRS 17 is 1 January 2021.
Following the issuance of the full and final version of IFRS 17, the Group plans to perform a detailed impact assessment of the implementation of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 on its results, financial position and cash flows during 2019.
Sabre Insurance Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic report | Corporate governance | Financial statements 79 IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and has not yet been endorsed by the EU.
The standard provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset has a low value.
This is in contrast to the current standard which differentiates between operating and finance leases.
The Groups current analysis is that this will not have a material impact on the Groups results, given the Group holds no lease assets or liabilities.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements 2.1 Valuation of insurance contracts For the valuation of insurance contracts, estimates are made both for the expected ultimate cost of claims reported at the reporting date, consisting of a claims reserve and estimate of the sufficiency of these reserves through the calculation of an Incurred But Not Enough Reported IBNER estimate, and for the expected ultimate cost of claims incurred, but not yet reported, at the reporting date IBNR.
It can take a significant period of time before the ultimate claims cost can be established with certainty.
The ultimate cost of outstanding claims is estimated by using a range of standard actuarial claims projection techniques, such as Chain Ladder and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods.
The main assumption underlying these techniques is that the Companys past claims development experience can be used to project future claims development and hence ultimate claims costs.
As such, these methods extrapolate the development of paid and incurred losses, average costs per claim and claim numbers based on the observed development of earlier years and expected loss ratios.
Historical claims development is analysed by accident years and types of claim.
Large claims are usually separately addressed, either by being reserved at the face value of loss adjuster estimates or separately projected in order to reflect their future development.
In most cases, no explicit assumptions are made regarding future rates of claims inflation or loss ratios.
Instead, the assumptions used are those implicit in the historical claims development data on which the projections are based.
Additional qualitative judgement is used to assess the extent to which past trends may not apply in future, e. g. to reflect one-off occurrences, changes in external or market factors such as public attitudes to claiming, economic conditions, levels of claims inflation, judicial decisions and legislation, as well as internal factors such as portfolio mix, policy features and claims handling procedures in order to arrive at the estimated ultimate cost of claims that present the likely outcome from the range of possible outcomes, taking account of all the uncertainties involved.
The gross carrying value at the reporting date of insurance liabilities is 215,757k 2017: 242,388k.
Liability claims may be settled through a Periodic Payment Order PPO, established under the Courts Act 2003, which allows a UK court to award damages for future loss or any other damages in respect of personal injury.
The court may order that the damages either partly or fully take the form of a PPO.
To date, the Company has two PPOs within its outstanding claims reserve.
Reinsurance is applied at the claim level, and therefore as PPOs generally result in a liability in excess of the Companys reinsurance retention, the net liability on acquisition of a PPO is not significantly different to that arising in a non-PPO situation.
Management will continue to monitor the level of PPO activity.
Once the level of projected PPO activity, and the volume of historical data available for modelling, becomes sufficient the firm will apply statistical modelling in respect of PPOs within the IBNR reserve.
Risk management 3.1 Risk and capital management The Board of Directors has ultimate responsibility for ensuring that the Group has sufficient funds to meet its liabilities as they fall due.
The Group carries out detailed modelling of its assets and liabilities and the key risks to which these are exposed.
This modelling includes the Groups own assessment of its capital requirements for solvency purposes.
The Group has continued to manage its solvency with reference to the Solvency Capital Requirement SCR calculated using the Standard Formula.
The Group has developed sufficient processes to ensure that the capital requirements under Solvency II are not breached, including the maintenance of capital at a level higher than that required through the Standard Formula.
In previous years Sabre Insurance Company Limited managed its capital position on both a Solvency II basis and on the previous regulatory basis.
The Group considers its capital position to be its net assets on a Solvency II basis and monitors this in the context of the Solvency II SCR.
As at 31 December 2018, the Company holds significant excess Solvency II capital.
The Groups IFRS capital comprised: As at As at 31 December 31 December 2018 2017 k k Equity Ordinary share capital 249 249 Preference share capital Share premium 205,241 Own shares 1 1 Merger reserve 48,524 48,404 Retained earnings 216,374 21,902 Total 265,148 231,993 Sabre Insurance Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 80 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED As at 31 December 2018 3.
Risk management continued The Solvency II position of the Group is given below: As at As at 31 December 31 December 2018 2017 k k Total tier 1 capital 130,019 97,873 SCR 60,995 61,087 Excess capital 69,024 36,786 Solvency coverage ratio % 213% 160% The following table sets out a reconciliation between IFRS net assets and Solvency II net assets: As at As at 31 December 31 December 2018 2017 k k Adjusted IFRS net assets 108,869 75,213 Unearned premium reserve 106,517 105,122 Deferred acquisition costs 15,761 14,673 Solvency II premium provision 71,092 68,199 1 IFRS risk margin 12,550 12,389 Discount claims provision 3,134 1,822 Solvency II risk margin 9,237 8,486 Change in deferred tax 4,961 5,315 Solvency II net assets 130,019 97,873 1 In line with industry practice, the IFRS risk margin is an explicit additional reserve in excess of the actuarial best estimate which is designed to create a margin held in reserves to allow for unforeseen adverse development in open claims.
The adjustments set out above have been made for the following reasons: Adjusted IFRS net assets: Equals Group net assets on an IFRS basis, less goodwill and intangibles.
Removal of unearned premium reserve and deferred acquisition costs: The unearned premium reserve must be added back as premium and deferred acquisition costs must be removed as they are not deferred under Solvency II.
Solvency II premium provision: A premium reserve reflecting the future cash in and outflows in respect of insurance contracts is calculated and this must be discounted under Solvency II.
IFRS risk margin: Solvency II reserves must reflect a true best estimate basis.
Therefore, the IFRS risk margin is removed from the claims reserve.
Discount claims provision: The provision held against future claims expenditure for claims incurred is discounted in the same way as the Solvency II premium provision.
Solvency II risk margin: The Solvency II risk margin represents the premium that would be required were the Group to transfer its technical provisions to a third party, and essentially reflects the SCR required to cover run-off of claims on existing business.
This amount is calculated by the Group through modelling the discounted SCR on a projected future balance sheet for each year of claims run-off.
Change in deferred tax: As the move to a Solvency II basis balance sheet increases the net asset position of the Group, a deferred tax liability is generated to offset the increase.
The Groups SCR, expressed on a risk module basis, is set out in the following table: As at As at 31 December 31 December 2018 2017 k k Interest rate risk 484 1,482 Equity risk Property risk 1,014 859 Spread risk 83 88 Currency risk 240 204 Concentration risk Correlation impact 555 815 Market risk 1,265 1,818 Counterparty risk 2,682 3,306 Underwriting risk 57,633 56,860 Correlation impact 2,305 2,982 Basic SCR 59,275 59,002 Operating risk 6,681 7,400 Loss absorbing effect of deferred taxes 4,961 5,315 Total Solvency Capital Requirement 60,995 61,087 Sabre Insurance Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic report | Corporate governance | Financial statements 81 The Groups capital management objectives are: To ensure that the Group will be able to continue as a going concern To maximise the income and capital return to its equity.
The Board monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Groups capital on an ongoing basis.
This review includes consideration of the extent to which revenue in excess of that which is required to be distributed should be retained.
The Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing capital have not changed during the historical period.
3.2 Principal risks from insurance activities and the use of financial instruments The Strategic Report sets out the principal risks faced by the Group.
Detailed below is the Groups risk exposure arising from its insurance activities and use of financial instruments specifically in respect of insurance risk, market risk and counterparty risk.
1 Underwriting The Group has identified that, in general, recognition from revenue in insurance contracts can be complex.
However, given the short-term nature of the Groups policies, this is not a source of material risk to the Group.
The principal risk the Group faces under insurance contracts is that the actual claims and benefit payments, or the timing thereof, differ from expectations.
This is influenced by the frequency of claims, severity of claims, actual benefits paid and subsequent development of long-term claims.
Therefore, the objective of the Group is to ensure that sufficient reserves are available to cover these liabilities.
The Group issues only motor insurance contracts, which usually cover 12 months duration.
For these contracts, the most significant risks arise from severe weather conditions or single catastrophic events.
For longer-tail claims that take some years to settle, there is also inflation risk.
The above risk exposure is mitigated by diversification across a large portfolio of policyholders and geographical areas within the UK.
The variability of risks is improved by careful selection and implementation of underwriting strategies, which are designed to ensure that risks are diversified in terms of type of risk and level of insured benefits.
This is largely achieved through diversification across policyholders.
Furthermore, strict claim review policies to assess all new and ongoing claims, regular detailed review of claims handling procedures and frequent investigation of possible fraudulent claims are all policies and procedures put in place to reduce the risk exposure of the Group.
The Group further enforces a policy of actively managing and promptly pursuing claims, in order to reduce its exposure to unpredictable future developments that can negatively impact the business.
Inflation risk is mitigated by taking expected inflation into account when estimating insurance contract liabilities.
The Group purchases reinsurance as part of its risk mitigation programme.
Reinsurance ceded is placed on a non-proportional basis.
This non-proportional reinsurance is excess-of-loss, designed to mitigate the Groups net exposure to single large claims or catastrophe losses.
Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the outstanding claims provision and are in accordance with the reinsurance contracts.
Although the Group has reinsurance arrangements, it is not relieved of its direct obligations to its policyholders and thus a credit exposure exists with respect to ceded insurance, to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations assumed under such reinsurance agreements.
The Groups placement of reinsurance is diversified such that it is not dependent on a single reinsurer.
There is no single counterparty exposure that exceeds 25% of total reinsurance assets at the reporting date.
Key assumptions The principal assumption underlying the liability estimates is that the Groups future claims development will follow a similar pattern to past claims development experience.
This includes assumptions in respect of average claim costs, claim handling costs, claim inflation factors and claim numbers for each accident year.
Additional qualitative judgements are used to assess the extent to which past trends may not apply in the future, for example: one-off occurrence: changes in market factors such as public attitude to claiming: economic conditions: and internal factors such as portfolio mix, policy conditions and claims handling procedures.
Judgement is further used to assess the extent to which external factors such as judicial decisions and government legislation affect the estimates.
Other key circumstances affecting the reliability of assumptions include variation in interest rates and delays in settlement.
Sensitivities The motor claim liabilities are primarily sensitive to the reserving assumptions noted above.
It has not been possible to quantify the sensitivity of certain assumptions such as legislative changes or uncertainty in the estimation process.
The following analysis is performed for reasonably possible movements in key assumptions with all other assumptions held constant, showing the impact on profit before tax and equity.
The correlation of assumptions will have a significant effect in determining the ultimate claims liabilities, but to demonstrate the impact due to changes in assumptions, assumptions had to be changed on an individual basis.
It should be noted that movements in these assumptions are non-linear.
The table shows the impact of a 10% increase in the loss ratio applied to all underwriting years which have a material outstanding claims reserve and a 10% increase in net outstanding claims across all underwriting years, taking into account the impact of an increase in the operational costs associated with handling those claims.

2 Financial risks 1 Counterparty credit risk Counterparty credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss to the other party by failing to discharge an obligation.
The two main sources of counterparty risk for the Company are investment counterparties and reinsurance recoveries.
The following policies and procedures are in place to mitigate the Companys exposure to credit risk: A Company credit risk policy which sets out the assessment and determination of what constitutes credit risk for the Company.
Compliance with the policy is monitored and exposures and breaches are reported to the Companys Audit and Risk Committee.
The policy is regularly reviewed for pertinence and for changes in the risk environment.
Reinsurance is placed with counterparties that have a good credit rating and concentration of risk is avoided by following policy guidelines in respect of counterparties limits that are set each year by the Board of Directors and are subject to regular reviews.
At each reporting date, management performs an assessment of creditworthiness of reinsurers and updates the reinsurance purchase strategy, ascertaining suitable allowance for impairment.
The Company sets the maximum amounts and limits that may be advanced to corporate counterparties by reference to their long-term credit ratings.
The credit risk in respect of customer balances incurred on non-payment of premiums or contributions will only persist during the grace period specified in the policy document or trust deed until expiry, when the policy is either paid up or terminated.
Commission paid to intermediaries is netted off against amounts receivable from them to reduce the risk of doubtful debts.
The following tables demonstrate the Companys exposure to credit risk in respect of overdue debt and counterparty creditworthiness.

2 Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the potential that obligations cannot be met as they fall due as a consequence of having a timing mismatch or inability to raise sufficient liquid assets without suffering a substantial loss on realisation.
The Company manages its liquidity risk through both ensuring that it holds sufficient cash and cash equivalent assets to meet all short-term liabilities, and matching the maturity profile of its financial investments to the expected cash outflows.
The liquidity of the Companys insurance liabilities and supporting assets is given in the tables below.
The maturity of insurance liabilities is based upon an estimate of expected settlement date.

Risk management continued 3 Investment concentration risk Excessive exposure to particular industry sectors or groups can give rise to concentration risk.
The Company has no significant investment in any particular industrial sector and therefore is unlikely to suffer significant losses through its investment portfolio as a result of over-exposure to sectors engaged in similar activities or which have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic, political or other conditions.
The Companys portfolio consists primarily of UK Government debt, therefore the risk of government default does exist, however the likelihood is extremely remote.
The Company continues to monitor the strength and security of these government bonds.
The Companys exposure by geographical area is outlined below.
Corporate Sovereign Total At 31 December 2018 k k k UK 518 286,624 287,142 Total 518 286,624 287,142 Corporate Sovereign Total At 31 December 2017 k k k UK 547 243,484 244,031 Total 547 243,484 244,031 4 Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
Floating rate instruments expose the Group to cash flow interest risk, whereas fixed interest rate instruments expose the Group to fair value interest risk.
Currently the Company holds only fixed rate securities.
The Groups interest risk policy requires it to manage the maturities of interest bearing financial assets and interest bearing financial liabilities.
Interest on fixed interest rate instruments is priced at inception of the financial instrument and is fixed until maturity.
The Group has no significant concentration of interest rate risk.
The analysis that follows is performed for reasonably possible movements in key variables with all other variables held constant, showing the impact on profit before tax and equity.
The correlation of variables will have a significant effect in determining the ultimate impact on interest rate risk, but to demonstrate the impact due to changes in variables, variables had to be changed on an individual basis.
It should be noted that movements in these variables are non-linear.
Note that the Companys investment portfolio has been designed such that the cash flows yielded from investments match the projected outflows inherent primarily within the claims reserve.
While these insurance liabilities are shown on an undiscounted basis under IFRS, their economic value will move broadly in line with the underlying assets.

3 Operational risk Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from system failure, human error, fraud or external events.
When controls fail to perform, operational risks can cause damage to reputation, have legal or regulatory implications or can lead to financial loss.
The Company cannot expect to eliminate all operational risks, but by initiating a rigorous control framework and by monitoring and responding to potential risks, the Company is able to manage the risks.
Controls include effective segregation of duties, access controls, authorisation and reconciliation procedures, staff education and assessment processes, including the use of internal audit.
Business risks such as changes in environment, technology and the industry are monitored through the Groups strategic planning and budgeting process.

Property, plant and equipment continued The Company holds two owner occupied properties, Sabre House and the Old House, which are both managed by the Company.
The properties are measured at fair value which is arrived at on the basis of a valuation carried out on 16 October 2018 by Hurst Warne and Partners LLP.
The valuation was carried out on an open-market basis in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors requirements, which is deemed to equate to fair value.
The fair value measurement of owner occupied property of 4,055k 2017: 3,435k has been categorised as a Level 3 fair value based on the non-observable inputs to the valuation technique used.
The following table shows a reconciliation to the closing fair value for the Level 3 owner occupied property at valuation: Owner occupied k At 31 December 2017 3,435 Purchase Revaluation 620 At 31 December 2018 4,055 15.

Cancellation of share premium account: On 26 June 2018, Sabre Insurance Group Plc received confirmation by an Order of the High Courts of Justice, Chancery Division, for the reduction of its share premium account, effective as at that date.
The share-based payments reserve is used to recognise the value of equity-settled share-based payments provided to employees, including key management personnel, as part of their remuneration.
Refer to note 31 for further details of these plans.
The merger reserve was generated through the corporate restructuring which preceded the Companys IPO in December 2017.
All other reserves are as stated in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
Goodwill On 3 January 2014 the Group acquired Binomial Group Limited, the parent of Sabre Insurance Company Limited, for a consideration of 245,485 satisfied by cash.
As from 1 January 2014, the date of transition to IFRS, goodwill was no longer amortised but is subject to annual impairment testing.
The recoverable amount of the insurance business unit is based on its fair value less cost to sell.
The goodwill recorded in respect of this transaction at the date of acquisition was 156,279k.
There has been no impairment to goodwill since this date, and no additional goodwill has been recognised by the Group.
The Group performed its annual impairment test as at 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017.
The Group considers the relationship between its market capitalisation and its book value, among other factors, when reviewing for indicators of impairment.
As at 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017, the Groups securities were traded on a liquid market, therefore market value could be used as a definitive indicator of market capitalisation.
Key assumptions The valuation uses fair value less costs to sell.
The key assumption on which management have based this value is: Market capitalisation of the Group at 31 December 2018 of 682,500k 2017: 680,000k.
The Directors conclude that the recoverable amount of the business unit would remain in excess of its carrying value even after reasonably possible changes in the key inputs and assumptions affecting its market value, such as a significant fall in demand for its product or a significant adverse change in the volume of claims and increase in other expenses, before the recoverable amount of the business units would reduce to less than its carrying value.
Therefore the Directors are of the opinion that there are no indicators of impairment as at 31 December 2018.
Goodwill is categorised as Level 1 under the IFRS hierarchy.

Owner occupied property is valued based upon an independent third party valuation and is classified as Level 3 under the IFRS hierarchy, as discussed in Note 14.
Corporate reorganisation On 11 December 2017 certain steps were taken to restructure the Group immediately prior to the Admission of the ultimate parent to the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange.
This included the issue of 250m new ordinary share capital and the redemption of 203m of preferences share capital in the Groups previous ultimate parent company, Barbados TopCo Limited.
As the transaction was effected by creating a new parent that is itself not a business, it has been accounted for using the pooling of interest method as a continuation of the existing Group.
