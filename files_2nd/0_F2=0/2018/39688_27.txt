com Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2018 1.
General information Sanne Group plc the Company, incorporated in Jersey on 26 January 2015, is a registered public company limited by shares with a Premium Listing on the London Stock Exchange.
The registered office and principal place of business is IFC 5, St. Helier, Jersey, JE1 1ST.
The principal activity of the Company and its subsidiaries collectively the Group is the provision of alternative asset and corporate administration services.
In the opinion of the Directors there is no ultimate controlling party.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 3.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently in the current and prior year, other than as set out below.
Adoption of new and revised Standards Standards in issue not yet effective The following standard, amendment and interpretation is relevant to the Group, but was not yet effective.
This standard has not been early adopted by the Group.
IFRS 16 Leases effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
This is a new standard which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract.
The standard eliminates the classification of leases as either operating or finance leases as required by IAS 17 and instead introduces a single lessee accounting model.
A lessee will be required to recognise a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of more than 12 months.
The depreciation on the right of use asset will be accounted for separately from the interest expense incurred on the lease liability in the income statement.
The Group currently recognises operating lease payments as an expense on the straight line basis with a corresponding asset or liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for the straight line effect, this asset or liability is released over the lifetime of the lease.
This will change with the new standard and the group has performed an assessment of the impact.
It will apply the modified retrospective approach for transition and will not restate comparative amounts.
The right of use assets will be measured as if the standard has always been applied.
On the transition date, the lease liability is 44.9 million.
This is equal to the remaining discounted lease commitments.
Under IFRS 16 the full rental expense which was included as operating expense under IAS 17 will be split between depreciation and interest expense, there is no significant impact on the net profit due to the new standard.
New and revised standards effective for the year In the current year, the Group applied a number of amendments to IFRSs and new interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB that are mandatorily effective for an accounting period that begins on or after 1 January 2018.
Their adoption has not had any material impact on the disclosures or on the amounts reported in these financial statements.
Themostsignificant of these standards are set out below.
IFRS 9 makes changes to accounting for financial instruments in the areas of classification and measurement, impairment and hedge accounting.
There is no significant impact on the classification for the Group as a result of IFRS 9.
IFRS 9 replaces the incurred credit loss impairment model for financial assets in IAS 39 with an expected credit loss model ECL.
Other than disclosure changes this has no significant impact on the Group financial statements due to the short term nature of the receivables on the Groups balance sheet.
Refertothe financial instruments accounting policy for the new IFRS 9 policy note 3.
IFRS 15 establishes principles for reporting useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entitys contracts with customers.
Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good or service.
The Group assessed the different revenue streams and grouped their recognition as either based on assets under management or service based fees, the timing of the revenue recognition was also assessed as point of time or over time and based on the delivering of service obligations, this resulted in no significant difference from how the Group recognised revenue under IAS 18 but additional disclosures were added.
Refer to the revenue accounting policy for the new IFRS 15 policy note 3.

Significant accounting policies Basis of accounting The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS asadopted by the European Union.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis.
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company itssubsidiaries during each year.
Control is achieved where the Company: has the power over the investee: is exposed, or has rights, to variable return from its involvement with the investee: and has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Company loses control over the subsidiary.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial results of the subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Under Article 105 11 of the Companies Jersey Law 1991, the Directors of a holding company need not prepare separate financial statements i. e. Company only financial statements.
Company only financial statements for the Company are not prepared unless required to do so by the members of the Company by ordinary resolution.
The members of the Company had not passed a resolution requiring separate financial statements and, in the Directors opinion, the Company meets the definition of a holding company.
As permitted by law, the Directors have elected not to prepare separate financial statements.
Going concern The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence at least for the next 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements.
The Directors have reviewed the Groups financial projections and cash flow forecasts and believe, based on those projections and forecasts, that it is appropriate to prepare the consolidated financial statements of the Group on the going concern basis.
The Group has healthy cash flow inflow through a good pipeline of existing and new customers, the Group also has finance facilities available.
Accordingly, they have adopted the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Further detail is contained in the viability statement included in the Audit Committee report on page 71. Business combinations Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition date fair values of assets transferred by the Group, liabilities incurred by the Group to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interest issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred and as non-underlying items within operating expenses.
The acquirees identifiable assets and liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 2008 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Significant accounting policies continued Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirers previously held equity interest in the acquiree if any over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
When the consideration transferred by the Group in a business combination includes an asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, the contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition-date fair value and included as part of the consideration transferred in a business combination.
Changes in fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as measurement period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments against goodwill.
Measurement period adjustments are adjustments that arise from additional information obtained during the measurement period which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date.
The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments depends on how the contingent consideration is classified.
Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured at subsequent reporting dates and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.
Contingent consideration that is classified as an asset or a liability is remeasured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value with the corresponding gain or loss being recognised in profit or loss, as non-underlying items within operating expenses.
Goodwill Goodwill is initially recognised and measured as set out above.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually or if indicators of impairment are identified.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are initially recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date which is regarded as their cost.
Subsequent to initial recognition, separately intangible assets acquired in a business combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses.
The Group performs assessments at the end of each reporting period, in order to identify any possible indicators of impairment.
Shouldthere be any indicators of impairment, the group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset and if an impairment should berecognised.
Contract intangibles Contract intangibles consist of the recognition of the legal relationships gained through acquisition.
On initial recognition the values are determined by relevant factors such as business product life-cycles, length of notice, ease of movement and general attrition.
These intangibles are amortised over their useful lives using the straight-line method, which is estimated at four to eight years, based on managements expectations and client experience.
The amortisation charge for the year is included in the consolidated income statement under operating expenses and further identified as non-underlying.
Customer intangibles Customer intangibles consist of the recognition of value attributed to the customer lists through acquisition.
On initial recognition the values are determined by relevant factors such as the Groups growth pattern and ability to cross-sell to existing clients.
Subsequently, these intangibles are amortised over their useful lives using the straight-line method, which is estimated at four to ten years, based on managements expectations and client experience.

Significant accounting policies continued Interest income Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method.
This is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset, unless the assets subsequently became credit impaired.
In the latter case, the effective interest rate is applied to the amortised cost of the financial asset.
Interest is recognised on an accruals basis.
Revenue recognition The revenue is measured at transaction price.
The transaction price is the amount of consideration that the Group expects to receive in exchange for the services rendered.
Rendering of services Revenue is based on and charged through three different categories, 1 Assets under management - open ended funds where revenue is charged as a percentage of the assets under management, 2 Assets under management - closed ended funds where fees are also charged as a percentage of assets under management, 3 Service based fees where the revenue is charged based on an agreed fee structure for various services being provided.
All revenue is recognised over time as the services are rendered and clients benefit from these services.
Accrued income Accrued income represents the billable provision of services which are rendered and where performance obligations have been met but clients have not been invoiced at the reporting date.
Accrued income is recorded based on agreed fees billed in arrears and time-based charge-out rates in force at the work date, less any specific provisions against the value of accrued income where recovery will not be made in full.
Deferred revenue Deferred revenue represents fees in advance and upfront fees in respect of services due under contract and are time apportioned to the respective accounting periods, and those fees billed but not yet earned.
These are included in deferred revenue in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The new standard, IFRS 15 came into effect on 1 January 2018.
For the transition process, the Group elected to apply the practical expedient consistently to all contracts.
The Group found that during the transition phase, there was little to no difference in the revenue recognition from the previous standard.
The most significant effect is the disclosure format of the prior period figures.
There was no change in the amounts for each financial line item.
Leases All leases are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to expenses on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the lease asset are consumed.
In the event that lease incentives are received on entering into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability.
Theaggregatebenefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of the rental expense on a straight-line basis, except where another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.
Contractualrental increases are straight-lined over the lease term.
Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each group company are expressed in pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency foreign currencies are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Significant accounting policies continued Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the year in which they arise.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Groups operations with a functional currency other than pounds sterling are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the exchange rates at the date of the transactions.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity in the translation reserve.
On the disposal of a foreign operations i. e. a disposal of the Groups entire interest in a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, loss of joint control over a jointly controlled entity that includes a foreign operation, or loss of significant influence over an associate that includes a foreign operation, all of the accumulated exchange differences in respect of that operation attributable to the Group are reclassified to profit or loss.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Exchange differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Defined contribution schemes Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered services entitling them to contributions.
Defined benefit schemes The Group has a defined benefit retirement obligation in Mauritius due to a regulatory requirement.
The defined benefit obligation is recognised in line with IAS 19.
The liability recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of the defined benefit retirement obligation is the present value ofthe defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets, however the Group has no plan assets.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated at half year and year end by qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation.
Defined benefit costs are categorised as follows: service cost net interest expense or income: and re-measurement Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity inother comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Earnings per share The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share.
In calculating the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period any share restructuring is adjusted by a factor to make it comparable with the other periods.
For diluted EPS, the weighted average number of ordinary shares is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Both basic and diluted EPS measures are shown for the statutory profit position, the Group has also presented an alternative version withprofit adjusted for non-underlying items to provide better understanding of the financial performance of the Group note 11.

Significant accounting policies continued Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement as it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are not taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Current tax and deferred tax for the year Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.
Where current tax or deferred tax arises from the initial accounting for a business combination, the tax effect is included in the accounting for the business combination.
Equipment Equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost of assets less their residual values over their useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: Computer equipment 3 to 5 years Fixtures and equipment 5 to 24 years The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation methods are reviewed at the end of each reporting period with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or scrappage of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss.
Significant accounting policies continued Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.
The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell or the value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets All financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where the purchase or sale of a financial asset is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured atfair value.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits held at call with banks.
Financial assets at amortised costs The Groups business model is to collect the contractual cash flows from its assets.
The cash flows consist solely of interest and principal payments.
Therefore the financial assets are classified as carried at amortised cost.
The assets are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less the expected credit losses.
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Impairment of financial assets The Group recognises a loss allowance, for expected credit losses on its financial assets.
The amount of expected credit losses is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the financial asset.
When the expected credit loss for trade receivables is determined, the Group makes use of the simplified approach, whereby the loss recognised is equal to the lifetime expected credit losses.
Lifetime expected credit losses represent the expected losses that may result from possible default events, and the probability of such an event occurring, over the life time of the financial asset.
The expected lifetime credit losses of the trade receivables, are estimated using a provision matrix.
The matrix is based on the Groups historical credit loss experience, the most significant factor being the days past due.
It is then adjusted for forward-looking factors, that are specific to debtors.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account.
When a trade receivable is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account.
Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.

Significant accounting policies continued Financial liabilities and equity Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.
Equity instruments An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equityinstruments issued by the Group are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Repurchase of the Companys own equity instruments is recognised and deducted directly in equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Companys own equity instruments.
Financial liabilities All financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost.
These liabilities are initially measured at fair value less transaction costs and subsequently using the effective interest method.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant year.
The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the amortised cost of a financial liability.
Where financial liabilities are short term and immaterial, no interest is levied.
Accrued interest is recorded separately from the associated borrowings within current liabilities.
Employee share trust Own shares Own shares represent the shares of the Company that are held in treasury and by the Groups employee share ownership trust which is consolidated in the Group financial statements.
Own shares are recorded at cost and deducted from equity.
When shares vest unconditionally, are cancelled or are reissued they are transferred from the own shares reserve at their weighted average cost.
Any consideration paid or received by the Trust for the purchase or sale of the Companys own shares is shown as a movement in shareholders equity.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are determined by the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the risks specific to the liability.
Onerous lease provisions are measured at the lower of the net cost to fulfil, or to exit the contract, discounted as appropriate.
Fiduciary activities The assets and liabilities of trusts and companies under administration and held in a fiduciary capacity are not included in these consolidated financial statements.
Share-based payments Employees of the Group receive bonus allocations in the form of share-based payments under Performance Share Plan, Restrictive Stock Awards and Annual Performance Bonuses, whereby eligible employees render services as consideration for equity instruments shares.
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date.
The fair value excludes the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Details regarding the determination of the fair value of equity-settled share-based transactions are set out in note 32.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vestingperiod, based on the Groups estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revisesits estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
Significant accounting policies continued Operating profit The operating profit reflects the profit earned from the Groups business operations.
It includes revenue and other operating income less direct and indirect costs.
Furthermore the operating profit comprises of underlying and non-underlying items.
Operating profit excludes finance costs, finance income and foreign exchange gains and losses.
Non-underlying items Non-underlying items are disclosed and described separately in the consolidated financial statements where it is necessary to do so to provide a better understanding of the financial performance of the Group.
The Groups core business is the administration, reporting and fiduciary services it provides in various jurisdictions, all acquisition and integration related costs are disclosed as non-underlying as these fall outside the core business of the Group.
Restricted Share Awards forms part of the non-underlying items as it is used as a tool to retain key personnel relating to the acquisitions and recruit senior management to support the acquisitions.
Amortisation of intangible assets recognised through the acquisitions is also included as non-underlying, these charges are based on judgements about the value and economic life of assets that, in the case of items such as customer relationships, would not be capitalised in normal operating practice.
All the non-underlying items are regarded as expense items outside the normal course of business and disclosed separately to assist Shareholders to better analyse the performance of the core business.
Changes to the subsequent contingent consideration arising from prior and current period business combinations are included innon-underlying items.
Further details of the nature of non-underlying items are given in note 9.
Direct costs Direct costs are defined by management as the costs of the income generating divisions including staff payroll, marketing and travel attributable to the division in relation to the delivery of services and supporting growth.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the application of the Groups accounting policies, which are described in note 3, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Theestimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actualresults may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that year, or in the year of the revision and future years if the revision affects both current and future years.
Critical judgements in applying the groups accounting policies The following are the critical judgements at the balance sheet date that the directors have made in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in financial statements.
Initial recognition of intangible assets On 6 February 2018, the Group acquired the LIS and CP.
The business combination gave rise to the recognition of customer and contract intangibles.
The valuation of these intangible assets requires various judgements of which the most significant is the number of years the customer base acquired would generate revenue for the Group.
The valuation was performed using five years which is based onmanagements best judgement and historical evidence.
The intangible assets recognised through the business acquisition amount to16.5 million.
On 3 September 2018 the Group acquired AgenSynd S. L. The business combination gave rise to the recognition of customer and contract intangibles.
The valuation was performed using seven years which is based onmanagements best judgement and historical evidence.
The intangible assets recognised through the business acquisition amount to3.3 million.

Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued Brexit The Group continues to appraise the potential of the United Kingdoms referendum on EU membership Brexit.
Based on managements judgement the impact of Brexit itself in the global alternatives market is unlikely to damage the overall demand for services.
The Groups presence in the EU have benefited from an increase in demand, the Group therefore believe that we are well protected against any uncertainty with regards to Brexit.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty Impairment testing Following the assessment of the recoverable amount of goodwill allocated to Sanne Netherlands, to which goodwill of 1.6 million is allocated, the directors consider the recoverable amount of goodwill allocated to Sanne Netherlands to be most sensitive to the achievement of the 2019 budget.
Budgets comprise of forecasts of revenue, staff cost and overheads based on current and anticipatedmarket conditions that have been considered and approved by the Board.
Whilst the Group is able to manage most of SanneNetherlands costs, the model is most sensitive to cost increase where an 8% increase in cost base will result in nil headroom.
Accrued income The Group recognises accrued income within revenue and as a receivable for amounts that remain unbilled at the year end, recorded at therecoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of accrued income is assessed on an individual basis using the judgement of management, and takes into account an assessment of the clients financial position, the aged profile of accrued income and an assessment of historical recovery rates.
The balance at year end is 6.6 million, the irrecoverability of 15% of this balance will result inanimpairment charge of990k.
Other estimates Probability of vesting of equity instruments granted in terms of share based schemes The cumulative expense recognised in terms of the Groups share based payment schemes reflects, in the opinion of the Directors, thenumber of equity instruments granted that will ultimately vest.
At each reporting date, management adjust the unvested equity instruments with the forfeited instruments.
Management is of the opinion that this number, adjusted for future attrition rates, represents the most accurate estimate of the number of instruments that will ultimately vest.
Based on current performance, management estimates the future performance of the Group will have an annual growth rate of 12%.
The current year share based payment charge for the performance share plan is 1.2 million, should the performance of the Group exceed the 12% growth assumption and have 20% growth, then the 2018 financial statements will have an additional charge of 185k in respect of share based payment catch-up with regards to 2018and prior financial periods.
Segmental reporting The reporting units engage in corporate, fund and private client administration, reporting and fiduciary services.

The Group makes acquisitions from time to time in order to continue to build scale in its chosen markets.
In common with many other businesses which make acquisitions, which primarily involve acquiring staff and the intangible assets of client contracts and goodwill, the costs directly related to such acquisitions are treated as non-underlying as they are not part of the normal, ongoing cost of doing business.
i Share based payments are detailed in note 32, all acquisition related share based payments RSA plan are shares issued in the course of acquisition consideration that have retained employment conditions and are therefore required to be expensed through the profit and loss, these are all related to acquisition rather than the normal, ongoing cost of doing business.
II D uring the year ended 31 December 2018, the Group completed the acquisition of LIS, CP and AgenSynd.
refer to note 31, the Group also completed one acquisition during the year ending 31 December 2017.
The Group expensed 1.4 million of acquisition and integration expenditure during the current year and 1.4 million in the prior year.
With acquisition activities not being part of the normal, ongoing cost of doing business, these costs are disclosed as non-underlying to enable Shareholders to assess the core ongoing performance of the business.
The majority of acquisition and integration cost will be incurred in the first 2 years after acquisition, however this could be longer depending on the nature of the cost.
iii The amortisation charges relates to the amortisation of intangible assets acquired through acquisitions.
The amortisation of intangibles are directly linked to the acquisitions and excluded from underlying cost because these charges are based on judgements about the value and economic life of the asset that, in the case of items such as customer relationships, would not be capitalised in normal operating practice.

Tax 1 2017 2018 Restated 000 000 The tax charge comprises: Current period: Jersey income tax 1,165 1,912 Other foreign tax 6,233 3,681 7,398 5,593 Deferred tax note 27 2,045 1,134 Total tax charge for the year 5,353 4,459 Adjustments in respect of prior periods: Jersey income tax 29 442 Other foreign tax 182 257 Tax on profit on ordinary activities 5,506 4,274 1.
Refer to note 15 for details of the prior year restatement.
In addition to the amount charged to the Consolidated Income statement, the following amounts relating to tax have been recognised in other comprehensive income: 2018 2017 000 000 Deferred tax: 000 000 Items that will not be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss: Actuarial gain loss on pension scheme 11 12 Total income tax recognised in other comprehensive income 11 12 The difference between the total current tax shown above and the amount calculated by applying the standard rate of Jersey income tax to the profit before tax is as follows: 1 2017 2018 Restated 000 000 Profit on ordinary activities before tax 23,680 22,407 Tax on profit on ordinary activities at standard Jersey income tax rate of 10% 2017: 10% 2,368 2,241 Effects of: Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 266 51 Non-deductible amortisation 153 209 Depreciation in excess of capital allowances 143 130 Net foreign exchange income 14 18 2 Foreign taxes not at Jersey rate 2,159 926 3 Deferred tax not recognised - taxable losses 250 884 Prior year adjustments 153 185 Total tax 5,506 4,274 2.
With the Jersey tax rate at 10% the impact of the 2017 and 2018 acquisitions is significant on the tax expense as all the acquired jurisdictions have higher tax rates than10%.
Deferred tax not recognised refers to jurisdictions where management is doubtful that future deferred tax assets would be able to be utilised through taxable profitsbeing recognised.
Tax continued Income tax expense computations are based on the jurisdictions in which profits were earned at prevailing rates in the respective jurisdictions.
The Jersey standard income tax rate is 10%, management reconcile to this rate as the Company is a Jersey registered entity.
1 2017 2018 Restated 000 000 Reconciliation of effective tax rates As per Consolidated income statement: Tax charge 5,506 4,274 Profit before tax 23,680 22,407 Effective tax rate 23.3% 19.1% Tax charge 5,506 4,274 Adjusted for: Prior period adjustments 153 185 Tax effect of non-underlying items 3,328 3,133 Deferred tax on US Goodwill amortisation 948 1,145 Underlying tax charge 7,733 6,447 Profit before tax 23,680 22,407 Non-underlying items 18,882 15,670 Profit before tax and non-underlying items 42,562 38,077 Underlying effective tax rate 18.2% 16.9% 5.
The effective tax rate of 23.3% 2017: 19.1% has increased due to a larger percentage of taxable profits being earned in higher tax jurisdictions.
The increase in the underlying effective tax rate of 18.2% 2017: 16.9% is also due to proportionally higher profits being earned in higher tax jurisdictions.
This was calculated against the underlying profit before tax after having excluded the tax effect of non-underlying expenses and the deferred tax in relation to the tax allowance for the amortisation of goodwill in the US.

Earnings per share continued The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share EPS data for its ordinary shares.
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.
Diluted EPS takes into consideration the Companys dilutive contingently issuable shares as disclosed above.
These arrangements have no impact on the earnings or underlying earnings figures used to calculate diluted EPS.
The weighted average number of ordinary shares used in the diluted calculation is inclusive of the number of shares which are expected to be issued to satisfy the awards when they become due and where the performance criteria, if any, have been deemed to have been met as at 31 December 2018.
Underlying basic EPS and Underlying diluted EPS are calculated in the same way as Basic EPS and Diluted EPS with the only exception being that the earnings used are the underlying earnings, being the profit for the year adjusted for non-underlying items.
In previous years profit for the year was adjusted for non-underlying items but the applicable tax charge was not.
The Board have changed the presentation of this alternative profit measure in 2018 so that the applicable tax charge reflects the tax impact of non-underlying items.
The tax impact of non-underlying items arises principally on the amortisation of acquired intangibles that are not deductible for tax purposes.
Thecomparative numbers were also updated to reflect this approach.
Further detail and a reconciliation of this change is provided in theChief Financial Officers Review in the Annual Report and Accounts.

Correction of prior period error On 1 January 2017 the Group acquired the IFS Group in Mauritius, and consolidated the business into the 2017 Group accounts.
In consolidating IFS Group into the Group, an error was made in the interpretation and application of Mauritius tax legislation in respect of the deductibility of amortisation on intangible assets arising from a business combination.
The impact of correcting this error is to recognise a deferred tax liability and a corresponding increase of goodwill on the balance sheet at the acquisition date.
The deferred tax liability will release as a credit through the Groups reported tax charge as the acquired intangibles in IFS are amortised.
On 1 November 2016 the Group acquired FAS, in the US.
Goodwill was recognised at acquisition and the business was consolidated into the 2016 Group accounts.
Goodwill is amortised for tax purposes in the US and in line with IFRS the goodwill on the balance sheet is not amortised.
This difference in tax and accounting treatment was incorrectly identified as a permanent difference and accordingly there was no deferred tax impact reflected in the periods following the acquisition.
On subsequent review it was identified that under IAS 12 the difference must be classified as temporary and a deferred tax liability recognised over the 15 year period the Group benefits from the tax deductibility of the goodwill.
The impact of correcting this error is to recognise a deferred tax liability, a corresponding increase of deferred tax charge through the Groups reported tax charge and exchange differences arising on translation of foreign operations.
The errors have been corrected by restating each of the affected financial statement line items for the prior period as follows: Audited Restated 12 Months to Increase 12 Months to 31 Dec 2017 Decrease 31 Dec 2017 Consolidated Income Statement extract 000 000 000 Tax 4,277 3 4,274 Basic EPS p 13.1 - 13.1 Diluted EPS p 12.7 - 12.7 1 Underlying basic EPS p 24.4 1.6 22.8 1 Underlying diluted basic EPS p 23.7 1.5 22.2 Consolidated Balance Sheet extract Goodwill 100,387 6,884 107,271 Deferred tax liabilities 2,144 6,828 8,972 Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity extract Retranslation reserve 14,377 53 14,324 1.
As the reported tax impact of the prior period errors largely net off there is a nill effect on any EPS measures as a result of the prior period errors.
As a result of the change of approach with regards to the tax impact of non-underlying items, as highlighted in Note 11, the underlying basic EPS and underlying diluted basic EPS have decreased by 1.6 pence and 1.5 pence respectively.

In accordance with the Groups accounting policy, the carrying value of goodwill is not subject to systematic amortisation but is reviewed annually for impairment.
The review assesses whether the carrying value of goodwill could be supported by the recoverable amount which is determined through value in use calculations of each cash-generating unit CGU.
The key assumptions applied in the value in use calculations are the discount rates and the projected revenue and costs.
The goodwill has been allocated to the CGUs as follows: Carrying value Goodwill 000 Sanne South Africa 8,272 Sanne Netherlands 1,649 Sanne North Americas 43,079 Sanne Mauritius 59,391 Sanne Luxembourg 68,165 Sanne Spain 8,372 188,928 The recoverable amounts of all CGUs are based on the same key assumptions and the values of those assumptions are specific to, andinsome cases differ across, each CGU.
Discount rates Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money.
Inassessingthe discount rate applicable to the Group the following factors have been considered: i Long term treasury bond rate for the relevant jurisdiction ii The cost of equity based on an adjusted Beta for the relevant jurisdiction iii The risk premium to reflect the increased risk of investing in equities Using the above assumptions have resulted in weighted average cost of capital of 21% for Sanne South Africa, 8.6% for Sanne Netherlands, 11.7% for Sanne North America and 12.6% for Sanne Mauritius, 7.9% for Sanne Luxembourg and 10.3% for Sanne Spain.
Goodwill continued Projected revenue and costs Projected revenue and costs are calculated with reference to each CGUs latest budget and business plan which are subject to a rigorous review and challenge process.
Management prepare the budgets through an assessment of historic revenues from existing clients, the pipeline of new projects, historic pricing, and the required resource base needed to service new and existing clients, coupled with their knowledge of wider industry trends and the economic environment.
Projected revenue and costs are calculated using the prior period actual result and compounding these results by the budgeted numbers.
Growth rates used are specific to the cash generating units and varies between 3% to 36%.
The terminal growth rate used is 2.1% and is applied after five years.
Based on the value in use calculations none of the CGUs show indicators of impairment.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions, on which recoverable amount per CGU is based, wouldnot cause the aggregate carrying amount to materially exceed the recoverable amount on the CGUs.

Intangible assets continued The method of valuation and subsequent review of the carrying value of intangible assets is outlined in note 3.
As part of that subsequent review, triggers for impairment were detected and value in use calculations were performed for the intangible assets relating to the Delorean, IDS Group and Sorato acquisitions.
A 55k impairment was recognised in operating expenses, for the Sorato intangibles, stemming from the loss of a small number of existing contracts acquired in the Dutch acquisition.
The Delorean and IDS Group intangibles had a value in use which is higher than the current carrying value.
The value in use calculations were performed by using the weighted average cost of capital to discount the cash flows.
The rates used were 6.7% 2017: 7.7% for Sanne UK, 15.1% 2017: 14.28% for Sanne South Africa, 6.9% 2017: 10.43% for Sanne Netherlands, 7.7% 2017: 8% for Sanne North America and 10.7% 2017: 13.3% for Sanne Mauritius, 6.4% for Sanne Luxembourg and 8% for Sanne Spain.
Annual amortisation is recognised in operating expenses.

In terms of the act in Mauritius, an employer is obligated to pay a lump sum to the employee upon retirement in proportion to the years of service employed atthe company.
The Group has no specific assets to cover the obligation as it is all self-funded by the Group.
The Group recognised a net defined benefit liability of 701k 2017: 718k on the Balance sheet in respect of amounts that are expected tobe paid out to employees under the Act.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the defined benefit liability was carried out at 31 December 2018 by the State Insurance Company ofMauritius.

The fair value measurement of the Groups financial and non-financial assets and liabilities utilises market observable inputs and data as far as possible.
Inputs used in determining fair value measurements are categorised into different levels based on how observable the inputs used in the valuation technique utilised are the fair value hierarchy : Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical items: Level 2: Observable direct or indirect inputs other than Level 1 inputs: and Level 3: Unobservable inputs, thus not derived from market data.
The classification of an item into the above levels is based on the lowest level of the inputs used that has a significant effect on the fair value measurement of the item.
Transfers of items between levels are recognised in the period they occur.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The managed capital refers to the groups debt and equity balances.
As disclosed in note 26, the Group has a loan which requires it to meet cash flow, leverage and interest cover covenants.
In order to achieve the Groups capital risk management objective, the Group aims to ensure that it meets financial covenants attached to borrowings.
Breaches in meeting the financial covenants would permit the lender to immediately call the loan.
In line with the loan agreement the Group tests compliance with the financial covenants on a quarterly basis and considers the results inmaking decisions affecting dividend payments to shareholders or issue of new shares.
Individual regulated entities within the Group are subject to regulatory requirements to ensure adequate capital and liquidity to meet local requirements in Jersey, UK, Guernsey, Ireland, Netherlands, Luxembourg and South Africa, which are monitored monthly to ensure compliance.
There have been no breaches of applicable regulatory requirements during the year or at year end.
Financial instruments continued Financial risk management objectives The financial risk management policies are discussed by the management of the Group on a regular basis to ensure that these are in line with the overall business strategies and its risk management philosophy.
Management sets policies which seek to minimise the potential adverse effects affecting the financial performance of the Group.
Management provides necessary guidance and instructions to the employees covering specific areas, such as market risk foreign exchange and interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, and in investing excess cash.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.
Interest rate risk management The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at floating interest rates, the interest rates are directly linkedto the LIBOR plus a margin based on the leverage ratio of the Group, the higher the leverage ratio the higher the margin on the LIBOR.
The risk is managed by the Group maintaining an appropriate leverage ratio and through this ensuring that the interest rate is kept as low aspossible.
The Groups exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section ofthis note.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the floating rate liabilities.
The Group considers a reasonable interest rate movement in LIBOR to be 25 basis points based on historical changes to interest rates.
Ifinterest rates had been higher lower by 25 basis points and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit for the year ended 31December 2018 would decrease increase by 229k 2017: 172k.
Foreign currency risk management The Group manages exposure to foreign exchange rates by carrying out the majority of its transactions in the functional currency of the Group company in the jurisdiction in which it operates.
The Group entities maintain assets in foreign currencies sufficient for regulatory capital purposes in each jurisdiction.
The Group continues to appraise the potential impacts of the United Kingdoms referendum on EU membership Brexit, the volatility of the Sterling is due to the uncertainties around the effect it might have but the Groups strong momentum and diverse geographic presence, as well as the favourable underlying trends in the markets in which we operate, give the Directors confidence in the continued management of the possible Brexit effect.
The carrying amounts of the Groups material foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities are as follows: Assets Liabilities 2018 2017 2018 2017 000 000 000 000 1 Euro 29,846 30,931 324 256 United States Dollar 18,261 16,442 8 1,130 South African Rand 2,410 2,106 2 1,031 50,517 49,479 330 2,417 1.
Included in the Euro exposure at 31 December 2017 is 21.2 million cash for the LIS Group acquisition which completed on 6 February 2018 note 31.
Where considered necessary the Group will manage its foreign currency risk through hedging arrangements.
A foreign currency contract was entered into during the prior year to buy Euro for the LIS acquisition, this contract was closed during the year.

Financial instruments continued Foreign currency risk management sensitivity analysis The principal currency of the Groups financial assets and liabilities is Pounds Sterling.
The Group, however, does own trading subsidiaries based in the United States of America, South Africa, Mauritius, Asia and Europe which are denominated in a currency other than the principal currency.
The Group therefore faces currency exposures.
