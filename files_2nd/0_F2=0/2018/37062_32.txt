Accounting Policies Basis of preparation The Annual Report and Accounts of IP Group plc IP Group or the Company and its subsidiary companies together, the Group are for the year ended 31 December 2018.
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below.
The policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, International Accounting Standards and Interpretations collectively IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB as adopted by the European Union adopted IFRSs.
The preparation of financial statements in compliance with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires Group management to exercise judgement in the most appropriate selection of the Groups accounting policies.
The areas where significant judgements and estimates have been made in preparing the financial statements and their effect are disclosed in note 3.
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, as the directors are satisfied that the Group and parent Company have the resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future.
In making this assessment, the directors have considered a wide range of information relating to present and future conditions, including future projections of profitability, cash flows and capital resources.
Changes in accounting policies i New standards, interpretations and amendments effective from 1 January 2018 The following new standards have been applied in these financial statements: IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: IFRS 15 was issued on 28 May 2014 and provides a global standard on revenue recognition which aligns the IFRS and US GAAP guidance.
It replaces existing revenue recognition guidance, including IAS 18 revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: IFRS 9 will eventually replace IAS 39 in its entirety.
The process has been divided into three main components, being classification and measurement: impairment: and hedge accounting.
No new standards, interpretations and amendments effective for the first time from 1 January 2018 have had a material effect on the Groups financial statements.
ii New standards, interpretations and amendments not yet effective The following new standard, which has not been applied in these financial statements, will or may have an effect on the Groups future financial statements: IFRS 16 Leases: IFRS 16 Leases was issued on 13 January 2016 and replaces IAS 17 Leases.
IFRS 16 requires all operating leases in excess of one year, where the Group is the lessee, to be included on the Groups statement of financial position, and recognised as a right-of-use ROU asset and a related lease liability representing the obligation to make lease payments.
The ROU asset will be amortised on a straight-line basis with the lease liability being amortised using the effective interest method.
Optional exemptions are available under IFRS 16 for short-term leases lease terms less than 12 months and for small-value leases.
Based on the preliminary assessment, the Group expects its existing operating lease arrangements as a lessee to be recognised as ROU assets with corresponding lease liabilities under the new standard.
The Group has assessed the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements resulting from the application of IFRS 16 and does not foresee any material effect when the Standard is applied.
Early adoption is permitted if IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with customers has been applied but IFRS 16 has an effective date of 1 January 2019 with the year ending 31 December 2019 being the first annual financial statements to which the standard applies.
None of the other new standards, interpretations and amendments not yet effective are expected to have a material effect on the Groups future financial statements.
Accounting Policies continued Basis of consolidation i Business Combinations The Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method from the date that control is transferred to the Group see ii Subsidiaries below.
Both the identifiable net assets and the consideration transferred in the acquisition are measured at fair value at the date of acquisition and transaction costs are expensed as incurred.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is tested at least annually for impairment.
In instances where the Group owns a non-controlling stake prior to acquisition the step acquisition method is applied, and any gain or losses on the fair value of the pre-acquisition holding is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
ii Subsidiaries Where the Group has control over an entity, it is classified as a subsidiary.
As per IFRS 10, an entity is classed as under the control of the Group when all three of the following elements are present: power over the entity: exposure to variable returns from the entity: and the ability of the Group to use its power to affect those variable returns.
Control is reassessed whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there may be a change in any of these elements of control.
In situations where the Company has the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee without holding the majority of the voting rights, it is considered that fide facto control exists.
In determining whether fide facto control exists the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances, including: The size of the Companys voting rights relative to both the size and dispersion of other parties who hold voting rights: Substantive potential voting rights held by the Company and by other parties: Other contractual arrangements: and Historic patterns in voting attendance.
The consolidated financial statements present the results of the Company and its subsidiaries as if they formed a single entity.
Intercompany transactions and balances between Group companies are therefore eliminated in full.
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the acquisition method.
In the statement of financial position, the acquirees identifiable assets and liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.
Contingent liabilities dependent on the disposed value of an associated investment are only recognised when the fair value is above the associated threshold.
The results of acquired operations are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the date on which control is obtained.
They are consolidated until the date on which control ceases.
iii Associates Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence, but does not control, generally accompanied by a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.
No associates are presented on the consolidated statement of financial position as the Group elects to hold such investments at fair value in the consolidated statement of financial position.
This treatment is permitted by IAS 28 Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures, which permits investments held by entities that are akin to venture capital organisations to be excluded from its measurement methodology requirements where those investments are designated, upon initial recognition, as at fair value through profit or loss and accounted for in accordance with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments.
Changes in fair value of associates are recognised in profit or loss in the period of the change.
The Group has no interests in associates through which it carries on its business.
The disclosures required by Section 409 of the Companies Act 2006 for associated undertakings are included in note 10 of the Company financial statements.
Similarly, those investments which may not have qualified as an Associate but fall within the wider scope of significant holdings and so are subject to Section 409 disclosure acts are also included in note 10 of the Company financial statements.

Accounting Policies continued iv Limited Partnerships and Limited Liability Partnerships Limited Partnerships Group entities act as general partner and investment manager to the following Limited Partnerships: Interest in limited partnership Name % IP Venture Fund II LP IPVFII 33.3 IP Venture Fund LP IPVF 10.0 The North East Technology Fund LP NETF The Group receives compensation for its role as investment manager to these Limited Partnerships, including fixed fees and performance fees.
The directors consider that these amounts are in substance and form normal market rate compensation for its role as investment manager.
In order to determine whether these Limited Partnerships were required to be consolidated, the presence of the three elements of control noted in part ii was examined.
The Groups significant stake in IPVFII creates a significant exposure to the variability of returns from those interests and the Groups ability to direct the operations of the fund would result in IP Group obtaining the benefits of its activities.
As such, IPVFII meets the criteria in IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and is consequently consolidated.
In the case of IPVF, the directors consider that the minority Limited Partnership interest does not create an exposure of such significance that it indicates that the Group acts as anything other than an agent for the other Limited Partners in the arrangement.
This is further supported by the presence of a strict investment policy and the inability for the general partner to change the restrictive terms of that policy other than with agreement of 100% of IPVFs Limited Partners.
Similarly, the lack of a stake in NETF indicates the Groups role as an agent for the limited partner.
As a result, the directors consider that the Group does not have the power to govern the operations of these limited partnerships so as to obtain benefits from their activities and accordingly do not meet the definition of a subsidiary under IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements.
However, the Group does have the power to exercise significant influence over its limited partnerships and accordingly the Groups accounting treatment for the interest in IPVF is consistent with that of associates as described earlier in this report, i. e. in accordance with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and designated as at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition.
In addition to Limited Partnerships where Group entities act as general partner and investment manager the Group has interests in three further entities which are all managed by third parties: Interest in limited partnership Name % UCL Technology Fund LP UCL Fund 46.4 Technikos LLP Technikos 18.0 Apollo Therapeutics LLP Apollo Fund 8.3 The Group has a 46.4% interest in the total capital commitments of the UCL Technology Fund LP UCL Fund.
The Group has committed 24.8m to the fund alongside the European Investment Fund EIF, University College London and other investors.
Participation in the fund provides the Group with visibility of potential intellectual property from across University College Londons research base.
The Group has an 18.0% interest in the total capital commitments of Technikos LLP Technikos.
The Group has an 8.3% interest in the total capital commitments of Apollo Therapeutics LLP Apollo, a 40.0m venture between AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson and the technology transfer offices of Imperial College London via Imperial Innovations Limited, University College London via UCL Business plc and the University of Cambridge via Cambridge Enterprise Limited.
The venture supports the translation of academic therapeutic science into innovative new medicines by combining the skills of the university academics with industry expertise at an early stage.
Accounting Policies continued v Non-controlling interests The total comprehensive income, assets and liabilities of non-wholly owned subsidiaries are attributed to owners of the parent and to the non-controlling interests in proportion to their relative ownership interests.
Portfolio return and revenue Change in fair value Change in fair value of equity and debt investments represents revaluation gains and losses on the Groups portfolio of investments.
Gains on disposal of equity investments represent the difference between the fair value of consideration received and the carrying value at the start of the accounting period on the disposal of equity investments.
Change in fair value of Limited Partnership investments represents revaluation gains and losses on the Groups investments in Limited Partnership funds.
Changes in fair values of assets do not constitute revenue.
Licence income Income from licensing and similar income is recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with the terms of the relevant licensing agreements.
Income from milestone income is recognised once performance obligations are satisfied, on an accruals basis and in accordance with the terms of the relevant licensing agreements.
Revenue from services and other income All revenue from services is generated within the United Kingdom and is stated exclusive of value added tax.
Revenue is recognised when the Group satisfies its performance obligations, in line with IFRS 15.
Revenue from services and other income comprises: Advisory fees Fees earned from the provision of business support services are recognised as the related services are provided.
Corporate finance advisory fees are generally earned as a fixed percentage of total funds raised and recognised at the time the related transaction is successfully concluded.
In some instances, these fees are settled via the issue of equity in the company receiving the corporate finance services at the same price per share as equity issued as part the financing round to which the advisory fees apply.
Fund management services Fund management fees include fiduciary fund management fees which are generally earned as a fixed percentage of total funds under management and are recognised as the related services are provided and performance fees payable from realisation of agreed returns to investors which are recognised as performance criterion are met.
Dividends Dividends receivable from equity shares are included within other portfolio income and recognised on the ex-dividend date or, where no ex-dividend date is quoted, are recognised when the Groups right to receive payment is established.
Property, plant and equipment All property, plant and equipment is shown at cost less subsequent depreciation and impairment.
Cost includes expenditure that is attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Depreciation on assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of each asset to its residual value over its estimated useful life, as follows: Fixtures and fittings Over three to five years Computer equipment Over three to five years The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date.

Accounting Policies continued Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets and allocated from the acquisition date to each of the Groups cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination.
Goodwill may be allocated to CGUs in both the acquired business and in the existing business.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets represent contractual arrangements and memorandums of understanding with UK universities acquired through acquisition of subsidiaries.
At the date of acquisition, the cost of these intangibles as a share of the larger acquisition was calculated and subsequently the assets are held at amortised cost.
Impairment of intangible assets including goodwill Goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are tested for impairment when events or a change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and the value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairments, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows i. e. CGUs.
Financial assets In respect of regular way purchases or sales, the Group uses trade date accounting to recognise or derecognise financial assets.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the assets have expired or the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
The Group classifies its financial assets into one of the categories listed below, depending on the purpose for which the asset was acquired.
None of the Groups financial assets are categorised as held to maturity or available for sale.
i At fair value through profit or loss Under IFRS 9, held for trading and financial assets which were previously designated at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition are now required to be recognised at fair value through profit and loss.
This category includes equity investments, debt investments and investments in limited partnerships.
Investments in associated undertakings, which are held by the Group with a view to the ultimate realisation of capital gains, are also categorised as at fair value through profit or loss.
This measurement basis is consistent with the fact that the Groups performance in respect of investments in equity investments, limited partnerships and associated undertakings is evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with an established investment strategy.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value and any gains or losses arising from subsequent changes in fair value are presented in profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive income in the period which they arise.
Fair value hierarchy The Group classifies financial assets using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the related fair value measurements.
The level in the fair value hierarchy, within which a financial asset is classified, is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to that assets fair value measurement.
The fair value hierarchy has the following levels: Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets.
Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as prices from market transactions.
Level 3 One or more inputs that are not based on observable market data.
Accounting Policies continued As an additional disclosure, we present a further analysis of Level 3 in note 15, reflecting the following categories: Level 3a equity Equity investments where prices have been determined from recent investments in the last twelve months.
Level 3b Equity investments using valuation techniques that are not supported by observable market prices or rates.
This includes where prices have been determined from the most recent market transaction, but that transaction occurred more than twelve months prior to the balance sheet date, and a variety of other valuation techniques.
Equity investments The fair values of quoted investments are based on bid prices in an active market at the reporting date.
The fair value of unlisted securities is established using valuation techniques.
These include the use of recent arms length transactions, discounted cash flow analysis and earnings multiples.
Wherever possible, the Group uses valuation techniques which make maximum use of market-based inputs.
Accordingly, the valuation methodology used most commonly by the Group is the price of recent investment contained in the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines the IPEV Guidelines endorsed by the British and European Venture Capital Associations.
The following considerations are used when calculating the fair value of unlisted securities: Cost Where the investment being valued was itself made recently, its cost may provide a good indication of fair value unless there is objective evidence that the investment has since been impaired, such as observable data suggesting a deterioration of the financial, technical, or commercial performance of the underlying business.
Price of recent investment The Group considers that fair value estimates, which are based entirely on observable market data, will be of greater reliability than those based on assumptions and, accordingly, where there has been any recent investment by third parties, the price of that investment will generally provide a basis of the valuation.
The length of period for which it remains appropriate to use the price of recent investment depends on the specific circumstances of the investment and the stability of the external environment.
Given the nature of the Groups investments in seed, start-up and early-stage companies, where there are often no current and no short-term future earnings or positive cash flows, it can be difficult to gauge the probability and financial impact of the success or failure of development or research activities and to make reliable cash flow forecasts.
Consequently, the most appropriate approach to determine fair value is a methodology that is based on market data, that being the price of a recent investment.
Where the Group considers that the price of recent investment, unadjusted, is no longer relevant and there are limited or no comparable companies or transactions from which to infer value, the Group carries out an enhanced assessment based on milestone analysis and or industry and sector analysis.
In applying the milestone analysis approach to investments in companies in early or development stages, the Group seeks to determine whether there is an indication of change in fair value based on a consideration of performance against any milestones that were set at the time of the original investment decision, as well as taking into consideration the key market drivers of the investee company and the overall economic environment.
Where the equity structure of a portfolio company involves different class rights in a sale or liquidity event, the Group takes these different rights into account when forming a view on the value of its investment.
Where the Group considers that there is an indication that the fair value has changed, an estimation is made of the required amount of any adjustment from the last price of recent investment, or an alternative valuation technique is used where this is deemed more appropriate.
Where a deterioration in value has occurred, the Group reduces the carrying value of the investment to reflect the estimated decrease.
If there is evidence of value creation the Group may consider increasing the carrying value of the investment: however, in the absence of additional financing rounds or profit generation it can be difficult to determine the value that a purchaser may place on positive developments given the potential outcome and the costs and risks to achieving that outcome and, accordingly, caution is applied.
Factors that the Group considers include, inter alia, technical measures such as product development phases and patent approvals, financial measures such as cash burn rate and profitability expectations, and market and sales measures such as testing phases, product launches and market introduction.

Accounting Policies continued Other valuation techniques Where it is no longer deemed appropriate to use the price of recent investment as a valuation basis, the Group uses alternative methodologies in the IPEV Guidelines such as discounted cash flows DCF or price-earnings multiples.
DCF involves estimating the fair value of a business by calculating the present value of expected future cash flows, based on the most recent forecasts in respect of the underlying business.
When using the earnings multiple methodology, earnings before interest and tax EBIT are generally used, adjusted to a maintainable level.
A suitable earnings multiple is derived from an equivalent business or group of businesses, for which the average price-earnings multiple for the relevant sector index can generally be considered a suitable proxy.
This multiple is applied to earnings to derive an enterprise value which is then discounted by up to 60% for non-marketability and other risks inherent to businesses in early stages of operation.
No reliable estimate Where a fair value cannot be estimated reliably, the investment is reported at the carrying value at the previous reporting date unless there is objective evidence that the investment has since been impaired.
Debt investments Debt investments are generally unquoted debt instruments which are convertible to equity at a future point in time.
Such instruments are considered to be hybrid instruments containing a fixed rate debt host contract with an embedded equity derivative.
The Group designates the entire hybrid contract at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition and, accordingly, the embedded derivative is not separated from the host contract and accounted for separately.
The fair value of debt on initial recognition is measured at fair value which is equal to cost and subsequent remeasurement will be recognised as changes in fair value in the statement of comprehensive income.
ii Loans and receivables These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed and determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They arise principally through the provision of services to customers trade receivables and are carried at cost less provision for impairment.
Deposits Deposits comprise longer-term deposits held with financial institutions with an original maturity of greater than three months.
Cash flows related to amounts held on deposit are presented within Investing activities in the Consolidated statement of cash flows.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and short-term deposits held with financial institutions with an original maturity of three months or less.
Financial liabilities Current financial liabilities are composed of trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities, which are recognised at amortised cost.
Non-current liabilities are composed of loans from Limited Partners of consolidated funds, outstanding amounts drawn down from a debt facility provided by the European Investment Bank, carried interest plans liabilities, provisions for liabilities and charges, liabilities recognised in relation to Higher Education Innovation Fund HEIF and University Challenge Seed Fund UCSF investment revenue sharing schemes and deferred consideration payable on acquisition of Parkwalk Advisors.
The loans from Limited Partners of consolidated funds are repayable only upon the applicable funds generating sufficient returns to repay the Limited Partners.
Management anticipates that the funds will generate the required returns and consequently recognises the full associated liabilities.
Non-current liabilities are recognised initially at fair value net of transaction costs incurred, and subsequently at amortised cost.
The Group operates a carried interest plan or Long-Term Incentive Carry Scheme LTICS for eligible employees.
Before any payment to a participant becomes due under the scheme, the Group must first have received back the amount of their investment in the relevant vintage together with a hurdle rate of 8% per annum compound on their investment.
At the point at which the hurdle rate has been exceeded a provision is included for the unrealised gain due to members of the scheme vintage.
The provision is measured by reference to the fair value of the relevant investments, with movements in the provision taken to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Accounting Policies continued The Group provides for liabilities in respect of revenue sharing with Imperial College London, arising under the Technology Pipeline Agreement TPA, and other parties.
The liability for revenue-share, based on fair value, on the future realisation of quoted and unquoted investments is recognised as part of the movement in fair value through profit or loss.
Deferred and contingent consideration payable on acquisition comprise amounts due to the sellers of Parkwalk Advisors.
Unless otherwise indicated, the carrying amounts of the Groups financial liabilities are a reasonable approximation to their fair value.
Share capital Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity if the holders have only a residual interest in the Groups assets after deducting all liabilities.
The objective of the Group is to manage capital so as to provide shareholders with aboveaverage returns through capital growth over the medium to long-term.
The Group considers its capital to comprise its share capital, share premium, merger reserve and retained earnings.
Top Technology Ventures Limited, Parkwalk Advisors Ltd and Touchstone Investment Management Limited, are Group subsidiaries which are subject to external capital requirements imposed by the Financial Conduct Authority FCA and as such must ensure that it has sufficient capital to satisfy these requirements.
The Group ensures it remains compliant with these requirements as described in their respective financial statements.
Employee benefits i Pension obligations The Group operates a company defined contribution pension scheme for which all employees are eligible.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds.
The Group currently makes contributions on behalf of employees to this scheme or to employee personal pension schemes on an individual basis.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expenses when they are due.
ii Share-based payments The Group engages in equity-settled share-based payment transactions in respect of services receivable from employees, by granting employees conditional awards of ordinary shares subject to certain vesting conditions.
Conditional awards of shares are made pursuant to the Groups Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP awards and or the Groups Annual Incentive Scheme AIS.
The fair value of the shares is estimated at the date of grant, taking into account the terms and conditions of the award, including market-based performance conditions.
The fair value at the date of grant is recognised as an expense over the period that the employee provides services, generally the period between the start of the performance period and the vesting date of the shares.
The corresponding credit is recognised in retained earnings within total equity.
The fair value of services is calculated using the market value on the date of award and is adjusted for expected and actual levels of vesting.
Where conditional awards of shares lapse the expense recognised to date is credited to the statement of comprehensive income in the year in which they lapse.
Where the terms for an equity-settled award are modified, and the modification increases the total fair value of the sharebased payment, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee at the date of modification, the incremental fair value is amortised over the vesting period.
Deferred tax Full provision is made for deferred tax on all temporary differences resulting from the carrying value of an asset or liability and its tax base.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or deferred tax liability settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that the deferred tax asset will be recovered in the future.
Leases Leases where the lessor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases are charged to administrative expenses in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

Financial Risk Management As set out in the Principal risks and uncertainties section on pages 48 to 54, the Group is exposed, through its normal operations, to a number of financial risks, the most significant of which are market, liquidity and credit risks.
In general, risk management is carried out throughout the Group under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
The following further describes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks and the methods used to measure them.
Further quantitative information in respect of these risks is presented throughout these financial statements.
a Market risk i Price risk The Group is exposed to equity securities price risk as a result of the equity and debt investments, and investments in Limited Partnerships held by the Group and categorised as at fair value through profit or loss.
The Group mitigates this risk by having established investment appraisal processes and asset monitoring procedures which are subject to overall review by the Board.
The Group has also established corporate finance and communications teams dedicated to supporting portfolio companies with fundraising activities and investor relations.
The Group holds investments which are publicly traded on AIM 20 companies and investments which are not traded on an active market.
The net portfolio loss in 2018 of 48.4m represents a 4.3 % change against the opening balance 2017: net increase of 94.2m, 15.3% change and a similar increase or decrease in the prices of quoted and unquoted investments is considered to be reasonably possible.
The table below summarises the impact of a 1% increase decrease in the price of both quoted and unquoted investments on the Groups post-tax profit for the year and on equity.

A facility of 30m which bears interest at a fixed rate of 1.98% with an additional variable spread equal to the six month GBP LIBOR rate as at the first date of each six-month interest period.
The average floating interest rate including the fixed element for 2018 was 2.69% 2017: 2.66%.
The second facility of 9.6m is based on a floating interest rate including LIBOR and the average interest in the year was 3.42% 2017: 3.13%.
There are no hedging instruments in place to cover against interest rate fluctuation as exposure is deemed insignificant.
The other primary impact of interest rate risk to the Group is the impact on the income and operating cash flows as a result of the interest-bearing deposits and cash and cash equivalents held by the Group.
Financial Risk Management continued iii Concentrations of risk The Group is exposed to concentration risk via the significant majority of the portfolio being UK-based companies and thus subject to the performance of the UK economy.
The Group is increasing its operations in the US and the determination of the associated concentrations is determined by the number of investment opportunities that management believes represent a good investment.
The Group mitigates this risk, in co-ordination with liquidity risk, by managing its proportion of fixed to floating rate financial assets.
The table below summarises the interest rate profile of the Group.

b Liquidity risk The Group seeks to manage liquidity risk, to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest cash assets safely and profitably.
The Groups Treasury Management Policy asserts that at any one point in time no more than 60% of the Groups cash and cash equivalents will be placed in fixed-term deposits with a holding period greater than three months.
Accordingly, the Group only invests working capital in short-term instruments issued by reputable counterparties.
The Group continually monitors rolling cash flow forecasts to ensure sufficient cash is available for anticipated cash requirements.

Financial Risk Management continued c Credit risk The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its deposits, cash and cash equivalents, debt investments and trade receivables.
The Group seeks to mitigate its credit risk on cash and cash equivalents by making short-term deposits with counterparties, or by investing in treasury funds with an AA credit rating or above managed by institutions.
Short-term deposit counterparties are required to have most recently reported total assets in excess of 5bn and, where applicable, a prime short-term credit rating at the time of investment ratings are generally determined by Moodys or Standard & Poors.
Moodys prime credit ratings of P1, P2 and P3 indicate respectively that the rating agency considers the counterparty to have a superior, strong or acceptable ability to repay short-term debt obligations generally defined as having an original maturity not exceeding 13 months.
An analysis of the Groups deposits and cash and cash equivalents balance analysed by credit rating as at the reporting date is shown in the table opposite.
All other financial assets are unrated.

The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The Group has detailed policies and strategies which seek to minimise these associated risks including defining maximum counterparty exposure limits for term deposits based on their perceived financial strength at the commencement of the deposit.
The maximum single counterparty limit for deposits at 31 December 2018 was the greater of 50% of total deposits or 50.0m 2017: 50.0m.
The Groups exposure to credit risk on debt investments is managed in a similar way to equity price risk, as described earlier, through the Groups investment appraisal processes and asset monitoring procedures which are subject to overall review by the Board.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for debt investments, receivables and other financial assets is represented by their carrying amount.
Significant Accounting Estimates and Judgements The directors make judgements and estimates concerning the future.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, such as expectations of future events, and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and assumptions which have the most significant effects on the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities in the financial statements are discussed below.
i Valuation of unquoted equity investments The Groups accounting policy in respect of the valuation of unquoted equity investments is set out in note 1.
In applying this policy, the key areas over which judgment are exercised include: Consideration of whether a funding round is sufficiently arms length to be representative of fair value The length of time for which the price of recent investment remains the most appropriate measure of fair value In the case of companies with complex capital structures, the appropriate methodology for assigning value to different classes of equity based on their differential economic rights Where using alternative valuation methods such as discounted cash flows, inputs including the probability of achieving milestones and the discount rate used.
In all cases, valuations are based on the judgement of the directors after consideration of the above and upon available information believed to be reliable, which may be affected by conditions in the financial markets.
Due to the inherent uncertainty of the investment valuations, the estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed, and the differences could be material.
ii Goodwill impairment testing Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an indication that the carrying amount may not be recoverable based on managements judgements regarding the future prospects of the business and an estimation of the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit CGU to which goodwill is allocated.
The recoverable amount is based on value in use calculations which requires estimates of future cash flows expected from the CGU and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
The key assumptions for the University Partnerships CGU are the rate of return achieved, the annual investment rate, the long-term growth rate and the discount rate.
See note 12 for further details.
Revenue from Services All revenue from services is derived from either the provision of advisory and venture capital fund management services or from licensing activities, royalty revenues and patent cost recoveries.

Operating Segments For both the year ended 31 December 2018 and the year ended 31 December 2017, the Groups revenue and profit loss before taxation were derived almost entirely from its principal activities within the UK.
For management reporting purposes, the Group is currently organised into three operating segments: i. the commercialisation of intellectual property via the formation of long-term partner relationships with universities: ii.
the management of venture capital funds focusing on early-stage UK technology companies: iii.
the in-licensing of drugable intellectual property from research-intensive institutions, which activity ceased in 2017.
Consideration has been given to whether the UK Life Sciences and Technology partnerships or the US and Australasian operations represent separate reporting segments.
In light of the executive-level management of several strategic assets in the portfolio, the involvement of the Board in the investment approval process for larger investments, and following consideration of the criteria for aggregation of operating segments, we conclude that this is not the case.
These activities are described in further detail in the strategic report on pages 8 to 17.

Taxation 2018 2017 m m Current tax UK corporation tax on losses profits for the year Foreign tax 0.1 0.1 Deferred tax Total tax 0.1 The Group primarily seeks to generate capital gains from its holdings in spin-out companies over the longer-term but has historically made annual net operating losses from its operations from a UK tax perspective.
Capital gains achieved by the Group would ordinarily be taxed upon realisation of such holdings.
The directors continue to believe that the Group qualifies for the Substantial Shareholdings Exemption SSE.
The majority of investments acquired via the combination with Touchstone Innovations plc were previously held via Imperial Innovation Srl, which exempted dividends and gains from tax under Luxembourg law provided the conditions for the relevant participation exemption were met.
During the year, the Group unwound this structure and, as a result, the assets of Touchstone Innovations are now subject to the UK tax regime described above.

Goodwill continued Impairment review of the university partnership CGU The recoverability of this CGU was based on its value in use, determined by discounting the future cash flows to be generated from the continuing use of the CGU.
The key assumptions used in the estimation of value in use are shown below.
For the purposes of impairment testing, the university partnership CGU comprises those elements connected with the Groups university partnership business.
The directors consider that for each of the key variables which would be relevant in determining a recoverable value for this CGU, there is a range of possible alternative values.
The key variable ranges are set out below: 2018 2017 Rate of return achieved 12-14% 15%20% i Annual investment rate 80m-90m 125m135m Long-term growth rate 1.5%-1.7% 1.5%1.7% Discount rate 9%-10% 10%-15% i The 2017 values have been represented to include capital investment in the Touchstone Innovations portfolio During the year, the Group has experienced negative portfolio returns as a result of a broad deterioration in equity market sentiment which has impacted the value of the Groups quoted portfolio, as well as the specific impact of the failure of Diurnal plcs Phase III clinical trial for Chronocort.
Management views these factors as potential indicators of impairment and have considered their impact on the assumptions used in the Groups goodwill impairment model.
The rate of return estimate has previously been based on the Groups long-term returns forecast, which was supported by the Groups cumulative IRR performance.
As a result of the factors noted above, in 2018 there was a significant divergence between forecast and actual portfolio returns performance, accompanied by a drop in the Groups cumulative IRR performance.
As a result, management no longer deems it appropriate to base the rate of return assumption on forecast portfolio returns and have instead based it on the Groups historical cumulative IRR performance to date.
The resulting reduction in the forecast IRR is the primary factor resulting in the full impairment of goodwill in this CGU.
The annual investment rate has been projected taking into account the Groups average anticipated portfolio investment level over the period covered by its financial forecasting period.
The decline in the projected annual investment rate reflects the completion of the integration of the IP Group and Touchstone portfolios, with the combined investment teams focusing on the most promising opportunities in the combined portfolio.
The discount rate was a pre-tax measure estimated based on an industry average weighted cost of capital.
The long-term growth rate was based on the International Monetary Funds five year UK real GDP growth rate, which the directors believe appropriately reflects the long-term growth assumption that a market participant would make.
Impairment review of venture capital fund management CGU The key assumptions of the DCF model used to assess the value in use are shown below: 2018 2017 m m Discount rate 9-10% 9%11% Number of funds under management 3 3 Remaining average fund life years 1.5 2.5 Annual management fee 2%-3.25% 2%3.25% Cost inflation 1.5% 2.5% Long-term growth rate 1.7% 1.9% The recoverability of this CGU was based on its value in use, determined by discounting the future cash flows to be generated from the continuing use of the CGU.
The Groups value in use model includes an estimate of fund management fees earned during the lifetime of its fixed life funds, which currently include investments from a number of EU-funded bodies.
As a result of uncertainty around the nature of future investments by EU-funded bodies, no extension in the life of these funds is now assumed.
The resulting reduction in the anticipated level of management fees gives rise to a full impairment of goodwill in the Groups venture capital fund management CGU.

Restated following finalisation of provisional acquisition accounting in respect of Touchstone acquisition see note 26 The Groups policy is to classify equity investments in unquoted investments as Level 3a where prices have been determined from recent investments in the last twelve months.
The impact of changing the qualifying criteria for Level 3a to be determined from recent investments in the last six months would mean 31.6% 2017: 23.0% of the equity investments in unquoted spin-out companies would be reclassified to Level 3b.
Investments in 119 2017: 190 companies have been classified as Level 3b.
If the fair value of all Level 3b investments were to decrease by 10%, the net assets figure would decrease by 30.5m 2017: 52.4m, with a corresponding increase if the unobservable inputs were to increase by 10%.
The majority of the assets held within Level 3 are valued based on unobservable inputs related to the price of recent investments.
Assets totalling 33.2m are valued on a discounted cash flow basis: these valuations are sensitive to the discount rate assumed in the valuation of each asset.
Net Investment Portfolio continued If the assumptions used in the valuation techniques for the Groups holding in each company are varied by using a range of possible alternatives, there is no material difference to the carrying value of the respective spin-out company.
The effect on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the period is also not expected to be material.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised at fair value on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole at the end of each reporting period.
Transfers between levels are then made as if the transfer took place on the first day of the period in question, except in the cases of transfers between tiers based on an initial public offering IPO of an investment wherein the changes in value prior to the IPO are calculated and reported in level 3a, and those changes post are attributed to level 1.
Transfers between Level 3a and Level 1 occur when a previously unquoted investment undertakes an initial public offering, resulting in its equity becoming quoted on an active market.
In the current period, transfers of this nature amounted to nil 2017: 13.4m.
Transfers between Level 1 and Level 3a would occur when a quoted investments market becomes inactive, or the portfolio company elects to delist.
There have been no such instances in the current period 2017: no such instances.
Transfers between Level 3b and Level 3a occur when an investment which previously had a most recent investment of over twelve months ago undertakes an investment, resulting in an observable market rate.
In the current period, transfers of this nature amounted to 471.9m 2017: 26.7m.
Transfers between Level 3a and Level 3b occur when an investments recent investment becomes more than twelve months old, with the price being deemed unobservable.
In the current period, transfers of this nature amounted to 164.6m 2017: 280.0m.
Within level 3a equity investments, the distribution by portfolio company holding value is as follows: investments 10m: 505.5m 2017: 177.4m, investments 5m-10m: 97.6m 63.7m, investments 1.5m-5m: 47.7m 2017: 54.5m, investments 1.5m: 6.5m 2017: 6.6m.

The classification of these loans as non-current reflects the forecast timing of returns and subsequent repayment of loans, which is not anticipated to occur within one year.
EIB debt facility The Group has a number of debt facilities with the European Investment Bank which it has used to fund UK university spinout companies as they develop and mature.

The Group must maintain that the amount of unencumbered funds freely available to the Group is not less than 15.0m.
The Group is also required to maintain a separate bank account which must at any date maintain a minimum balance equal to that of all payments due to the EIB in the forthcoming six months.
The Touchstone loans contain a debt covenant requiring that the ratio of the total fair value of investments plus cash and qualifying liquidity to debt should at no time fall below 4:1.
The loan also stipulates that on any date, the aggregate of all amounts scheduled for payment to the EIB in the following six months should be kept in a separate bank account.
The Group closely monitors that the covenants are adhered to on an ongoing basis and has complied with these covenants throughout the year.
The Group will continue to monitor the covenants position against forecasts and budgets to ensure that it operates within the prescribed limits.

Share-Based Payments In 2018, the Group continued to incentivise employees through its LTIP and AIS.
Both are described in more detail in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 90 to 115.
Deferred Bonus Share Plan DBSP Awards made to employees under the Groups AIS above a certain threshold include 50% deferred into IP Group equity through the grant of nil-cost options under the Groups DBSP.
The number of nil-cost options granted under the Groups DBSP is determined by the share price at the vesting date.
The DBSP options are subject to further time-based vesting over two years typically 50% after year one and 50% after year two.
An analysis of movements in the DBSP options outstanding is as follows: Weighted  Number of exercise Number of exercise options price options price 2018 2018 2017 2017 At 1 January 394,494 837,995 AIS deferral shares award during the year 468,901 Exercised during the year 241,145 436,689 Lapsed during the year 16,609 6,812 At 31 December 605,641 394,494 Exercisable at 31 December 153,349 The options outstanding at 31 December 2018 had an exercise price of nil 2017: nil and a weighted-average remaining contractual life of 0.6 years 2017: 0.3 years.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised in 2018 was 127p 2017: 139.17p.
As the 2018 AIS financial performance targets were met and as the number of DBSP options to be granted in order to defer such elements of the AIS payments as are required under our remuneration policy are based on a percentage of employees salary, the share-based payments line includes the associated share-based payments expense incurred in 2018.
Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP Awards under the LTIP take the form of conditional awards of ordinary shares of 2p each in the Group which vest over the prescribed performance period to the extent that performance conditions have been met.
The Remuneration Committee imposes objective conditions on the vesting of awards and these take into consideration the guidance of the Groups institutional investors from time to time.
Further information on the Groups LTIP is set out in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 90 to 115.
The 2018 LTIP awards were made on 10 May 2018.
The awards will ordinarily vest on 31 March 2021, to the extent that the performance conditions have been met.
The awards are based on the performance of the Groups Hard NAV and Total Shareholder Return TSR.
Both performance measures are combined into a matrix format to most appropriately measure performance relative to the business, as shown in the Directors Remuneration Report within the Groups 2018 Annual Report and Accounts.
The total award is subject to an underpin based on the relative performance of the Groups TSR to that of the FTSE 250 index, which can reduce the awards by up to 50%.
The 2018 LTIP matrix is designed such that up to 100% of the award prior to the application of the underpin will vest in full in the event of both Hard NAV increasing by 15% per year on a cumulative basis, from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2020, and TSR increasing by 15% per year on a cumulative basis from the date of award to 31 March 2021, using an industry-standard average price period at the beginning and end of the performance period.
Further, the matrix is designed such that 30% of the award shall vest again prior to the application of the underpin if the cumulative increase is 8% per annum for both measures over their respective performance periods threshold performance.
A straight-line sliding scale is applied for performance between the distinct points on the matrix of vesting targets.
Share-Based Payments continued The 2017 LTIP awards were made on 29 August 2017.
The awards will ordinarily vest on 31 March 2020, to the extent that the performance conditions have been met.
Both performance measures are combined into a matrix format to most appropriately measure performance relative to the business, as shown in the Directors Remuneration Report within the Groups 2017 Annual Report and Accounts.
The 2017 LTIP matrix is designed such that up to 100% of the award prior to the application of the underpin will vest in full in the event of both Hard NAV increasing by 15% per year on a cumulative basis, from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2019, and TSR increasing by 15% per year on a cumulative basis from the date of award to 31 March 2020, using an industry-standard average price period at the beginning and end of the performance period.
The 2016 LTIP awards were made on 16 May 2016.
The awards will ordinarily vest on 31 March 2019, to the extent that the performance conditions have been met.
The 2016 LTIP matrix is designed such that up to 100% of the award prior to the application of the underpin will vest in full in the event of both Hard NAV increasing by 15% per year on a cumulative basis, from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2018, and TSR increasing by 15% per year on a cumulative basis from the date of award to 31 March 2019, using an industry-standard average price period at the beginning and end of the performance period.
The 2015 LTIP awards did not meet the threshold performance target and lapsed on 31 March 2018.

2016 schemes: It was proposed that, given the short period of time since grant, awards would not become exercisable in connection with the Offer and therefore that no progress towards meeting performance targets had been made.
Instead award holders were offered the opportunity to release their awards in exchange for the grant of a replacement award of equivalent value over shares in IP Group and the exercise price was set at 3.33 pence divided by the exchange ratio.
The vesting dates on the replacement awards remained the same as the original award, being 1 December 2020, 1 December 2021 and 1 December 2022.
The replacement awards are subject to performance conditions adjusted from those attaching to the original Touchstone award as follows: a the Net Asset Value NAV condition will be adjusted to reflect Touchstones portfolio being part of the enlarged group following the acquisition and b the Total Shareholder Return TSR condition will be adjusted so that TSR shall be measured by reference to the performance of IP Group shares over the performance period with the starting share price for such purpose being adjusted by dividing the existing starting share price of 290 pence by the exchange ratio detailed above.
The TTO specific targets remain the same.

The exercise period and time-based vesting provisions for the replacement awards remained the same as the original Touchstone awards but the shareholder return performance condition will be updated by reference to the exchange ratio.
Awards under the 2006 scheme were exercisable to some extent at the time of the grant of replacement awards, subject to meeting the applicable vesting conditions.

Former Fusion IP LTIP In 2014, three former employees of Fusion IP plc were each conditionally awarded 1,000,000 shares in Fusion IP plc under the Fusion IP LTIP.
As part of the arrangements for the acquisition of Fusion IP plc, the Fusion IP LTIP awards were converted into awards of IP Group shares at the same conversion price per share as when the scheme of arrangement was undertaken 0.446 IP Group plc shares for every Fusion IP plc share.
The awards were scheduled to vest on 31 December 2017 provided certain performance conditions were met which related to, inter alia, the growth in value of Fusion IP plcs net asset value Fusion NAV from the date of acquisition and the continued employment of the individual by the Group.
The options expired on 31 December 2017 as vesting criteria had not been met.

Capital Management The Groups key objective when managing capital is to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk.
The Group manages the capital structure, and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of its underlying assets.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of issued new shares or dispose of interests in more mature portfolio companies.
During 2018, the Groups strategy, which was unchanged from 2017, was to maintain healthy cash and short-term deposit balances that enable it to provide capital to all portfolio companies, as determined by the Groups investment committee, whilst having sufficient cash reserves to meet all working capital requirements in the foreseeable future.
The Group has an external debt facility with associated covenants that are described in note 18.

Alternative Performance Measures APM IP Group management believes that the alternative performance measures included in this document provide valuable information to the readers of the financial statements as they enable the reader to identify a more consistent basis for comparing the business performance between financial periods and provide more detail concerning the elements of performance which the managers of the Group are most directly able to influence or are relevant for an assessment of the Group.
They also reflect an important aspect of the way in which operating targets are defined and performance is monitored by the directors.
These measures are not defined by IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable with other companies APMs, including those in the Groups industry.
APMs should be considered in addition to, and are not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, IFRS measurements.
The directors believe that these APMs assist in providing additional useful information on the underlying trends, performance and position of the Group.
APMs are used to enhance the comparability of information between reporting periods and aid the reader in understanding the Groups performance.
Consequently, APMs are used by the directors and management for performance analysis, planning, reporting and incentive-setting purposes.
