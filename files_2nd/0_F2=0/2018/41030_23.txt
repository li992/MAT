Consolidated accounts 2017 18 Notes to the consolidated financial statements At 1 March 2018 1Authorisation of consolidated financial statements The consolidated financial statements of Whitbread PLC for the year ended 1 March 2018 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 24 April 2018.
Whitbread PLC is a public company limited by shares incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act and is registered in England and Wales.
The Companys ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The address of the registered office isgiven on page 165.
The significant activities of the Group are described in Note 4, Segment information, and in the strategic report on pages 4to 55.
2Accounting policies Basis of accounting and preparation The consolidated financial statements of Whitbread PLC and all its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted for use in the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments that are measured at fair values at the end of each reporting period and the defined benefit pension scheme, as explained inthe accounting policies below.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
Further detail is contained in the viability statement included in the strategic report on page 52.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest hundred thousand except when otherwise indicated.
The financial year represents the 52 weeks to 1 March 2018 prior financial year: 52 weeks to 2 March 2017.
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 2 March 2017, except for the adoption of the new standards and interpretations that are applicable for the year ended 1 March 2018.
The significant accounting policies adopted are set out below.
The Group has adopted the following standards, interpretations and amendments which have been assessed as having no financial impact or disclosure requirements at this time: Amendments to IAS 12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses: Amendment to IAS 7 Disclosure Initiative: and Amendments to IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities included in the Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2014-2016 Cycle.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the accounts of Whitbread PLC and all its subsidiaries, together with theGroups share of the net assets and results of joint ventures and associate incorporated using the equity method of accounting.
These are adjusted, where appropriate, to conform to Group accounting policies.
The financial statements of significant trading subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company except for Costa Coffee Shanghai Co. Ltd which has a year-end of 31 December as per Chinese legislation.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group.
Control is the power to direct the relevant activities of the subsidiary whichsignificantly affect the subsidiarys return, so as to have rights to the variable return from its activities.
Apart from the acquisition of Whitbread Group PLC by Whitbread PLC in 2000 01, which was accounted for using merger accounting, acquisitions by the Group are accounted for under the acquisition method and any goodwill arising is capitalised as an intangible asset.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from, or up to, the date that control passes respectively.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated, unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Significant accounting policies Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisition is capitalised and represents the excess of the fair value of consideration over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is reviewed forimpairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or losson disposal.
Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2017 18 107 Consolidated accounts 2017 18 Consolidated accounts Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued At 1 March 2018 2Accounting policies continued Intangible assets Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are carried initially at cost.
An intangible asset acquired as part of abusiness combination is recognised outside of goodwill if the asset is separable, or arises from contractual or other legal rights, and its fair value can be measured reliably.
Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the asset as follows: trading licences have an indefinite life: reacquired franchise rights are amortised over the life of the acquired franchise agreement: IT software and technology is amortised over periods of three to ten years: acquired customer relationships are amortised over 15 years: and operating rights agreements are amortised over the life of the contract.
The carrying values are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may not be recoverable.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost at transition to IFRS, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Gross interest costs incurred on the financing of qualifying assets arecapitalised until the time that the assets are available for use.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over theestimated useful life of the asset asfollows: freehold land is not depreciated: freehold and long leasehold buildings are depreciated to their estimated residual values over periods up to 50 years: and plant and equipment is depreciated over three to 30 years.
The residual values are reviewed annually.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable.
Any impairment in the values of property, plant and equipment is charged to the income statement.
Profits and losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment reflect the difference between net selling price and carrying amount at the date of disposal and are recognised in the income statement.
Payments made on entering into, or acquiring, leaseholds that are accounted for as operating leases are amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Impairment The Group assesses assets or groups of assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
Individual assets are grouped, for impairment assessment purposes, at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups ofassets cash generating units or CGUs.
If such indication of impairment exists, or when annual impairment testing for anasset group is required, the Group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value, using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined with reference to the CGU to which theasset belongs.
Impairment losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement within operating costs.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated tothe units and then to reduce the carrying amounts of other assets in the CGU, on a pro-rata basis.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such an indication exists, the CGUs recoverable amount is estimated.
Apreviously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimated future cash flows used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount.
That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount thatwould have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Such a reversal is recognised in the income statement.
After such a reversal, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the assets carrying amount, less any residual value, on a straight-line basis over its remaining useful life.
Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2017 18 108 Consolidated accounts 2017 18 2Accounting policies continued For the purposes of impairment testing, all centrally held assets are allocated in line with IAS 36 to CGUs based on managements view of the consumption of the asset.
Any resulting impairment is recorded against the centrally held asset.
Goodwill and intangible assets Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to groups of CGUs at the level management monitor goodwill, which is at strategic business unit level.
The Group performs an annual review of its goodwill to ensure that its carrying amount is not greater than its recoverable amount.
In the absence of a comparable recent market transaction that demonstrates that the fair value, less the costs of disposal, of goodwill and intangible assets exceeds their carrying amount, the recoverable amount is determined from value in use calculations.
An impairment is then made to reduce the carrying amount to the recoverable amount.
Property, plant and equipment For the purposes of the impairment review of property, plant and equipment, the Group considers each trading outlet to be aseparate CGU.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Consideration is also given, where appropriate, to the market value of the asset either from independent sources or, inconjunction with, an accepted industry valuation methodology.
Investments in joint ventures The Group assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying valuemay not be recoverable.
If any such indication of impairment exists, the carrying amount of the investment is compared with its recoverable amount.
Where thecarrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, the investment iswritten down to its recoverable amount.
Assets held for sale Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale only if available for immediate sale in their present condition and a sale is highly probable and expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification.
Suchassets are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value, less the cost to sell, and are not depreciated oramortised.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is calculated on the basis of first in, first out andnetrealisable value is the estimated selling price less any costs to sell.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions are discounted to present value, using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the timevalue of money and the risks specific to the liability.
The amortisation of the discount is recognised as a finance cost.
Onerous contracts Present obligations arising under onerous contracts are recognised and measured as provisions.
An onerous contract is considered to exist where the Group has a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under thecontract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it.
Warranties Provisions for the expected costs of warranty obligations arising on the acquisition or disposal of a business are recognisedat the date of the relevant transaction, at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle theGroups obligation.
Restructuring costs A restructuring provision is recognised when the Group has developed a detailed formal plan and has raised a valid expectation, in those affected, that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main features to those affected by it.
The measurement of a restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring which are those amounts that are both necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not associated with the ongoing activities of the entity.
Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2017 18 109 Consolidated accounts 2017 18 Consolidated accounts Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued At 1 March 2018 2Accounting policies continued Non-underlying items and use of underlying performance measures We use a range of measures to monitor the financial performance of the Group.
These measures include both statutory measures in accordance with IFRS and alternative performance measures APMs which are consistent with the way that thebusiness performance is measured internally.
The term underlying profit is not defined under IFRS and may not be comparable with similarly titled profit measures reported by other companies.
It is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, statutory measurements of profit.
Underlying measures of profitability are non-IFRS because they exclude amounts that are included in, or include amounts thatare excluded from, the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS.
We report underlying measures because we believe they provide both management and investors with useful additional information about the financial performance of the Groups businesses.
Underlying measures of profitability represent the equivalent IFRS measures adjusted for specific items that we consider hinder comparison of the financial performance of the Groups businesses either from one period to another or with other similar businesses.
The face of the income statement presents underlying profit before tax and reconciles this to profit before tax.
Underlyingearnings per share is calculated using underlying profit after tax attributable to parent shareholders.
The adjustments made to reported profit in the consolidated income statement, in order to derive our underlying results, may include: profit or loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment, property provisions and onerous leases.
On occasion wemaydispose of properties, either as part of a sale and leaseback transaction or because the property is no longer requiredin our ongoing business.
In addition, the Group may recognise liabilities in respect of lease obligations on properties which have been previously disposed of but where the lease obligations have reverted to the Group under privity.
Profits or losseson these items may be significant and are not reflective of the Groups ongoing trading results: profit or loss on the sale of a business or investment.
These disposals are not part of the Groups ongoing trading businessand are therefore excluded: restructuring costs, resulting from a strategic review of the Groups businesses or operations, theinclusion of which would distort the year on year comparability of the Groups trading results: impairment of assets as the result of restructuring or closure of a business and impairment of sites which are underperforming or are to be closed, the inclusion of which would distort the year on year comparability of the Groups trading results: acquisition costs incurred as part of a business combination or other strategic asset acquisitions: amortisation of intangible assets recognised as part of a business combination or other transaction outside of the ordinarycourse of business: finance charge credit for defined benefit pension scheme.
These costs are non-cash and do not relate to the Groups ongoing activities as the scheme is closed to future accrual: finance costs resulting from the unwinding of discounts on provisions created in respect of non-underlying items: and tax settlements in respect of prior years including the related interest and the impact of changes in the statutory tax rate, the inclusion of which would distort year on year comparability, as well as the tax impact of the non-underlying items identified above.
Foreign currency translation Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange quoted atthe balance sheet date.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions.
Day-to-day transactions in a foreign currency are recorded in the functional currency at an average rate for the month in which those transactions take place, which is used as a reasonable approximation to the actual transaction rate.
Translation differences on monetary items are taken to the income statement.
The differences that arise from translating the results of foreign entities at average rates of exchange, and their assets and liabilities at closing rates, are also dealt with in a separate component of equity.
On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in the income statement.
All other currency gains and losses are dealt with in theincome statement.
A number of subsidiaries within the Group have a non-sterling functional currency.
The financial performance and end position of these entities are translated into sterling in the consolidated financial statements.
Balance sheet items are translated at the rate applicable at the balance sheet date.
Transactions reported in the income statement are translated using an average rate for the month in which they occur.
Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2017 18 110 Consolidated accounts 2017 18 2Accounting policies continued Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of the goods or services provided have transferred to the buyer, the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with thetransaction will flow to the Group.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration receivable from the sale of goods and services to third parties after deducting discounts, allowances for customer loyalty and other promotional activities.
Revenue includes duties whichthe Group pays as principal, but excludes amounts collected on behalf of other parties, such as value added tax.
Allsales between Group businesses are eliminated on consolidation.
Revenue of the Group comprises the following streams: Sale of goods Revenue from the sale of food, beverages and merchandise is recognised at the point of sale, with the exception of wholesale transactions which are recognised on delivery.
The Group operates some customer loyalty programmes.
Where award credits are granted as part of a sale transaction, aportion of revenue equal to the fair value of the award points earned is deferred until redemption.
The fair value of points awarded is determined with reference to the discount received upon redemption and the level of redemption: Rendering of services Revenue from room sales and other guest services is recognised when rooms are occupied and as services are provided: and Franchise fees Revenue from fees received in connection with the franchise of the Groups brand names is recognised when earned.
Leases Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
Rental payments in respect of operating leases are charged against operating profit on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Lease incentives are recognised as a reduction of rental costs over the lease term.
Finance revenue Interest income is recognised as the interest accrues, using the effective interest method.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred, except for gross interest costs incurred on the financing of major projects, which are capitalised until the time that the projects are available for use.
Retirement benefits In respect of the defined benefit pension scheme, the obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation, reduced by the fair value of the scheme assets.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method.
Re-measurements are recognised in full in the period inwhich they occur in the statement of comprehensive income and are not reclassified to the income statement in subsequent periods.
For defined benefit plans, the employers portion of the past and current service cost is charged to operating profit, withnetinterest costs reported within finance costs.
In addition, all administration costs, other than those relating to the management of plan assets or taxes payable by the plan itself, are charged as incurred to operating costs in the income statement.
Net interest is calculated by applying the opening discount rate to the opening net defined benefit obligation taking into account the expected contributions and benefits paid.
Curtailments and settlements relating to the Groups defined benefit plan are recognised in the period in which the curtailment or settlement occurs.
Payments to defined contribution pension schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Share-based payment transactions Equity-settled transactions Certain employees and directors of the Group receive equity-settled remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares.
The cost of these equitysettled transactions is measured by reference to the fair value, determined using a stochastic model, at the date at whichthey aregranted.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over theperiod in which the performance conditions or non-vesting conditions are fulfilled, ending on the relevant vesting date.
Except for awards subject to market-related conditions for vesting, the cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions, at each reporting date until the vesting date, reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired, andisadjusted to reflect the directors best available estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
Theincome statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as atthe beginning and end of that period.
If options are subject to market-related conditions, awards are not cumulatively adjusted for the likelihood of these targets being met.
Instead, these conditions are included in the fair value of the awards.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
Where an equity-settled award is forfeited, the related expense recognised to date is reversed.
Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2017 18 111 Consolidated accounts 2017 18 Consolidated accounts Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued At 1 March 2018 2Accounting policies continued Cash-settled transactions The cost is fair-valued at grant date and expensed over the period until the vesting date, with recognition of a corresponding liability.
The liability is re-measured to fair value at each reporting date, up to and including the settlement date, with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement for the period.
Tax The income tax charge represents both the income tax payable, based on profit for the year, and deferred income tax.
Deferred income tax is recognised in full, using the liability method, in respect of temporary differences between the tax base of the Groups assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts that have originated but have not been reversed by the balance sheet date.
No deferred tax is recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill, or the initial recognition of an asset or liability, in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred income tax is recognised in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in associates and interests in joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeablefuture.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all, or part of, the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income tax is charged or credited to other comprehensive income if it relates to items that are charged or credited to other comprehensive income.
Similarly, income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are charged orcredited directly to equity.
Otherwise, income tax is recognised in the income statement.
Treasury shares Own equity instruments which are held by the Group treasury shares are deducted from equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Groups own equity instruments.
Investments in joint ventures and associates Investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor.
The Group has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements and determined them tobe joint ventures.
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.
Investments in joint ventures and associates are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration given, including acquisition charges associated with the investment.
After initial recognition, investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method.
Recognition and derecognition of financial assets and liabilities The recognition of financial assets and liabilities occurs when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The derecognition of financial assets takes place when the Group no longer has the right to cash flows, the risks and rewards of ownership, or control of the asset.
The derecognition of financial liabilities occurs when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Financial assets Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or available-for-sale.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money issignificant.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the loans and receivables are derecognised orimpaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less any uncollectable amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written off when identified.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank, cash in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist ofcash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2017 18 112 Consolidated accounts 2017 18 2Accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments The Group enters into derivative transactions with a view to managing interest and currency risks associated with underlying business activities and the financing of those activities.
Derivative financial instruments used by the Group are stated at fair value on initial recognition and at subsequent balance sheet dates.
The fair value of derivative instruments is calculated by discounting all future cash flows by the applicable market yield curves at the balance sheet date.
Cash flow hedges mitigate exposure to variability in cash flows that are either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecast transaction.
Fair value hedges mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment and include foreign currency swaps.
Hedge accounting is only used where, at the inception of the hedge, there is formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship, it meets the Groups risk management objective strategy for undertaking the hedge and it is expected to be highly effective.
The portion of any gains or losses on cash flow hedges which meet the conditions for hedge accounting and are determined tobe effective, is recognised directly in the statement of comprehensive income.
The gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognised immediately in the income statement.
The change in fair value of derivatives designated as part of a fair value hedge, is recognised in the income statement in finance costs.
The change in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability, that is attributable to the hedged risk, is also recognised in the income statement within finance costs.
When a firm commitment that is hedged becomes an asset or a liability recognised on the balance sheet, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability.
For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period in whichthe transaction that results from a firm commitment that is hedged affects the income statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, for cash flow hedges, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement.
When a fairvalue hedge item is derecognised, the unamortised fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, net of any directly associated issue costs.
Borrowings are subsequently recorded at amortised cost, with any difference between the amount initially recorded and theredemption value recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
Key accounting judgements and estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported as assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts reported as revenues and expenses during the year.
Although these amounts are based on managements best estimates, events or actions may mean that actual results ultimately differ from those estimates, and these differences may be material.
These judgements and estimates and the underlying assumptions are reviewed regularly.
Key accounting judgements The following are the key judgements, apart from those involving estimations dealt with separately below that management have made in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies and which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Non-underlying items During the year certain items are identified and separately disclosed as non-underlying.
Judgement is applied as to whether the item meets the necessary criteria as per the accounting policy disclosed earlier in this note.
This assessment covers the nature of the item, cause of occurrence and the scale of impact of that item on reported performance.
Reversals of previous exceptional items are assessed based on the same criteria.
Note 6 provides information on all of the items disclosed as non-underlying in the current year financial statements.
Intangible asset capitalisation IT software and technology assets The amount capitalised includes the total cost of any external products or services as well as any internal costs directly attributable to the development of the assets.
Management judgement is involved in determining whether projects meet the criteria for capitalisation, which has become more critical as the Groups investment in system improvement and development projects has increased.
Note 12 provides details of the value of IT software and technology assets capitalised.
Key areas of estimation uncertainty The following are the key areas of estimation uncertainty that may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2017 18 113 Consolidated accounts 2017 18 Consolidated accounts Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued At 1 March 2018 2Accounting policies continued Defined benefit pension Defined benefit pension plans are accounted for in accordance with actuarial advice using the projected unit credit method.
Note 29 describes the assumptions used together with an analysis of the sensitivity to changes in key assumptions.
Residual values and asset lives The residual value is the net realisable value of an asset at the end of its useful economic life.
The Group has taken an assessment of the residual values that are appropriate for the business and reviews this assessment annually.
Asset lives are based upon managements estimation at the point of capitalisation.
Periodically these are reviewed to ensure that the estimated lives of the assets remain appropriate and if not the assets are re-lifed prospectively.
Significant changes to the estimate of residual values or asset lives would impact the depreciation charge in future periods.
Notes 12 and 13 provide details on the depreciation and amortisation booked.
Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB not effective for the current year and not early adopted by the Group The following standards and interpretations, which have been issued by the IASB and are relevant for the Group, subject to EU ratification, become effective after the current year-end and have not been early adopted by the Group: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Whitbread will adopt IFRS 9 on 2 March 2018 and anticipates applying the standard prospectively with no retrospective adjustments required.
The new standard is a replacement of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
IFRS 9 covers the classication, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, together with a new hedge accounting model and a new expected credit loss model for calculating impairment of financial assets.
The Group has completed an impact assessment and determined that the adoption of IFRS 9 will not have a material impact on its consolidated result and financial position.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers Whitbread will adopt IFRS 15 on 2 March 2018 and anticipates applying the cumulative catch-up modified transition method.
The new standard provides a single, five-step revenue recognition model, applicable to all sales contracts, which is based upon the principle that revenue is recognised when control of goods or services is transferred to the customer.
It replaces all existing revenue recognition guidance under current IFRS.
The Group has completed an impact assessment and determined that the adoption of IFRS 15 will not have a material impact on its consolidated result and financial position, but will result in additional disclosures regarding the disaggregation of revenue.
IFRS 16 Leases Whitbread will adopt IFRS 16 on 1 March 2019 and anticipates applying the cumulative catch-up modified transition method.
The new standard provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset has a low value.
It replaces the existing leasing Standard, IAS 17 Leases, and related Interpretations.
The Group has determined that the application of IFRS 16 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial result and financial position.
This includes recognition of interest and amortisation expense in place of fixed rental expense in the income statement and the recognition of right of use assets and lease liabilities for its operating lease portfolio on the balance sheet.
There is no net cash flow impact on application of IFRS 16.
The Group is currently undertaking a detailed assessment to determine the full impact of IFRS 16 on its consolidated result and financial position.
Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2017 18 114 Consolidated accounts 2017 18 2Accounting policies continued Whilst the following standards, interpretations and amendments are relevant to the Group, they have been assessed 1 as having minimal or no financial impact or additional disclosure requirements at this time : IFRS Standards and Interpretations IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts: IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts: IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Translations and Advance Consideration: and IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments: Amendments Amendments to IAS 28: Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures: Amendments to IAS 40: Transfers of Investment Property: Amendments to IFRS 2: Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions: Amendments to IFRS 9: Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation: Amendments to IAS 19: Plan amendment, curtailment or settlement: Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2014-2016 Cycle: and Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2015-2017 Cycle.
1 As the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, the adoption date is as per the EU, not the IASB.
3Revenue An analysis of the Groups revenue is as follows: 2017 18 2017 18 m m Sale of goods 1,813.2 1,717.2 Rendering of services 1,439.5 1,349.1 Franchise fees 42.4 39.7 Revenue 3,295.1 3,106.0 4Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into two strategic business units: Premier Inn previously Premier Inn & Restaurants andCosta, based upon their different products and services: Premier Inn provides services in relation to accommodation and food: and Costa generates income from the operation of its branded, owned and franchised coffee outlets.
The UK and International Premier Inn segments have been aggregated on the grounds that the Internationalsegment is immaterial.
Management monitors the operating results of its strategic business units separately for the purpose of making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance.
Segment performance is measured based on underlying operating profit.

These measures include both statutory measures in accordance with IFRS and APMs which are consistent with the way that the business performance is measured internally.
Underlying measures of profitability represent the equivalent IFRS measures adjusted for specific items that we consider hinder the comparison of the financial performance of the Groups businesses either from one period to another or with other similar businesses.

This was offset by impairment losses of hotel sites transferred to assets held for sale of 14.1m, impairment losses on trading sites of 7.9m and provision for other property costs of 15.2m.
The balance relates to changes in onerous contract provisions in the UK of 3.7m, Poland of 2.7m and release of other provisions of 7.0m.
2 On 13 July 2016, the Group announced its intention to exit hotel operations in South East Asia.

During the current year the Group disposed of its businesses in Thailand, India and Indonesia, acheiving net sales proceeds in excess of those assumed in the initial impairment calculation resulting in a net credit of 6.7m in the year.
3 During the year Costa has continued the strategic review of its international operations.
Further to the decisions taken last year to exit its French equity business and to restructure its Chinese operations, decisions have been made to exit its Singapore equity business and its Express business in Canada.

In France impairment losses of 1.5m, store closure costs of 0.8m and restructuring costs of 6.8m were recognised in the prior year.
With the exit from France nearing completion, the exit costs have been reviewed resulting in a release of 1.5m in the current year.
Continuing our reorganisation in China, we have recognised impairment losses of 3.6m 2016 17: 3.2m, store closure costs of 0.8m 2016 17: 1.6m and onerous lease provisions of 1.0m 2016 17: 0.6m.
The share attributable to the parent shareholders is 5.1m 2016 17: 2.7m.
4 During the prior year, the Group undertook significant operational reorganisation of support centre operations.
This restructuring resulted in costs of 12.4m, including staff redundancy and consultation costs, asset impairments of 2.9m as well as the recognition of a restructuring provision of 6.3m covering staff redundancy and consultation costs.
The charge relating to this in the year was 1.1m.

The Group has incurred overseas tax losses which, subject to any local restrictions, can be carried forward and offset against future taxable profits in the companies in which they arose.
The Group carries out an annual assessment of the recoverability ofthese losses and does not think it is appropriate at this stage to recognise any deferred tax asset.
If the Group were to recognise these deferred tax assets in their entirety, profits would increase by 17.6m 2017: 16.5m, of which, the share attributable to the parent shareholders is 17.6m 2017: 13.9m.
At 1 March 2018, there was no recognised deferred tax liability 2017: nil for taxes that would be payable on any unremitted earnings, as all such amounts are permanently reinvested or, where they are not, there are no corporation tax consequences of such companies paying dividends to parent companies.
Tax relief on total interest capitalised amounts to 0.9m 2017: 1.8m.
Factors affecting the tax charge for future years The Finance Act 2016 reduced the main rate of UK corporation tax to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020.
The effect of the new rate was included in the financial statements in 2016 17.
The rate change will also impact the amount of the future cash tax payments to be made by the Group.
Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2017 18 122 Consolidated accounts 2017 18 10Earnings per share The basic earnings per share EPS figures are calculated by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders, therefore before non-controlling interests, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year after deducting treasury shares and shares held by an independently managed employee share ownership trust ESOT.
The diluted earnings per share figures allow for the dilutive effect of the conversion into ordinary shares of the weighted average number of options outstanding during the year.
Where the average share price for the year is lower than the option price, the options become anti-dilutive and are excluded from the calculation.
The number of such options was nil 2017: nil.

Whereindicators of impairment are identified an impairment assessment is undertaken.
In assessing whether an asset has been impaired, the carrying amount of the CGU is compared to its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value, less costs of disposal and its value in use.
In the absence of any information about the fair value of a CGU, the recoverable amount is deemed to be its value in use.
The Group estimates value in use using a discounted cash flow model, which applies a pre-tax discount rate of 7.0% in the UK 2016 17: 7.0%, 7.2% in China 2016 17: 7.2% and 7.5% inPoland 2016 17: 7.5%.
The future cash flows are based on assumptions from the business plans and cover a five-year period.
These business plans and forecasts include managements most recent view of medium-term trading prospects.
Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using long-term growth rates for the relevant country, ranging from 2.0% to3.5% with the UK, the most significant country, being 2.0% 2016 17: 2.0%.
The events and circumstances that led to the impairment charge of 29.1m are set out below: Premier Inn During the year, seven hotel sites were transferred to assets held for sale resulting in an impairment of 14.1m.
The remaining 0.6m impairment arose on sites which are to be closed or are underperforming.
Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2017 18 127 Consolidated accounts 2017 18 Consolidated accounts Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued At 1 March 2018 14Impairment continued Costa The Costa international restructuring has resulted in impairment losses of 0.4m in Canada and 3.6m in China.
The remaining impairment charge includes 7.6m in the UK and 2.4m in Poland, where stores are to be closed or are underperforming.
Impairment reversals Following an improvement in trading performance and an increase in amounts of estimated future cash flows of previously impaired sites, reversals of 3.1m have been recognised, 2.7m in Premier Inn and 0.4m in Costa.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions The level of impairment is predominantly dependent upon judgements used in arriving at future growth rates and the discount rates applied to cash flow projections.
The impact on the impairment charge of applying a reasonably possible change in assumptions to the growth rates used in the five-year business plans and in the pre-tax discount rates would be an incremental impairment charge of: Premier Inn Costa Total Incremental impairment charge m m m Impairment if business plan growth rates were reduced by 1% pt 0.5 0.5 Impairment if discount rates were increased by 1% pt 0.9 0.9 Goodwill Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to groups of CGUs at strategic business unit level, being the level at which management monitor goodwill.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.
In the absence of a recent market transaction, the recoverable amount is determined from value in use calculations.
Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using a 2.0% growth rate 2016 17: 2.0%.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 7.0% 2016 17: 7.0%.
No impairment was required for goodwill in either Premier Inn or Costa CGUs 2016 17: 3.0m in Premier Inn as a result of the decision to exit hotel operations in India and South East Asia.

On 13 July 2016, the Group announced its intention to exit hotel operations in South East Asia.
This resulted in the recognition ofa restructuring provision of 15.1m for costs of exiting management agreements and closure of regional offices.
The Group has also recognised restructuring provisions of 4.0m resulting from decisions to exit the Costa equity market in Singapore and the Costa Express business in Canada 2016 17: 12.9m resulting from decisions to exit the Costa equity market in France and the reorganisation of support centre operations.
The restructuring provisions are expected to be used within one year.
Onerous contracts Onerous contract provisions relate primarily to property reversions.
Provision is made for rent and other property related costs for the period that a sublet or assignment of the lease is not possible.
Where the property is deemed likely to be assigned, provision is made for the best estimate of the reverse lease premium payable on the assignment.
Where the property is deemed likely to be sublet, the rental income and the timing of the cash flows are estimated by bothinternal and external property specialists and a provision is maintained for the estimated cost incurred by the Group.
Onerous lease provisions are discounted using a discount rate of 3.74% 2017: 3.74% based on an approximation for the timevalue of money.
The amount and timing of the cash outflows are subject to variation.
The Group utilises the skills and expertise of both internal and external property experts to determine the provision held.
Provisions are expected to be utilised over a period ofup to 18 years.
Other Other provisions relate to property related costs and warranties given on the disposal of businesses.
During the year the Group released the provision in relation to the warranty on disposal of businesses and provided for one-off property related costs.
These are expected to be used within one to two years.
Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2017 18 134 Consolidated accounts 2017 18 22Financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans, private placement loans, senior unsecured bonds, cash, short-term deposits, trade receivables and trade payables.
The Groups financial instrument policies can be found in the accounting policies in Note 2.
The Board agrees policies for managing the financial risks summarised below: Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Groups long-term debt obligations.
Interest rate swaps are used where necessary to maintain a mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings to manage this risk, in line with the Group treasury policy.
Although the private placement loan notes are US dollar denominated, cross-currency swaps mean that the interest rate risk is effectively sterling only.
At the year-end, 898.9m 97.3% of Group debt was fixed for an average of 6.92 years at an average interest rate of 3.5% 2017: 761.2m 90.3% for 6.29 years at 4.0%.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the Group has undertaken sensitivity analysis on its financial instruments which are affected by changes in interest rates.
This analysis has been prepared on the basis of a constant amount of net debt, a constant ratio offixed to floating interest rates, and on the basis of the hedging instruments in place at 1 March 2018 and 2 March 2017 respectively.
Consequently, the analysis relates to the situation at those dates and is not representative of the years then ended.
The following assumptions were made: balance sheet sensitivity to interest rates applies only to derivative financial instruments, as the carrying value of debt anddeposits does not change as interest rates move: gains or losses are recognised in equity or the income statement in line with the accounting policies set out in Note 2: and cash flow hedges were effective.
Based on the Groups net debt position at the year-end, a 1% pt change in interest rates would affect the Groups profit beforetax by approximately 0.2m 2016 17: 0.8m, and equity by approximately 4.1m 2017: 7.3m.
Liquidity risk In its funding strategy, the Groups objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts and bank loans.
This strategy includes monitoring the maturity of financial liabilities to avoidthe risk of a shortage of funds.
Excess cash used in managing liquidity is placed on interest-bearing deposit where maturity is fixed at no more than threemonths.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of short-term borrowing on the money markets.
The tables below summarise the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 1 March 2018 and 2 March 2017 basedon contractual undiscounted payments, including interest: On Less than 3 to 12 1 to 5 More than demand 3 months months years 5 years Total 1 March 2018 m m m m m m Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 12.1 126.8 246.8 723.5 1,109.2 Derivative financial instruments 2.2 7.0 9.2 Trade and other payables 226.5 26.5 253.0 Accrued financial liabilities 299.0 299.0 Provisions in respect of financial liabilities 4.1 18.3 9.5 3.2 35.1 242.7 446.3 289.8 726.7 1,705.5 On Less than 3 to 12 1 to 5 More than demand 3 months months years 5 years Total 2 March 2017 m m m m m m Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 109.6 7.6 66.2 382.0 513.2 1,078.6 Derivative financial instruments 2.3 9.2 11.5 Trade and other payables 230.2 21.9 252.1 Accrued financial liabilities 233.1 233.1 Provisions in respect of financial liabilities 7.8 28.3 10.3 5.2 51.6 109.6 245.6 329.9 423.4 518.4 1,626.9 Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2017 18 135 Consolidated accounts 2017 18 Consolidated accounts Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued At 1 March 2018 22Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Credit risk There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
The Group is exposed to a small amount of credit risk that is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables.
This is minimised by dealing with counterparties with good credit ratings.
The amounts included in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful debts, which have been estimated by management based on prior experience and any known factors at the balance sheet date which may indicate that a provision is required.
The Groups maximum exposure on its trade and other receivables is the carrying amount as disclosed in Note 17.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, the Groups exposure arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying value of theseinstruments.
The Group seeks to minimise the risk of default in relation to cash and cash equivalents by spreading investments across a number of counterparties.
In the event that any of the Groups banks get into financial difficulty, the Group is exposed to the risk of withdrawal of currently undrawn committed facilities.
This risk is mitigated by the Group having a range of counterparties to its facilities.
Foreign currency risk Foreign exchange exposure is currently not significant to the Group.
Although the Group has US dollar denominated loan notes, these have been swapped into sterling thereby eliminating foreign currency risk.
Sensitivity analysis has therefore notbeen carried out.
The Group monitors the growth and risks associated with its overseas operations and will undertake hedging activities asand when they are required.
Capital management The Groups primary objective in regard to capital management is to ensure that it continues to operate as a going concern andhas sufficient funds at its disposal to grow the business for the benefit of shareholders.
The Group seeks to maintain a ratio of debt to equity that balances risks and returns and also complies with lending covenants.
See pages 44 to 49 of this report for the policies and objectives of the Board regarding capital management, analysis of the Groups credit facilities andfinancing plans for the coming years.
The Group aims to maintain sufficient funds for working capital and future investment in order to meet growth targets.
Themanagement of equity through share buy-backs and new issues is considered as part of the overall leverage framework balanced against the funding requirements of future growth.
In addition, the Group may carry out a number of sale and leaseback transactions to provide further funding for growth.
The Groups financing is subject to financial covenants.
These covenants relate to measurement of EBITDA against consolidated net finance charges interest cover and total net debt leverage ratio, on a not-adjusted-for pension and property lease basis.
The Group has complied with all of these covenants.
The above matters are considered at regular intervals and form part of the business planning and budgeting processes.
Inaddition, the Board regularly reviews the Groups dividend policy and funding strategy.
23Financial instruments Fair values As in the prior year, the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities disclosed in Notes 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 24 are considered to be reasonable approximations of their fair values.
The fair value of derivative instruments is calculated by discounting all future cash flows by the market yield curve at the balance sheet date using level 2 techniques.
IFRS 13 requires that the classification of financial instruments at fair value be determined by reference to the source ofinputs used to derive the fair value.
The classification uses the following three-level hierarchy: Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 Other techniques for which all inputs, which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value, are observable, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3 Techniques which use inputs, which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value, that are not based on observable market data.

Derivative financial instruments Hedges Cash flow hedges At 1 March 2018, the Group has interest rate swaps in place to swap a notional amount of 50.0m 2017: 50.0m whereby itreceives a variable interest rate based on LIBOR on the notional amount and pays fixed rates of between 5.145% and 5.190% 2017: 5.145% and 5.190%.
The swaps are being used to hedge the exposure tochanges in future cash flows from variable rate debt.
The Group also has cross-currency swaps in place whereby it receives a fixed interest rate of between 3.92% and 4.86% 2017: 3.92% and 4.86% on a notional amount of US$210.0m 2017:US$250.0m and pays an average of 4.72% on a notional sterling balance of 131.4m 2017: 4.72% on 158.2m.
The cash flow hedges were assessed to be highly effective at 1 March 2018 and a net unrealised gain of 2.4m 2016 17: net unrealised loss of 0.2m has been recorded in other comprehensive income.
The ineffectiveness recorded within finance costs in the income statement for 2017 18 was nil 2016 17: nil.
Fair value hedges At 1 March 2018, the Group has cross-currency swaps in place whereby it receives a fixed interest rate of 5.23% 2017: 5.23% ona notional amount of US$75.0m 2017: US$75.0m and pays a spread of between 1.715% and 1.755% 2017: 1.715% and 1.755% over 6m GBP LIBOR on a notional sterling balance of 50.1m 2017: 50.1m.
The fair value hedges were also assessed to be highly effective at 1 March 2018.
A decrease in the fair value of the interest rate swap of 8.8m 2017: an increase of 6.5m offset by a gain in the fair value of the hedged items of 8.3m 2017: loss of6.6m led to a debit of 0.5m recorded within finance costs in the income statement 2017: a debit of 0.1m in finance costs in the income statement.

27Commitments and contingencies Operating lease commitments The Group leases various buildings which are used within the Premier Inn and Costa businesses.
The leases arenoncancellable operating leases with varying terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights.
The Group also leases various plant and equipment under non-cancellable operating lease agreements.
Contingent rents are the portion of the lease payment that is not fixed in amount but based upon the future amount of a factor that changes other than with the passage of time e. g. percentage of future sales, amount of future use, future price indices or future market rates of interest.
Future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases, on an undiscounted basis, are as follows: 2018 2017 m m Due within one year 269.2 247.0 Due after one year but not more than five years 953.4 850.8 Due after five years but not more than ten years 856.4 742.0 Due after ten years 1,500.6 1,298.9 3,579.6 3,138.7 Future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases disclosed above includes 10.4m in relation toprivity contracts 2016 17: 13.7m.
Future lease costs in respect of these privity contracts are included within the onerouscontracts provision Note 21.
Onerous contracts are under constant review and every effort is taken to reduce thisobligation.
The weighted average lease life of future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases is 13.4 years 2017:11.7 years.
Group companies have sublet space in certain properties.
The future minimum sublease payments expected to be received under non-cancellable sublease agreements as at 1 March 2018 are 27.7m 2017: 25.8m of which 12.1m 2017: 14.5m relates to privity contracts.
Contingent liabilities There are no contingent liabilities to be disclosed in the year ended 1 March 2018 2017: nil.

Vesting of all shares under the scheme will depend on continued employment and meeting earnings per share EPS and return on capital employed ROCE performance targets over a three-year period the vesting period.
Details of the performance targets for the LTIP awards can be seen inthe remuneration report on pages 72 to 87.
The awards are settled in equity once exercised.
Movements in the number of share awards are as follows: 2018 2017 Awards Awards Outstanding at the beginning of the year 623,643 685,426 Granted during the year 245,343 284,129 Exercised during the year 13,332 257,797 Expired during the year 68,548 88,115 Outstanding at the end of the year 787,106 623,643 Exercisable at the end of the year 123,487 26,855 Deferred equity awards Awards are made under the Whitbread Leadership Group Incentive Scheme implemented during 2004 05.
The awards are not subject to performance conditions and will vest in full on the release date subject to continued employment at that date.
If the director or senior executive of the Group ceases to be an employee of Whitbread prior to the release date, normally three years after the award, by reason of redundancy, retirement, death, injury, ill health, disability or some other reason considered to be appropriate by the Remuneration Committee, the awards will be released in full.
If employment ceases for any other reason, the proportion of awards which vest depends upon the year in which the award was made and the date that employment ceased.
If employment ceases in the first year after an award is made none of the awards vest, between thefirst and second anniversary, 25% vests and between the second and third anniversary, 50% vests.

The weighted average contractual life of the share options outstanding as at 1 March 2018 is between two and three years.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for options exercised during the year was 38.03 2017: 39.09.
The fair value of share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a stochastic model, taking into account theterms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
Expected volatility reflects the assumption that historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily bethe actual outcome.
The risk-free rate is the rate of interest obtainable from government securities over the expected life of the equity incentive.
The expected dividend yield is calculated on the basis of publicly available information at the time of the grant date which, inmost cases, is the historic dividend yield.
No other features relating to the granting of options were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.
Employee share ownership trust ESOT The Company funds an ESOT to enable it to acquire and hold shares for the LTIP.
All dividends on the shares in the ESOT are waived by the Trustee.

Contributions by both employees and Group companies are held in externally invested, trustee-administered funds.
The Group contributes a specified percentage of earnings for members of the above defined contribution scheme, and thereafter has no further obligations in relation to the scheme.
The total cost charged to income in relation to the defined contribution scheme in the year was 9.1m 2016 17: 8.6m.
At the year-end, 32,209 employees 2017: 30,344 were active members of the scheme, which also had 19,827 deferred members 2017: 11,772.
Defined benefit scheme The defined benefit final salary section of the principal Group pension scheme, the Whitbread Group Pension Fund, was closed to new members on 31 December 2001 and to future accrual on 31 December 2009.
The Whitbread Group Pension Fund is set up under UK trust law, registered with Her Majestys Revenue and Customs and regulated by the Pensions Regulator.
The Whitbread Group Pension Fund is governed by a corporate trustee which operates the scheme in accordance with the requirements of UK pensions legislation.
At the year-end the scheme had no active members 2017: nil, 21,328 deferred pensioners 2017: 21,942 and 16,433 pensions in payment 2017: 16,581.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets.
The IAS 19 pension cost relating to the defined benefit section of the Whitbread Group Pension Fund is assessed in accordance with actuarial advice from, and calculations provided by, Lane Clark & Peacock, using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
As the scheme is closed to future accrual, there is no future service cost.
Under the governing documentation of the Whitbread Group Pension Fund, any future surplus in the Fund would be returnable to Whitbread PLC by a reduction in future contributions.
As such, there are no adjustments required in respect of IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit plan obligation at the end of the reporting period is 18.0 years 2017: 18.0 years Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2017 18 142 Consolidated accounts 2017 18 29Retirement benefits continued Funding Expected contributions to be made in the next reporting period total 103.3m 2017: 92.6m.
In 2017 18, contributions were 98.3m with 88.2m from the employer, 9.4m from Moorgate Scottish Limited Partnership SLP and 0.7m of benefits settled by the Group in relation to an unfunded scheme 2016 17: 88.1m, with 78.2m from the employer, 9.1m from Moorgate SLP and 0.8m of benefits settled by the Group in relation to an unfunded scheme.
In addition, Whitbread paid 2.5m 2016 17: 2.2m of investment manager expenses.
A scheme specific actuarial valuation for the purpose of determining the level of cash contributions to be paid into the Whitbread Group Pension Fund was undertaken as at 31 March 2017 by Willis Towers Watson using the projected unit credit method.
The valuation showed a deficit of assets relative to technical provisions of 450.0m 31 March 2014: deficit of 564.0m.
A deficit recovery plan and some protection whilst the scheme remains in deficit have been agreed with the Trustee.
For the period of the deficit, the Group has agreed to give undertakings to the Trustee similar to some of the covenants provided in respect of its banking agreements, up to the value of any outstanding recovery plan payments or the remaining deficit, if lower.
Until the next valuation, the Trustee has also been given a promise of accelerated payments at a rate aligned with increases in ordinary dividends.
If ordinary dividends increase by more than 5% a year, contributions will be accelerated at a rate in line with dividend growth minus 5%.
In addition to the scheduled deficit contribution payments described above, the Pension Scheme will receive a share of the income, profits and a variable capital payment from its investment in Moorgate SLP, which was established by the Group in the year ended 4 March 2010 the share in profits is accounted for by the Group as contributions when paid.
The partnership interests in Moorgate SLP are held by the Group, the general partner and by the Pension Scheme.
Moorgate SLP holds an investment in a further partnership, Farringdon Scottish Partnership SP, which was also established by the Group during 2009 10.
Property assets with a market value of 221.0m have been transferred from other Group companies to Farringdon SP and leased back to Whitbread Group PLC and Premier Inn Hotels Limited.
The Group retains control over these properties, including the flexibility to substitute alternative properties.
However, the Trustee has first charge over the property portfolio and certain other assets with an aggregate value of 228.0m.
The Group retains control over both partnerships and, as such, they are fully consolidated in these consolidated financial statements.
The Pension Scheme is a partner in Moorgate SLP and, as such, is entitled to an annual share of the profits of the partnership over the next eight years.
At the end of this period, the partnership capital allocated to the Pension Scheme partner will, depending on the funding position of the Pension Scheme at that time, be transferred in cash to the Pension Scheme up to a value of 150.0m 2017: 150.0m.
Under IAS 19, the investment held by the Pension Scheme in Moorgate SLP, a consolidated entity, does not represent a plan asset for the purposes of the consolidated financial statements.
Accordingly, the pension deficit position in these consolidated financial statements does not reflect the 190.2m 2017: 190.2m investment in Moorgate SLP held by the Pension Scheme.
During the year ended 28 February 2013, the Group entered into a charge in favour of Whitbread Pension Trustees Limited over properties with a market value totalling 180.0m at that date.
The charge was to secure the obligations of the Group to make payments to the Pension Fund as part of the recovery plan to reduce the deficit.
This, together with the properties secured as a consequence of the arrangement surrounding the partnerships, secures properties totalling 408.0m in favour of the Pension Scheme.
Risks Through its defined benefit scheme, the Group is exposed to a number of risks in relation to the IAS 19 deficit, the most significant of which are detailed below: Principal impact on assets Risk Description and obligation reconciliations Market volatility The defined benefit obligation is linked to AA-rated corporate bonds Return on plan assets whilst scheme assets are invested in equities, gilts, bonds, property and cash.
This exposes the Group to risks including those relating to interest rates, equity markets, property markets and foreign exchange.
Changing market conditions, in conjunction with discount rate fluctuations, will lead to volatility in the Groups net pension liability on the balance sheet, pension expense in the income statement and re-measurement of movements in other comprehensive income.
Inflationary risk Due to the link between the scheme obligation and inflation, an Actuarial movements in increased rate of inflation will lead to higher scheme liabilities.
financial assumptions Accounting The defined benefit obligation is calculated by projecting the Discount rate: interest income on assumptions future cash flows of the scheme for many years into the future.
scheme assets and cost on liabilities Consequently, the assumptions used can have a significant impact Mortality: actuarial movements in on the balance sheet position and income statement charge.
In demographic assumptions practice, future scheme experience may not be in line with the assumptions adopted.
For example, an increase in the life expectancy of members would increase scheme liabilities.
Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2017 18 143 Consolidated accounts 2017 18 Consolidated accounts Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued At 1 March 2018 29Retirement benefits continued The principal assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries in updating the most recent valuation carried out as at 31 March 2017 of the UK scheme to 1 March 2018 for IAS 19 purposes were: At At 1 March 2 March 2018 2017 % % Pre-April 2006 rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.00 3.10 Post-April 2006 rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.10 2.10 Pension increases in deferment 3.00 3.10 Discount rate 2.60 2.60 Inflation assumption 3.10 3.20 The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements.
The assumptions are that a member currently aged 65 will live on average for a further 20.8 years 2017: 21.3 years if they are male and for a further 23.3 years 2017: 24.5 years if they are female.
For a member who retires in 2038 at age 65, the assumptions are that they will live on average for a further 22.0 years 2017: 22.8 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 24.5 years 2017: 26.0 years after retirement if they are female.
The amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of the defined benefit scheme are as follows: 2017 18 2016 17 m m Net interest on net defined benefit liability 10.0 9.4 Administrative expenses 3.2 3.1 Total expense recognised in the income statement gross of deferred tax 13.2 12.5 Amounts recognised in operating profit for service costs or curtailment are nil 2016 17: nil.
The amounts taken to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income are as follows: 2017 18 2016 17 m m Actuarial gains losses 85.8 601.7 Return on plan assets less greater than discount rate 36.9 386.9 Re-measurement effects recognised in other comprehensive income 48.9 214.8 The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are as follows: 2018 2017 m m Present value of defined benefit obligation 2,683.9 2,808.2 Fair value of scheme assets 2,395.3 2,383.1 Liability recognised in the balance sheet 288.6 425.1 During the year, the accounting deficit decreased from 425.1m at 2 March 2017 to 288.6m at 1 March 2018.
The principal reasons for this improvement were the change to mortality assumptions and company contributions.

2 Includes cost of managing fund assets.
3 Other primarily relates to assets held in respect of cash and net current assets.
The assumptions in relation to discount rate, mortality and inflation have a significant effect on the measurement of scheme liabilities.
The following table shows the sensitivity of the valuation to changes in these assumptions: Increase decrease in liability 2018 2017 m m Discount rate 0.25% increase to discount rate 116.0 125.0 0.25% decrease to discount rate 124.0 134.0 Inflation 0.25% increase to inflation rate 90.0 97.0 0.25% decrease to inflation rate 87.0 94.0 Life expectancy Additional one-year increase to life expectancy 91.0 95.0 The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption whilst holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions, the same method projected unit credit method has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the balance sheet.
The methods and types of assumptions did not change.
