Finance lease liabilities are in respect of leased investment property.
Minimum lease payments under finance leases fall due as follows: The policies for managing each of these risks and the principal effects of these policies on the results for the year are summarised below: 2018 2017 a Market risk m m Market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions will affect the Groups interest rates.
Borrowings at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Borrowings at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
Within one year 1.0 0.5 Between two and five years 3.9 1.8 The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and borrowings.
The Group borrows at both fixed and floating rates of Beyond five years 95.3 48.3 interest and then uses interest rate and cross currency swaps and caps to generate the desired interest and risk profile.
The Group has entered 100.2 50.6 into a cross currency swap to ensure the US Dollar liability streams generated from the US Dollar private placement notes are fully hedged into Future finance charges on finance leases 84.1 43.5 Sterling for the life of the transaction.
At 31 March 2018 77% 2017: 84% of Group borrowings were fixed or fixed through the use of interest rate and cross currency swaps.
Present value of finance lease liabilities 16.1 7.1 All transactions entered into are approved by the Board and are in accordance with the Groups treasury policy.
The Board also monitors variances on interest rates to budget and forecast rates to ensure that the risk relating to interest rates is being sufficiently safeguarded against.
Based upon year end variable rate loan balances, a reasonably possible interest rate movement of -0.5% would have increased and decreased net interest payable by 0.6m 2017: 0.2m.
Interest cover covenants in relation to Group borrowings range between 1.5x and 2.0x and the Group targets a minimum cover of 2.0x.
As at 31 March 2018 interest cover was 5.1x.
Interest cover is calculated as net rental income divided by finance costs.
b Credit risk The Groups main financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, deposits with banks and financial institutions and trade and other receivables.
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a tenant or a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
The Groups exposure to this risk principally relates to the receivables from tenants, deferred consideration on the sale of investment property and cash and cash equivalent balances held with counterparties.
The Groups exposure to credit risk in relation to receivables from tenants is influenced mainly by the characteristics of individual tenants occupying its rental properties.
The Group has around 3,000 tenants over 66 properties.
The largest 10 single tenants generate less than 10% of net rent roll.
As such, the credit risk attributable to individual tenants is low.
The Groups credit risk in relation to tenants is further managed by requiring that tenants provide a deposit equivalent to three months rent on inception of lease as security against default.
Total tenant deposits held are 28.1m 2017: 21.8m.
The Group monitors aged debt balances and any potential bad debts every week, the information being reported to the Executive Committee every month as part of the performance monitoring process.
The Groups debtor recovery is consistently high and as such is deemed a low risk area.
