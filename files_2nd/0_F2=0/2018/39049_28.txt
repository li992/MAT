Discontinued operations, disposals and assets held for sale continued Disposals During the year, Premier completed the previously announced sales of its interest in the Kakap field, its 30 per cent non-operated interest in the Esmond Transportation System 'ETS' and its interest in the Babbage Area.
A net gain for these disposals has been recognised in the income statement for the year.
The gain recognised has been partially offset by a charge of US$5.6 million due to a write-off of a contingent consideration receivable from Kris Energy in relation to the Aceh disposal by Premier in 2014.
Discontinued operations Pakistan Business Unit In April 2017, Premier announced it had reached agreement and signed a sale and purchase agreement with Al-Haj Energy Limited Al-Haj for the sale of Premier Oil Pakistan Holdings BV, which comprises Premiers Pakistan business unit, for a cash consideration of US$65.6 million.
During the year, Al-Haj paid a deposit to Premier of US$10.0 million, on top of the US$25.0 million deposit received in 2017.
The disposal of the Pakistan business unit is expected to complete in 2019 and, as this is within 12 months of the balance sheet date, the business unit continued to be classified as a disposal group held for sale in the year-end balance sheet.
The results of the disposal group which have been included as discontinued operations in the consolidated income statement were as follows: 2018 2017 US$ million US$ million Revenue 40.8 40.8 Expenses 15.0 22.4 Profit before tax 25.8 18.4 Attributable tax credit charge 2.5 2.0 Net profit for the period from discontinued operations 28.3 16.4 During the year to 31 December 2018, the Pakistan disposal group contributed US$29.0 million 2017 : US$16.8 million to the Groups net operating cash flows and paid US$5.0 million 2017: US$6.8 million in respect of investing activities.
There were no financing cash flows in either the current or the prior years.

These amounts are written off to the income statement as exploration expense unless commercial reserves are established or the determination process is not completed and there are no indications of impairment.
Assets written off in the year include costs incurred in Mexico on the Block 2 licence, the Sunbeam prospect in the UK and Block 665 in Brazil.
The outcome of ongoing exploration, and therefore whether the carrying value of E&E assets will ultimately be recovered, is inherently uncertain.
To the extent that we have an active licence to continue to explore for resources and have an intention to continue exploration activity, the exploration cost associated with the licence will remain capitalised as an E&E asset on the balance sheet.
Once exploration activity has completed and we have no further intention to explore the licence for resources, costs capitalised until that point will be expensed and no further costs associated with the licence will be capitalised.
During the year, the costs associated with the Tolmount project were transferred to PP&E following project sanction in August.
The balance carried forward is predominantly in relation to the Group's prospects in the Falkland Islands and the non-operated Zama prospect and Block 30 in Mexico.

Amortisation and depreciation of oil and gas properties is calculated on a unit-of-production basis, using the ratio of oil and gas production in the period to the estimated quantities of proved and probable reserves on an entitlement basis at the end of the period plus production in the period, on a field-by-field basis.
Proved and probable reserve estimates are based on a number of underlying assumptions including oil and gas prices, future costs, oil and gas in place and reservoir performance, which are inherently uncertain.
Management uses established industry techniques to generate its estimates and regularly references its estimates against those of joint venture partners or external consultants.
However, the amount of reserves that will ultimately be recovered from any field cannot be known with certainty until the end of the fields life.
Premier Oil plc 2018 Annual Report and Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2018 10.
Property, plant and equipment continued Impairment charge The impairment charge in the current year relates entirely to the Huntington asset in the UK.
The impairment charge of US$20.5 million was calculated by comparing the future discounted pre-tax cash flows expected to be derived from production of commercial reserves the value-in-use against the carrying value of the asset.
The future cash flows were estimated using the following oil price assumption: US$60 bbl in 2019, US$65 bbl in 2020, US$70 bbl in 2021 and US$75 bbl in real terms thereafter 2017: two years at forward curve, year three at US$70 bbl followed by a long-term price of US$75 bbl real and were discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 9 per cent for the UK assets 2017: 9 per cent and 12.5 per cent for the non-UK assets 2017: 12.5 per cent.
Assumptions involved in impairment measurement include estimates of commercial reserves and production volumes, future oil and gas prices, discount rates and the level and timing of expenditures, all of which are inherently uncertain.
The principal cause of the impairment charge being recognised in the year was as a result of an increase in the expected decommissioning costs attributed to the asset.
The prior year impairment charge was principally driven by a downgrade in 2P reserves on the Solan asset.
Reversal of previously recognised impairment charges Under the requirements of IAS 36, if there is an indication that a factor that resulted in an impairment charge may have changed or been reversed, then the previously recognised impairment charge may no longer exist or may have decreased.
For a number of assets, due to an increase in the near-term oil price assumption based on the Dated Brent forward curve, we have reassessed the recoverable amount of the asset to assess whether an increase in the recoverable amount value-in-use is indicative of a reversal of a previously recognised impairment charge.
The future cash flows were determined using the same assumptions as those used for the impairment charge outlined above.
A reversal of impairment of US$55.7 million has been credited to the income statement for the year, which has been partially offset by the impairment charge recognised.
The impairment reversal relates entirely to Solan in the UK as a result of a reduction in the expected gross decommissioning cost attributed to the asset.
The recoverable amount of Solan at 31 December 2018 was US$171.4 million.
The prior year reversal of impairment was driven by a one year extension of COP on the Huntington asset.
Sensitivity A 1 per cent increase in the discount rates used when determining the value-in-use for each oil and gas property would result in a reduction in the net impairment reversal of approximately US$6.1 million.
A US$5 bbl reduction in the long-term oil price to US$70 bbl real would reduce the net impairment reversal by approximately US$19.5 million.
Goodwill Goodwill of US$240.8 million has been specifically assigned to the Catcher field in the UK, which is considered the cash-generating unit for the purposes of any impairment testing of this goodwill.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts are determined from value-in-use calculations with the same key assumptions as noted above for the impairment calculations.
The discount rate used is 9 per cent 2017: 9 per cent.
The value-in-use forecast takes into consideration cash flows which are expected to arise during the life of the Catcher field as a whole, currently expected to be around 2026.
This period exceeds five years but is believed to be appropriate as it is underpinned by estimates of commercial reserves provided by our in-house reservoir engineers using industry standard reservoir estimation techniques.
The headroom between the recoverable amount and the carrying amount, including the goodwill, is US$166.8 million.
The key assumptions to which the calculation of value-in-use of the Catcher asset are discount rate, oil prices, forecasted recoverable reserves and estimated future costs.
No reasonably possible change in any of these key assumptions would cause the asset's carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.

The decommissioning funding asset relates to the Decommissioning Liability Agreement entered into with E. ON whereby E. ON agreed to part fund Premier's share of decommissioning the Johnston and Ravenspurn North assets.
Under the terms of the agreement, E. ON will reimburse 70 per cent of the decommissioning costs between a range of 40 million to 130 million based on Premier's net share of the total decommissioning cost of the two assets.
This results in maximum possible funding of 63 million from E. ON.
At 31 December 2018, a long-term decommissioning funding asset of US$48.3 million has been recognised utilising the year-end US$ exchange rate and underlying assumptions consistent with those used for the corresponding decommissioning provision.

Deferred income In June 2015, Premier received US$100 million from FlowStream in return for granting them 15 per cent of production from the Solan field until sufficient barrels have been delivered to achieve the rate of return within the agreement.
This balance is being released to the income statement within revenue as barrels are delivered to FlowStream from production from Solan.
The balance has reduced by US$16.2 million during the year reflecting barrels delivered to FlowStream and a charge to finance costs of US$9.8 million.
The portion of the deferred income that is expected to be delivered to FlowStream within the next 12 months has been classified as a current liability.

At the year-end, the Groups principal credit facilities comprised: Bank loans: US$2.5 billion revolving and letter of credit facility RCF, US$150 million and 100 million term loans together the Term Loan : Senior loan notes: US$335 million and 63.6 million of US Private Placement USPP notes and US$130 million converted loan facility: and 150 million of retail bonds.
All of the above facilities mature in May 2021.
The Company has financing in US$, and.
The and loans have been swapped into US$ at the original issue dates.
In total, 250 million and 60 million have been swapped into US$ using cross currency swap markets at an average exchange rate of US$1.64: and US$1.37: respectively.
However, all liabilities in currencies other than US$ have been translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the year-end.
Convertible bonds In January 2018, Premier invited convertible bondholders to exercise their exchange rights in respect of any and all of their bonds.
87.5 per cent or US$205.8 million of the US$235.2 million bonds outstanding were accepted for early exchange with an incentive amount of US$50 per US$1,000 in principal of bonds.
The exchange resulted in the issue of 231,882,091 Ordinary Shares, which included 7,578,343 incentive shares.
Completion of this offer, resulted in a remaining convertible bond liability of US$28.8 million.
Following this, in July 2018, the Group announced its intention to exercise the mandatory conversion option in the remaining outstanding convertible bonds.
The exercise of this option converted all the remaining US$28.8 million outstanding convertible bonds into approximately 31.4 million new Ordinary Shares of Premier.
This resulted in Premier's convertible bond liability being fully extinguished in September 2018.

Capital management The primary objective of the Groups capital management policy is to ensure that it maintains healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and increase shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the years ended 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017.
The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by net assets plus net debt.
The Groups policy is to target to keep the long-term gearing ratio below 50 per cent.
Net debt comprises interest-bearing bank loans, senior loan notes, retail bonds and convertible bonds, less cash and short-term deposits.

These provisions have been created based on Premier's internal estimates and, where available, operators estimates.
Based on the current economic environment, assumptions have been made which are believed to be a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future liability.
These estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions.
However, actual decommissioning costs will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works required, which will reflect market conditions at the relevant time.
Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning is likely to depend on when the fields cease to produce at economically viable rates.
This in turn will depend upon future oil and gas prices, which are inherently uncertain.
A discount rate of 4.6 per cent and an inflation rate of 2.5 per cent have been applied to all decommissioning estimates when determining the net present value of the decommissioning provision.
Rig rates used to determine the relevant part of the decommissioning cost estimates are based on a rolling five-year average observed in the market place for similar types of rigs, except where decommissioning is expected to occur in the near-term and then a spot price or actual price received during a rig tender process is used.
The oil and gas price assumptions used to determine the field life COP are consistent with those applied for the impairment assessment see note 10.
Decommissioning provisions include expected future obligations for Ravenspurn North and Johnston assets in the UK.
The first 63 million of decommissioning expenditure related to these assets is funded via a separate agreement with E. ON, see note 11.
Contingent consideration The contingent consideration is the closing year-end fair value of the royalty stream payable to Chrysaor for the acquisition of 40 per cent of the Solan asset in May 2015.
The estimate of fair value of this contingent consideration includes unobservable inputs and is level 3 in the IFRS 13 hierarchy and is held at fair value through profit and loss.
The movement in fair value for the year was US$1.2 million charge 2017: US$10.7 million income and has been recognised within other operating costs.
Indonesia unfunded termination benefit provision In Indonesia, the Group operates a Service, Severance and Compensation pay scheme under a Collective Labour Agreement with the local workforce.
In early 2003, the Government of Indonesia introduced a labour law which requires that on dismissal, companies are required to make certain payments to employees that are dependent on numbers of years' service and salary.
The scheme effectively provides a termination benefit to employees, but does not represent a defined benefit pension scheme.
The Company operates a defined termination benefit scheme, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Gains and losses are recognised immediately.
Past service cost is also recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The provision recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost.

Financial instruments Financial risk management objectives and policies The Group's principal financial liabilities, other than derivative financial instruments derivatives, are comprised of accounts payable, bank loans, retail bonds and senior loan notes.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage short-term cash flow and to raise finance for the Group's capital expenditure programme.
The Group has various financial assets such as accounts receivable and cash and short-term deposits, which arise directly from its operations.
It is Group policy that all transactions involving derivatives must be directly related to the underlying business of the Group.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative exposures.
The main risks that could adversely affect the Group's financial assets, liabilities or future cash flows are commodity price risk, cash flow interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange risk, credit risk, liquidity and the Group's share price.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain of these risk exposures.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group's policies as approved by the Board of Directors.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivatives to manage its exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations and to changes in interest rates and foreign currency.
Oil and gas price commodity hedging is undertaken using swaps, options, collar options, reverse collars, collar structures, hedges embedded in long-term crude offtake agreements and selling forward using fixed price sales contracts.
Oil is hedged using Dated Brent oil price swaps and options.
Indonesian gas is hedged using HSFO Singapore 180cst which is the variable component of the gas price and UK gas is hedged by selling gas forward through fixed price contracts and through UK NBP gas swaps and options.
The Group's exposure to interest rates is managed by maintaining an appropriate mix of both fixed and floating interest rate borrowings within its debt portfolio.
However, given the very low level of fixed interest rates available relative to historical rates, a substantial portion of the current drawings have been converted to fixed interest rates using the interest rate swap and option markets.
The Group has and currency exposure as a result of its borrowings.
These are managed through cross-currency swap arrangements.
As the Group reports in US dollars, since that is the currency in which the majority of the Groups transactions are denominated, aside from some of its borrowings, significant exchange rate exposures currently relate only to certain local currency such as Pound sterling receipts and expenditures within individual business units.
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts and options.
Fair value hierarchy The fair values of all derivative financial instruments are based on estimates from observable inputs and are all level 2 in the IFRS 13 hierarchy.
Both the estimate of the Chrysaor contingent consideration see note 17 and fair value of the warrants see below include estimates based on unobservable inputs are level 3 in the IFRS 13 hierarchy.
As at 31 December 2018, the Group held the following financial instruments measured at fair value excluding any primary financial instruments such as cash and bank loans.

The forward sales have been designated as cash flow hedges and were assessed to be effective, with a fair value movement of US$133.5 million credit 2017: US$14.2 million charge in retained earnings.
During the year, forward oil sales contracts for 5.9 mmbbls matured generating a loss of US$71.2 million 2017: US$11.4 million loss.
This loss is a reduction to sales revenue.
During the year, the Group paid premiums of US$1.6 million to enter into oil option agreements for 0.7 mmbbls taking the total oil options open in the year to 2.5 mmbbls at average price of US$56.4 bbl.
All these options expired at year-end.
Any premium paid relating to these options has been expensed to the income statement.
These options are held at fair value through profit and loss and hedge accounting is not applied.
Included within physically delivered oil sales contracts are a further 1.8 mmbbls of oil that will be sold for an average fixed price ofUS$54.9 bbl during 2019 as these barrels are delivered.
As these instruments are physically settled they do not meet the definition of financial instruments under IFRS 13 and are accounted for as they are delivered.
Gas At the year-end date, 255,000 mt of HSFO, which drives the Group's gas pricing in Singapore, is subject to forward sales contracts for 2019 and 2020 at an average price of US$391.4 mt.
All contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges and were assessed to be effective, with a fair value movement of US$22.8 million credit in retained earnings.
As at 31 December 2018, the Group had forward gas sales contract of 115,000 therms at an average price of 65p therm.
This forward sales contract has been designated as a cash flow hedge and was assessed to be effective, with a fair value movement of US$0.6 million credited to retained earnings.
During the year, the Group entered into forward gas sales of 100,000 mt at an average price of 48.2p therm which matured by the year-end generating a loss of US$2.0 million.
Equity and synthetic warrants During the year, 24.9 million equity warrants have been converted resulting in an allotment of 24.7 million shares.
The closing fair value of the open equity and synthetic warrants at 31 December 2018 was US$22.7 million and US$9.1 million respectively, giving a total of US$31.8 million after the exercise of warrants valued at US$7.8 million and resulting in a gain of US$20.1 million being recognised in the year.
The fair value of the warrants includes unobservable inputs and is level 3 in the IFRS 13 hierarchy.
The key assumptions underpinning the fair value relate to the expected future share price of the Company, US$: exchange rates and the expected date of exercise of the warrants.
The fair value has been determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model.
The equity warrants have an exercise price of 41.80 pence 2017: 42.75 pence and are exercisable from their issuance until 31 May 2022, at the option of the warrant holder, and are settled with ordinary shares of the Company.
The synthetic warrants are cash settled by the Group when certain future net debt and leverage ratio conditions are achieved, linked to the Groups market capitalisation, and expire in May 2021.
When determining the fair value of the equity and synthetic warrants, if the share price assumed increased decreased by 10 per cent, the closing total fair value recognised for the equity and synthetic warrants at the year-end would have increased decreased by US$5.2 million.
Changes in the Company's share price is the main driver with regards to changing the fair value of the warrant instruments.
Premier Oil plc 2018 Annual Report and Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2018 18.
Financial instruments continued Commodity contract sensitivity analysis The key variable which affects the fair value of the Group's hedging instruments is market expectations about future commodity prices.
An increase of 10 per cent in oil prices would decrease the mark-to-market gain of these instruments, and hence other comprehensive income, by US$10.3 million.
A decrease of 10 per cent in forward oil prices would increase the mark-to-market gain by US$10.3 million.
An increase of 10 per cent in gas prices would decrease the mark-to-market gain of these instruments, and hence other comprehensive income, by US$2.4 million.
A decrease of 10 per cent in forward gas prices would increase the mark-to-market gain by US$2.4 million.
Interest rate risk At 31 December 2018, US$1.3 billion 2017: US$750 million of the Group's long-term bank borrowings have been swapped from floating rate to fixed rate.
Of this US$300 million were interest rate swap contracts.
The Group has agreed to exchange the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
During the year, the Group entered into US$1 billion interest rate options with a strike price 3.0 to 3.1 per cent.
Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates and the cash flow exposure on the issued variable rate debt held.
These contracts will mature by end 2020.
Foreign currency exchange risk The majority of borrowings at year-end were denominated in US dollars to match the currency of the Group's assets.
The Group has issued 150.0 million retail bonds and 100 million term loan at a fixed exchange rate of US$1.64, senior loan notes of 25 million at a fixed rate of US$1.33, and 35 million at a fixed rate of US$1.42.
All these amounts have been hedged under cross currency swaps into US dollars.
In addition, to cover sterling exposures an amount of 236 million was purchased and matured with spot and forward contracts during the year 2017: 290.5 million to cater for its North Sea developments and operations.
Other financial instruments Credit risk Credit risk arises from the Group's trade receivables and its bank deposits.
The amount of receivables presented in the balance sheet is net of allowances for doubtful receivables, which were immaterial in 2018 and 2017.
The Group does not require collateral or other security to support receivables from customers or related parties.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with at least single A credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
An indication of the concentration of credit risk is shown in note 1, whereby the revenue from three customers each exceeded 10 per cent of the Group's consolidated revenue in 2018 2017: three.
The age profile of the Group's trade and other receivables and trade and other payables as at 31 December, including the related undiscounted interest amounts payable, was: Less than 2 to 3 3 months 1 to 5 Over 1 month months to 1 year years 5 years Total US$ million US$ million US$ million US$ million US$ million US$ million 2018: Long-term receivables 19.2 140.6 159.8 Trade and other receivables 184.4 0.5 5.6 190.5 Trade and other payables 44.7 1.8 42.7 89.2 Bank loans 60.2 52.0 233.8 1,809.2 2,155.2 Senior loan notes 0.5 11.9 37.7 609.0 659.1 Retail bonds 12.7 212.7 225.4 Total 79.0 65.2 321.3 2,611.7 140.6 2,778.6 2017: Long-term receivables 0.4 4.3 9.1 4.9 141.6 160.3 Trade and other receivables 216.7 1.6 14.4 19.2 0.2 252.1 Trade and other payables 146.2 4.9 25.1 1.1 177.3 Bank loans 3.6 8.8 99.9 2,516.1 2,628.4 Convertible bonds 237.9 237.9 Senior loan notes 0.3 10.8 33.8 643.9 688.8 Retail bonds 13.2 234.1 247.3 Total 67.0 18.6 148.5 3,609.0 141.8 3,567.3 Premier Oil plc 2018 Annual Report and Financial Statements 150 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 151 Liquidity risk Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has approved an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Group's short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking and borrowing facilities and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities and future capital and operating commitments.
Borrowing facilities The Group has committed borrowing facilities of US$2,112.3 million 2017: US$2,335 million and letters of credit facilities of US$450 million 2017: US$450 million, in addition to the retail bonds and senior loan notes.
The undrawn balance of the committed borrowing facilities as at 31 December 2018 was US$265.6 million 31 December 2017: US$170 million.
The undrawn balance of the letter of credit facilities as at 31 December 2018 was US$89.3 million 2017:US$74.3 million.
Interest rate risk profile of financial liabilities The interest rate profile of the financial liabilities of the Group as at 31 December excluding trade and other payables which are interest free was: Fixed rate weighted average Fixed rate Floating rate Total interest rate US$ million US$ million US$ million % 2018: Bank loans 1,300.0 546.6 1,846.6 6.21 Senior loan notes 408.2 130.0 538.2 9.20 Retail bonds 190.5 190.5 6.50 Total 1,898.7 676.6 2,575.3 2017: Bank loans 750.0 1,415.0 2,165.0 4.95 Convertible bonds 237.9 237.9 2.50 Senior loan notes 411.6 130.0 541.6 7.65 Retail bonds 202.5 202.5 6.50 Total 1,602.0 1,545.0 3,147.0 The floating rate financial liabilities at 31 December 2018 comprised bank loans bearing interest at rates set by reference to US$ and LIBOR, exposing the Group to a cash flow interest rate risk.
Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values.
The estimated fair values have been determined using market information and appropriate valuation methodologies.
Values recorded are as at the balance sheet date, and will not necessarily be the amounts that are realised.
Non-interest bearing financial instruments, which include amounts receivable from customers and accounts payable, are measured at amortised cost which, due to the short-term maturity, approximate to fair value.
The carrying values and fair values of the Group's non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities excluding current assets and current liabilities for which carrying values approximate to fair values due to their short-term nature are: 2018 2018 2017 2017 Fair value Carrying Fair value Carrying amount amount amount amount US$ million US$ million US$ million US$ million Primary financial instruments held or issued to finance the Groups operations: Retail bonds 181.6 190.5 196.1 202.5 Convertible bonds 266.9 180.5 The fair values of the retail bonds and convertible bonds are determined by reference to quoted prices for each of the instruments.
The fair value of the bank loans and senior loan notes are considered to be materially the same as the amortised cost of the instruments.

The Group's deferred tax assets at 31 December 2018 are recognised to the extent that taxable profits are expected to arise in the future against which the UK ring fence tax losses and allowances can be utilised.
In accordance with paragraph 37 of IAS 12 'Income Taxes', the Group reassessed its deferred tax assets at 31 December 2018 with respect to UK ring fence tax losses and allowances.
The corporate model used to assess whether it is appropriate to recognise the Group's deferred tax losses and allowances was re-run, using an oil price assumption of US$60 bbl in 2019, US$65 bbl in 2020, US$70 bbl in 2021 and US$75 bbl in 'real' terms thereafter and a gas price assumption of forward curve for 3 years, followed by GBP57.4p therm in 2022 'real' terms thereafter.
These price assumptions are consistent with that used when assessing the Group's underlying assets for impairment.
The cash flows included in the corporate model are predominantly derived from future revenue from UKCS assets which management consider to be probable to arise, including both existing producing assets and certain future currently unsanctioned projects.
The results of the corporate model concluded that it was appropriate to continue to recognise the Group's deferred tax assets in respect of UK ring fence tax losses and allowances with the exception of US$25.2m of losses relating to supplementary charge.
Premier Oil plc 2018 Annual Report and Financial Statements 152 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 153 In addition to the above, there are carried forward non-ring fence UK tax losses of approximately US$359.1 million 2017: US$330.8 million and overseas tax losses of US$154.8 million 2017: US$130.3 million for which a deferred tax asset has not been recognised.
None of the UK tax losses ring fence and non-ring fence have a fixed expiry date for tax purposes.
No deferred tax has been provided on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, following a change in UK tax legislation in 2009 which exempted foreign dividends from the scope of UK corporation tax, where certain conditions are satisfied.

Premier Oil plc 2018 Annual Report and Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2018 21.
Share-based payments The Group currently operates a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP for all employees and a Share Incentive Plan and a Save As You Earn Scheme for UK-based and expatriate employees only.
For the year ended 31 December 2018, the total cost recognised by the Company for equity-settled share-based payment transactions is US$14.6 million 2017: US$14.5million.
A credit of US$14.6 million has been recorded in retained earnings 2017: US$14.5 million for all equity-settled payments of the Company.
Like other elements of remuneration, this charge is processed through the time-writing system which allocates cost, based on time spent by individuals, to various entities within the Premier Oil plc Group.
Part of this cost is therefore recharged to the relevant subsidiary undertaking, part is capitalised as directly attributable to capital projects and part is charged to the income statement as operating costs, pre-licence exploration costs or general and administration costs.
Details of the different share incentive plans currently in operation are set out below: 2009 Long Term Incentive Plan 2009 LTIP The 2009 LTIP is comprised of the following three elements: Equity Pool Awards EPA, Performance Share Awards PSA and Matching Share Awards MSA : The Equity Pool Awards EPA are funded by a per cent share of the growth in the Companys equity value over a three-year performance period.
One per cent of the compound growth is credited to the equity pool at 10 per cent compound annual growth rate CAGR, with maximum funding of 2.5 per cent at 20 per cent CAGR per annum.
Participants receive a percentage share of the equity pool which vests, if the relevant performance criteria are met, in shares at the end of the performance period.
Performance Share Awards of up to 150 per cent of salary may be granted under the 2009 LTIP, which vest on three-year TSR relative to a comparator group of oil and gas sector peers.
25 per of the award vest for median performance with full vesting for upper quartile performance.
50 per cent of vested EPA and PSA shares are subject to compulsory deferral for a further three years for senior executives and eligible for a discretionary Share Award.
Awards under the 2009 LTIP were approved by Premiers Remuneration Committee in August 2016 and the awards were granted to the Executive Directors and other members of senior management during the period August 2016 to April 2017 as a result of trading restrictions applying to certain participants over that period.
The Performance Period for the 2016 awards is the period 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2018.
As part of the April 2017 award, the EPA was capped at 50 per cent of salary and the PSA was scaled back by 50 per cent to 75 per cent, with no matching awards.
The EPA and PSA elements of the above award have been fair valued by the Company using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
The main assumptions for the calculation are as follows:: Volatility 48% Risk free rate of interest 1.7% Correlation factor with comparator group 0.39 In March 2019, the Remuneration Committee determined that based on the performance achieved to 31 December 2018, the EPA and PSA under the 2009 LTIP should vest.
Further detail on the vesting outcome is described in the Directors' Remuneration Report page 98.
2017 Long Term Incentive Plan 'LTIP The new Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP was introduced in the prior year for Executive Directors and certain senior staff.
This new LTIP comprises two types of awards which support different elements of the Company's strategy.
Performance Share Awards: vesting is subject to a Performance Target measured over a three year period from 1 January based on Total Shareholder Return relative to a peer group of companies and aligns to longer-term strategic objectives.
Restricted Share Award RSA aligns to the primary objective of balance sheet recovery, independent of other performance objectives and vesting of awards is subject to a financial underpin and continued employment.
Long-term alignment to shareholders interests is maintained with the introduction of a compulsory two-year Holding Period for both Performance Share Awards and Restricted Share Awards ending on the fifth anniversary of the award date.
The RSA represents a fixed award equal in value of up to 40 per cent of salary.
They vest subject to continued employment in one-third annual increments over three, four and five years, subject to a holding requirement over the full five-year cycle from grant.
This fixed value award is being accrued at cost.
The RSA granted in 2017 and 2018 have been scaled back by 50 per cent to 20 per cent.

The performance period commences from 1 January of the year of grant.
The movement in the number of shares and main assumptions for the calculation are as follows: 2018 2017 million million Outstanding at 1 January 5.7 Granted during the year 8.1 5.7 Forfeited during the year 0.3 Outstanding as at 31 December 13.5 5.7 Volatility 82% 83% Risk free rate of interest 0.8% 0.2% Correlation factor with comparator group 0.30 0.32 Premier Value Share Plan PVSP The broader employee population participates in the Premier Value Share Plan PVSP, which forms part of the 2017 LTIP.
The PVSP is made up of two awards, Base Awards and Multiplier Awards.
Under the PVSP, annual awards of time-vesting restricted shares and three-year performance-vesting shares may be made, with performance-vesting shares subject to achievements or Premier's delivery of long-term shareholder return.
PVSP awards have been granted to employees in 2016, 2017 and 2018 and these will vest in 2019, 2020 and 2021 respectively.
Owing to the prevailing business environment, the multiplier element of the PVSP Multiplier Award was removed from both the 2016 and 2017 awards, resulting in each employee receiving in effect a fixed award at the end of the vesting period Base Award.
However, the 2018 award included the multiplier based on a pre-scale back Base Award.
The value of the Base Award is set at a fixed percentage of each employee's salary and the number of shares awarded is fixed according to the average closing price of a Premier Oil share over the five dealing days immediately preceding the award date: 75 pence for 2016 awards, 55 pence for 2017 awards, and a weighted average price of 72 pence for 2018 awards.
All these Base Awards were scaled back by 50 percent.
Included in the below table are an immaterial number of cash settled shares which are revalued using the year-end share price.

These were fair valued by the Company using a Monte Carlo simulation model at point of grant.
The main assumptions for the calculation are as follows: Volatility 79 82% Risk free rate of interest 0.70.9% Correlation factor with comparator group 0.290.30 No shares were exercised or lapsed during the year.
Share-based payments continued Share Incentive Plan Under the Share Incentive Plan employees are invited to make contributions to buy partnership shares.
If an employee agrees to buy partnership shares the Company currently matches the number of partnership shares bought with an award of shares matching shares, on a one-for-one basis.
After three years the employee has the right to receive their original contributions plus the shares awarded in either cash or shares of the Company, at the employees option.
The amount owed by the Company to employees under this scheme is deemed to be insignificant.
Save As You Earn SAYE scheme Under the SAYE eligible employees with six months or more continuous service can join the scheme.
Employees can save to a maximum of 500 per month through payroll deductions for a period of three or five years, after which time they can acquire shares at up to a 20 per cent discount.

Capital commitments and guarantees At 31 December 2018, the Group had capital commitments on exploration and development licences totalling US$121.5 million 2017: US$207.1 million.
In addition, the Group had issued letters of credit for future decommissioning liabilities totalling 288.1 million, US$22.6 million held as security for the Mexican letters of credit and a performance bond for the Indonesia Andaman licence of US$0.6 million, totalling US$389.1 million 2017: US$398 million.

On the same actuarial basis as used to assess the Scheme's pension costs, the present value as at 31 December 2018 of the future payments projected to be made in respect of UK unfunded pensions is US$0.7 million 2017: US$0.7 million.
Funded pensions The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme in the UK - The Premier Oil plc Retirement and Death Benefits Plan 'the Scheme primarily inflation-linked annuities based on an employees length of service and final salary.
The Scheme was closed to new members aside from the provision of insured death in service benefits in 1997 and a new scheme, providing benefits on a defined contribution basis, was started.
Both schemes are funded by the payment of contributions to separately administered trust funds.
The disclosures set out below are based on calculations carried out as at 31 December 2018 by a qualified independent actuary.
The figures have been prepared in compliance with IAS 19 'Employee Benefits'.
The Scheme's assets are held in a separate trustee-administered fund to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and present employees.
The Trustee of the Scheme is required to act in the best interest of the Scheme's beneficiaries.
The appointment of members of the Trustee Board is determined by the trust documentation.
The liabilities of the defined benefit Scheme are measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid out of the Scheme using the projected unit credit method.
This amount is reflected in the surplus or the deficit in the balance sheet.
The projected unit credit method is an accrued benefits valuation method in which the Scheme liabilities make allowance for the projected earnings.
The liabilities set out in this note have been calculated using membership data current as at 31 December 2018.
The results of the calculations and the assumptions adopted are shown below.
As at 31 December 2018, contributions are payable to the Scheme by the Group at the rates set out in the schedule of contributions signed by the trustees on 19 January 2018.
Under this schedule, the Company contributes on a monthly basis at the rate of 30 percent of the aggregate of members' pensionable salaries.

The balance sheet position revealed by IAS 19 calculations must be expected to be volatile, principally because the market value of assets with significant exposure to equities is being compared with a liability assessment derived from corporate bond yields.
The below table shows the sensitivity of the IAS 19 balance sheet position to small changes in some of the assumptions.
Where one assumption has been changed all the other assumptions are kept as disclosed above.

The following projections should therefore be treated with caution.
Assumptions implicit in the following projections are: The interest on the defined benefit liability asset from 31 December 2018 is 2.8% p. a Contributions to the Scheme will continue throughout 2019 in accordance with the current Schedule of Contributions in place at the date of signing this report: and There will be no changes to the terms of the Scheme.
The amounts recognised in the components of pension expense are: 2019 US$ million Current service cost 0.1 Interest on defined benefit liability asset Net actuarial gain loss recognised Total 0.1 Defined contribution scheme The Group operates a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme.
The only obligation of the Group with respect to the retirement benefit scheme is to make specified contributions.
Payments to the defined contribution scheme are charged as an expense as they fall due.
The total cost charged to income of US$9.3 million 2017: US$6.7 million represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the Scheme.
