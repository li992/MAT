The movement from a charge of 674 million to a credit of 326 million in the tax charge attributable to policyholders returns mainly reflects a decrease in the deferred tax liabilities on unrealised gains on investments in the with-profits funds of the UK and Europe and of Asia compared to 2017.
The reconciliation of the expected to actual tax charge attributable to shareholders is provided in b below.
The tax credit attributable to policyholders of 326 million above is equal to the loss before tax attributable to policyholders of 326 million.
This is the result of accounting for policyholder income after the deduction of expenses and movement on unallocated surpluses and on an after-tax basis.
The total tax charge comprises: 2018 m 2017 m Current tax expense: Corporation tax 677 746 Adjustments in respect of prior years 19 50 Total current tax charge 696 696 Deferred tax arising from: Origination and reversal of temporary differences 385 531 Impact of changes in local statutory tax rates 8 353 Credit in respect of a previously unrecognised tax loss, tax credit or temporary difference from a prior period 7 Total deferred tax credit charge 400 884 Total tax charge 296 1,580 The current tax charge of 696 million 2017: 696 million includes 65 million 2017: 59 million in respect of the tax charge for the Hong Kong operation.

The principal reason for the reduction in the tax charge attributable to short-term temporary differences from 526 million in 2017 to 198 million in 2018 is the remeasurement of US deferred tax balances in 2017 from 35 per cent to 21 per cent.

co. uk Annual Report 2018 Prudential plc 211 B Earnings performance continued B4 Tax charge continued Notes i Impact of US tax reform The 2018 tax charge for US operations reflects the full impact of the US tax reform package, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted in December 2017 and took effect from 1 January 2018.
The expected tax rate of 21 per cent reflects the reduced US corporate income tax rate compared to 35 per cent for 2017.
The benefit of the dividend received deduction shown in Items related to the taxation of life insurance businesses is lower in 2018 than 2017 reflecting the changes to how this deduction is computed.
In 2017, the reduction in the US corporate income tax rate gave rise to a 445 million unfavourable reconciling item in US operations relating to the remeasurement of the net deferred tax asset attributable to shareholders and a 134 million benefit recognised in other comprehensive income.
ii Items related to taxation of life insurance businesses The 83 million 2017: 238 million reconciling item in US operations reflects the impact of the dividend received deduction on the taxation of profits from variable annuity business.
The principal reason for the reduction in the Asia operations reconciling items from 92 million at 2017 to 13 million at 2018 reflects non-operating investment losses in Hong Kong which do not attract tax relief offsetting the benefit of operating profits due to the taxable profit being computed as 5 per cent of net insurance premiums.
iii Effects of results of joint ventures and associates Profit before tax includes Prudentials share of profits after tax from the joint ventures and associates.
Therefore, the actual tax charge does not include tax arising from profit or loss of joint ventures and associates and is reflected as a reconciling item in the table above.
iv Irrecoverable withholding taxes The 47 million 2017: 54 million adverse reconciling items reflects local withholding taxes on dividends paid by certain non-UK subsidiaries, principally Indonesia, to the UK.
The dividends are exempt from UK tax and consequently the withholding tax cannot be offset against UK tax payments.
