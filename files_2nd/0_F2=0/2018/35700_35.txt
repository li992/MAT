FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Financial Statements Critical Accounting Judgements and Estimates Notes The following provides information on those policies that management considers critical because of the level of judgement and estimation 1.
Segment analysis required which often involves assumptions regarding future events which can vary from what is anticipated.
The Directors believe that the financial statements reflect appropriate judgements and estimates and provide a true and fair view of Essentras performance and financial position.
In accordance with IFRS 8, Essentra has determined its operating segments based upon the information reported to the Group Management Committee.
With effect from 1 January 2018, Essentra has implemented a new organisational structure, comprising four divisions.
The scope of central services remains the same.
Accounting Estimates The operating segments are as follows: i Business combinations and intangible assets IFRS 3 requires the identification of acquired intangible assets as part of a business combination.
The methods used to value such intangible assets Components is a global market-leading manufacturer and distributor of plastic injection moulded, vinyl dip moulded and metal items.
require the use of estimates and judgements such as customer attrition, cash flow generation from the existing relationships with customers and Packaging is one of only two multi-continental suppliers of a full secondary packaging range to the health and personal care sectors.
Future results are impacted by the amortisation periods adopted and changes to the estimated useful lives would result in different effects on the income statement and balance sheet.
Filters is the only global independent supplier of innovative cigarette filters and related solutions to the tobacco industry.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment, along with the finite-lived intangible assets and other assets of the Groups cash Specialist Components is a new division, created with effect from 1 January 2018 further to the Companys strategic review, and comprises generating units.
Tests for impairment are based on discounted cash flows and assumptions including discount rates, timing and growth the following six smaller businesses of Essentra: prospects which are inherently subjective.
An estimate is also required in identifying the events which indicate potential impairment, and in The Extrusion business is a leading custom profile extruder located in the Netherlands which offers a complete design and production service.
assessing fair value of individual assets when allocating an impairment loss in a cash-generating unit or groups of cash-generating units.
The Group performs various sensitivity analyses in respect of the tests for impairment, as detailed in note 8.
The Pipe Protection Technologies business specialises in the manufacture of high-performance innovative products from commodity resins to engineering-grade thermoplastics and polymer alloys for use in the oil & gas industry.
The useful lives of the Groups finite-lived intangible assets are reviewed following the tests for impairment annually.
The Speciality Tapes business has expertise in coating multiple adhesive systems in numerous technologies, and its products range from foam, Judgement may also be required in determining the fair value of other assets acquired and liabilities including contingent liabilities assumed.
magnetic, finger lift and acrylic high bond tapes to hook and loop and non-skid foam.
ii Pensions The Tear Tapes business is globally recognised as the leading manufacturer and supplier of pressure-sensitive tear tapes, which are largely used Essentra accounts for its defined benefit pension schemes in accordance with IAS 19.
The application of IAS 19 requires the exercise of judgement in the tobacco, food & drink and specialist packaging sectors.
in relation to the assumptions used and for each assumption there is a range of possible outcomes see note 17.
In consultation with Essentras The Industrial Supply business provides a wide range of branded hardware supplies to a broad base of industrial customers, largely located actuaries, management decides the point within those ranges that most appropriately reflects Essentras circumstances.

assumptions can have a significant impact on valuations.
The Group performs a sensitivity analysis for the significant assumptions used in determining post-employment costs and liabilities, as detailed in note 17.
The Card Solutions business is a leading European provider of ID card printers, systems and accessories to direct and trade customers.
On 25 August 2016, Essentra entered into a sale and purchase agreement with Filtration Group to dispose of the Groups entire operations in iii Taxation Porous Technologies.
The transaction completed on 6 March 2017.
The results of Porous Technologies were presented as results from a discontinued Liabilities for tax contingencies require management judgements and estimates in respect of tax audit issues and exposures in each of the operation in the consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 December 2017. jurisdictions in which it operates.
Management is also required to make an estimate of the current tax liability together with an assessment of the temporary differences which arise as a consequence of different accounting and tax treatments.
Where Management concludes a tax position No finance income or expense related to discontinued operations, and the income tax expense related to discontinued operations amounted to is uncertain, a current tax liability is held for anticipated taxes that are considered probable based on the information available.
Key judgement areas for the Group include the pricing of intercompany goods and services as well as the tax consequences arising from The adjusted operating profit loss presented for each operating segment includes the effect of allocation of certain functional costs such restructuring operations.
Included in the tax payable is a liability of 17.7m 2017: 18.9m for transfer pricing matters and 17.7m 2017: 19.0m as finance, human resources, legal and IT, as well as costs relating to management of the divisions on an internal management methodology.
for other uncertain tax positions.
The movement is due to adjustments for current year transactions, foreign exchange movements, expiry of Therefore the adjusted operating profit for year ended 31 December 2017 presented below of 84.9m differs from the amount presented statute of limitations following the passage of time and agreement reached with tax authorities on previous matters.
as operating profit before intangible amortisation and exceptional and other adjusting items of 84.6m as a result of 0.3m of costs allocated to Porous Technologies under the internal management methodology.
The group is aware of the European Commission press release on 26 October 2017 where the Commission opened an in-depth investigation into the UKs finance company partial exemption from controlled foreign company rules to determine whether EU state aid rules have been breached.
Management does not consider it probable that an outflow of cost will arise to the Group as a consequence of this and so no current or deferred tax liability is held.
Management considers it impracticable to calculate the potential contingent liability since there is too much uncertainty regarding how the process may conclude.
Management note the European Commission investigation is ongoing and will monitor the progress of this investigation.
Management may engage with professional advisors in making their assessment and, if appropriate, will liaise with the relevant taxation authorities to resolve the matter.
The tax liability is reassessed in each period to reflect Managements best estimate in light of information available.
If the final outcome of these matters differs to the liability held in the financial statements, the difference may impact the income tax charge credit in the year the matter is concluded.
Accounting Judgements i Exceptional and other adjusting items Judgement is required to determine whether items should be included within exceptional and other adjusting items by virtue of their size or incidence.
Details of the items categorised as exceptional are disclosed in note 2.

1 The change in the weighted average applicable tax rate is caused by a change in the geographical balance of the Groups profits and changes in corporate tax rates in these geographies.
The prior year weighted average tax rate was impacted by the disposal of the Porous Technologies business and the US tax reform.
2 This primarily includes depreciation on assets not qualifying for capital allowances and costs incurred in connection with acquisition and disposals of businesses.
Permanent disallowable items may vary in future years dependent on the nature of future expenditure.
3 The disposal of the Porous Technologies businesses in 2017 gave rise to taxable gains, the basis of which is different to the accounting gains.
4 The US Tax Reform enacted during 2017 generated a tax credit as deferred tax liabilities were rebased to reflect the reduction to the US Federal tax rate from 1 January 2018.
Given the material nature of this impact, it was presented as an exceptional tax credit.
5 The increase in the year is largely driven by the impact of the US Global Intangible Low Taxed Income provisions that are applicable from 1 January 2018.

At the period end it is expected that earnings from certain overseas Group companies will be remitted and a deferred tax liability of 5.7m 2017: 4.5m has been recognised accordingly.
This represents withholding taxes payable on the remittance of these earnings under local tax laws.
The amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and branches for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 127.1m as at 31 December 2018 2017: 107.8m, and the associated amount of unrecognised deferred tax is 14.1m 2017: 11.5m.
Based on available information, management determined whether it is probable for some or all of the deferred tax assets to be realised.
In determining this management considered the cumulative losses in prior years, the history of tax losses, the manner in which assets can be used including time limitations under local laws, future earnings potential and expectation of future reversal of taxable temporary differences.
Following management assessment, gross deferred tax assets of 0.2m 2017: 0.2m in respect of capital losses and unutilised tax losses of 27.6m 2017: 31.9m have not been recognised as their realisation is not probable.
The capital losses have an unlimited expiry date.
The tax losses expire as follows: 0.9m within 5 years, 2.5m in 5 -- -10 years, 0.2m in over 10 years and 24.0m with no expiry.
If future conditions change the amount of unrecognised deferred tax assets will be reassessed.

AAA is the highest possible rating and all of the assets are neither impaired nor past due.
ii Market price risk Market price risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect income or the value of financial assets and liabilities.
Essentra has produced a sensitivity analysis that shows the estimated change to the income statement and equity of a 1%, 5% or 10% weakening or strengthening in sterling against all other currencies or an increase or decrease of 50 basis points bps, 100bps and 200bps in market interest rates.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are estimates and actual results in the future may materially differ.
Essentra is exposed to two types of market price risk: currency risk and interest rate risk.
a Currency risk Essentra publishes its consolidated financial statements in sterling but conducts business in several foreign currencies.
Therefore it is subject to currency risk due to exchange rate movements which affect the translation of results and underlying net assets of its operations and their transaction costs.
Hedge of net investment in foreign operations The majority of Essentras net assets are in currencies other than sterling.
The Companys normal policy is to limit the translation exposure and the resulting impact on shareholders funds through measures such as borrowing in those currencies in which the Group has significant net assets.
Essentras US dollar-denominated assets were approximately 36% 2017: 36% hedged by the US dollar-denominated borrowings.
Essentras eurodenominated assets were approximately 30% hedged by the euro-denominated borrowings 2017: 65%.

Financial risk management continued Transaction exposure hedging The movement in the provision for impaired receivables including amounts relating to disposal group held for sale is as follows: The majority of Essentras transactions are carried out in the functional currencies of its operations and therefore transaction exposure is limited.
However, where such exposure does occur, Essentra uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge its exposure to movements in exchange 2018 2017 m m rates on its highly probable forecast foreign currency sales and purchases over a period of up to 18 months.

The translational End of year 6.6 4.5 effect on equity is limited as a proportion of US dollar and euro exposure is hedged.
Accordingly the effect on equity is calculated by increasing or decreasing the closing rate of all currencies with an adjustment for the movement in currency hedges.
It is assumed that all net investment and Derivative assets cash flow hedges will continue to be 100% effective.
Credit risk with respect to derivatives is controlled by limiting transactions to major banking counterparties where internationally agreed standard form documentation exists.

Essentras objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility.
Essentra is primarily funded by a series of US Private Placement Loan Notes from various financial institutions totalling US$155m and syndicated multi-currency five-year revolving credit facilities of 285.0m and 100.8m from its banks.
The series of Loan Notes have original maturities ranging from seven to twelve years and the revolving credit facilities mature in November 2022.
At 31 December 2018, the available bank facilities totalled 375.0m 2017: 374.2m of which 193.1m 2017: 155.9m was drawn down.
In addition, uncommitted and overdraft facilities are maintained to provide short-term flexibility.
Amounts drawn by Essentra on its committed facilities are subject to standard banking covenants.
The financial covenants require the net debt to EBITDA ratio to be less than 3.0x and interest cover to be greater than 3.5x.
There has been no covenant breach during the period.
