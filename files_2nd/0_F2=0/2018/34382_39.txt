Financial statements NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 2 Performance measures Earnings per share The Group measures financial performance with reference to underlying earnings per share, the European Public Real Estate Association EPRA earnings per share and IFRS earnings per share.
The relevant earnings and weighted average number of shares including dilution adjustments for each performance measure are shown below, and a reconciliation between these is shown within the supplementary disclosures Table B. EPRA earnings per share is calculated using EPRA earnings, which is the IFRS profit after taxation attributable to shareholders of the Company excluding investment and development property revaluations, gains losses on investing and trading property disposals, changes inthe fair value of financial instruments and associated close-out costs and their related taxation.
The 2012 convertible bond was repaid in the current year.
In the prior year diluted EPRA earnings per share did not include the dilutive impact of the 2012 convertible bond, as the Groups share price was below the exchange price of 693 pence.
IFRS diluted earnings per share included the dilutive impact as IAS 33 ignores this hurdle to conversion.
In the current and prior year, both EPRA and IFRS measures exclude the dilutive impact of the 2015 convertible bond as the Companys share price had not exceeded the level required for the convertible conditions attached to the bond to trigger conversion into shares.
Underlying earnings per share is calculated using Underlying Profit adjusted for underlying taxation see note 7.
Underlying Profit is the pre-tax EPRA earnings measure, with additional Company adjustments.
No Company adjustments were made in either the current or prior year.

The net asset value and number of shares for each performance measure are shown below.
A reconciliation between IFRS net assets and EPRA net assets, and the relevant number of shares for each performance measure, is shown within the supplementary disclosures Table B. EPRA net assets is a proportionally consolidated measure that is based on IFRS net assets excluding the mark-to-market on derivatives and related debt adjustments, the mark-to-market on the convertible bonds as well as deferred taxation on property and derivative valuations.
They include the valuation surplus on trading properties and are adjusted for the dilutive impact of share options.
In the prior year EPRA NAV and EPRA NNNAV did not include the dilutive impact of the 2012 convertible bond, as the Groups share price was below the exchange price of 693 pence.
