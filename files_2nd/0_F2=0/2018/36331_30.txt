NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Accounting policies Accounting policies applicable throughout the financial statements are shown below.
Accounting policies that are specific to a component of the financial statements have been incorporated in the relevant note.
a Basis of preparation Grainger plc is a company incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
It is a public limited liability company listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries, together referred to as the Group, and equity account the Groups interest in joint ventures and associates.
The parent company financial statements present information about the Company and not the Group.
The Group financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2018 have been prepared in accordance with EU endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards EU IFRS, IFRIC interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Company has prepared its company financial statements in accordance withFinancial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101, which are presented on pages 140 to 148.
The accounting policies set out below and in the notes to the financial statements have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in the Group financial statements.
No new accounting policies have been adopted in the yearand there has been no change to the basis of accounting estimates in the year.
The Group financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for the following assets and liabilities, and corresponding income statement accounts, which are stated at their fair value: investment property: derivative financial instruments: and financial interest in property assets.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with EU IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the events and amounts involved, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed in Note 2.
Going concern The Directors are required to make an assessment of the Groups ability to continue to trade as a going concern for the foreseeable future.
The Directors have given this matter due consideration and have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the Group financial statements on a going concern basis.
The main considerations were as follows: i Covenant compliance The Directors have reviewed the Groups financial projections covering a minimum period of at least 12 months beyond the date of signing of these financial statements, which include covenant compliance forecasts.
These projections show that the Group will meet its covenant requirements.
ii Banking facilities The Directors have reviewed the available headroom on the Group.
Cash flow projections confirm that the Group will remain within its facilities for a minimum period of at least 12 months beyond the date of signing of these financial statements.
On this basis the Directors consider the Group will be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due for a period of at least 12 months from the date these financial statements were approved and have prepared the financial statements on a going concern basis.
b Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control.
The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are fide-consolidated from the date control ceases.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
92 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic report Governance Financial Statements Other information ii Joint ventures and associates Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.
Where the Group owns less than 50% of the voting rights but acts as property and or asset manager an assessment is made as to whether or not the Group has fide facto control over an investee.
This includes a review of the Groups rights relative to those of another investor or investors and the ability the Group has to direct the investees relevant activities further detail is provided in Note 19.
Investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the Groups share of the profit or loss after the date of acquisition.
The joint venture and associate results for the 12 months to 30 September 2018 and the financial position as at that date have beenequity accounted in these financial statements.
The Groups share of its joint ventures and associates post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the income statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in other comprehensive income.
Where the Groups interest has been reduced to nil, additional losses are provided for, and a liability is recognised, only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture or associate.
The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures and associates are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in joint ventures and associates.
The accounting policies of joint ventures and associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
iii Business combinations At the time of acquisition, the Group considers whether each acquisition represents the acquisition of a business or the acquisition of an asset.
The Group accounts for an acquisition as a business combination where an integrated set of activities are acquired in addition to the property.
When the acquisition of a subsidiary does not represent a business, it is accounted for as an acquisition of assets and liabilities.
The cost of acquisition is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based on their fair values, and no goodwill or deferred tax is recognised.
iv Goodwill and impairment Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given and equity instruments issued.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable assets, including intangible assets, of the acquired entity at the date of acquisition.
If the cost of the acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Costs attributable to an acquisition of a business are expensed in the consolidated income statement under the heading Other expenses.
Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is included within this caption in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Goodwill on acquisition of joint ventures and associates is included in investments in joint ventures and associates.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of impairment testing and is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 93 Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1.
Accounting policies continued c Adoption of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards and interpretations An amendment to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows was issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB in January 2016 and came into effect for the Group in the current financial year.
Under the new guidelines, the Group is required to provide a reconciliation between the opening and closing balances for liabilities arising from financing activities.
This reconciliation has been presented in Note 27.
In accordance with IAS 7, no comparative information for preceding periods is required upon first application of the new requirements.
A number of new standards and amendments to standards have been issued but are not yet effective for the Group.
The most significant of these, and their potential impact on the Groups accounting, are set out below: i IAS 40 Investment Property effective 1 October 2018 The amendment to IAS 40 widens the scope for transfers to and from investment property.
Previously the standard provided an exhaustive list to evidence a change in use that would permit a transfer.
This is now a non-exhaustive list of examples of circumstances that could represent a propertys change in use.
A change in managements intention does not alone constitute a change in use.
Transfers to and from investment property can only occur when the property meets or ceases to meet the definition of an investment property and there is evidence of change in use.
On transition, the Group is required to assess property classifications across its entire portfolio held at the effective date 1 October 2018 and, if applicable, reclassify property to reflect the conditions as at that date.
A review of the Groups property portfolio held as at 30 September 2018 has been undertaken.
Trading property with a cost of 75.9m and market value of 78.8m has been identified as requiring reclassification to investment property.
There have been no properties identified that are classified as investment property that would be reclassified as trading property.
There will be limited impact to the market value balance sheet and related metrics including EPRA NAV, EPRA NNNAV and LTV as these already reflect the market value of properties.
There will however be a valuation uplift of 2.9m taken through the statutory income statement, impacting statutory net profit before and after tax, as well as statutory earnings per share.
The adjusted earnings of the Group, a non-statutory measure, will not be impacted.
ii IFRS 9 Financial Instruments effective 1 October 2018 IFRS 9 replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, which is currently used by the Group.
The new standard sets out the classification, recognition and measurement requirements for financial assets and liabilities, impairment provisioning and general hedge accounting.
The key changes that will follow the adoption of this standard are: classification of financial assets according to their contractual cash flow characteristics: impairments of financial assets based on prospective expected credit losses rather than retrospective objective evidence of impairment: changes to hedge accounting effectiveness testing: and changes to disclosures 94 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic report Governance Financial Statements Other information Classification, recognition and measurement of financial assets and liabilities The standard applies to the Groups financial assets consisting of CHARM, receivables, derivatives and cash, as well as financial liabilities consisting of borrowings, payables and derivatives.
IFRS 9 retains almost all of the existing classification, recognition and measurement requirements of IAS 39 on financial liabilities and will not have an impact on the Groups financial liabilities for financial results and reporting.
For financial assets, the permissible measurement bases are now amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI and fair value through profit and loss FVTPL.
IFRS 9 has abolished the held to maturity loans and receivables and availablefor-sale classifications that were previously available under IAS 39.
CHARM is therefore impacted by this change as it is currently classified as an available-for-sale asset.
As a result, CHARM will need to be reclassified from available-for-sale to FVTPL.
The implication of the reclassification is that the fair value difference between the updated projected cashflows using the effective interest rate applicable at acquisition compared to the year-end effective interest rate will now be taken through the statutory income statement as opposed to other comprehensive income.
This will impact statutory net profit before and after tax, as well as statutory earnings per share.
This will not impact the Groups adjusted earnings, statutory net assets, EPRA NAV, EPRA NNNAV or LTV as the fair value and deferred tax positions remain unchanged.
IFRS 9 has retrospective application, which requires the new standard to be applied to transactions as if those requirements had always been applied.
There are however exceptions from the requirement to restate comparatives, allowing the accounting to be reflected in the year of adoption which the Group will utilise.
Effective 1 October 2018, the Group will transfer 6.0m from the available-for-sale reserve to retained earnings, on transition to the new standard.
Expected credit loss model of impairment The new standard no longer requires a loss event to occur before an impairment to financial assets is recognised.
IFRS 9 requires an entity to recognise an expected credit loss, being the present value of all cash shortfalls over the expected life of the entitys various financial assets.
Of the Groups financial assets, the standard will apply to trade receivables.
Trade receivables held at 30 September 2018 were 2.3m, with an impairment provision recognised under IAS 39 of 0.5m.
Management have assessed the impact of impairment losses were the new standard to be applied at 30 September 2018, utilising both historical data and forward-looking macro-economic information.
Based upon this assessment, the Group would have recognised an impairment provision of 0.5m at 30 September 2018 under IFRS 9.
Given that the provision is broadly consistent on transition, the expected credit loss model will not have a material effect on the remainder of the financial assets held by the Group.
Hedge accounting Hedge accounting continues to be optional under the new standard, though the removal of the 80-125% test in favour of a more principles-based approach allows greater scope for entities to hedge account.
The current hedge relationships in place for the Group as at 30 September 2018 for interest rate swaps will qualify as continuing hedges upon adoption of the new standard.
No other derivative instruments are expected to be designated as hedging relationships under IFRS 9.
As a result, there will be no quantitative impact on the results of the Group.
Disclosures IFRS 9 will require new disclosures, particularly around credit risk and expected credit losses.
The relevant disclosures will be presented in the notes to the financial statements upon adoption of the new standard.
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 95 Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1.
Accounting policies continued iii IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers effective 1 October 2018 IFRS 15 replaces IAS 11 Construction Contracts and IAS 18 Revenue, both of which are currently used by the Group.
The new standard sets out a five-step model for the recognition of revenue and establishes the principles to apply to the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from a contract with a customer.
The key changes that will follow the adoption of this standard are: identifying performance obligations based on contracts with customers and recognising revenue either at a point in time or over time in accordance with the performance obligations: and increased revenue disclosures that arise from contracts with customers.
Revenue recognition This standard applies to Graingers revenue including proceeds from disposal of trading and investment property, property and asset management fees and revenue from construction contracts.
It does not apply to gross rental income or CHARM revenue which as at the date of reporting are covered by IAS 17 and IAS 39 respectively.
The revenue recognition point for the Groups revenue streams impacted by the standard is not expected to differ following the adoption of the new standard.
As a result, the effects of the new standard will be immaterial to the Groups financial results.
Disclosures IFRS 15 will require new qualitative disclosures and the relevant disclosures will be presented in the notes to the financial statements upon adoption of the new standard.
iv IFRS 16 Leases effective 1 October 2019 IFRS 16 replaces IAS 17 Leases which is currently used by the Group.
The standard sets out the criteria to recognise, measure, present and disclose leases.
The key changes that will follow the adoption of this standard are: a single lessee accounting model that removes the distinction between operating and finance leases.
The previous off-balance sheet financing permitted by operating leases will now be brought on balance sheet by recognising the asset and corresponding liability: and the standard includes two recognition exemptions for lessees leases of low-value assets and short-term leases.
As a lessor, the Groups position is substantially unchanged.
As a lessee of office space, the assets and the corresponding lease liabilities will now be required to be measured and presented on the balance sheet and in the notes to the financial statements.
Although these leases are currently off-balance sheet, they will have an immaterial impact on the overall net assets and the consolidated income statement of the Group.
Of the other IFRSs that are available for early adoption, none are expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The Groups significant accounting policies are stated in the relevant notes to the Group financial statements.
The preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Groups accounting policies.
It also requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets andliabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis with revisions recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in anyfuture periods affected.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity are set out below.
96 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic report Governance Financial Statements Other information Estimates 1 Valuation of property assets Residential trading property is carried in the statement of financial position at the lower of cost and net realisable value and investment property is carried at fair value.
The Group does, however, in its principal non-GAAP net asset value measures, EPRA NAV and EPRA NNNAV, include trading property at market value.
The adjustment in the value of trading property is the difference between the statutory book value and its market value as set out in Note 5.
For investment property, market value is the same as fair value.
In respect of trading properties, market valuation is the key assumption in determining the net realisable value of those properties.
The results and the basis of each valuation and their impact on both the statutory financial statements and market value for the Groups non-GAAP net asset value measures are set out below: % of properties for which external Financial valuer Residential Development Others assets Total provides Notes m m m m m Valuer valuation Trading property 756.5 42.8 799.3 Investment property 589.7 589.7 Financial asset CHARM 82.2 82.2 Total statutory book value 1,346.2 42.8 82.2 1,471.2 Trading property Residential i 952.6 952.6 Allsop LLP 71% GInvest ii 369.5 369.5 Allsop LLP 100% Developments iii 38.1 46.2 84.3 CBRE Limited 83% Total trading property 1,360.2 46.2 1,406.4 Investment property Residential i 153.9 153.9 Allsop LLP 71% Tricomm Housing iv 121.4 121.4 Allsop LLP 100% Affordable housing v 50.8 50.8 Allsop LLP 100% PRS build to rent vi 263.6 263.6 CBRE Limited 98% Total investment property 589.7 589.7 1 Financial asset CHARM vii 82.2 82.2 Allsop LLP Total assets at market value 1,949.9 46.2 82.2 2,078.3 Statutory book value 1,346.2 42.8 82.2 1,471.2 2 Market value adjustment 603.7 3.4 607.1 Total assets at market value 1,949.9 46.2 82.2 2,078.3 Net revaluation gain recognised in the income statement for wholly-owned properties 22.6 22.6 Net revaluation gain relating to joint ventures 3 and associates viii 5.1 5.1 3 Net revaluation gain recognised in the year 22.6 5.1 27.7 1 Allsop provide vacant possession values used by the Directors to value the financial asset in accordance with the accounting policy set out in Note 21.

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 97 Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued i Residential The Groups own in-house qualified team provided a vacant possession value for the majority of the Groups UK residential properties as at 30 September 2018.
A structured sample of these in-house valuations was reviewed by Allsop LLP, an external independent valuer.
Valuing the large number of properties in this portfolio is a significant task.
For this reason it is undertaken on an external inspection basis only.
Invariably, when the in-house valuations are compared with those of the external valuer, around 72% of the valuations are within a small acceptable tolerance.
Where the difference is more significant, this is discussed with the valuer to determine the reasons for the difference.
Typically, the reasons vary, but it could be, for example, that further or better information about internal condition is available or that respective valuers have placed a different interpretation on comparable sales.
Once such reasons have been identified, the Group and the valuer agree the appropriate valuation that should be adopted as the Directors Valuation.
Allsop LLP has provided the Directors with the following opinion on the Directors Valuation.
Property held in the Residential Portfolio was valued as at 30 September 2018 by Graingers in-house surveyors.
These valuations were reviewed and approved by the Directors.
Allsop LLP has undertaken a comprehensive review of the Directors Valuation and they are satisfied with the process by which the in-house valuations were conducted.
Allsop LLP valued approximately 80% of the Residential Portfolio, independently of the Group.
Based on the results of that review, Allsop LLP has concluded that they have a high degree of confidence in those Directors Valuations.
Allsop LLP also recommends a discount to apply to the vacant possession valuations to establish the market value of each property.
For property in the Residential Portfolio, the discounts are established by tenancy type and are based on evidence gathered by Allsop LLP from recent transactional market evidence.
The Directors have adopted the discounts recommended by Allsop LLP.
ii GInvest All of the property owned by the Group in the GInvest portfolio was valued as at 30 September 2018 by Allsop LLP.
The market value of the properties subject to the assumption that the dwellings would be sold individually, which is deemed to be the highest and best use, in their existing condition, and subject to any existing leases or tenancies was provided by Allsop LLP.
Thevaluers opinion of market value was primarily derived using comparable recent market transactions on arms-length terms.
iii Developments The current market value of the Groups land and property held within the development segment has been assessed by CBRE Limited, external independent valuers.
Their valuation, representing 83% of the total value of development trading stock, ison the basis of fair value as defined in the RICS Professional Valuation Standards where fair value is the same as market value.
Theremaining 17% of the portfolio is a Directors Valuation.
iv Tricomm Housing Allsop LLP provided an investment valuation as at 30 September 2018 for the property assets owned by the Group and let under a long-term lease arrangement with the Secretary of State for Defence under a PFI project agreement.
The investment valuation is in accordance with RICS Professional Valuation Standards, and is based on a discounted cash flow model.
Significant unobservable inputs within the valuation relate to assumptions for house price inflation and the discount rates to apply to the cash flows.
The assumptions adopted for house price inflation are 2.00% in 2019, 2.75% in 2020, 3.00% in 2021, 2022 and 2023 and 2.75% thereafter.
The discount rates applied to the cash flows range between 3.55% and 8.75%.
v Affordable housing For properties let on affordable rents, social rents or sold on shared ownership leases, Allsop LLP valued the assets on the basis of Existing Use Value for Social Housing EUV-SH in line with RICS Global Standards.
Properties subject to intermediate rents have been valued at market value as these assets are not restricted as social housing in perpetuity.
98 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic report Governance Financial Statements Other information vi PRS build-to-rent assets CBRE Limited assessed the fair value of the completed assets and assets in the course of construction.
The principal approach was to value the apartments on an income capitalisation basis, having regard to prevailing market conditions and evidence, and with close regard to the relativity between the market value and the aggregate vacant possession value.
Where applicable, estimated costs required tocomplete construction have been taken into account.
The valuation has been prepared in accordance with RICS Professional Valuation Standards where fair value is the same as market value.
vii Financial asset CHARM The valuation methodology adopted for the CHARM asset is set out in Note 21 to the financial statements.
The key assumptions affecting the carrying value are house price inflation and the discount rate.
The assumptions used to value theasset adopt an increase in house prices of between 2.85% and 3.85% per annum.
A discount rate of 3.5% has been applied to the interest income and a rate of 6.5% has been applied to the projected proceeds from sales of the underlying properties, reflecting the risk profile of each individual income stream.
The fair value of the interest changes as cash flows are realised and a decrease of 0.5m 2017: 1.0m in the fair value has been recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income and the available-for-sale reserve.
Credit risk arises from the credit exposure relating to cash receipts from the financial instrument.
All of the cash receipts are payable by the Church Commissioners, a counterparty considered to be low risk as they have no history of past due or impaired amounts and there are no past due amounts outstanding at the year end.
viii Joint ventures and associates Property assets in the associate GRIP REIT PLC were valued at 30 September 2018 by CBRE Limited.
The market value of the properties takes into account whether the block is managed as a whole or as a group of individual units and valued accordingly.
Valuation on the basis of how the properties are managed is deemed to be the highest and best use of property.
The valuation of properties under construction assesses the market value of the property upon completion less estimated cost of work to complete and where appropriate, an adjustment to take into account the remaining construction and stabilisation risks.
The Directors consider the valuations provided by external valuers to be representative of fair value.
As required by RICS Professional Valuation Standards, the external valuers in the UK mentioned above have made full disclosureof the extent and duration of their work for, and fees earned by them from, the Group, which in all cases are less than 5%oftheir total fees.
2 Net realisable value of trading property The Groups residential trading properties are carried in the consolidated statement of financial position at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the net sales proceeds which the Group expects on sale of a property with vacant possession.
The Group has a net realisable value provision of 7.8m as at 30 September 2018 2017: 8.1m.
The provision includes specific properties which are vacant and properties expected to become vacant in the future.
3 Derivative financial instruments Fair value measurements for derivative financial instruments are obtained from quoted market prices and or valuation models asappropriate.
When not directly observable in active markets, the fair value of derivative contracts are computed internally based on internal assumptions as well as directly observable market information, including forward and yield curves for commodities, currencies and interest.
Changes in internal assumptions and forward curves could materially impact the internally computed fair value of derivative contracts, particularly long-term contracts, resulting in a corresponding impact on income or loss in the consolidated income statement.
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 99 Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued Changes to key assumptions could impact both income and financial position.
The impact of changes to key assumptions is considered for assets using a range of reasonable changes.
The Group measures its market risk exposure internally by running various sensitivity analyses.
The Directors consider that the range of potential movements set out in the table below represent reasonable possible changes.
The table below sets out potential impacts that may result from changes to certain assumptions: 2018 2017 Statement Statement Income of financial Income of financial statement position statement position impact impact impact impact m m m m Increase of 2% in house prices GRIP 3.4 3.4 3.4 3.4 Decrease of 2% in house prices GRIP 3.4 3.4 3.4 3.4 Increase of 2% in house prices NRV provision 0.9 0.9 1.0 1.0 Decrease of 2% in house prices NRV provision 1.1 1.1 1.1 1.1 Increase of 25bps in HPI rate CHARM 0.2 1.2 0.2 1.3 Decrease of 25bps in HPI rate CHARM 0.2 1.2 0.2 1.3 Increase of 1% in discount rate CHARM 5.5 5.9 Decrease of 1% in discount rate CHARM 6.2 6.6 Increase of 25bps in discount rate Tricomm Housing 2.2 2.2 2.3 2.3 Decrease of 25bps in discount rate Tricomm Housing 2.3 2.3 2.3 2.3 Increase of 25bps in HPI rate Tricomm Housing 1.9 1.9 1.7 1.7 Decrease of 25bps in HPI rate Tricomm Housing 1.8 1.8 1.7 1.7 Increase of 25bps in gross yield PRS build-to-rent 2.9 2.9 1.3 1.3 Decrease of 25bps in gross yield PRS build-to-rent 3.3 3.3 1.4 1.4 Judgements 1 Distinction between investment and trading property The Group considers the intention at the outset when each property is acquired in order to classify the property as either an investment or a trading property.
Where the intention is either to trade the property or where the property is held for immediate saleupon receiving vacant possession within the ordinary course of business, the property is classified as trading property.
Where the intention is to hold the property for its long-term rental yield and or capital appreciation, the property is classified as an investment property.
The classification of the Groups properties is a significant judgement which directly impacts the statutory net asset position, as trading properties are held at the lower of cost and net realisable value, whilst investment properties are held at fair value, with gains or losses taken through the consolidated income statement.
2 Adjusted earnings Adjusted earnings is one of Graingers key performance indicators.
The metric is utilised as a key measure to aid understanding of theperformance of the continuing business and excludes valuation movements and other adjustments that are considered to be one-off in nature, which do not form part of the normal ongoing revenue or costs of the business and, either individually or in aggregate, are material tothe reported Group results.
The classification of other adjustments is a significant judgement made by management and isa matter referred to the Audit Committee for approval.
Other adjustments in 2018 comprise costs in relation to the redemption of the previous corporate bond of 27.4m, being 25.8m gross prepayment cost and 1.6m expense of unamortised costs.
In 2017, 2.8m other adjustments were recorded, being a provision for historic non-core businesses of 1.6m and costs in relation to the implementation of strategic operations of 1.2m.

Discontinued operations Accounting policy A discontinued operation is a component of the Groups business, the operations and cash flows of which can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the Group and which: represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations: is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations: or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to re-sale.
Classification as a discontinued operation occurs at the earlier of disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held-for-sale.
For the discontinued operation, the comparable income statement and other comprehensive income is re-presented as if the operation had been discontinued from the start of the comparative year.
The 2017 comparatives presented represent activities relating to the disposal of the remaining assets and in winding down the remaining business in Germany.

Analysis of profit before tax The table below provides adjusted earnings, which is one of Graingers key performance indicators.
The metric is utilised as a key measure to aid understanding of the performance of the continuing business and excludes valuation movements and other adjustments previously non-recurring, that are one-off in nature, which do not form part of the normal ongoing revenue or costs of the business and, either individually or in aggregate, are material to the reported Group results.

Segmental information Accounting policy IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires operating segments to be identified based upon the Groups internal reporting to the ChiefOperating Decision Maker CODM so that the CODM can make decisions about resources to be allocated to segments andassess their performance.
The Groups CODM is the Chief Executive.
The three significant segments for continuing operations are Residential, Development and Funds.
The title Other has been included in the tables below to reconcile the segments to the figures reviewed by the CODM and includes certain central costs that cannot be allocated to the operating segments.
The key operating performance measure of profit or loss used by the CODM is adjusted earnings before tax, valuation and other adjustments.
The CODM reviews by segment two key statement of financial position measures of net asset value.
These are EPRA Net Asset Value EPRA NAV and EPRA Triple Net Asset Value EPRA NNNAV.
Information relating to the Groups operating segments is set out in the tables below.
The tables distinguish between adjusted earnings, valuation and other adjustments and should be read in conjunction with Note 4.

Tax Accounting policy The taxation charge for the year represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The charge is recognised in the income statement and statement of comprehensive income according to the accounting treatment of the related transaction.
Current tax payable or receivable is based on the taxable income for the period and any adjustment in respect of prior periods and is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.
Tax payable upon the realisation of revaluation gains recognised in prior periods is recorded as a current tax charge with a release of the associated deferred tax.
Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will give rise to a future tax liability against which the deferred tax assets can be recovered.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.

The Group works in an open and transparent manner and maintains a regular dialogue with HM Revenue and Customs.
This approach is consistent with the low risk rating we have been awarded by HM Revenue and Customs, and to which the Group is committed.
The Groups results for this year are taxed at an effective rate of 19.0% 2017: 19.5%.
The tax charge for the year is different to the charge for the year derived by applying the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 19.0% 2017: 19.5% to the profit before tax.
The differences are explained below: 2018 2017 m m Profit before tax including discontinued operations 100.7 87.8 Profit before tax at a rate of 19.0% 2017: 19.5% 19.1 17.1 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 1.7 1.7 Share of joint ventures associates after tax 1.0 0.8 Revaluation of investment properties and indexation allowance 4.2 Difference between tax and accounting profit on disposal of fixed assets and investments 1.6 0.4 Adjustment in respect of prior periods 3.9 4.5 Amounts recognised in the income statement 13.3 13.1 110 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic report Governance Financial Statements Other information In addition to the above, a deferred tax charge of 0.6m 2017: 2.6m was recognised within other comprehensive income comprising: 2018 2017 m m Deferred tax Actuarial deficit on BPT Limited pension scheme 0.1 0.8 Equity component of available-for-sale financial asset 0.1 0.2 Fair value movement in cash flow hedges and exchange adjustments 0.6 2.0 Amounts recognised in other comprehensive income 0.6 2.6 Deferred tax balances comprise temporary differences attributable to: 2018 2017 m m Deferred tax assets Accelerated capital allowances 0.3 Short-term temporary differences 3.1 4.2 Losses carried forward 4.5 Actuarial deficit on BPT Limited pension scheme 0.3 0.2 Fair value movement in derivative financial instruments and cumulative exchange adjustments 0.5 3.4 9.7 Deferred tax liabilities Trading property uplift to fair value on business combinations 9.3 10.3 Investment property revaluation 18.6 20.7 Short-term temporary differences 0.8 0.4 Equity component of available-for-sale financial asset 1.1 1.2 Fair value movement in derivative financial instruments and cumulative exchange adjustments 0.1 29.9 32.6 Total deferred tax 26.5 22.9 Deferred tax has been predominantly calculated at a rate of 17% 2017: 17% in line with changes to the main rate of corporation tax from 1 April 2020 which have been substantively enacted.
In addition to the tax amounts shown above, contingent tax based on EPRA market value measures being tax on the difference between the carrying value of trading properties in the statement of financial position and their market value has not been recognised by the Group.
This contingent tax amounts to 103.2m 2017: 109.8m.
It is not possible for the Group to identify the timing of movements in deferred tax between those expected within one year andthose expected in a period greater than one year.
This is because movements in the main balances, both assets and liabilities, will be determined by factors outside the control of the Group, namely the vacation date of properties and interest yield curve movements.
However, given the long-term nature of our property ownership, we anticipate that the balance will predominantly be crystallised in a period greater than one year.

Dividends Accounting policy Dividends are recognised through equity when approved by the Companys shareholders or on payment, whichever is earlier.
Dividends paid in the year are shown below: 2018 2017 m m Ordinary dividends on equity shares: Final dividend for the year ended 30 September 2016 3.05p per share 12.7 Interim dividend for the year ended 30 September 2017 1.60p per share 6.6 Final dividend for the year ended 30 September 2017 3.26p per share 13.6 Interim dividend for the year ended 30 September 2018 1.74p per share 7.2 20.8 19.3 Subject to approval at the AGM, the final dividend of 3.52p per share gross amounting to 14.7m will be paid on 11 February 2019 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 14 December 2018.
Shareholders will again be offered the option to participate in a dividend reinvestment plan and the last day for election is 18 January 2019.
An interim dividend of 1.74p per share amounting to a total of 7.2m was paid to shareholders on 5 July 2018.
Earnings per share Accounting policy Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to the owners of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares purchased by the Group and held both in Trust and as treasury shares to meet its obligations under the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP, Deferred Bonus Plan DBP and Save As You Earn SAYE scheme, on which the dividends are being waived.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares in issue by the dilutive effect of ordinary shares that the Company may potentially issue relating to its share option schemes and contingent share awards under the LTIP and DBP, based upon the number of shares that would be issued if 30 September 2018 was the end of the contingency period.
Where the effect of the above adjustments is antidilutive, they are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share 30 September 2018 30 September 2017 Weighted Weighted average average Profit for number of Earnings Profit for number of Earnings the year shares per share the year shares per share m millions pence m millions pence Basic earnings per share continuing and discontinued operations Profit attributable to equity holders 87.4 416.3 21.0 74.7 415.6 18.0 Effect of potentially dilutive securities Share options and contingent shares 2.1 0.1 2.3 0.1 Diluted earnings per share continuing and discontinued operations Profit attributable to equity holders 87.4 418.4 20.9 74.7 417.9 17.9 Basic earnings per share continuing operations only Profit attributable to equity holders 87.4 416.3 21.0 73.5 415.6 17.7 Effect of potentially dilutive securities Share options and contingent shares 2.1 0.1 2.3 0.1 Diluted earnings per share continuing operations only Profit attributable to equity holders 87.4 418.4 20.9 73.5 417.9 17.6 112 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic report Governance Financial Statements Other information 17.
Investment property Accounting policy Property that is held for long-term rental yields or for capital appreciation or both, and that is not occupied by the companies in the consolidated Group, is classified as investment property.
Investment property is measured initially at its cost, including related transaction costs.
After initial recognition, investment property is carried at fair value.
Fair value is based on active market prices, adjusted, if necessary, for any difference in the nature, location or condition of the specified asset.
If this information is not available, the Group uses alternative valuation methods such as recent prices on less active markets or discounted cash flow projections.
Investment property falls within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as defined by IFRS 13.
Further details are given in Note 28.
Subsequent expenditure is included in the carrying amount of the property when it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other repair and maintenance costs are charged to the consolidated income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the Groups investment properties are included in the consolidated income statement of the period in which they arise.
Where specific investment properties are expected to sell within the next 12 months their fair value is shown under assets classified as held-for-sale within current assets.
Any loss on the reclassification of these assets from investment properties to assets held-for-sale is charged to the consolidated income statement of the period in which this occurs.

Financial interest in property assets CHARM portfolio Accounting policy The CHARM portfolio is a financial interest in equity mortgages held by the Church of England Pensions Board as mortgagee.
It is accounted for under IAS 39 in accordance with the designation available-for-sale financial assets and is carried at fair value.
Itisinitially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs and subsequently carried at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the net change in value recorded is as follows: i the carrying value of the assets is increased by the effective interest rate: ii cash received from the instrument in the year is deducted from the carrying value of the assets: and iii the carrying value of the assets is revised to the net present value of the updated projected cash flows arising from the instrument using the effective interest rate applicable at acquisition.
The change in value arising from i and iii above is recorded through the consolidated income statement and is shown on the line Income from financial interest in property assets.
Differences between the updated projected cash flows using the effective interest rate applicable at acquisition compared to updated projected cash flows using a year end effective interest rate, assessed as the rate available in the market for an instrumentwith a similar maturity and credit risk, are taken through other comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the assets.
When gains or losses in the assets are realised, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognisedin equity are included in the consolidated income statement as gains and losses from financial interest in property assets.

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 117 Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 22.
Intangible assets Accounting policy Intangible assets comprise computer software and goodwill.
Computer software is amortised on a straight-line basis over 5-7 years being the estimated useful lives of the assets, from the date they are available for use.
Amortisation is charged to the consolidated income statement.
Goodwill is tested for impairment based on a value in use calculation at each reporting date.
Inventories Accounting policy Tenanted residential properties held-for-sale in the normal course of business are shown in the financial statements as a current asset at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes legal and surveying charges and introducer fees incurred during acquisition together with improvement costs.
Land and property held within the development segment of the business are shown in the financial statements at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost represents the acquisition price including legal and other professional costs associated with the acquisition together with subsequent development costs net of amounts transferred to costs of sale.
Net realisable value is the expected sales proceeds that the Group expects on sale of a property or current market value net of associated selling costs.
2018 2017 m m Residential trading property 756.5 797.6 Development trading property 42.8 43.7 799.3 841.3 It is not possible for the Group to identify which properties will be sold within the next 12 months.
The size of the Groups property portfolio does result in a relatively predictable vacancy rate.
However, it is not possible to predict in advance the specific properties that will become vacant.
Trading property is shown as a current asset in the consolidated statement of financial position.
The Group has an obligation, under an agreement for sale in relation to its land at West Waterlooville, to pay further consideration should the site value exceed certain pre-agreed amounts.
It also has an obligation under a profit sharing agreement to share profits above an agreed threshold.
It is not possible to determine the amount or timing of any such future payments due to the long-term nature of the sites development and the associated uncertainties.
However, our current best estimate is that the earliest payment under these arrangements will not be before October 2019 and any payments are likely to be spread over a number of years.
Amounts relating to inventories that have been recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement are as follows: 2018 2017 m m Carrying value of trading property sold Note 8 85.1 100.6 Carrying value of construction contract expenses Note 8 34.0 26.9 Impairment of inventories to net realisable value 0.5 5.4 118 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic report Governance Financial Statements Other information 24.
Trade and other receivables Accounting policy Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment in trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate.
The movement in the provision is recognised in the consolidated income statement.

Other receivables includes 15.6m 2017: 29.0m due from land sales, which is receivable no later than July 2019.
The fair values of trade and other receivables are considered to be equal to their carrying amounts.
The credit quality of financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired is discussed in Note 28 Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments.
Provisions for other liabilities and charges Accounting policy Provisions are recognised when: i the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event: ii it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation: and iii a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Accounting policy Borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of consideration received, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the consolidated income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the consolidated statement of financial position date.
2018 2017 m m Current liabilities Non-bank financial institution 1.1 1.1 1.1 1.1 Non-current liabilities Bank loans Pounds Sterling 533.4 637.7 Bank loans Euros 0.9 6.2 Non-bank financial institution 79.8 7.6 Corporate bond 346.0 273.1 960.1 924.6 Total interest-bearing loans and borrowings 961.2 925.7 a Bank loans Sterling bank loans include variable rate loans bearing interest at rates between 1.6% and 1.8% above LIBOR and Euro bank loans include variable rate loans bearing interest at a rate of 1.6% above EURIBOR.
The weighted average variable interest rate on bank loans as at 30 September 2018 was 2.4% 2017: 2.0%.
Bank loans are secured by fixed and floating charges over specific property and other assets of the Group.
Unamortised costs in relation to bank loans of 6.6m 2017: 7.2m will be amortised over the life of the loans to which they relate.
b Non-bank financial institution 7.6m is funded by a loan from Homes England and bears interest at 1% over the European Commission reference rate applicable to the UK.
The remaining 75.0m is funded by a fixed rate loan from Rothesay Life PLC, at a rate of 2.8%.
Unamortised costs in relation to the fixed rate loan of 1.7m 2017: nil will be amortised over the life of the loan.
c Corporate bond A new 350.0m, 3.375% corporate bond was issued at 99.588% in April 2018.
The discount on issuance is being amortised to the consolidated income statement using an effective interest basis.
Unamortised costs and the outstanding discount in relation to the corporate bond are, in total, 4.0m and will be amortised over the remaining life of the bond.
The unamortised costs and the outstanding premium in relation to the previous 275.0m corporate bond were amortised up until the date of redemption at which point the remaining balance of 1.6m was expensed to the consolidated income statement.
d Other loans and borrowings information The above analyses of loans and borrowings are net of unamortised loan issue costs and the discount on issuance of the corporate bond.
As at 30 September 2018, unamortised costs totalled 10.9m 2017: 9.6m and the outstanding discount was 1.4m 2017: a premium of 0.4m.

Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments Accounting policies Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative instruments to help manage its interest rate risk.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group doesnot hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes.
Derivatives are classified as current assets and current liabilities.
The derivatives are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequently, the gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement, unless the derivatives qualify for cash flow hedge accounting, and have been designated as such, in which case any gain or loss is taken to equity in a cash flow hedge reserve via other comprehensive income.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document in advance the relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument.
The Group is also required to demonstrate that the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis.
This effectiveness testing is re-performed at each period end to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecasted transaction is ultimately recognised in the consolidated income statement.
When a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was recognised in equity is immediately transferred to the consolidated income statement.
Fair value estimation The fair values of interest rate derivatives are based on a discounted cash flow model using market information.
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 121 Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 28.
Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities Derecognition is the point at which the Group removes an asset or liability from its consolidated statement of financial position.
The Groups policy is to derecognise financial assets only when the contractual right to the cash flows from the financial asset expires.
The Group also derecognises financial assets that it transfers to another party provided that the transfer of the asset also transfers theright to receive cash flows from the financial asset.
When the transfer does not result in the Group transferring the right to receive cash flows from the financial asset but it does result in the Group assuming a corresponding obligation to pay cash flows toanother recipient, the financial asset is derecognised.
The Group derecognises financial liabilities only when its obligation is discharged, is cancelled or expires.
Financial assets classified as available-for-sale are the financial interest in property assets.
Derivative financial instruments not in hedge accounting relationships are classified as fair value through profit and loss.
Categories of financial instruments A summary of the classifications of the financial assets and liabilities held by the Group is set out in the following table: 2018 Loans and Assets at receivables fair value cash and through Derivatives Total cash profit used for Availablebook Fair value m equivalents and loss hedging for-sale value adjustment Fair value Non-current assets Financial interest in property assets 82.2 82.2 82.2 Current assets Trade and other receivables excluding prepayments 148.6 148.6 148.6 Derivative financial instruments 0.2 4.2 4.4 4.4 Cash and cash equivalents 109.3 109.3 109.3 Total financial assets 257.9 0.2 4.2 82.2 344.5 344.5 2018 Loans and Liabilities at Other receivables fair value financial cash and through Derivatives liabilities at Total cash profit used for amortised book Fair value m equivalents and loss hedging cost value adjustment Fair value Non-current liabilities Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 960.1 960.1 3.4 963.5 Current liabilities Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 1.1 1.1 1.1 Trade and other payables 70.7 70.7 70.7 Derivative financial instruments 3.4 3.4 3.4 Total financial liabilities 3.4 1,031.9 1,035.3 3.4 1,038.7 Net financial assets liabilities 257.9 0.2 0.8 949.7 690.8 3.4 694.2 122 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic report Governance Financial Statements Other information 2017 Loans and Assets at receivables fair value cash and through Derivatives Total cash profit used for Availablebook Fair value m equivalents and loss hedging for-sale value adjustment Fair value Non-current assets Financial interest in property assets 86.1 86.1 86.1 Current assets Trade and other receivables excluding prepayments 137.7 137.7 137.7 Derivative financial instruments 0.4 3.0 3.4 3.4 Cash and cash equivalents 88.9 88.9 88.9 Total financial assets 226.6 0.4 3.0 86.1 316.1 316.1 Loans and Liabilities at Other receivables fair value financial cash and through Derivatives liabilities at Total cash profit used for amortised book Fair value m equivalents and loss hedging cost value adjustment Fair value Non-current liabilities Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 924.6 924.6 24.8 949.4 Current liabilities Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 1.1 1.1 1.1 Trade and other payables 48.8 48.8 48.8 Derivative financial instruments 4.9 4.9 4.9 Total financial liabilities 4.9 974.5 979.4 24.8 1,004.2 Net financial assets liabilities 226.6 0.4 1.9 888.4 663.3 24.8 688.1 The fair value difference relates to the Groups corporate bond and the Rothesay Life loan, which are stated at amortised cost in the consolidated statement of financial position.
The fair value of the bond is calculated as 345.5m 2017: 299.8m previous corporate bond based on quoted prices in traded markets.
The fair value of the Rothesay Life loan is calculated as 82.9m 2017: nil based on a discounted cash flow model using observable market rates.
There is no requirement under IAS 39 to revalue these loans to fair value in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Included in cash above is 14.4m 2017: 11.3m relating to cash held on behalf of tenants, leaseholders and clients comprising service charge amounts, sinking fund balances, tenant deposits and cash held on behalf of joint ventures.
These cash amounts are held by the Group in client bank accounts and are excluded from net debt.
In addition, 35.6m 2017: 29.0m of the cash balance is restricted in use by underlying financing arrangements comprising either reserve fund amounts or amounts where the release of cash is contingent upon proof of qualifying expenditure.

Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued Financial risk management The Groups objectives for managing financial risk are to minimise the risk of adverse effects on performance and to ensure the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern while securing access to cost-effective finance and maintaining flexibility to respond quickly to opportunities that arise.
The Groups policies on financial risk management are approved by the Board of Directors and implemented by Group treasury.
Written policies and procedures cover interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments andinvestment of excess liquidity.
Group treasury reports to the Audit Committee.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to financial risk but does not take positions for speculative purposes.
The sources of financial risk and the policies and activities used to mitigate each are discussed below and include credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, which includes interest rate risk, credit availability risk, house price risk in relation to the Tricomm Housing portfolio, the CHARM portfolio and our financial interest in property assets, and capital risk.
Financial risk factors 1 Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss due to a counterpartys failure to honour its obligations.
The Groups principal financial assets include its financial interest in property assets, bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of any collateral obtained.
The Groups financial interest in property assets CHARM relates to a financial interest in equity mortgages held by the Church ofEngland Pensions Board.
The Groups cash receipts are payable by the Church Commissioners, a counterparty considered to be lowrisk as they have no history of past due or impaired amounts and there are no past due amounts outstanding at the year end.
The Group sometimes enters into land sales contracts within the Development division under which a proportion of the consideration is deferred and recognised within other receivables Note 24.
Each purchaser is subject to financial due diligence prior to sale.
The Group also has credit risk relating to trade receivables.
Where it is identified that recovery is doubtful, a provision for impairment is made.
For all assured shorthold tenancies, credit checks are performed prior to acceptance of the tenant.
Regulated tenants are incentivised through the benefit of their tenancy agreement to avoid default on their rent.
Lifetime tenancies are generally at low or zero rent and hence suffer minimal credit risk.
Rent deposits and personal guarantees are held in respect of some leases.
Taking these factors into account, the risk to the Group of individual tenant default and the credit risk of trade receivables are considered low, as is borne out by the low level of trade receivables written off both in this year and in prior years.
Tenant deposits of 2.6m 2017: 2.5m are held that provide some security against rental arrears and property dilapidations caused by the tenant.
The Group does not hold any other collateral as security.
Of the net trade receivables balance of 1.8m, we consider nil to be not due and not impaired.
All of the 34.8m other receivables balance and all of the 112.0m amounts recoverable on contracts are considered not due and not impaired.
As at 30 September 2018, tenant arrears of 0.5m within trade receivables were impaired and fully provided for 2017: 0.6m.
Theindividually impaired receivables are based on a review of outstanding arrears and an assessment of collectability.
Impaired receivables and receivables not considered to be impaired are not material to the financial statements and, therefore, no further analysis is provided.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is managed through the Groups policies of monitoring counterparty exposure, monitoring the concentration of credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties and the use of counterparties of good financial standing.
At 30 September 2018, the fair value of all interest rate derivatives that had a positive value was 4.4m 2017: 3.4m.
124 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic report Governance Financial Statements Other information At 30 September 2018, the combined credit exposure arising from cash held at banks, money market deposits and interest rate swaps was 100.5m 2017: 80.0m, which represents 5.3% 2017: 4.5% of total assets.
Deposits were placed with financial institutions with Aor better credit ratings.
The Group has the following cash and cash equivalents: 2018 2017 m m Pounds Sterling 107.6 83.2 Euros 1.7 5.7 109.3 88.9 At the year end, 34.7m was placed on deposit 2017: 35.3m at effective interest rates between 0.2% and 0.6% 2017: 0.2% and 0.3%.
Remaining cash and cash equivalents are held as cash at bank or in hand.
The Group has an overdraft facility of 1.0m as at 30 September 2018 2017: 1.0m.
2 Liquidity risk The Group ensures that it maintains continuity and flexibility through a spread of maturities.
Although the Groups core funding is subject to covenants requiring certain levels of loan to value with respect to the entities in the Group of obligors, and to maintaining a certain level of interest cover at the Group level, the loan is not secured directly against any property allowing operational flexibility.
The Group has operated within its covenants during 2018 and as at 30 September 2018 seeNote 1 Accounting policies Going concern.
The Group ensures that it maintains sufficient cash for operational requirements at all times.
The Group also ensures that it has sufficient undrawn committed borrowing facilities from a diverse range of banks and other sources to allow for operational flexibility and to meet committed expenditure.
The business is highly cash generative from its sales of vacant properties, gross rents and management fees.
In adverse trading conditions, tenanted sales can be increased and new acquisitions can be stopped.
Consequently, the Group is able to reduce gearing levels and improve liquidity quickly.
The following table analyses the Groups financial liabilities and net-settled derivative financial liabilities at the consolidated statement of financial position date into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period to the contractual maturity date.

The approach the Group takes to each of these risks is set out below.
The Group is not significantly exposed to equity price risk or to commodity price risk.
Fair values IFRS 13 sets out a three-tier hierarchy for financial assets and liabilities valued at fair value.
These are as follows: Level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities: Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3 unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
The following table presents the Groups assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value: 2018 2017 m Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Level 3 CHARM 82.2 86.1 Investment property 589.7 391.0 671.9 477.1 Level 2 Interest rate swaps in cash flow hedge accounting relationships 4.2 3.4 3.0 4.9 Interest rate caps not in cash flow hedge accounting relationships 0.2 0.4 4.4 3.4 3.4 4.9 The significant unobservable inputs affecting the carrying value of the CHARM portfolio are house price inflation and the effective interest rate.
Assumptions used are detailed in Note 2 and reconciliation of movements and amounts recognised in the consolidated income statement and other comprehensive income are detailed in Note 21.
The investment valuations provided by Allsop LLP and CBRE Limited are based on the RICS Professional Valuation Standards, but include a number of unobservable inputs and other valuation assumptions.
The fair value of swaps and caps were valued in-house by a specialised treasury management system, using first a discounted cash flow model and market information.
The fair value is derived from the present value of future cash flows discounted at rates obtained by means of the current yield curve appropriate for those instruments.
As all significant inputs required to value the swaps and caps are observable, they all fall within Level 2.
Interest rate swaps and caps are all classified as either current assets or current liabilities.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap and cap contracts as at 30 September 2018 was 459.6m 2017: 460.9m.
126 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic report Governance Financial Statements Other information In accordance with IAS 39, the Group has reviewed its interest rate hedges.
In the absence of hedge accounting, movements in fair value are taken directly to the consolidated income statement.
However, where cash flow hedges have been viewed as being effective, and have been designated as such, any gains or losses have been taken to the cash flow hedge reserve via other comprehensive income.
The reconciliation between opening and closing balances for Level 3 is detailed in the table below: 2018 2017 Assets Level 3 m m Opening balance 477.1 354.4 Amounts taken to income statement 29.1 23.3 Other movements 165.7 99.4 Closing balance 671.9 477.1 The following assets and liabilities are excluded from the above table as fair value is not the accounting basis for the Groups financial statements, but is the basis for the Groups EPRA NAV and EPRA NNNAV measures: 2018 2017 m Accounting basis Classification if fair valued Book value Fair value Book value Fair value Inventories trading property Lower of cost and net Level 3 799.3 1,406.4 841.3 1,487.1 realisable value Corporate bond Amortised cost Level 1 350.0 345.5 275.0 299.8 Rothesay Life Loan Amortised cost Level 1 75.0 82.9 a Interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk arises from the risk of fluctuations in interest charges on floating rate borrowings.
The Group mitigates this risk through the use of variable to fixed interest rate swaps and caps.
This subjects the Group to fair value risk as the value of the financial derivatives fluctuates in line with variations in interest rates.
However, the Group seeks to cash flow hedge account where applicable.
TheGroup is, however, driven by commercial considerations when hedging its interest rate risk and is not driven by the strict requirements of the hedge accounting rules under IAS 39 if this is to the detriment of achieving the best commercial arrangement.
Hedging activities are carried out under the terms of the Groups hedging policies and are regularly reviewed by the Board to ensure compliance with this policy.
The Board reviews its policy on interest rate exposure regularly with a view to establishing that it is still relevant in the prevailing and forecast economic environment.
The current Group treasury policy is to maintain floating rate exposure of no greater than 30% of expected borrowing.
As at 30 September 2018, 91% 2017: 79% of the Groups net borrowings were economically hedged to fixed or capped rates.
Based on the Groups interest rate profile at the statement of financial position date, a 1% increase in interest rates would decrease annual profits by 1.5m 2017: 2.0m.
Similarly, a 1% decrease would increase annual profits by 1.5m 2017: 2.0m.
Based on the Groups interest rate profile at the statement of financial position date, a 1% increase in interest rates would increase the Groups equity by 16.5m 2017: 9.9m.
Similarly, a 1% decrease would decrease the Groups equity by 16.5m 2017: 9.9m.
Upward movements in medium and long-term interest rates, associated with higher interest rate expectation, increase the value of the Groups interest rate swaps that provide protection against such moves.
The converse is true for downward movements in the interest yield curve.
Where the Groups swaps qualify as effective hedges under IAS 39, these movements in fair value are recognised directly in other comprehensive income rather than the consolidated income statement.
As at 30 September 2018, the market value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges under IAS 39 is a net asset of 0.8m 2017: net liability of 1.9m.
No amount is recognised within the income statement for ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges 2017: nil.
The fair value movement on derivatives not in hedge accounting relationships resulted in a charge of 0.2m 2017: a gain of 0.2m in the consolidated income statement.
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 127 Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 28.
Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued At 30 September 2018, the market value of derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges under IAS 39 is a net asset of 0.2m 2017: 0.4m.
The cash flows occur and enter in the determination of profit and loss until the maturity of the hedged debt.
The table below summarises debt hedged: Hedged debt 2018 2017 m m Hedged debt maturing: Within one year Between one and two years Between two and five years 459.6 460.9 Over five years 459.6 460.9 Interest rate profile including the effect of derivatives and amortisation of issue costs 2018 2017 Weighted Weighted average average interest Average Gross interest Average Gross rate maturity Sterling Euros debt total rate maturity Sterling Euros debt total % years m m m % years m m m Fixed rate 3.4 9.5 425.0 425.0 5.2 3.3 275.0 275.0 Hedged rate 3.1 5.5 459.6 459.6 2.9 4.0 460.9 460.9 Variable rate 2.7 2.3 88.0 0.9 88.9 2.3 4.0 192.8 6.2 199.0 3.2 5.7 972.6 0.9 973.5 3.4 3.8 928.7 6.2 934.9 At 30 September 2018, the fixed interest rates on the interest rate swap contracts vary from 0.69% to 1.96% 2017: 0.69% to 1.96% : the weighted average rates are shown in the table above.
b Credit availability risk Credit availability risk relates to the Groups ability to refinance its borrowings at the end of their terms or to secure additional financing where necessary.
The Group maintains relationships with a range of lenders and maintains sufficient headroom throughcash and committed borrowings.
On 30 September 2018, the Group had available headroom of 388.6m.
c House price risk The cash flows arising from the Groups financial interest in property assets CHARM and the Tricomm Housing portfolio are related to the movement in value of the underlying property assets and, therefore, are subject to movements in house prices.
However, consistent with the Groups approach to house price risk across its portfolio of trading and investment properties, the Group does not seek to eliminate this risk as it is a fundamental part of the Groups business model.
d Capital risk management The Board manages the Groups capital through the regular review of: cash flow projections: the ability of the Group to meet contractual commitments: covenant tests: dividend cover: and gearing.
The current capital structure of the Group comprises a mixofdebt and equity.
Debt is both current and non-current interest-bearing loans and borrowings as set out in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Equity comprises issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as set out in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
Group loans and borrowings have associated covenant requirements with respect to loan to value and interest cover ratios.
The Board regularly reviews all current and projected future levels to monitor anticipated compliance and available headroom against keythresholds.
Loan to value is reviewed in the context of the Boards view of markets, the prospects of, and risks relating to, the portfolio and the recurring cash flows of the business.
The Group deems a range of gearing of up to 45% to be appropriate in the medium term.
The Group monitors its cost of debt and weighted average cost of capital WACC on a regular basis.
At 30 September 2018, the weighted average cost of debt was 3.2% 2017: 3.4%.
Investment and development opportunities are evaluated using a risk adjusted WACC in order to ensure long-term shareholder value is created.

Pension costs Accounting policy i Defined contribution pension scheme Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the period to which they relate.
ii Defined benefit pension scheme The Group currently contributes to a defined benefit pension scheme that was closed to new members and future accrual of benefits in 2003.
The full deficit in the scheme was recognised in the statement of financial position as at 1 October 2004.
An actuarial valuation of the scheme is carried out every three years.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each consolidated statement of financial position date by a qualified actuary, also under the Projected Unit Credit Method, for the purpose of determining the amounts to be reflected in the Groups financial statements under IAS 19.
The defined benefit obligation is valued by projecting the best estimate of future benefit outgoings allowing for future salary increases for active members, revaluation to retirement for deferred members and annual pension increases for all members and then discounting to the consolidated statement of financial position date.
The pension scheme assets comprise investments in equities, bonds, insurance policies and cash, managed by Rathbones Investment Management Limited.
These assets are measured at fair value in the statement of financial position.
The amount shown in the statement of financial position is the net of the present value of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of the scheme assets.
When there is a surplus the Group consider the requirements of IFRIC 14 and whether there is economic benefit available as a refund of this surplus, or through a reduction in future contributions.
When an unconditional right to future economic benefit exists, there is no restriction on the amount of surplus recognised.
There are no current or past service costs as the scheme is closed to new members and future accrual.
The net interest amount, calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability, is reflected in the income statement each year.
Actuarial gains and losses net of deferred income tax are reflected in other comprehensive income each year.
a Defined contribution scheme The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme for its employees.
The assets of the scheme are held separately fromthose of the Group in independently administered funds.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the funds do not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
Pension arrangements for Directors are disclosed in the report of the Remuneration Committee and the Directors Remuneration report on pages 59 to 76.
The pension cost charge in these financial statements represents contributions payable by the Group.
The charge of 0.9m 2017: 0.9m is included within employee remuneration in Note 11. b Defined benefit scheme In addition to the above, the Group also operates a final salary defined benefit pension scheme, the BPT Limited Retirement Benefits Scheme.
The assets of the scheme are held separately in funds administered by Trustees and are invested with Rathbones Investment Management Limited, an independent investment manager.
Pension benefits are linked to the members final pensionable salaries and service at their retirement date or date of leaving if earlier.
The Trustees are responsible for running the scheme in accordance with the schemes trust deed and rules, which sets out their powers.
The Trustees of the scheme are required to act in the best interests of the beneficiaries of the scheme.
There is a requirement that at least one-third of the Trustees are nominated by the members of the scheme.
There are three categories of pension scheme members: Active members: currently employed by the Group.
No benefits have accrued since 30 June 2003, although active members retain a final salary link.
Deferred members: former employees of the Group.
Pensioner members: in receipt of pension.
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 129 Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 29.
Pension costs continued The defined benefit obligation is valued by projecting the best estimate of future benefit payments allowing for future salary increases for active members, revaluation to retirement for deferred members and annual pension increases for all members and then discounting to the statement of financial position date.
In the period up to retirement, benefits receive increases linked to Consumer Prices Index CPI inflation subject to a cap of no more than 5% p. a.. After retirement, benefits receive fixed increases of 5% p. a.
The valuation method used is known as the Projected Unit Credit Method.
The approximate overall duration of the schemes defined benefit obligation as at 30September 2018 was 17 years.
The IAS 19 calculations for disclosure purposes have been based upon the results of the actuarial valuation carried out as at 1 July 2016, updated to 30 September 2018, by a qualified independent actuary.

These assets are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, but provide volatility and risk in the short term.
Changes in bond yields: a decrease in corporate bond yields would increase the schemes defined benefit obligation: however, this would be partially offset by an increase in the value of the schemes bond holdings.
Inflation risk: some of the schemes defined benefit obligation is linked to inflation, therefore higher inflation will result in a higher defined benefit obligation subject to the appropriate caps in place.
The majority of the schemes assets are either unaffected by inflation, or only loosely correlated with inflation, therefore an increase in inflation would also increase the deficit.
Life expectancy: if scheme members live longer than expected, the schemes benefits will need to be paid for longer, increasing the schemes defined benefit obligation.
The Trustees and Group manage risks in the scheme through the following strategies: Diversification: investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.
Investment strategy: the Trustees are required to review their investment strategy on a regular basis.
Market value of scheme assets The assets of the scheme are invested in a diversified portfolio as follows: 30 September 2018 30 September 2017 Market value % of total Market value % of total m scheme assets m scheme assets Equities 15.6 50% 15.4 50% Bonds 11.1 36% 11.1 36% Cash 0.9 3% 0.4 1% Insurance policies 3.6 11% 3.9 13% Total value of assets 31.2 100% 30.8 100% The actual return on assets over the year was 0.8 1.8 The assets of the scheme are held with Rathbones Investment Management Limited in a managed fund.

Future funding obligation The Trustees are required to carry out an actuarial valuation every three years.
The last actuarial valuation of the scheme was performed by the Actuary for the Trustees as at 1 July 2016.
This valuation revealed a funding shortfall of 3.6m.
As a result of this valuation, the Group agreed a recovery plan with the Trustees to pay additional contributions to eliminate the deficit by 30April2022.
Based on this plan, the Group expects to pay 0.6m p. a. to the scheme until 30 April 2022.
The next actuarial valuation is due to be performed as at 1 July 2019.
The plan asset has not been restricted as the Group has an unconditional right to a refund of the surplus.
In line with paragraph 23 of IFRIC 14, no additional liability is recognised as the additional contributions under the funding plan will reduce the future contributions into the scheme.

Issued share capital Accounting policy Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Acquisition of and investment in own shares The Group acquires its own shares to enable it to meet its obligations under the various share schemes in operation.
No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Companys own shares.
The acquisition cost ofthe shares is debited to an investment in own shares reserve within retained earnings.
Where the Group buys back its own shares as treasury shares it adopts the accounting as described above.
Where it subsequently cancels them, issued share capital is reduced by the nominal value of the shares cancelled and this same amount is transferred to the capital redemption reserve.

Share-based payments Accounting policy The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans comprising awards under a Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP, a Deferred Bonus Plan DBP, a Share Incentive Plan SIP and a Save As You Earn SAYE scheme.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of shares and options is recognised as an employee expense.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares and options granted.
For market-based conditions, the probability of vesting is taken into account in the fair value calculation and no revision is made to the number of shares or options expected to vest.
For non-market conditions, each year the Group revises its estimate of the number of options or shares that are expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the consolidated income statement with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Awards that are subject to a market-based performance condition are valued at fair value using the Monte Carlo simulation model.
Awards not subject to a market-based performance condition are valued at fair value using the Black-Scholes valuation model.
When options are exercised the proceeds received, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium.

134 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic report Governance Financial Statements Other information a LTIP scheme One-half of the awards under the LTIP scheme are subject to an absolute total shareholder return performance condition measured over three years from the date of grant and one-half are subject to annual growth in NNNAV compared to the average growth in theHalifax and Nationwide House Price indices all measured over three years from the date of grant.
The fair value of theseawards is based on the assumptions relating to previous LTIP awards.
Please see section 6 of the Remuneration report on page 71 for further details.
b DBP scheme Awards granted under the DBP scheme have no specific performance conditions other than the Company meeting its target for operating profit before valuation movements and other adjustments OPBVM and employees in the scheme continuing to be employed.
There is a three-year vesting period from the date of grant.
One-third of the awards vest at the end of each year.
Participants can choose to exercise their awards on vesting or to retain their awards within the plan until the end of the third year at which point a 50% matching element is added to their award entitlement.
In addition to the normal DBP scheme, an enhanced DBP scheme EDBP is also provided.
The enhanced scheme operates in exactly the same way as the normal DBP scheme except that if participants retain their awards within the plan until the end of the fifth year, a further additional 50% matching award is added to their award entitlement.
Awards under the DBP EDBP have been valued based on the share price at the date of the award less the dividend yield at the award date as there is no entitlement to dividends during the vesting period.

Operating leases Accounting policy i Group as lessor Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The net present value of ground rents receivable is, in the opinion of the Directors, immaterial.
Accordingly, ground rents receivable are taken to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Properties leased out to tenants are included in the consolidated statement of financial position as either investment property or as trading property under inventories.
ii Group as lessee The Group occupies a number of its offices as a lessee.
After a review of all of its occupational leases, the Directors have concluded that all such leases are operating leases.
Payments, including prepayments, made under operating leases net of any incentives from the lessor are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
a Group as lessor The future aggregate minimum lease payments due to the Group under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: 2018 2017 m m Operating lease payments due: Not later than one year 3.6 3.0 Later than one year and not later than five years 9.7 8.5 Later than five years 62.4 96.1 75.7 107.6 There are no contingent rents recognised within net rental income in 2018 or 2017 relating to properties where the Group acts as a lessor of assets under operating leases.
A significant proportion of the Groups non-cancellable operating leases relate to regulated tenancies under which tenants have the right to remain in a property for the remainder of their lives.
It is therefore not possible to estimate the timing of future minimum lease payments in respect of these regulated tenancies and so these are excluded from the above analysis.
