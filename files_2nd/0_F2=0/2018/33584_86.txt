Accounting judgements Joint arrangements Joint arrangements are classified as joint operations or joint ventures according to the rights and obligations of the parties, as described in note 38I.
Judgement is required in determining this classification through an evaluation of the facts and circumstances arising from each individual arrangement.
When a joint arrangement has been structured through a separate vehicle, consideration has been given to the legal form of the separate vehicle, the terms of the contractual arrangement and, when relevant, other facts and circumstances.
When the activities of an arrangement are primarily designed for the provision of output to the parties and, the parties are substantially the only source of cash flows contributing to the continuity of the operations of the arrangement, this indicates that the parties to the arrangement have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities.
Certain joint arrangements that are structured through separate vehicles including Collahuasi, Debswana and Namdeb are accounted for as joint operations.
These arrangements are primarily designed for the provision of output to the parties sharing joint control, indicating that the parties have rights to substantially all the economic benefits of the assets.
The liabilities of the arrangements are in substance satisfied by cash flows received from the parties: this dependence indicates that the parties effectively have obligations for the liabilities.
It is primarily these facts and circumstances that give rise to the classification as joint operations.
