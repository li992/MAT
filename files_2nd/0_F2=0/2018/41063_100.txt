11.21 Guarantees and contingent liabilities The Company has given an unlimited guarantee in respect of the overdraft of all the subsidiary undertakings within the Groups banking offset agreement.
The overdraft position at 4 February 2018 was nil 2017: nil.
The Company has also provided a guarantee in respect of sterling bonds amounting to 75m at fair value 2017: 147m in respect of a subsidiary undertaking.
Where the Company enters into financial contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Following the disposal of the land and building of its customer fulfilment centre CFC at Dordon to a third party see note 3.3 the Company continues to guarantee the lease in respect of this site.
If the lessee were to default, their lease obligations could revert back to the Company under the terms of the guarantee and become a liability of the Company.
Should the lessee default, the additional future commitment is estimated at up to 32m.
The Company has had an ongoing legal case brought by a number of current and former colleagues relating to employee data theft in the 52 weeks ended 1 February 2015.
In December 2017, the High Court concluded that the Company was liable for the actions of the former employee who conducted the data theft.
The Company has since launched an appeal to this judgement and the High Court has confirmed that there will be no hearings on the level of compensation until the appeal has been concluded.
It is the Directors view that at this stage of the process the Company can not reliably assess the outcome of the case nor reasonably estimate the quantum of any loss and as such no provision has been recognised in these financial statements.
11.22 Post balance sheet events Following IAS 10 Events after the Balance Sheet Date, the Company continues to disclose events that it considers material and non-disclosure of which can influence the economic decisions of users of the financial statements.
On 19 February 2018, the Company acquired Chippindale Foods Limited, a leading supplier of free range eggs, for a consideration of 6m.
The Directors consider this event as a non-adjusting post balance sheet event.
