3. Business combinations and other significant transactions Business combinations BP undertook a number of business combinations in 2018.
For the full year, total consideration paid in cash amounted to $7,100 million, offset by cash acquired of $114 million.
On 31 October 2018, BP acquired from BHP Billiton Petroleum North America Inc. 100% of the issued share capital of Petrohawk Energy Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of BHP that holds a portfolio of unconventional onshore US oil and gas assets.
The acquisition brings BP extensive oil and gas production and resources in the liquids-rich regions of the Permian and Eagle Ford basins in Texas and in the Haynesville gas basin in Texas and Louisiana.
The total consideration for the transaction, after customary closing adjustments and the effect of discounting deferred payments, is $10,302 million, which will all be paid in cash.
As at 31 December 2018, $6,788 million of the consideration had been paid.
The remaining discounted amount of $3,514 million is included within other payables on the group balance sheet and will be paid in four instalments, with the final instalment being paid in April 2019.
The transaction has been accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method.
