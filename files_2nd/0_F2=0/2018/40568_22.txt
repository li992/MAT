Key estimate over pension assumptions The Group has chosen to adopt assumptions that the Directors believe are generally in line with comparable companies.

Wherethe pension obligation is included in the balance sheet at the net present value of the minimum funding payments then the impact on the balance sheet of changes in these assumptions isreduced.
The sensitivity of the balance sheet position to changes in key assumptions is disclosed in note 16 j.
