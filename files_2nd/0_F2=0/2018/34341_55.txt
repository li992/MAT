As at that date, RAI ceased to be reported as an associate and has become a fully owned subsidiary.
Accordingly, as at that date, RAI has been consolidated in accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements.
Included in the 30,521 million is the gain arising on the deemed disposal of RAI of 23,288 million.
This gain includes amounts restated in accordance with IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates see note 19.
Prior to 25 July 2017, the Group accounted for RAI as an associate, having concluded that it did not have fide facto control of RAI because of the operation of the governance agreement between the Group and RAI which ensured that the Group did not have the practical ability to direct relevant activities of RAI.
The Groups investment in Tisak d. d. Tisak was acquired as part of the TDR transaction note 24.
During 2016, the Group entered into an agreement with Tisaks parent Agrokor d. d. Agrokor to convert certain outstanding trading balances into long-term loans and an additional shareholding in Tisak.
As part of the agreement, Agrokor had the right to reacquire the additional shareholding in Tisak.
As a consequence of this, while the Group had legal ownership of the additional shareholding, it did not consider that the shares provided any additional equity interest and continued to account for 26% of the equity of Tisak.
In 2017, due to the financial difficulties of Agrokor and Tisak, the Group fully impaired this investment.
This resulted in a charge of 27 million to the income statement that has been reported as an adjusting item in note 5.
In July 2018, Agrokors creditors approved a settlement plan proposed by Agrokors administrators that is expected to be implemented during 2019.
In its current form, the settlement plan is unlikely to return any value to the Group on this investment.
Included within the dividends amount of 211 million 2017: 688 million are nil million 2017: 477 million attributable to dividends declared by RAI and 204 million 2017: 204 million attributable to dividends declared by ITC.
The principal associate undertaking of the Group is ITC Ltd. ITC as shown under associates undertakings and joint ventures.
