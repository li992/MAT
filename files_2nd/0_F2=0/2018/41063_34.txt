Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 18 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 53 weeks ended 4 February 2018 2 Taxation The Group takes a compliance-focused approach to its tax affairs, and has a transparent relationship with the UK and overseas tax authorities and interacts with HMRC on a regular basis.
The Groups tax policy provides a governance framework with all related risks and stakeholder interests taken into consideration.
The tax policy is approved by the Board, with updates on tax compliance and governance matters being provided to the Audit Committee.
The Groups approach to tax is to ensure compliance with the relevant laws of the territories in which the Group operates.
The majority of the Groups stores and sales are in the UK so the majority of the Groups taxes are paid in the UK.
The Group operates a small number of branches and subsidiary companies outside of the UK based in the following overseas jurisdictions: The Netherlands: The Group has operations in the Netherlands as part of its produce supply chain.
Local corporation taxes of 2m were paid during 2018 2017: 1.3m : Hong Kong: Offices in Hong Kong were established in 2011 and source many of the Groups non-food products.
Local corporation taxes of 0.4m were paid during 2018 2017: 0.3m : and Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey: The Groups insurance company is based in the Isle of Man for regulatory reasons.
Companies based in Jersey and Guernsey hold UK property assets as a result of historic acquisitions.
All profits arising in these companies are subject to UK tax.
2.1 Accounting policies Current tax The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws in effect during the period and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Taxable profit differs from the reported profit for the period as it is adjusted both for items that will never be taxable or deductible, and temporary differences.
Current tax is charged to profit or loss for the period, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly in other comprehensive income or equity, in which case the current tax is reflected in other comprehensive income or equity as appropriate.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method.
Provision is made for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
No deferred tax is recognised for temporary differences that arise on the initial recognition of goodwill or the initial recognition of assets and liabilities that are not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profits.
Deferred tax is calculated based on tax law that is enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date and provided at rates expected to apply when the temporary differences reverse.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to profit for the period except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income or equity, in which case the deferred tax is reflected in other comprehensive income or equity as appropriate.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date as judgement is required to estimate the probability of recovery.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where amounts will be settled on a net basis as there is a legally enforceable right to offset.
Uncertain tax positions The Group uses in-house tax specialists, professional advisers and relevant previous experience to assess tax risks, and considers IFRIC 23 Accounting for Uncertainties in Income Taxes, which provides guidance on the determination of taxable profit and tax bases, when making its assessment.
The Group recognises a tax provision when it is considered probable that there will be a future outflow of funds to a tax authority.
Provisions are measured based on the single most likely outcome for each item unless there is a range of possible outcomes for a particular item where a weighted average measurement is more appropriate.
Provisions are included in current liabilities.

3 Tax reconciliation The reconciliation below shows how the tax charge of 69m 2017: 20m has arisen on profit before taxation of 380m 2017: 325m.
The tax for the period is lower 2017: lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 19.16% 2017: 20.0%.
The differences are explained below: 2018 2017 m m Profit before taxation 380 325 Profit before taxation at 19.16% 2017: 20.0% 73 65 Effects of: Recurring items: Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 6 1 Disallowed depreciation on UK properties 20 20 Deferred tax on Safeway acquisition assets 4 10 Adjustments in respect of prior periods 2 8 Non-recurring items: Profit on property transactions 8 6 Tax impact of impairment and related items 4 21 Effect of change in tax rate 21 Tax charge for the period 69 20 Factors affecting current and future tax charges The effective tax rate for the year was 18.2% 2017: 6.2%.
The normalised tax rate for the year excluding the impact of property transactions, business disposals and tax rate changes was 23.8% 2017: 25.0%.
The normalised tax rate was 4.64% above the UK statutory tax rate of 19.16%.
The main factor increasing the normalised tax rate is disallowed depreciation on UK properties which reflects the Groups strategy to maintain a majority freehold estate.
Legislation to reduce the standard rate of corporation tax to 17% from 1 April 2020 was included in the Finance Bill 2016 and was enacted in the prior period.
Accordingly, deferred tax has been provided at 19% or 17% depending upon when the temporary difference is expected to reverse 2017: 19% or 17%.
There have been no indications of any further changes to the rate of corporation tax after 1 April 2020.
