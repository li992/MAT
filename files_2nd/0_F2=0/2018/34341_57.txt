The Group has revised 2017, as explained in notes 1 and 31.
In 2017, as part of the acquisition of RAI, the Group had to account for the assets and liabilities of the RAI companies at fair market value at the acquisition date of 25 July 2017 note 24.
The increase in the net asset value versus the tax bases created net deferred tax liabilities, valued within the purchase price allocation process at the prevailing Federal and State corporation taxrate at the date of the acquisition.
Subsequently on 22 December 2017, the Federal corporation tax rate was changed to 21% from 1January 2018.
This revised rate has been used to revalue the net deferred tax liabilities in the United States, reducing the liability leading toa credit in the income statement of 9,620 million.
The net deferred tax liabilities are reflected in the Group balance sheet as follows: deferred tax asset of 344 million and deferred tax liability of 17,776 million 2017: deferred tax asset of 333 million and deferred tax liability of 17,129 million, after offsetting assets and liabilities where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and where the deferred income taxes relate tothe same fiscal authority.
At the balance sheet date, the Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of unused tax losses of 308 million 2017: 301 million which have no expiry date and unused tax losses of 502 million 2017: 616 million which will expire within the next 10 years.
At the balance sheet date, the Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of deductible temporary differences of nil million 2017: nil million, which have no expiry date and 184 million 2017: 140 million, which will expire within the next 10years.
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax credits of 80 million 2017: 80 million which have no expiry date.
No amount of deferred tax has been recognised in respect of these unused tax credits.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of undistributed earnings of subsidiaries which would be subject to dividend withholding tax and for which no withholding tax liability has been recognised was 0.7 billion 2017: 0.7 billion.
