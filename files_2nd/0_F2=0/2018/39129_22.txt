co. uk Annual Report 2018 Prudential plc 135 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Directors remuneration report continued What performance means for Executive Directors pay At Prudential, remuneration packages are designed to ensure a strong alignment between pay and performance.
As you can see from the charts within the Annual statement from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, sustained growth across our key performance metrics has delivered substantial value to our shareholders.
This has been reflected in both the annual bonuses paid and the release of long-term incentive awards, as set out in the Annual report on remuneration.
In particular, the long-term incentives awarded to Executive Directors in 2016 had stretching performance conditions attached to vesting and were denominated in shares or ADRs.
The value generated for shareholders through share price growth and dividends paid over the last three years is reflected in the value of the LTIP releases.
The value of these performance-related elements of remuneration is added to the fixed packages provided to Executive Directors to calculate the 2018 single figure of total remuneration.
The total 2018 single figure for the Group Chief Executive is 13.2 per cent less than the total 2017 single figure, despite continuing strong business performance and his exceptional leadership and personal performance.
This is chiefly a result of a lower level of vesting of the 2016 PLTIP awards.
The values for the Executive Directors during the year are outlined in the table below: Fixed pay Performance related 2018 Pension and 2018 LTIP 2018 2017 1 Executive Director Role salary benefits bonus vesting single figure single figure Mark FitzPatrick Chief Financial Officer 745,000 275,000 1,241,000 2,261,000 1,634,000 John Foley Chief Executive, M&GPrudential 781,000 318,000 1,186,000 1,511,000 3,796,000 4,597,000 2 3 Nic Nicandrou Chief Executive, PCA 1,023,000 654,000 1,692,000 1,433,000 4,802,000 4,705,000 4 Anne Richards Chief Executive, M&G 249,000 164,000 413,000 3,053,000 2,5 6 Barry Stowe Chairman and CEO, NABU 867,000 287,000 4,935,000 2,761,000 8,850,000 9,541,000 7 James Turner Group Chief Risk Officer 521,000 239,000 793,000 347,000 1,900,000 N A Mike Wells Group Chief Executive 1,126,000 689,000 2,133,000 3,486,000 7,434,000 8,560,000 Notes 1 Revised 2017 single figure, in line with the regulations, reflecting the actual value of 2017 LTIP releases and additional dividends paid as set out in the notes to the 2017 single figure table on page 145.

Aligning 2019 pay to performance The Committee awarded salary increases to the Executive Directors for 2019 of 2 per cent, which was at the lower end of the range of salary increase budgets for the wider workforce.
No changes have been made to incentive opportunities as we believe remuneration packages remain strongly aligned with performance over both the short and the long term.

Circumstances when the Committee may exercise its discretion to apply malus or clawback to an award Malus applies in respect of Where a business decision taken during the performance period by the business unit by which the any annual bonus or long-term participant was employed has resulted in a material breach of any law, regulation, code of practice incentive award or other instrument that applies to companies or individuals within the business unit.

apparent that a material breach of a law or regulation took place during the performance period which resulted in significant harm to the Company or its reputation, and the Committee considers it appropriate, taking account of the extent of the participants responsibility for the relevant restatement or breach, that clawback be applied to the relevant participant.
The full Directors remuneration policy sets out the Committees powers in respect of Executive Directors joining or leaving the Board, where a change in performance conditions is appropriate or in the case of corporate transactions such as a takeover, merger or rights issue.
The policy also describes legacy long-term incentive plans under which some Executive Directors continue to hold awards.
Subsequent to the approval of the Directors remuneration policy by our shareholders, we have determined that for PLTIP awards granted in 2019 and subsequent years the proportion vesting for threshold performance will be reduced from 25 per cent to 20 per cent of the maximum opportunity, and externally recruited Executive Directors appointed on or after 1 March 2019 will be offered pension benefits of 20 per cent of salary, rather than the current level of 25 per cent of salary.
Scenarios of total remuneration The following chart provides an illustration of the future total remuneration for each Executive Director in respect of their remuneration opportunity for 2019.
Three scenarios of potential outcome are provided based on underlying assumptions shown in the notes to the chart.
In line with changes to Schedule 8 of The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013 which would apply from the next Directors remuneration policy, we have indicated the maximum remuneration that would be delivered to each Executive Director by a 50 per cent share price growth during the relevant performance period.
The Committee is satisfied that the maximum potential remuneration of the Executive Directors is appropriate.
Prudentials policy is to offer Executive Directors remuneration which reflects the performance and experience of the executive, internal relativities and Group and or business unit financial performance.
In order for the maximum illustrated total remuneration to be payable: Financial performance must exceed the Group and or business units stretching business plan: Relative TSR must be at or above the upper quartile relative to the peer group: The balanced scorecard, aligned to the Groups strategic priorities, must be fully satisfied: Functional and personal performance objectives must be fully met: Performance must be achieved within the Groups and business units risk framework and appetites: and The Companys share price must grow by 50 per cent over three years.

In setting the Directors remuneration policy, the Committee considers a range of factors including: Statement of consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Group Across the Group, remuneration is reviewed regularly with the intention that all employees are paid appropriately in the context of their local market and given their individual skills, experience and performance.
Each business units salary increase budget is set with reference to local market conditions.
The Committee considers salary increase budgets in each business unit when determining the salaries of Executive Directors.
Prudential does not consult with employees when setting the Directors remuneration policy.
Prudential is a global organisation with employees and agents in multiple business units and geographies.
As such, there are practical challenges associated with consulting with employees directly on this matter.
As many employees are also shareholders, they are able to participate in binding votes on the Directors remuneration policy and annual votes on the Annual report on remuneration.
Statement of consideration of shareholder views The Committee and the Company undertake regular consultation with key institutional investors on the remuneration policy and its implementation.
This engagement is led by the Remuneration Committee Chair and is an integral part of the Companys investor relations programme.
The Committee is grateful to shareholders for their feedback and takes this into account when determining executive remuneration.
As set out in the Annual statement from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, feedback from shareholders and their advisers informed a number of changes to the Companys 2019 remuneration arrangements.

Key activities at each meeting are shown in the table below: Meeting Key activities Early March 2018 Approve the 2017 Directors remuneration report and the Gender pay gap report: consider 2017 bonus awards for Executive Directors: consider vesting of the long-term incentive awards with a performance period ending on 31 December 2017: approve 2018 long-term incentive awards, performance measures and plan documentation: note an update on regulation affecting remuneration: and review the appointment of the Committees independent adviser.

The Chairman and the Group Chief Executive attend meetings by invitation.
The Committee also had the benefit of advice from: Group Chief Risk Officer: Chief Financial Officer: Group Human Resources Director: and Director of Group Reward and Employee Relations.
Individuals are never present when their own remuneration is discussed and the Committee is always careful to manage potential conflicts of interest when receiving views from Executive Directors or senior management about executive remuneration proposals.
During 2018, Deloitte LLP was the independent adviser to the Committee.
Deloitte was appointed by the Committee in 2011 following a competitive tender process.
As part of this process, the Committee considered the services that Deloitte provided to Prudential and its competitors, as well as other potential conflicts of interest.
Deloitte is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and voluntarily operates under their code of conduct when providing advice on executive remuneration in the UK.
Deloitte regularly meets with the Chair of the Committee without management present.
The Committee is comfortable that the Deloitte engagement partner and team providing remuneration advice to the Committee do not have connections with Prudential that may impair their independence and objectivity.
The total fees paid to Deloitte for the provision of independent advice to the Committee in 2018 were 48,400 2017: 56,000 charged on a time and materials basis.
During 2018, Deloitte gave Prudential management advice on remuneration, as well as providing guidance on capital optimisation, digital and technology, taxation, internal audit, real estate, global mobility and other financial, risk and regulatory matters.
Remuneration advice is provided by an entirely separate team within Deloitte.
As set out in the table above, the Committee reviewed Deloittes appointment during 2018 and considered Deloitte to be independent.
In addition, management received external advice and data from a number of other providers.
This included market data and legal counsel.
This advice, and these services, are not considered to be material.
During the year, the Company has complied with the appropriate provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code regarding Directors remuneration.

Annual bonus outcomes for 2018 Target setting For the financial AIP metrics which comprise 80 per cent of the bonus opportunity for all Executive Directors apart from the Group Chief Risk Officer, the performance ranges are set by the Committee prior to, or at the beginning of, the performance period.
These ranges are based on the annual business plans approved by the Board and reflect the ambitions of the Group and business units, in the context of anticipated market conditions.
Personal objectives comprise 20 per cent of the bonus opportunity for all Executive Directors apart from the Group Chief Risk Officer, for whom this accounts for 50 per cent of the total bonus opportunity.
These objectives are established at the start of the year and reflect the Companys Strategic Priorities set by the Board.
In line with the remuneration requirements of Solvency II, functional objectives account for the remaining 50 per cent of the Group Chief Risk Officers bonus opportunity.
These are based on the Group Risk Plan and are developed with input from the Chairman of the Group Risk Committee.
AIP payments are subject to meeting Solvency II minimum capital thresholds which are aligned to the Group and business unit risk framework and appetites as adjusted for any Group Risk Committee and or business unit risk committees approved counter-cyclical buffers.
The Committee also seeks advice from the Group Risk Committee on risk management considerations to be applied to remuneration architecture and performance measures.
This is to ensure risk management culture and conduct is appropriately reflected in the design and operation of Executive Directors remuneration.
Executive Directors 2018 bonuses were determined by the achievement of four Group measures, namely operating profit, free surplus, EEV new business profit and cash flow, which are aligned to the Groups growth and cash generation focus.
In compliance with Solvency II, the weightings of the Group Chief Risk Officers AIP performance targets relate to a combination of functional and personal measures only.

3 Barry Stowe retired from the Board on 31 December 2018 and remained eligible to receive his 2018 AIP award.
Barry Stowe is also eligible to receive 10 per cent of the Jackson bonus pool.
Financial performance The Committee reviewed performance against the performance ranges at its meeting in March 2019.
2018 Group operating profit and Group free surplus generation exceeded the stretching targets established by the Board.
All of our business units achieved target remittances levels and, although lower than the prior period, we achieved our objective to balance net remittances sufficient to cover the dividend and corporate costs, with reinvestment in profitable opportunities within the business units, and maintained significant cash stock at the centre.
The business unit remittances contributed to Group cashflow, which approached the maximum target.
Group EEV new business profit was between threshold and plan.
The Committee considered a report from the Group Chief Risk Officer which had been approved by the Group Risk Committee.
This report confirmed that the 2018 results were achieved within the Groups and business units risk framework and appetite.
The Group Chief Risk Officer also considered the effectiveness of risk management and internal controls, and specific actions taken to mitigate risks, particularly where these may be at the expense of profits or sales.
The report also confirmed that the Group met Solvency II minimum capital thresholds which were aligned to the Group and business unit risk framework and appetites.
The Group Chief Risk Officers recommendations were taken into account by the Committee when determining AIP outcomes for Executive Directors.
The level of performance required for threshold, plan and maximum payment against the Groups 2018 AIP financial measures and the results achieved are set out below.
Weighting Threshold Plan Maximum Achievement 2018 AIP measure m m m m Group operating profit 35% 3,691 3,991 4,290 4,827 Group free surplus generated 30% 3,235 3,370 3,572 4,047 Group cash flow 20% 237 10 93 58 Group EEV new business profit 15% 3,663 3,897 4,053 3,877 The Committee had regard to the achievement against the performance measures and the Group Chief Risk Officers report and decided not to apply a discretionary adjustment to the arithmetic outcome under the financial element of the 2018 bonus.
The Board believes that, due to the commercial sensitivity of the business unit targets, disclosing further details of these targets may damage the competitive position of the Group.

Remuneration in respect of performance periods ending in 2018 Prudential Long Term Incentive Plan PLTIP Target setting Our long-term incentive plans have stretching performance conditions that are aligned to the strategic priorities of the Group.
In 2016, all Executive Directors were granted awards under the PLTIP.
In determining the targets the Committee had regard to the stretching nature of the three-year Business Plan for operating profit set by the Board.
The weightings of these measures are detailed in the table below.
Weighting of measures 1 2 3 Executive Director Group TSR Operating profit Group or business unit John Foley 50% 50% business unit target 4 Nic Nicandrou 50% 50% Group target Barry Stowe 50% 50% business unit target 5 James Turner 50% 50% Group target Mike Wells 50% 50% Group target Notes 1 This table includes current Executive Directors with 2016 PLTIP awards.
Anne Richards stepped down from the Board on 10 August 2018 and her 2016 PLTIP award lapsed.
2 Group TSR is measured on a ranked basis over three years relative to peers.
3 Operating profit is measured on a cumulative basis over three years.
4 Nic Nicandrou was granted this award when he was in the role of Chief Financial Officer.
The performance measures attached to his PLTIP award did not change following his appointment to the role of Chief Executive, Prudential Corporation Asia in 2017.
5 James Turner was granted this award when he was in his previous role of Director of Group Finance.
The performance measures attached to his PLTIP award did not change following his appointment to the role of Group Chief Risk Officer on 1 March 2018.
Under the Group TSR measure used for 2016 PLTIP awards, 25 per cent of the award vests for TSR at the median of the peer group increasing to full vesting for performance within the upper quartile.
TSR is measured on a local currency basis since this has the benefit of simplicity and directness of comparison.
The peer group for the 2016 awards is: Aegon Aflac AIA AIG Allianz Aviva AXA Generali Legal & General Manulife MetLife Munich Re Old Mutual Prudential Financial Standard Life Sun Life Financial Swiss Re Zurich Insurance Group Following the merger of Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management during the performance period, the Committee determined that Standard Life would be retained in the peer group for the pre-merger period and the combined entity would be included in the peer group from the date of the merger for all outstanding PLTIP awards.
In addition, following the demerger of Quilter from Old Mutual and Old Mutuals delisting from the FTSE on 26 June 2018, the Committee determined that Old Mutual be retained as a TSR peer with no adjustment to its performance during the period prior to its demerger and delisting, and that Old Mutuals TSR performance from the date of its demerger and delisting would track an index of the peers excluding Prudential plc for all outstanding PLTIP awards.
co. uk Annual Report 2018 Prudential plc 151 Directors remuneration report continued Performance assessment In deciding the proportion of the awards to be released, the Committee considered actual financial results against these performance targets.
The Committee also reviewed underlying Company performance to ensure vesting levels were appropriate, including an assessment of whether results were achieved within the Groups and business units risk framework and appetite.
The Directors remuneration policy contains further details of the design of Prudentials long-term incentive plans.
Prudentials TSR performance during the performance period 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2018 was ranked at median of the peer group.
The portion of the awards related to TSR that therefore vested was 25 per cent.
Under the operating profit measure, 25 per cent of the 2016 awards vest for meeting the threshold operating profit target set at the start of the performance period, increasing to full vesting for performance at or above the stretch level.
The table below illustrates the cumulative performance achieved over 2016 to 2018 compared to the Group targets set in 2016: 2016-18 cumulative targets 2016-18 Vesting under cumulative the operating Group Threshold Plan Maximum achievement profit element Operating profit 10,837m 12,041m 13,245m 13,782m 100% The Committee determined that the cumulative operating profit target established for the PLTIP should be expressed using exchange rates consistent with the reported disclosures.
Individual business units achieved between 86 per cent and 100 per cent vesting under this element.
Details of business unit operating profit targets have not been disclosed as the Committee considers that these are commercially sensitive and disclosure of targets at such a granular level would put the Company at a disadvantage compared to its competitors.
The Committee will keep this disclosure policy under review based on whether, in its view, disclosure would compromise the Companys competitive position.
PLTIP vesting The Committee considered a report from the Group Chief Risk Officer which had been approved by the Group Risk Committee.
This report confirmed that the financial results were achieved within the Groups and business units risk framework and appetite.
On the basis of this report, and the performance of the Group and its business units described above, the Committee decided not to apply a discretionary adjustment to the arithmetic vesting outcome under the 2016 PLTIP awards and determined the vesting of each Executive Directors PLTIP awards as set out below.
Maximum value of award at Percentage of the Number of Value of 1 2 1 Executive Director full vesting LTIP award vesting shares ADRs vesting shares ADRs vesting John Foley 2,418,213 62.5% 98,525 1,511,374 Nic Nicandrou 2,292,486 62.5% 93,402 1,432,787 Barry Stowe 4,417,184 62.5% 93,530 2,760,648 James Turner 554,771 62.5% 22,602 346,715 Mike Wells 5,576,826 62.5% 227,217 3,485,509 Notes 1 The share price used to calculate the value of the PLTIP awards with performance periods which ended on 31 December 2018 and vest in 2019 was the average share ADR price for the three months up to 31 December 2018, being 15.34 US$39.41.

The vesting of these awards will depend on: Relative TSR 25 per cent of award : Group or business unit operating profit 50 per cent of award : and Balanced scorecard of strategic measures 25 per cent of award.
In line with the remuneration requirements of Solvency II, the weightings of the Group Chief Risk Officers LTIP performance targets were different to the other Executive Directors and were: Relative TSR 50 per cent of award : Group operating profit 20 per cent of award : and Balanced scorecard of strategic measures 30 per cent of award.
Under the Group TSR measure used for 2018 awards, 25 per cent of the award vests for TSR at the median of the peer group, increasing to full vesting for performance within the upper quartile.
The peer group for the 2018 awards is the same as that used for the 2017 awards other than following the merger of Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management, the combined entity of Standard Life Aberdeen has been included.
The peer group for the 2018 awards is set out below: Aegon AIA AIG Allianz Aviva AXA Generali Legal & General Manulife MetLife Old Mutual Prudential Financial Standard Life Aberdeen Sun Life Financial Zurich Insurance Group Under the operating profit measure used for 2018 awards, 25 per cent of the award vests for meeting the threshold operating profit, set at the start of the performance period, increasing to full vesting for performance at or above the stretch level.
Under the balanced scorecard, performance is assessed for each of the four measures, at the end of the three-year performance period.
Performance will be assessed on a sliding scale rather than the meet fail approach adopted for the 2017 scorecard.
Each of the measures has equal weighting and the 2018 measures are set out below: Capital measure: Cumulative three-year ECap Group operating capital generation relative to plan, less cost of capital based on the capital position at the start of the performance period.
Vesting basis: 25 per cent vesting for achieving Plan, increasing to full vesting for performance above stretch level.
The plan figure for this metric will be published in the Annual Report for the final year of the performance period.
Capital measure: Cumulative three-year Solvency II Group operating capital generation as captured in published disclosures relative to plan.
Conduct measure: Through appropriate management action, ensure there are no significant conduct culture governance issues that result in significant capital add-ons or material fines.
Vesting basis: 25 per cent vesting for partial achievement of the Groups expectations, increasing to full vesting for achieving the Groups expectations.
Diversity measure: Percentage of the Leadership Team that is female at the end of 2020.
The target for this metric is based on progress towards the goal that the Company set when it signed the Women in Finance Charter, specifically that 30 per cent of our Leadership Team will be female by the end of 2021.
For this portion of the 2018 PLTIP awards to vest, at least 28 per cent of our Leadership Team must be female by the end of 2020.
Vesting basis: 25 per cent vesting for meeting the threshold of at least 27 per cent of our Leadership Team being female at the end of 2020, increasing to full vesting for reaching the stretch level of at least 29 per cent being female at that date.
The performance conditions attached to outstanding PLTIP awards may be reviewed at the time of the demerger.
Should any performance conditions be revised, the new conditions will be no more or less stretching that those originally attached to the awards and the changes will be disclosed.

co. uk Annual Report 2018 Prudential plc 155 Directors remuneration report continued Percentage change in remuneration The table below sets out how the change in remuneration for the Group Chief Executive between 2017 and 2018 compared to a wider employee comparator group: Salary Benefits Bonus Group Chief Executive 2% 17.4 % 2.9% All UK employees 3% 1.4 % 8.6% The employee comparator group used for the purpose of this analysis is all UK employees.
This includes employees in M&GPrudential and Group Head Office, and reflects the average change in pay for employees employed in both 2017 and 2018.
The salary increase includes uplifts made through the annual salary review, as well as any additional changes in the year: for example to reflect promotions or role changes.
The UK workforce has been chosen as the most appropriate comparator group as it reflects the economic environment where the Group Chief Executive is employed.
Group Chief Executive pay compared with employee pay To further increase transparency of executive remuneration and its alignment with the pay of other employees, we are publishing our CEO pay ratio one year in advance of the disclosure becoming a requirement under the UK Companies Miscellaneous Reporting Regulations 2018.
The employee comparator group used for the purpose of this analysis is all UK employees.
This includes employees in M&GPrudential and Group Head Office in 2018.
The table below compares the Group Chief Executives single figure of total remuneration to that received by three representative UK employees in 2018.
25th percentile Median 75th percentile Year Method pay ratio pay ratio pay ratio 2018 Option B 155 : 1 102 : 1 68 : 1 Under the regulations there is a choice of three methods to determine the 25th, median and 75th full-time equivalent remuneration of our UK employees.
The Company has chosen to use the 2018 hourly rate gender pay gap information as this method uses data that is aligned with other disclosures made under our gender pay gap reporting Option B in the table above.
The employees used in the calculations were selected on 11 January 2019, following the end of the financial year.
The Committee determined that the identified employees are reasonably representative since the structure of their remuneration arrangements is in line with that of the majority of UK workforce.
The same methodology used for calculating the single figure for the Group Chief Executive has been used for calculating the pay and benefits of the UK employees.
The salary and total remuneration received during 2018 by the indicative employees used in the above analysis are set out below: Year 25th percentile Median 75th percentile 2018 salary 40,000 55,000 68,000 Total 2018 remuneration 48,000 73,000 109,000 The Committee believes the median pay ratio is consistent with the pay, reward and progression policies for our UK employees.
The base salary and total remuneration levels for the Group Chief Executive and the median representative employee are competitively positioned within the relevant markets and reflect the operation of our remuneration structures which are effective in appropriately incentivising staff, having regard to our risk framework, risk appetites and to rewarding the how as well as the what of performance.
Gender pay gap The UK business entities have recently reported their 2018 UK gender pay gap data and details can be found on the Groups website at www.
There has been narrowing of the pay gaps in some areas and modest increases in others.
While we have made progress, the gender pay gap cannot be removed overnight.
We remain focused and committed to closing it as quickly as possible.
We have a policy and carry out procedures to ensure that, where men and women perform similar roles, they are paid equally.
However, the gender pay gaps demonstrate the demographic profile of the business and the financial services sector more widely : there is a greater proportion of males in more senior and front-office roles and a greater proportion of females in more junior, support and back-office non-finance roles.
All the Groups businesses are continuing to work on initiatives to increase the proportion of women in senior management and operating roles as part of the Groups strategic focus on diversity and inclusion as described in the diversity and inclusion statement on our website.
This important priority is reflected in the Groups reward structure through the diversity measure attached to PLTIP awards granted from 2017 onwards.

Appointing high-calibre executives to the Board and to different roles on the Board is necessary to ensure the Company is well positioned to develop and implement its strategy and deliver long-term value.
As the Company operates in an international market place for talent, the best internal and external candidates are sometimes asked to move location to assume their new roles.
Where this happens, the Company will offer relocation support.
The support offered will depend on the circumstances of each move but may include paying for travel, shipping services, the provision of temporary accommodation and other housing benefits.
Executives may receive support with the preparation of tax returns, but no current Executive Director is tax equalised.
James Turner James Turner was appointed as Group Chief Risk Officer on 1 March 2018.

Buy-out awards In order to facilitate Mr Falcons appointment, the Company agreed to replace the 2018 bonus and other outstanding awards that Mr Falcon forfeited on leaving his previous employer, J. P. Morgan Asset Management.
2018 bonus The Committee approved an award under the AIP of US$2,637,179 in order to compensate Mr Falcon for the loss of his 2018 bonus.

In line with the Directors remuneration policy, 60 per cent of this will be delivered in cash and 40 per cent deferred into Prudential ADRs with dividend equivalents until the third anniversary of the grants award date, subject to the rules of the deferred AIP.
This bonus payment and AIP award will be made alongside 2018 bonus payments and deferred AIP awards for other Executive Directors.
Outstanding deferred awards The terms of Mr Falcons replacement awards were designed to replicate those of his forfeited restricted stock and fund units.
At the date of this report the Company is in a Closed Period and these awards will not be granted until we are in an Open Period following the announcement of 2018 results.
A portion of these awards that were due to vest in January 2019 will be compensated by a cash payment of US$1,316,551 to be paid in March 2019 after the date of this report.

This award entitles Mr Falcon to receive a cash amount equal to the market value of the specific notional number of Prudential ADRs on the date of exercise, less an award price of 10 pence per ADR.
The award will vest on the dates detailed below.

The Company will pay to transport Mr Falcons belongings from Hong Kong to the US and will then support his move within the US in line with our US domestic relocation policy.
These benefits will be included in the 2019 Directors remuneration report.
Payments to past Directors and payments for loss of office The Committees approach when exercising its discretion under the policy is to be mindful of the particular circumstance of the departure and the contribution the individual made to the Group.

When the Committee took these decisions, it considered the salary increases awarded to other employees in 2018 and the expected increases in 2019.
The external market reference points used to provide context to the Committee were identical to those used for 2018 salaries.
All Executive Directors received a salary increase of 2 per cent.
The 2019 salary increase budgets for other employees across the Groups business units were between 2 per cent and 8 per cent.
The Executive Directors bonus opportunities, performance measures and weightings will remain the same as in 2018.
Details of Michael Falcons recruitment arrangements have been provided under the Recruitment arrangements section.
The Committee considered his remuneration package with reference to internal and external reference points and determined that it was appropriate to appoint him on a lower salary and lower incentive opportunities than his predecessor, Barry Stowe, who had served on the Board over the last 12 years.
Having joined the Board on 7 January 2019, Michael Falcon will be eligible to receive a full year bonus for the 2019 financial year.
He will receive a 2019 long-term incentive award, granted under the PLTIP, with a face value on grant of 400 per cent of base salary.

They will remain in their executive roles and will continue to be members of the Group Executive Committee.
The remuneration of these executives will be managed in line with the approved Directors remuneration policy and they will not receive any loss of office payment in respect of their service as Directors.
Further details will be disclosed in website announcements and in the 2019 Directors remuneration report.
co. uk Annual Report 2018 Prudential plc 163 Directors remuneration report continued 2019 share-based long-term incentive awards The Executive Directors long-term incentive awards will continue to be made under the PLTIP and the opportunity levels remain the same as the 2018 PLTIP awards.
However, as highlighted in the Annual statement from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee at the beginning of this report, changes will be made to the vesting scale and measures under PLTIP for the 2019 awards only.
The vesting of these awards will depend on: Relative TSR 75 per cent of award : and Balanced scorecard of strategic measures 25 per cent of award.
Since these measures are in line with the remuneration requirements of Solvency II, the weightings of the Group Chief Risk Officers PLTIP performance targets will be the same as that of the other Executive Directors.
Under the Group TSR measure, 20 per cent of the award will vest for TSR at the median of the peer group, increasing to full vesting for performance within the upper quartile.
A comprehensive review of the TSR peer group has been undertaken for 2019 PLTIP awards as a number of years has passed since the group was last considered in detail.
The companies were selected based on organisational size, product mix and geographical footprint.
The peer group for 2019 PLTIP awards is set out below: Aegon AIA AXA Equitable China Taiping Insurance Great Eastern Lincoln National Manulife MetLife Ping An Insurance Principal Financial Prudential Financial Sun Life Financial The TSR peer group for 2017 and 2018 PLTIP awards remains unchanged.
Under the 2019 balanced scorecard, performance will be assessed for each of the four measures, at the end of the three-year performance period.
Performance will be assessed on a sliding scale.
Each of the measures has equal weighting and the 2019 measures are set out below: Capital measure: Cumulative three-year E-cap Group operating capital generation relative to plan, less cost of capital based on the capital position at the start of the performance period.
Vesting basis: 20 per cent vesting for achieving Plan, increasing to full vesting for performance above stretch level.
Vesting basis: 20 per cent vesting for partial achievement of the Groups expectations, increasing to full vesting for achieving the Groups expectations.
Diversity measure: Percentage of the Leadership Team that is female at the end of 2021.
The target for this metric will be based on progress towards the goal that the Company set when it signed the Women in Finance Charter, specifically that 30 per cent of our Leadership Team will be female by the end of 2021.
Vesting basis: 20 per cent vests for meeting the threshold of at least 28 per cent of our Leadership Team being female at the end of 2021, increasing to full vesting for reaching the stretch level of at least 32 per cent being female at that date.
Pension entitlements from 2019 Externally-recruited Executive Directors appointed on or after 1 March 2019 will be offered pension benefits of 20 per cent of salary, rather than the current level of 25 per cent of salary.
Given evolving practice in this area, pension benefits will be considered again as part of our review of the Directors remuneration policy.

In preparation for the demerger process the Committee has established a set of principles to underpin decisions on remuneration relating to the demerger, including: Executives should not be advantaged or disadvantaged by the demerger: the value of outstanding awards and their key terms release dates, holding periods, malus and clawback provisions should be unaffected: Where performance conditions need to be revised, the new conditions should be no more or less stretching that those originally attached to the awards: Where the Committee has applied discretion, this will be disclosed clearly: and The future arrangements of M&GPrudential will be a matter for the Board, Remuneration Committee and shareholders of the new business.
However, until the date of the demerger, the Prudential plc Remuneration Committee will have a responsibility for the remuneration of members of the plc Board and Group Executive Committee members and oversight of those M&GPrudential employees currently within its purview.
The Prudential plc Directors remuneration policy will continue to apply to all members of the plc Board until the date of the demerger and the Prudential plc Group-wide Remuneration Policy will continue to apply to all Group staff including those within the M&GPrudential business until the date of the demerger.
During 2019, we intend to review the Directors remuneration policy, taking into account the demerger, the views of our shareholders, the new UK Corporate Governance Code, forthcoming changes to accounting standards and the broader regulatory and competitive environment.

Executive Directors are invited to participate in these plans on the same basis as other staff in their location.
Save As You Earn SAYE schemes UK-based Executive Directors are normally eligible to participate in the HM Revenue and Customs HMRC approved Prudential Savings-Related Share Option Scheme.
This scheme allows all eligible employees to save towards the exercise of options over Prudential plc shares with the option price set at the beginning of the savings period at a discount of up to 20 per cent of the market price.
Since 2014 participants have been able to elect to enter into savings contracts of up to 500 per month for a period of three or five years.
At the end of this term, participants may exercise their options within six months and purchase shares.
If an option is not exercised within six months, participants are entitled to a refund of their cash savings plus interest if applicable under the rules.
Shares are issued to satisfy those options which are exercised.
No options may be granted under the schemes if the grant would cause the number of shares which have been issued, or which remain issuable pursuant to options granted in the preceding 10 years under the scheme and any other option schemes operated by the Company, or which have been issued under any other share incentive scheme of the Company, to exceed 10 per cent of the Companys ordinary share capital at the proposed date of grant.
In anticipation of the demerger of the M&GPrudential business the Company did not operate the SAYE in 2018.
Details of Executive Directors rights under the SAYE scheme are set out in the Outstanding share options table.
Share Incentive Plan SIP UK-based Executive Directors are also eligible to participate in the Companys Share Incentive Plan SIP.
Since April 2014, all UK-based employees have been able to purchase Prudential plc shares up to a value of 150 per month from their gross salary partnership shares through the SIP.
For every four partnership shares bought, an additional matching share is awarded which is purchased by Prudential plc on the open market.
Dividend shares accumulate while the employee participates in the plan.
If the employee withdraws from the plan, or leaves the Group, matching shares may be forfeited.
The table below provides information about shares purchased under the SIP together with matching shares awarded on a 1:4 basis and dividend shares.

For details of the cash-settled long-term incentive awards held by some Executive Directors, please see our Annual report on remuneration.
Dilution Releases from the Prudential Long Term Incentive Plan and the Prudential Agency Long Term Incentive Plan are satisfied using new issue shares rather than by purchasing shares in the open market.
Shares relating to options granted under all-employee share plans are also satisfied by new issue shares.
The combined dilution from all outstanding shares and options at 31 December 2018 was 1.11 per cent of the total share capital at the time.
Deferred bonus awards will continue to be satisfied by the purchase of shares in the open market.
