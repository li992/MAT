If the assets within the scheme deliver a return which is lower than the discount rate this will create or increase a deficit within the scheme.
This risk is reduced by holding a significant proportion of the scheme assets in matching assets bonds or similar.
As the scheme matures, it is anticipated that this proportion will increase to better match the assets and liabilities of the scheme.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in bond yields will typically increase liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an appreciation in the value of scheme assets held in bonds.
Inflation risk As the pension obligations are linked to inflation, higher inflation expectations will lead to higher liabilities.
The asset portfolio includes a significant proportion of inflation linked bonds to reduce this risk.
Member longevity The pension obligations provide benefits for the life of the members, therefore increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in liabilities and vice-versa.
Sensitivity analysis The following sets out the sensitivity of the actuarial value of liabilities to reasonably possible changes in assumptions compared with the actuarial assumptions adopted at 30 November 2018: A 0.5% decrease in the discount rate would increase the actuarial value of liabilities by 1.8m to 28.8m.
A one-year increase in life expectancy would increase the actuarial value of liabilities by 1.4m to 28.4m.
A 0.5% increase in the inflation rate would increase the actuarial value of liabilities by 1.1m to 28.1m.
A 0.5% increase in the rate of increase in deferred pensions would increase the actuarial value of liabilities by 0.1m to 27.1m.
A 0.5% increase in the rate of increase in pensions in payments would increase the actuarial value of liabilities by 1.1m to 28.1m.
Capital commitments At 30 November 2018 the Group had contracted capital expenditure of 19.0m 2017: 38.8m.
In addition the Groups share of the contracted capital expenditure of its joint venture undertakings was 5.2m 2017: 9.0m.
All capital commitments relate to investment properties.
