The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 FRS 102, the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland as issued by the Financial Reporting Council.
As the Company meets the definition of a qualifying company under FRS 100, as permitted by FRS 102, the Company has taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions: Presentation of a statement of cash flows: Disclosure of key management personnel compensation: Disclosure of related party transactions between wholly-owned subsidiaries and parents within a group: Disclosures required under IFRS 2 Share-Based Payments in respect of Group settled share-based payments: Disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures: Certain disclosures required under IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement: and Disclosure of information in relation to new standards not yet applied.
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis and on the going concern basis.
The Companys financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling being the Companys functional currency.
Going concern The Groups principal objective, of which the Company is the holding company, is to manage cash and debt to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern for the foreseeable future.
The Group retains sufficient resources to comfortably remain in compliance with the financial covenants of its bank facilities.
The Directors have also assessed the Groups prospects and viability over a three-year period.
The Directors therefore consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

The loss for the year to 31 December 2018 was 1.4 million 2017: 1.6 million.

Principal accounting policies Investments in subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Company.
Control exists where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The investment in the Companys subsidiaries is recorded at cost less provisions for impairment.
Carrying values are reviewed for impairment either annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible decline in carrying values.
The Company uses forecast cash flow information and estimates of future growth to assess whether investments are impaired.
If the results of operations in a future period are adverse to the estimates used for impairment testing, an impairment may be triggered at that point.
Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on timing differences which arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
Timing differences are not provided for differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is not probable that they will reverse in the foreseeable future and the reporting entity is able to control the reversal of the timing difference.
Deferred tax is not recognised on permanent differences arising because certain types of income or expense are non-taxable or are disallowable for tax or because certain tax charges or allowances are greater or smaller than the corresponding income or expense.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rate that is expected to apply to the reversal of the related difference, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that is it probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.

Principal accounting policies continued Share-based payments Certain employees of the Company receive part of their remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured at fair value at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value of share awards with market-related vesting conditions is determined by an external consultant and the fair value at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Companys estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each balance sheet reporting date up to the vesting date, at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the actual outcome of awards which have vested.
No adjustment is made to the fair value after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or not exercised.
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries, it recognises an increase in the cost of investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity-settled share-based payment charge recognised in the subsidiarys financial statements with the corresponding credit being recognised directly in equity.
In cases where a subsidiary is recharged for the share-based payment expense, no such increase in investment is recognised.
Shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust The EBT provides for the issue of shares to Group employees under share incentive schemes.
The Company has control of the EBT and accounts for the EBT as an extension to the Company in the financial statements.
Accordingly, shares in the Company held by the EBT are included in the balance sheet at cost as a deduction from equity.
Directors emoluments The Company has 2 employees other than the Directors.
Full details of the Directors remuneration and interests are set out in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 68 to 75.
