COMBINED EARNINGS PER SHARE The combined earnings per share calculations are based on the average number of share units representing the combined ordinary shares of NV and PLC in issue during the period, less the average number of shares held as treasury shares.
In calculating diluted earnings per share and underlying earnings per share, a number of adjustments are made to the number of shares, principally, the exercise of share options by employees.
Underlying earnings per share is calculated as underlying profit attributable to shareholders equity divided by the diluted combined average number of share units.
In calculating underlying profit attributable to shareholders equity, net profit attributable to shareholders equity is adjusted to eliminate the post-tax impact of non-underlying items in operating profit and any other significant unusual items within net profit but not operating profit.
