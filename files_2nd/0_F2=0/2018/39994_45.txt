The carrying value of deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities principally arising on the acquisition of Sky Deutschland was 401 million as at 30 June 2018 2017: 296 million.
The majority of the deferred tax asset relates to tax losses in the German and Austrian businesses, which can be carried forward indefinitely.
The Directors have concluded that it is probable that there will be sufficient future taxable profits against which the German and Austrian losses can be utilised, taking into account the Groups latest available medium term plan, which was considered by the Companys Board of Directors, and extrapolated beyond the forecast period as disclosed in note 10.
The forecast shows that the Group will continue to benefit from the utilisation of the tax losses beyond the initial forecasting period.
For further details regarding this judgement, please refer to the Groups critical accounting policies and the use of judgement and estimates section, contained in note 1.
