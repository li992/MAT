SECTION 5: OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES This section provides information on the assets and liabilities in the Consolidated balance sheet that are not covered in other sections, including goodwill, other intangible assets and provisions.
5.1 ACQUISITIONS Accounting policy Acquisitions of businesses are recognised at the point the Group obtains control of the target the acquisition date.
The consideration transferred and the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are measured at their fair value on the acquisition date.
The assets and liabilities are recognised in the Consolidated balance sheet and the revenues and profit or loss of the acquired business are recognised in the Consolidated income statement from the acquisition date.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement in the period the acquisition occurs as an exceptional item.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
Acquisition of ScottishPower Generation Limited The Group announced the proposed acquisition of ScottishPower Generation Limited from Iberdrola on 16 October 2018.
The acquisition was approved by shareholders on 21 December 2018 and subsequently completed at 23:59 on 31 December 2018.
ScottishPower Generation Limited was renamed Drax Generation Enterprise Limited DGE on 9 January 2019.
DGE owns and operates a portfolio of hydro, pumped storage and gas-fired power generation assets, including Cruachan Power Station, one of only four pumped storage assets in the UK, run-of-river hydro schemes in Lanark and Galloway, and gas-fired Combined Cycle Gas Turbine CCGT power stations at Damhead Creek, Rye House and Shoreham in the south of England, and Blackburn Mill in the north.
DGE also owns SMW Ltd, a company operating a biomass-from-waste facility on the outskirts of Glasgow.
The new sites are complementary to the Groups existing generation activities, diversifying the Drax portfolio and widening the Groups UK footprint.
The expanded portfolio of assets ensures the Group can support a power system with increasing intermittent renewable capacity by providing flexible generation and system support.
The acquired assets are expected to make a positive contributions to both Adjusted EBITDA and cash flows from 2019, as set out in the shareholder Circular recommending the acquisition, on 5 December 2018, and in the profit forecast referenced on page 41 of this Annual report.
The purchase consideration was 702 million, payable entirely in cash, subject to working capital adjustments customary for a transaction of this type.
In addition, following the suspension of the UK Capacity Market on 15 November 2018, the Group announced it had agreed a risk-sharing mechanism with the vendor which will activate in the event the Group does not receive 100% of the contracted Capacity Market payments for the acquired assets in the period 1 January to 30 September 2019.
If 100% of Capacity Market payments are not received in this period, a further payment will be made either by the Group or by the vendor, the value and beneficiary of which is contingent upon the 2019 gross profit achieved by the acquired assets.
The value of any further payment for both parties is capped at 26 million.
Full details are set out on the Groups website.
In the event Capacity Market payments remain suspended beyond 2019, the Group will be entitled to no further compensation.
Reflecting the Groups belief that the Capacity Market is likely to be reinstated during 2019, no value has been ascribed to the risk-sharing mechanism in determining the fair value of the consideration payable on the acquisition date.
In the event the Capacity Market restarts and the Group receives payments relating to the period following the Capacity Market suspension but prior to the acquisition date 1 October to 31 December 2018, these payments will be passed directly to the vendor and accordingly no amounts are recorded in the provisional fair values shown below.
The total consideration, after adjusting for estimated working capital values, was 687 million.
The consideration remains provisional and is subject to a completion accounts process.
The consideration was paid on 2 January 2019, funded by a combination of existing cash reserves 137 million and the partial drawing of a 725 million acquisition bridge facility 550 million.
The Group expects to conclude a refinancing of the bridge facility during 2019, as described in note 4.3.
Acquisition-related costs, including stamp duty and advisers fees, amounted to 18.4 million and have been recognised in 2018.
The Group incurred a further 2.6 million of costs in 2018 on activities to ensure operational readiness and initial integration activities at completion.
The total costs of 21.0 million are reported as exceptional items and included in the acquisition and restructuring line in the income statement.

Provisional goodwill of 74.8 million is largely reflective of the trading and operational opportunities that arise from acquiring a multi-site multi-fuel generation portfolio together with the assembled skilled workforce.
None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Intangible assets reflect software previously recognised on the balance sheet of the acquiree.
The financial assets acquired include 35.8 million of receivables, the majority of which reflect trade receivables for ancillary services and balancing market activity.
By virtue of their short tenor, the fair value of these receivables is considered to be the contractual amounts receivable less any provision for doubtful debts.
The provision for doubtful debts as at the acquisition date was less than 0.1 million.
Financial assets includes a net balance of 3.5 million in respect of amounts payable to and receivable from the vendor and its fellow group undertakings.
The Group received an initial settlement in respect of these balances on 2 January 2019, which will be finalised as part of the completion accounts process.
Additional financial information The consolidated results of the Group, assuming DGE had been acquired at the beginning of the year, would show Total revenue of 4,780.0 million compared to reported Total revenue of 4,229.0 million and a Total profit after taxation of 43.2 million compared to the reported Total profit after taxation of 20.2 million.
This information includes the revenue and profits made by DGE and its subsidiary undertaking between 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2018, extracted from the historical financial records of the acquired companies.
Profit centre analysis was used to exclude the historic results and restructuring activities relating to assets not acquired by the Group: however no adjustment has been made for the alignment of accounting policies nor the impact of measuring acquired assets and liabilities at fair value.
This information is not necessarily indicative of the results of the combined Group that would have been achieved had the acquisition actually occurred on 1 January 2018, nor is it indicative of the future results of the combined Group.
5.2 GOODWILL Goodwill arises on the acquisition of a business when the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the assets acquired.
Accounting policy Goodwill is initially recognised and measured at the acquisition date.
Goodwill is not amortised but reviewed for impairment at least annually.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the CGU to which it relates and the recoverable amount for that CGU assessed.
The table below shows movements and balances: Goodwill m Cost and carrying amount: At 1 January 2017 14.5 Acquisition of Opus Energy 159.2 Disposal of Billington Bioenergy 3.8 At 31 December 2017 169.9 Acquisition of ScottishPower Generation Limited see note 5.1 74.8 At 31 December 2018 244.7 Total goodwill in the Consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2018 was 244.7 million, with 10.7 million arising on the acquisition of Haven Power in 2009 attributed to the Haven Power CGU and 159.2 million arising on the acquisition of Opus Energy in 2017 attributed to the Opus Energy CGU.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 149 SECTION 5: OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES continued 5.2 GOODWILL continued In addition, the Group recognised 74.8 million of provisional goodwill in respect of the ScottishPower transaction in 2018 see note 5.1.
Reflecting the timing of the acquisition, none of the provisional goodwill has been allocated to individual CGUs.
This will be completed during 2019.
Impairment review The recoverable amount of the Haven Power and Opus Energy CGUs is measured annually, based on a value-in-use calculation using the Groups established planning model.
This model depends on a broad range of assumptions, the most significant of which are customer margins and supply volumes.
Inherent in these assumptions are expectations about future energy prices and supply costs.
Cash flows beyond the business plan period are inflated into perpetuity using a growth rate of 1%.
The carrying amount of the Haven Power CGU at 31 December 2018 was 40 million.
The expected future cash flows of the CGU were discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 8.1% calculated based on independent analysis commissioned by the Group, adjusted to the specific circumstances and risk factors affecting the Groups B2B Energy Supply business.
We believe that this rate reflects the prospects for a well-established B2B Energy Supply business.
The value in use of the Haven Power CGU, including the goodwill, was significantly in excess of its carrying amount.
The carrying amount of the Opus Energy CGU at 31 December 2018 was 342 million, including intangible assets of 162 million.
Following further integration of Opus Energy into the Groups existing B2B Energy Supply business during 2018, the discount rate was assessed as being in line with that of Haven Power at 8.1%.
The value in use of the Opus Energy CGU, including the goodwill and intangible assets, was significantly in excess of its carrying amount.
Reflecting the recent acquisition of Opus, the recoverable amount of the Opus CGU was tested using a range of discount rates up to the rate used in the acquisition valuation of intangible assets in 2017 10.7% application of discount rates across the 8.1% to 10.7% range would not result in an impairment charge.
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis of the estimates of future cash flows of each CGU.
This analysis indicates that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions, which are customer margins and supply volumes, would not cause an impairment loss in respect of goodwill.
5.3 INTANGIBLE ASSETS Intangible assets are not physical in nature but are identifiable and separable from other assets.
Intangible assets can be acquired in business combinations such as the acquisition of Opus Energy during 2017 or purchased separately.
The Group routinely purchases computer software and carbon emissions allowances, which are considered intangible assets.
Accounting policy Intangibles acquired in business combinations are measured at fair value on the acquisition date.
Other intangible assets are measured at cost.
Cost comprises the purchase price net of any discount or rebate and any directly attributable costs to bring the asset into the condition and location required for use as intended by management.
Intangible assets are amortised over their anticipated useful lives.
Useful lives are reviewed at each balance sheet date.
No changes to useful lives were made as at 31 December 2018.
Amortisation calculations are specific to each category of assets and are explained in further detail below.
Carrying amounts are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
The customer-related assets and brand are attributed to the Opus Energy CGU and details of the impairment test relating to this CGU are included in note 5.2.

The asset valuation of 211 million reflected the estimated value of the future cash flows associated with this customer base at the acquisition date and is dependent upon estimates of both current and expected future contract margins and assumed customer retention rates.
The cash flows have been discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 10.7%.
The asset has an estimated useful life of 11 years, calculated based on customer churn-rate analysis, and is being amortised on a reducing balance basis to reflect the diminishing rate of contract renewals over time.
Opus Energy brand The Opus Energy brand was acquired as part of the acquisition in February 2017 and valued at 11 million on a relief-from-royalty method.
The brand is being amortised on a straight-line basis over its assumed 10 year useful life.
Computer software Additions in the period include assets acquired in the Opus Energy acquisition in addition to those in the ordinary course of business, which principally reflect ongoing investment in business systems to support the B2B Energy Supply segment.
Software assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from three to five years.
As at 31 December 2018, computer software assets in the course of construction amounted to 24.5 million 2017: 11.1 million.
Development assets The development assets arose on the acquisition of four Open Cycle Gas Turbine projects in December 2016 and reflect the value of planning and consents.
Until operations commence, the assets are considered to have an indefinite life and thus are not amortised and are subject to impairment testing at each balance sheet date.
At 31 December 2018, the recoverable amount of the development assets was established using a value-in-use calculation derived from the Groups established planning model.
The assessment reflected the Groups core planning assumption that the Capacity Market will be reinstated during 2019 and incorporated assumptions related to likely Capacity Market clearing prices, construction costs, the ongoing revenues to be derived from the projects once constructed and the direct costs of generating those revenues.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 151 SECTION 5: OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES continued 5.3 INTANGIBLE ASSETS continued The expected future cash flows were discounted using a pre-tax rate of 9.1%, which includes an assessment of the level of construction and execution risk inherent in the existing assets and quality of revenue if constructed.
The analysis indicated a recoverable amount in excess of the current carrying amount of the development assets.
The analysis is sensitive to the discount rate applied.
Increasing the pre-tax discount rate by approximately 1% would result in a recoverable amount below the current carrying value.
In the event costs materially increase, or expected future revenue streams reduce from current estimates, the Group may not proceed with the projects and the assets currently recognised on the balance sheet would be impaired.
In particular, the analysis depends upon achieving an acceptable clearing price in future Capacity Market auctions or equivalent income if the Capacity Market is not reinstated in its previous form.
Carbon assets Carbon assets arise on the purchase of CO emissions allowances in excess of the amount allocated under the Emissions Trading 2 Scheme and required for the current financial year, and are measured at cost, net of any impairment.
Given their short tenor, carbon assets are not amortised.
In the event of the UK exiting the EU without a deal, these allowances may no longer be required, as noted in the risks and viability statements on pages 42 to 49.
The charge to the income statement, within fuel costs, reflects the cost of emissions allowances required to satisfy the obligation for the current year and takes into account generation and market purchases allocated to the current financial year, and to the extent further purchases are required, is based on the market price at the balance sheet date.
5.4 PROVISIONS We make provision for reinstatement to cover the estimated costs of decommissioning and demolishing our generation assets and remediating the sites at the end of the useful economic lives of the assets.
Accounting policy Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Specifically, provision is made for the estimated decommissioning costs at the end of the useful economic life of the Groups generating assets, when a legal or constructive obligation arises, on a discounted basis.
The amount provided is calculated on a site-by-site basis and represents the present value of the expected costs.
In view of the uncertainty of assessing the amount of any proceeds from the disposal of the assets at the decommissioning date, no reduction in the provision is made for any such proceeds.
The discount rate used is a risk-free pre-tax rate that reflects the duration of the liability.
The average discount rate used across the Groups decommissioning provisions is 1.8% 2017: 1.8%.
The use of a risk-free rate reflects the fact that the estimated future cash flows have built-in risks specific to the liability.
An amount equivalent to the discounted provision is capitalised within property, plant and equipment and is depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets.
The unwinding of the discount is included in interest payable and similar charges.
Other provisions include a small provision in respect of dilapidation provisions for leased offices and other provisions recognised as part of the acquisition of ScottishPower Generation Limited see note 5.1.

The decommissioning provision is based on the assumption that the decommissioning and reinstatement will take place at the end of the expected useful life of each site which varies between 2026 and 2039 and has been estimated using existing technology at current prices based on independent third-party advice, updated on a triennial basis.
The most recent updates took place in December 2017 for Drax Power Station, and 2018 for other sites.
