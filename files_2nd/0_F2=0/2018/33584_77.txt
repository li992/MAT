RETIREMENT BENEFITS Overview The Group operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans with the most significant plans being in South Africa and the United Kingdom.
It also operates post employment medical plans, the majority of which are unfunded, principally inSouth Africa.
The post employment medical plans provide health benefits to retired employees and certain dependants.
Defined contribution plans The charge for the year for defined contribution pension plans net of amounts capitalised and special items was $148million 2017: $158 million and for defined contribution medical plans net of amounts capitalised was $71million 2017:$74million.
Defined benefit pension plans and post employment medical plans Characteristics of plans The majority of the defined benefit pension plans are funded.
The assets of these plans are held separately from those of the Group, in independently administered funds, in accordance with statutory requirements or local practice in the relevant jurisdiction.
The responsibility for the governance of the funded retirement benefit plans, including investment and funding decisions, lies with the Trustees of each scheme.
The unfunded liabilities are principally in relation totermination indemnity plans in Chile.
South Africa The pension plans in South Africa are in surplus.
All pension plans in South Africa are closed to new members and the majority of plans are closed to future benefit accrual.
As the plans are in surplus no employer contributions are currently being made.
The Groups provision of anti-retroviral therapy to HIV positive staff does not significantly impact the post employment medical plan liability.
The liabilities of a South African pension fund were transferred during the year, giving rise to a loss on curtailment of $80 million.
United Kingdom The Group operates funded pension plans in the United Kingdom.
These plans are closed to new members and to the future accrual of benefits.
The Group iscommitted to make payments to certain United Kingdom pension plans under deficit funding plans agreed with the respective Trustees.
Other Other pension and post employment medical plans primarily comprise obligations in Chile where legislation requires employers to provide for a termination indemnity, entitling employees to a cash payment made on the termination of an employment contract.
Contributions Employer contributions are made in accordance with the terms of each plan and may vary from year to year.
Employer contributions made to funded pension plans inthe year ended 31December 2018 were $191million 2017: $100 million including a one-off contribution of $115 million by fide Beers from the sale proceeds of the Charterhouse Street disposal.
In addition, $12 million 2017: $11 million of benefits were paid to unfunded pension plans and $25 million 2017: $25 million of benefits were paid in relation topost employment medical plans.
The Group expects to contribute $60million toits pension plans and $26 million to its post employment medical plans in2019.

The fair value of the assets of the funded plans was sufficient to cover 118% 2017:111% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected increases in future earnings and pensions.
The present value of unfunded obligations includes $181 million 2017: $178 million relating to active members.
All material investments are quoted.
In South Africa the asset recognised is restricted to the amount in the Employer Surplus Account.
The Employer Surplus Account is the amount that the Group is entitled to by way of a refund, taking into consideration any contingency reserves as recommended by the funds actuaries.
Actuarial assumptions The principal assumptions used to determine the actuarial present value of benefit obligations and pension charges and credits are detailed below shown as weighted averages : 2018 2017 South United South United Africa Kingdom Other Africa Kingdom Other Defined benefit pension plans Average discount rate for plan liabilities 9.8% 2.9% 5.3% 9.6% 2.6% 5.7% Average rate of inflation 6.3% 3.2% 3.0% 6.7% 3.2% 3.0% Average rate of increase of pensions in payment 6.3% 3.4% 2.8% 6.7% 3.2% 2.8% Post employment medical plans Average discount rate for plan liabilities 9.8% n a 7.7% 9.6% n a 8.0% Average rate of inflation 6.3% n a 5.3% 6.7% n a 5.6% Expected average increase in healthcare costs 8.4% n a 7.8% 8.4% n a 8.0% The weighted average duration of the South African plans is 11 years 2017: 10 years, United Kingdom plans is 18years 2017: 19 years and plans in other regions is 13 years 2017: 13 years.
This represents the average period over which future benefit payments are expected to be made.
Mortality assumptions are determined based on standard mortality tables with adjustments, as appropriate, to reflect experience of conditions locally.
InSouth Africa, the PA90 tables are used.
The main plans in the United Kingdom use CMI tables or Club Vita models with plan specific adjustments based onmortality investigations.
Themortality tables used imply that a male or female aged 60 at the balance sheet date has the following future life expectancy shown as weighted averages : Male Female Years 2018 2017 2018 2017 South Africa 18.8 20.0 23.4 24.8 United Kingdom 27.7 27.6 29.2 29.0 Other 24.2 22.7 28.4 26.6 The table below summarises the expected life expectancy from the age of 60 for a male or female aged 45 at the balance sheet date.
When viewed together with the respective life expectancy at age 60 in the table above this indicates the anticipated improvement in life expectancy shown as weighted averages : Male Female Years 2018 2017 2018 2017 South Africa 18.8 20.0 23.4 24.8 United Kingdom 28.8 28.3 30.7 30.2 Other 25.2 24.7 29.3 28.5 170 Anglo American plc Integrated Annual Report 2018 Financial statements FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS EMPLOYEES 27.
RETIREMENT BENEFITS continued Risks of plans The Group has identified the main risk to its defined benefit pension schemes as being interest rate risk due to the impact on the UK discount rate assumption: Risk Description Mitigation Interest rate risk A fall in longer-term real and nominal The Trustees investment strategies vary by plan for the UK and include investing, with the interest rates expectations causes gilt intention of counter-balancing the movements in the liabilities, in fully owned fully funded yields and corporate bond yields to physical credit and gilts, and by gaining unfunded exposure to gilts via gilt repurchase decrease, which results in a lower agreements and other fixed income based derivatives to match the real and nominal interest discount rate being applied to the UK rate sensitivity of the pension scheme liabilities.
pension liabilities and so, with all else Approximately 75-100% depending on the scheme of the pension scheme liabilities are being held equal, the value of the currently hedged against movements in real and nominal interest rates.
The Trustees hedging strategies are typically designed to protect the respective schemes If the pension scheme assets do not funding plans against volatility in market yields.
Thediscount rate used to calculate any funding increase by the same amount as the requirement for the schemes is linked to gilt yields rather than to corporate bond yields as increase in the pension scheme required under IAS19.
Consequently the valuation of the net retirement benefit obligation liabilities caused by the fall in interest foraccounting purposes remains susceptible to movements in value due to the difference rates then, all else being equal, this between corporate bond and gilt yields.
In addition, since corporate bond yields are typically will result in a worsening of the higher than gilt yields, this can result in therecognition of accounting surpluses in respect of pension scheme funding position.
schemes where cash contributions continue to be made to meet funding shortfalls.
Sensitivity analysis Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of pension and medical plan liabilities are the discount rate, inflation rate and mortality.
The sensitivity analysis below has been provided by local actuaries on an approximate basis based on changes in the assumptions occurring at the end of the year, assuming that all other assumptions are held constant and the effect of interrelationships is excluded.
The effect on plan liabilities is as follows: 2018 South United US$ million Africa Kingdom Other Total Discount rate 0.5% decrease 38 328 17 383 Inflation rate pension plans 0.5% increase 20 115 11 146 Inflation rate medical plans 0.5% increase 16 3 19 Life expectancy increase by 1 year 28 167 4 199 Independent qualified actuaries carry out full valuations at least every three years using the projected unit credit method.
The actuaries have updated the valuations to 31 December 2018.
Assumptions are set after consultation with the qualified actuaries.
While management believes the assumptions used are appropriate, achange in the assumptions used would impact the Groups other comprehensive income.
