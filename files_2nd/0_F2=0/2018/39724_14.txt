171592 Schroder AsiaPacific Fund Annual Report Pt3 171592 Schroder AsiaPacific Fund Annual Report Pt3 10 12 2018 14:12 Page 35 Notes to the Accounts 1.
Accounting Policies a Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP, in particular in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard FRS 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland, and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts the SORP issued by the Association of Investment Companies in November 2014 and updated in February 2018.
All of the Companys operations are of a continuing nature.
The Company has not presented a statement of cash flows as it is not required for an investment trust which meets certain conditions.
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of investments held at fair value through profit or loss.
The accounts are presented in sterling and amounts have been rounded to the nearest thousand.
The accounting policies applied to these accounts are consistent with those applied in the accounts for the year ended 30 September 2017.
No significant judgements, estimates or assumptions have been required in the preparation of the accounts for the current or preceding financial years.
b Valuation of investments The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment objective and information is provided internally on that basis to the Companys board of directors.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition the investments are designated by the Company as held at fair value through profit or loss.
Investments are included initially at fair value which is taken to be their cost, excluding expenses incidental to purchase which are written off to capital at the time of acquisition.
Subsequently the investments are valued at fair value, which are quoted bid prices for investments traded in active markets.
Investments that are unlisted or not actively traded are valued using a variety of techniques to determine their fair value: any such valuations are reviewed by both the AIFMs fair value pricing committee and by the directors.
All purchases and sales are accounted for on a trade date basis.
c Accounting for reserves Gains and losses on sales of investments are included in the Income Statement and in capital reserves within Gains and losses on sales of investments.
Increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end are included in the Income Statement and in capital reserves within Holding gains and losses on investments.
Foreign exchange gains and losses on cash and deposit balances and unrealised exchange gains and losses on foreign currency loans are included in the Income Statement and in capital reserves.
The cost of repurchasing shares, including the related stamp duty and transactions costs, is charged to Share repurchase reserve.
d Income Dividends receivable are included in revenue on an ex-dividend basis except where, in the opinion of the board, the dividend is capital in nature, in which case it is included in capital.
Overseas dividends are included gross of any withholding tax.
Where the Company has elected to receive scrip dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised in revenue.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in capital.
Interest receivable from debt securities, together with any premium or discount on purchase, is recognised using the effective interest method.
Deposit interest outstanding at the year end is calculated and accrued on a time apportionment basis using market rates of interest.
e Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are allocated wholly to the revenue column of the Income Statement with the following exceptions: Annual Report and Accounts 35 for the year ended 30 September 2018 Financial 171592 Schroder AsiaPacific Fund Annual Report Pt3 171592 Schroder AsiaPacific Fund Annual Report Pt3 10 12 2018 14:12 Page 36 Notes to the Accounts In order to better reflect the increasing significance of income as part of total return, the board has, with effect from 1 October 2017, adopted an allocation policy whereby a proportion of indirect costs are allocated to the capital account.
Based on the boards expected long-term split of returns in the form of capital gains and income respectively, from the Companys investment portfolio, it has determined that 75% of the management fee will be allocated to capital and the remaining 25% to revenue.
It had previously allocated the management fee wholly to revenue.
The effect of this change on the Income Statement for the year ended 30 September 2018, is to increase net revenue return after taxation by 5,243,000 3.13p per share and to reduce net capital return by the same amount.
Total return after taxation is unaffected by the change.
The comparative figures have not been restated.
Expenses incidental to the purchase or sale of an investment are charged to capital.
These expenses are commonly referred to as transaction costs and mainly comprise brokerage commission.
Details of transaction costs are given in note 10 on page 39. f Finance costs Finance costs, including any premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest method and in accordance with the provisions of FRS 102.
For the reasons detailed in part e to this note above, the board has determined that with effect from 1 October 2017, 75% of finance costs will be allocated to capital and the remaining 25% to revenue.
It had previously allocated finance costs wholly to revenue.
The effect of this change on the Income Statement for the year ended 30 September 2018, is to increase the revenue return after taxation by 867,000 0.52p per share and to reduce net capital return by the same amount.
g Financial instruments Cash at bank and in hand may comprise cash and demand deposits which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
Other debtors and creditors do not carry any interest, are short-term in nature and are accordingly stated at nominal value, with debtors reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Bank loans and overdrafts are classified as loans and receivables and are initially measured at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
They are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
h Taxation Current tax is provided at the amounts expected to be received or paid.
Deferred tax is accounted for in accordance with FRS 102.
Deferred tax is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the accounting date.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable timing differences but deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those timing differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rate which is expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and is measured on an undiscounted basis.
i Value added tax VAT Expenses are disclosed inclusive of any related irrecoverable VAT.
j Foreign currency In accordance with FRS 102, the Company is required to nominate a functional currency, being the currency in which the Company predominantly operates.
The board, having regard to the currency of the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its shareholders operate, has determined that sterling is the functional currency and the currency in which the accounts are presented Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted at actual exchange rates as at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets, liabilities and equity investments held at fair value, denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at 1600 hours on the accounting date.
k Dividends payable In accordance with FRS 102, the final dividend is included in the accounts in the year in which it is paid.

Share repurchase transactions are accounted for on a trade date basis.
The nominal value of share capital repurchased and cancelled is transferred out of Called-up share capital and into Capital redemption reserve.

b Factors affecting tax charge for the year The tax assessed for the year is lower 2017: lower than the Company's applicable rate of corporation tax for the year of 19.0% 2017: 19.5%.
The factors affecting the current tax charge for the year are as follows: 2018 2017 Revenue Capital Total Revenue Capital Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Net return on ordinary activities before taxation 18,075 18,128 36,203 10,736 140,876 151,612 Net return on ordinary activities before taxation multiplied by the Company's applicable rate of corporation tax for the year of 19.0% 2017: 19.5% 3,434 3,444 6,878 2,094 27,471 29,565 Effects of: Capital returns on investments 4,550 4,550 27,454 27,454 Income not chargeable to corporation tax 3,718 55 3,773 3,289 17 3,306 Overseas withholding tax 1,492 1,492 1,199 1,199 Taiwanese withholding tax recovered 302 302 Overseas capital gains tax 529 529 1111 Unrelieved expenses 284 1,161 1,445 1,195 1,195 Taxation on ordinary activities 1,190 529 1,719 1,199 11 1,210 c Deferred taxation The Company has an unrecognised deferred tax asset of 6,984,000 2017: 5,691,000 based on a prospective corporation tax rate of 17.0% 2017: 17.0%.
The reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax was substantively enacted in September 2016 and is effective from 1 April 2020.
The deferred tax asset has arisen due to the cumulative excess of deductible expenses over taxable income.
Given the composition of the Companys portfolio, it is not likely that this asset will be utilised in the foreseeable future and therefore no asset has been recognised in the accounts.
Given the Companys intention to meet the conditions required to retain its status as an Investment Trust Company, no provision has been made for deferred UK capital gains tax on any capital gains or losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.

Disclosures regarding financial instruments measured at fair value The Companys financial instruments within the scope of FRS 102 that are held at fair value comprise its investment portfolio.
The Company has held derivative financial instruments during the year, but none were held at the year end.
FRS 102 requires that financial instruments held at fair value are categorised into a hierarchy consisting of the three levels below.
A fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
Level 1 valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.
Level 2 valued using observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1.
Level 3 valued using inputs that are unobservable.
Details of the valuation techniques used by the Company are given in note 1 b on page 35.
At 30 September 2018, the Company's investments were all categorised in Level 1 2017: same.
Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies The investment objective is set out on the inside front cover of this report.
In pursuing this objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of financial risks that could result in a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for dividends.
These financial risks include market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and market price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The directors policy for managing these risks is set out below.
The board coordinates the Companys risk management policy.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks and the methods used to measure the risks that are set out below, have not changed from those applying in the comparative year.
The Companys classes of financial instruments may comprise the following: investments in shares, warrants, depositary receipts and government bonds which are held in accordance with the Companys investment objective: short-term debtors, creditors and cash arising directly from its operations: a multi-currency overdraft facility with HSBC Bank plc, the purpose of which is to assist in financing the Companys operations: and a multi-currency revolving credit facility with Scotiabank Europe plc, the purpose of which is to assist in financing the Companys operations.
a Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements: currency risk, interest rate risk and market price risk.
Information to enable an evaluation of the nature and extent of these three elements of market risk is given in parts i to iii of this note, together with sensitivity analyses where appropriate.
The board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and these policies have remained unchanged from those applying in the comparative year.
The Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
i Currency risk Certain of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling, which is the Companys functional currency and the presentational currency of the accounts.
As a result, movements in exchange rates will affect the sterling value of those items.
Schroder AsiaPacific Fund plc 42 171592 Schroder AsiaPacific Fund Annual Report Pt3 171592 Schroder AsiaPacific Fund Annual Report Pt3 10 12 2018 14:12 Page 43 Notes to the Accounts Management of currency risk The Manager monitors the Companys exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the board, which meets on at least four occasions each year.
The Manager measures the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and income of a movement in the rates of exchange to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
The Company may use foreign currency borrowings or forward foreign currency contracts to limit the exposure to anticipated changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted into sterling on receipt.
Foreign currency exposure The fair value of the Companys monetary items that have foreign currency exposure at 30 September are shown below.
The Companys investments which are not monetary items have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.
Annual Report and Accounts 43 for the year ended 30 September 2018 Financial 171592 Schroder AsiaPacific Fund Annual Report Pt3 171592 Schroder AsiaPacific Fund Annual Report Pt3 10 12 2018 14:12 Page 44 Notes to the Accounts Foreign currency sensitivity The following tables illustrate the sensitivity of net profit for the year and net assets with regard to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities and exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary currency financial instruments held at each accounting date and assumes a 10% 2017: 10% appreciation or depreciation in sterling against all the currencies to which the Company is exposed, which is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on the volatility of exchange rates during the year.
If sterling had weakened by 10% this would have had the following effect: 2018 2017 000 000 Income Statement return after taxation Revenue return 1,811 1,595 Capital return 3,663 3,547 Total return after taxation 1,852 1,952 Net assets 1,852 1,952 Conversely if sterling had strengthened by 10% this would have had the following effect: 2018 2017 000 000 Income Statement return after taxation Revenue return 1,811 1,595 Capital return 3,663 3,547 Total return after taxation 1,852 1,952 Net assets 1,852 1,952 In the opinion of the directors, the above sensitivity analysis with respect to monetary financial assets and liabilities is broadly representative of the whole of the current and comparative year.
The sensitivity with regard to the Companys investments and foreign currency is subsumed into market price risk sensitivity on page 45. ii Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable on cash deposits and the interest payable on variable rate borrowings when interest rates are re-set.
The fair value of any government bonds held in the Companys portfolio may be affected by interest rate movements or the expectation of such movements in the future.
However, it is not possible to assess the impact of interest rate movements on the value of these investments accurately and therefore the exposure would be included in other price risk in part iii to this note.
Management of interest rate risk Liquidity and borrowings are managed with the aim of increasing returns to shareholders.
The board would not expect gearing to exceed 20% where gearing is defined as borrowings used for investment purposes, less cash, expressed as a percentage of net assets.
The possible effects on cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when the Company draws on the credit facility.
However, amounts drawn on this facility are for short-term periods and therefore exposure to interest rate risk is not significant.
Interest rate exposure The exposure of financial assets and financial liabilities to floating interest rates, giving cash flow interest rate risk when rates are re-set, is shown below: 2018 2017 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates: Cash at bank and in hand 20,439 7,213 Creditors: amounts falling due within one year borrowings on the credit facility 42,141 42,716 Net exposure 21,702 35,503 Schroder AsiaPacific Fund plc 44 171592 Schroder AsiaPacific Fund Annual Report Pt3 171592 Schroder AsiaPacific Fund Annual Report Pt3 10 12 2018 14:12 Page 45 Notes to the Accounts Interest receivable on cash balances is at a margin below LIBOR 2017: same.
During the year, the Company extended its 364 day, multi-currency credit facility with Scotiabank Europe plc to 26 April 2019, and increased the facility limit from 50 million to 75 million.
The limit may be extended to 105 million, subject to credit approval by the lender.
Amounts are normally drawn down on the facility for one month periods.
Interest is payable at a rate of LIBOR as quoted in the market for the relevant currency and period, plus a margin, plus Mandatory Costs, which are the lenders costs of complying with certain regulatory requirements of the Bank of England.
At 30 September 2018, the Company had drawn down US$ 55.0 million 42.1 million at an interest rate of 2.92% per annum.
At the prior year end, the Company had drawn down US$ 57.3 million 42.7 million at an interest rate of 1.89% per annum.
The Company also has a 30 million overdraft facility with HSBC Bank plc, secured by a floating charge, but which was not utilised during the current or comparative year.
The above year end amounts are not representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year as the level of cash balances and drawings on the credit facility have fluctuated.
The maximum and minimum net cash debt balances during the year are as follows: 2018 2017 000 000 Maximum debit interest rate exposure during the year net debt 36,898 37,730 Minimum debit maximum credit interest rate exposure during the year net debt cash 10,321 2,147 Interest rate sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and net assets to a 0.5% 2017: 0.5% increase or decrease in interest rates in regards to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities.
This level of change is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on observation of current market conditions.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary financial instruments held at the accounting date with all other variables held constant.

iii Market price risk Market price risk includes changes in market prices, other than those arising from interest rate risk, which may affect the value of investments.
Management of market price risk The board meets on at least four occasions each year to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular countries and industry sectors.
The investment management team has responsibility for monitoring the portfolio, which is selected in accordance with the Companys investment objective and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
The board may authorise the Manager to enter derivative transactions for the purpose of protecting the portfolio against falls in market prices.

Concentration of exposure to market price risk An analysis of the Companys investments is given on pages 7 and 8.
This shows that the portfolio comprises investments trading in Asian countries.
Accordingly there is a concentration of exposure to that region.
Market price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and net assets to an increase or decrease of 20% 2017: 20% in the fair values of the Companys investments.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys investments and adjusting for the change in the management fee, but with all other variables held constant.
2018 2017 20% increase 20% decrease 20% increase 20% decrease in fair value in fair value in fair value in fair value 000 000 000 000 Income statement return after taxation Revenue return 319 319 1,255 1,255 Capital return 169,249 169,249 167,272 167,272 Total return after taxation and net assets 168,930 168,930 166,017 166,017 Percentage change in net asset value 20.5% 20.5% 20.8% 20.8% b Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting its obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset.
Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the Companys assets comprise mainly readily realisable securities, which can be sold to meet to meet funding requirements if necessary.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of a credit facility and an overdraft facility.
The boards policy is for the Company to remain fully invested in normal market conditions and that borrowings be used to manage working capital requirements and to gear the Company as appropriate.
Liquidity risk exposure Contractual maturities of financial liabilities, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required are as follows: Three Three months months or less or less 2018 2017 000 000 Creditors: amounts falling due within one year Bank loan including interest 42,148 42,718 Securities purchased awaiting settlement 4,375 Other creditors and accruals 2,033 1,920 48,556 44,638 Schroder AsiaPacific Fund plc 46 171592 Schroder AsiaPacific Fund Annual Report Pt3 171592 Schroder AsiaPacific Fund Annual Report Pt3 10 12 2018 14:12 Page 47 Notes to the Accounts c Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that the failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in loss to the Company.
Management of credit risk This risk is not significant and is managed as follows: Portfolio dealing The Company invests in markets that operate a Delivery Versus Payment settlement process which mitigates the risk of losing the principal of a trade during settlement.
The Manager continuously monitors dealing activity to ensure best execution, which involves measuring various indicators including the quality of trade settlement and incidence of failed trades.
Counterparties must be pre-approved by the Managers credit committee.
Exposure to the custodian The custodian of the Companys assets is HSBC Bank plc which has Long-Term Credit Ratings of AAwith Fitch and Aa3 with Moodys.
The Companys investments are held in accounts which are segregated from the custodians own trading assets.
If the custodian were to become insolvent, the Companys right of ownership of its investments is clear and they are therefore protected.
However the Companys cash balances are all deposited with the custodian as banker and held on the custodians balance sheet.
Accordingly, in accordance with usual banking practice, the Company will rank as a general creditor to the custodian in respect of cash balances.
Credit risk exposure The amounts shown in the balance sheet under debtors and cash at bank and in hand represent the maximum exposure to credit risk at the current and comparative year ends.
No debtors are past their due date and none have been provided for.
There has been no stock lending during the year.
d Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities All financial assets and liabilities are either carried in the balance sheet at fair value, or the balance sheet amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Capital management policies and procedures The Companys objectives, policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from the preceding year.
The Companys debt and capital structure comprises the following: 2018 2017 000 000 Debt Bank loan 42,141 42,716 Equity Called-up share capital 16,757 16,757 Reserves 808,285 783,185 825,042 799,942 Total debt and equity 867,183 842,658 The Companys capital management objectives are to ensure that it will continue as a going concern and to maximise the capital return to its equity shareholders through an appropriate level of gearing.
The board would not expect gearing to exceed 20%.
Gearing for this purpose is defined as borrowings used for investment purposes, less cash, expressed as a percentage of net assets.
2018 2017 000 000 Borrowings used for investment purposes, less cash 21,702 35,503 Net assets 825,042 799,942 Gearing 2.6% 4.4% The board, with the assistance of the Manager, monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Companys capital on an ongoing basis.
This review includes: the planned level of gearing, which takes into account the Managers views on the market: the need to buy back the Companys own shares for cancellation or to hold in treasury, which takes into account the share price discount: the opportunity for issue of new shares: and the amount of dividends to be paid, in excess of that which is required to be distributed.
