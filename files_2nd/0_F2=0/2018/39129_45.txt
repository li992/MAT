The estimated fair value of derivative financial instruments reflects the estimated amount the Group would receive or pay in an arms-length transaction.
This amount is determined using quoted prices if exchange listed, quotations from independent third parties or valued internally using standard market practices.
Other than the loans which have been designated at fair value through profit or loss, the loans and receivables have been shown net of provisions for impairment.
The fair value of loans have been estimated from discounted cash flows expected to be received.
The discount rate is updated for the market rate of interest where applicable.
The fair value of investment properties is based on market values as assessed by professionally qualified external valuers or by the Groups qualified surveyors.
The fair value of the subordinated and senior debt issued by the parent company is determined using quoted prices from independent third parties.
The fair value of financial liabilities other than derivative financial instruments is determined using discounted cash flows of the amounts expected to be paid.

The fair value of the assets and liabilities in the table above, with the exception of the subordinated and senior debt issued by the parent company, has been estimated from the discounted cash flows expected to be received or paid.
Where appropriate, the observable market interest rate has been used and the assets and liabilities are classified within level 2.
Otherwise, they are included as level 3 assets or liabilities.
The fair value included for the subordinated and senior debt issued by the parent company is determined using quoted prices from independent third parties.
c Valuation approach for level 2 fair valued assets and liabilities A significant proportion of the Groups level 2 assets are corporate bonds, structured securities and other non-national government debt securities.
These assets, in line with market practice, are generally valued using a designated independent pricing service or quote from third-party brokers.
These valuations are subject to a number of monitoring controls, such as comparison to multiple pricing sources where available, monthly price variances, stale price reviews and variance analysis on prices achieved on subsequent trades.
When prices are not available from pricing services, quotes are sourced directly from brokers.
Prudential seeks to obtain a number of quotes from different brokers so as to obtain the most comprehensive information available on their executability.
Where quotes are sourced directly from brokers, the price used in the valuation is normally selected from one of the quotes based on a number of factors, including the timeliness and regularity of the quotes and the accuracy of the quotes considering the spreads provided.
The selected quote is the one which best represents an executable quote for the security at the measurement date.
Generally, no adjustment is made to the prices obtained from independent third parties.
Adjustment is made in only limited circumstances, where it is determined that the third-party valuations obtained do not reflect fair value eg either because the value is stale and or the values are extremely diverse in range.
These are usually securities which are distressed or that could be subject to a debt restructure or where reliable market prices are no longer available due to an inactive market or market dislocation.
In these instances, prices are derived using internal valuation techniques including those as described below in this note with the objective of arriving at a fair value measurement that reflects the price at which an orderly transaction would take place between market participants on the measurement date.
The techniques used require a number of assumptions relating to variables such as credit risk and interest rates.
Examples of such variables include an average credit spread based on the corporate bond universe and the relevant duration of the asset being valued.
Prudential determines the input assumptions based on the best available information at the measurement dates.
Securities valued in such manner are classified as level 3 where these significant inputs are not based on observable market data.
Of the total level 2 debt securities of 120,511 million at 31 December 2018 31 December 2017: 115,141 million, 15,425 million are valued internally 31 December 2017: 13,910 million.
The majority of such securities are valued using matrix pricing, which is based on assessing the credit quality of the underlying borrower to derive a suitable discount rate relative to government securities of a comparable duration.
Under matrix pricing, the debt securities are priced taking the credit spreads on comparable quoted public debt securities and applying these to the equivalent debt instruments factoring in a specified liquidity premium.
The majority of the parameters used in this valuation technique are readily observable in the market and, therefore, are not subject to interpretation.

Valuation approach for level 3 fair valued assets and liabilities Financial instruments at fair value Investments valued using valuation techniques include financial investments which by their nature do not have an externally quoted price based on regular trades, and financial investments for which markets are no longer active as a result of market conditions, eg market illiquidity.
The valuation techniques used include comparison to recent arms-length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis, option adjusted spread models and, if applicable, enterprise valuation.
These techniques may include a number of assumptions relating to variables such as credit risk and interest rates.
Changes in assumptions relating to these variables could positively or negatively impact the reported fair value of these instruments.
When determining the inputs into the valuation techniques used priority is given to publicly available prices from independent sources when available, but overall the source of pricing is chosen with the objective of arriving at a fair value measurement that reflects the price at which an orderly transaction would take place between market participants on the measurement date.
The fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based upon available market information and judgements about the financial instruments, including estimates of the timing and amount of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of counterparties.
Such estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time a significant volume of a particular financial instrument, nor do they consider the tax impact of the realisation of unrealised gains or losses from selling the financial instrument being fair valued.
In accordance with the Groups risk management framework, the estimated fair value of derivative financial instruments valued internally using standard market practices are subject to assessment against external counterparties valuations.
At 31 December 2018, the Group held 5,301 million 31 December 2017: 4,443 million of net financial instruments at fair value within level 3.
This represents 1 per cent 31 December 2017: 1 per cent of the total fair valued financial assets net of fair valued financial liabilities.
The principal financial assets, net of corresponding liabilities, classified as fair value within level 3 as of 31 December 2018 are described below: i 1,702 million of loans 31 December 2017: 1,983 million and a corresponding 1,606 million 31 December 2017: 1,887 million of borrowings are held by a subsidiary of the Groups UK with-profits fund, attaching to a portfolio of buy-to-let mortgages and other loans financed largely by external third-party non-recourse borrowings.
See note C3.3 c for further details.
The Groups exposure is limited to the investment held by the UK with-profits fund, rather than to the individual loans and borrowings themselves.
The fair value movements of these loans and borrowings have no effect on shareholders profit and equity.
The most significant non-observable inputs to the mortgage fair value are the level of future defaults and prepayments by the mortgage holders.
ii L oans of 2,783 million at 31 December 2018 31 December 2017: 2,512 million, measured as the loan outstanding balance, plus accrued investment income, attached to acquired REALIC business and held to back the liabilities for funds withheld under reinsurance arrangements.
The funds withheld liability of 2,941 million at 31 December 2018 31 December 2017: 2,664 million is also classified within level 3, accounted for on a fair value basis being equivalent to the carrying value of the underlying assets.
iii Excluding the above, the level 3 fair valued financial assets net of financial liabilities are 5,363 million 31 December 2017: 4,499 million.
Of this amount, a net liability of 298 million 31 December 2017: net liability of 117 million is internally valued, representing less than 0.1 per cent of the total fair valued financial assets net of financial liabilities 31 December 2017: less than 0.1 per cent.
Internal valuations are inherently more subjective than external valuations.
Included within these internally valued net asset liability are: a D ebt securities of 582 million 31 December 2017: 500 million, which are either valued on a discounted cash flow method with an internally developed discount rate or on external prices adjusted to reflect the specific known conditions relating to these securities eg distressed securities or securities which were being restructured.
b Private equity and venture investments in both debt and equity securities of 512 million 31 December 2017: 217 million which are valued internally using discounted cash flows based on management information available for these investments.
The significant unobservable inputs include the determination of expected future cash flows on the investments being valued, determination of the probability of counterparty default and prepayments and the selection of appropriate discount rates.
The valuation is performed in accordance with International Private Equity and Venture Capital Association Valuation guidelines.
These investments are principally held by consolidated investment funds that are managed on behalf of third parties.

The inputs that are significant to the valuation of these investments are primarily the economic assumptions, being the discount rate risk-free rate plus a liquidity premium and property values.
d Liabilities of 898 million 31 December 2017: 403 million for the net asset value attributable to external unit holders in respect of the consolidated investment funds, which are non-recourse to the Group.
These liabilities are valued by reference to the underlying assets.
e D erivative liabilities of 423 million 31 December 2017: 512 million which are valued internally using the discounted cash flow method in line with standard market practices but are subject to independent assessment against external counterparties valuations.
f Other sundry individual financial investments of 15 million 31 December 2017: 164 million.
Of the internally valued net liability referred to above of 298 million 31 December 2017: net liability of 117 million : A net liability of 53 million 31 December 2017: net asset 67 million is held by the Groups participating funds and therefore shareholders profit and equity are not impacted by movements in the valuation of these financial instruments: and A net liability of 245 million 31 December 2017: 184 million is held to support non-linked shareholder-backed business.
If the value of all the level 3 instruments held to support non-linked shareholder-backed business valued internally decreased by 10 per cent, the change in valuation would be 24 million 31 December 2017: 18 million, which would reduce shareholders equity by this amount before tax.
All this amount passes through the income statement substantially as part of short-term fluctuations in investment returns outside of adjusted IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns.
Other assets at fair value investment properties The investment properties of the Group are principally held by the UK and Europe insurance operations that are externally valued by professionally qualified external valuers using the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS valuation standards.
An income capitalisation technique is predominantly applied for these properties.
This technique calculates the value through the yield and rental value depending on factors such as the lease length, building quality, covenant and location.
The variables used are compared to recent transactions with similar features to those of the Groups investment properties.
As the comparisons are not with properties that are virtually identical to the Groups investment properties, adjustments are made by the valuers where appropriate to the variables used.
Changes in assumptions relating to these variables could positively or negatively impact the reported fair value of the properties.
e Transfers into and transfers out of levels The Groups policy is to recognise transfers into and transfers out of levels as of the end of each half year reporting period except for material transfers which are recognised as of the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.
Transfers are deemed to have occurred when there is a material change in the observed valuation inputs or a change in the level of trading activities of the securities.
During the year, the transfers between levels within the Groups portfolio were primarily transfers from level 1 to level 2 of 908 million and transfers from level 2 to level 1 of 976 million.
These transfers which relate to equity securities and debt securities arose to reflect the change in the observed valuation inputs and in certain cases, the change in the level of trading activities of the securities.
In addition, the transfers into level 3 during the year were 8 million and the transfers out of level 3 were 30 million.
These transfers were primarily between levels 3 and 2 for derivative liabilities.
f Valuation processes applied by the Group The Groups valuation policies, procedures and analyses for instruments categorised as level 3 are overseen by business unit committees as part of the Groups wider financial reporting governance processes.
The procedures undertaken include approval of valuation methodologies, verification processes, and resolution of significant or complex valuation issues.
In undertaking these activities the Group makes use of the extensive expertise of its asset management functions.
In addition, the Group has minimum standards for independent price verification to ensure valuation accuracy is regularly independently verified.
Adherence to this policy is monitored across the business units.

iv Other operations Other operations exposure to asset-backed securities is held by Prudential Capital with no sub-prime exposure.
Of the 445 million, 99 per cent 31 December 2017: 96 per cent are graded AAA.
f Group sovereign debt and bank debt exposure The Group exposures held by the shareholder-backed business and with-profits funds in sovereign debts and bank debt securities are analysed as follows: Exposure to sovereign debts 31 Dec 2018 m 31 Dec 2017 m  With-profits backed With-profits business funds business funds Italy 57 58 63 Spain 36 18 34 18 France 50 23 38 Germany 239 281 693 301 Other Eurozone 103 34 82 31 Total Eurozone 378 440 890 451 United Kingdom 3,226 3,013 5,918 3,287 United States 5,647 11,858 5,078 10,156 Other, including Asia 5,142 2,745 4,638 2,143 Total 14,393 18,056 16,524 16,037 Including bonds guaranteed by the federal government.
The exposure to the United States sovereign debt comprises holdings of the US, the UK and Europe and Asia insurance operations.
In addition, the tables above exclude the proportionate share of sovereign debt holdings of the Groups joint venture operations.
g Impairment of US available-for-sale debt securities and other financial assets In accordance with the Groups accounting policy set out in note A3.1, impairment reviews were performed for available-for-sale securities and loans and receivables.
During the year ended 31 December 2018, a credit for recoveries net of impairment of 13 million 2017: credit of 1 million was recognised.
This includes 15 million 2017: 8 million for available-for-sale securities held by Jackson, offset by a charge of 2 million 2017: 7 million for loans and receivables held across the Group.
Jackson, with the support of internal credit analysts, regularly monitors and reports on the credit quality of its holdings of debt securities.
In addition, there is a periodic review of its investments on a case-by-case basis to determine whether any decline in fair value represents an impairment.
Investments in structured securities are subject to a review of their future estimated cash flows, including expected and stress case scenarios, to identify potential shortfalls in contractual payments both interest and principal.
Impairment charges are recorded on structured securities when the Company forecasts a contractual payment shortfall.
Situations where such a shortfall would not lead to a recognition of a loss are rare.
The impairment loss reflects the difference between the fair value and book value.
In 2018, the Group realised gross losses on sales of available-for-sale securities of 43 million 2017: 155 million with 49 per cent 2017: 97 per cent of these losses related to the disposal of fixed maturity securities of the top 10 individual issuers, which were disposed of to limit future credit loss exposure.
Of the 43 million 2017: 155 million, 4 million 2017: 3 million relates to losses on sales of impaired and deteriorating securities.
234 Prudential plc Annual Report 2018 www.
co. uk 01 Groupoverview 02 Strategicreport 03 Governance 04  05 Financialstatements 06  EEV basisresults 07  The effect of changes in the key assumptions that underpin the assessment of whether impairment has taken place depends on the factors described in note A3.1.
A key indicator of whether such impairment may arise in future, and the potential amounts at risk, is the profile of gross unrealised losses for fixed maturity securities accounted for on an available-for-sale basis by reference to the time periods by which the securities have been held continuously in an unrealised loss position and by reference to the maturity date of the securities concerned.
For 2018, the amount of gross unrealised losses for fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale under IFRS in an unrealised loss position was 925 million 2017: 106 million.
Note B1.2 provides further details on the impairment charges and unrealised losses of Jacksons available-for-sale securities.
C3.3 Loans portfolio a Overview of loans portfolio Loans are accounted for at amortised cost net of impairment except for: Certain mortgage loans which have been designated at fair value through profit or loss of the UK and Europe insurance operations as this loan portfolio is managed and evaluated on a fair value basis: and Certain policy loans of the US insurance operations that are held to back liabilities for funds withheld under reinsurance arrangements and are also accounted on a fair value basis.
The amounts included in the statement of financial position are analysed as follows: 31 Dec 2018 m 31 Dec 2017 m Mortgage Policy Other Mortgage Policy Other loans loans loans Total loans loans loans Total Asia With-profits 727 65 792 613 112 725 Non-linked shareholder-backed 156 226 203 585 177 216 199 592 US Non-linked shareholder-backed 7,385 3,681 11,066 6,236 3,394 9,630 UK and Europe With-profits 2,461 3 1,389 3,853 2,441 4 1,823 4,268 Non-linked shareholder-backed 1,655 59 1,714 1,681 37 1,718 Other operations 109 109 Total loans securities 11,657 4,637 1,716 18,010 10,535 4,227 2,280 17,042 All mortgage loans are secured by properties.
In the US 2,783 million 31 December 2017: 2,512 million policy loans are backing liabilities for funds withheld under reinsurance arrangements and are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss.
All other policy loans are accounted for at amortised cost, less any impairment.
Other loans held in UK with-profits funds are commercial loans and comprise mainly syndicated loans.
b Additional information on US mortgage loans In the US, mortgage loans are all commercial mortgage loans that are secured by the following property types: industrial, multi-family residential, suburban office, retail or hotel.
The average loan size is 14.0 million 2017: 12.6 million.
The portfolio has a current estimated average loan to value of 53 per cent 2017: 55 per cent.
Jackson had no mortgage loans where the contractual terms of the agreements had been restructured at the end of both 2018 and 2017. c Additional information on UK mortgage loans The UK with-profits fund invests in an entity that holds a portfolio of buy-to-let mortgage loans.
The vehicle financed its acquisitions through the issue of debt instruments, largely to external parties, securitised upon the loans acquired.
These third-party borrowings have no recourse to any other assets of the Group and the Groups exposure is limited to the amount invested by the UK with-profits fund.
By carrying value, 1,237 million of the 1,655 million 31 December 2017: 1,267 million of 1,681 million mortgage loans held by the UK shareholder-backed business relates to lifetime equity release mortgage business which has an average loan to property value of 33 per cent 31 December 2017: 31 per cent.

The Group has no cash flow hedges and, in general, contractual maturities are not considered essential for an understanding of the timing of the cash flows for these instruments.
The only exception is certain identified interest rate swaps which are expected to be held until maturity for the purposes of matching cash flows on separately held assets and liabilities.
For these instruments the undiscounted cash flows including contractual interest amounts due to be paid under the swap contract assuming conditions are consistent with those at year end are included in the column relating to the contractual maturity of the derivative.

Most investment contracts have options to surrender early, often subject to surrender or other penalties.
Therefore, most contracts can be said to have a contractual maturity of less than one year, but the additional charges and term of the contracts mean these are unlikely to be exercised in practice and the more useful information is to present information on expected payment.
The vast majority of the Groups financial assets are held to back the Groups policyholder liabilities.
Although asset liability matching is an important component of managing policyholder liabilities both those classified as insurance and those classified as investments, this profile is mainly relevant for managing market risk rather than liquidity risk.
Within each business unit this asset liability matching is performed on a  basis.
In terms of liquidity risk, a large proportion of the policyholder liabilities contain discretionary surrender values or surrender charges, meaning that many of the Groups liabilities are expected to be held for the long term.
Much of the Groups investment portfolios are in marketable securities, which can therefore be converted quickly to liquid assets.
For the reasons provided above, an analysis of the Groups assets by contractual maturity is not considered meaningful to evaluate the nature and extent of the Groups liquidity risk.
ii Credit risk The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk of financial instruments before any allowance for collateral or allocation of losses to policyholders is represented by the carrying value of financial instruments on the balance sheet that have exposures to credit risk comprising cash and cash equivalents, deposits, debt securities, loans and derivative assets, and other debtors, the carrying value of which are disclosed at the start of this note and note C3.4 b below for derivative assets.
The collateral in place in relation to derivatives is described in note C3.4 c below.
Note C3.3 describes the security for the loans held by the Group.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is further discussed in note C7 below.
Of the total loans and receivables held, 27 million 31 December 2017: 23 million are past their due date but are not impaired.
Of the total past due but not impaired, 22 million are less than one year past their due date 31 December 2017: 17 million.
The Group expects full recovery of these loans and receivables.
Financial assets that would have been past due or impaired had the terms not been renegotiated amounted to 23 million 31 December 2017: 22 million.
In addition, during 2018 and 2017 the Group did not take possession of any other collateral held as security.
Further details of collateral and pledges are provided in note C3.4 c below.

Of these financial assets, 49 per cent 31 December 2017: 52 per cent are held by the UK with-profits fund, allowing the fund to obtain exposure to foreign equity markets.
Of these financial liabilities, 28 per cent 31 December 2017: 28 per cent are held by the UK with-profits fund, mainly relating to foreign currency borrowings.
The exchange risks inherent in these exposures are mitigated through the use of derivatives, mainly forward currency contracts note C3.4 b below.
The amount of exchange gain recognised in the income statement in 2018, except for those arising on financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss, is 281 million 2017: 112 million loss mainly arising on investments of the UK with-profits fund.
C3.4 b Derivatives and hedging Derivatives The Group enters into a variety of exchange traded and over-the-counter derivative financial instruments, including futures, options, forward currency contracts and swaps such as interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, swaptions and credit default swaps.
All over-the-counter derivative transactions, with the exception of some Asia transactions, are conducted under standardised ISDA International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc master agreements and the Group has collateral agreements between the individual Group entities and relevant counterparties in place under each of these market master agreements.
Under Article 11 of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation on derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories EMIR and Commission Delegated Regulation EU 2016 2251 supplementing EMIR, market participants transacting in non-cleared OTC derivatives are required to exchange collateral to cover variation and initial margin.
However, trades between counterparties belonging to the same group are exempt from these margin requirements subject to certain criteria.
Prudential Capital plc Legal Entity Identifier reference LEI CHW8NHK268SFPTV63Z64 has entered into such derivative agreements with the following six entities in the Group.

co. uk 01 Groupoverview 02 Strategicreport 03 Governance 04  05 Financialstatements 06  EEV basisresults 07  Derivatives are used for efficient portfolio management to obtain cost effective management of exposure to various markets in accordance with the Groups investment strategies and to manage exposure to interest rate, currency, credit and other business risks.
The Group also uses interest rate derivatives to reduce exposure to interest rate volatility.
In particular: UK with-profits funds use derivatives for efficient portfolio management or reduction in investment risks.
For UK annuity business derivatives are used to assist with asset and liability cash flow matching: US operations and some of the UK and Europe operations hold large amounts of interest-rate sensitive investments that contain credit risks on which a certain level of defaults is expected.
These businesses have purchased some swaptions to manage the default risk on certain underlying assets and hence reduce the amount of regulatory capital held to support the assets: and Some products, especially in the US, have guarantee features linked to equity indices.
A mismatch between guaranteed product liabilities and the performance of the underlying assets exposes the Group to equity index risk.
In order to mitigate this risk, the relevant business units purchase swaptions, equity options and futures to better match asset performance with liabilities under equity-indexed products.
Hedging The Group has formally assessed and documented the effectiveness of the following net investment hedges under IAS 39.
At 31 December 2018, the Group has designated perpetual subordinated capital securities totalling US$3.7 billion 31 December 2017: US$4.3 billion as a net investment hedge to hedge the currency risks related to the net investment in Jackson.
The carrying value of the subordinated capital securities was 2,909 million as at 31 December 2018 31 December 2017: 3,140 million.
The foreign exchange loss of 199 million 2017: gain of 325 million on translation of the borrowings to pounds sterling at the statement of financial position date is recognised in the translation reserve in shareholders equity.
This net investment hedge was 100 per cent effective.
The Group has no cash flow hedges or fair value hedges in place.
C3.4 c Derecognition, collateral and offsetting Securities lending and reverse repurchase agreements The Group has entered into securities lending including repurchase agreements whereby blocks of securities are loaned to third parties, primarily major brokerage firms.
Typically, the value of collateral assets granted to the Group in these transactions is in excess of the value of securities lent, with the excess determined by the quality of the collateral assets granted.
Collateral requirements are calculated on a daily basis.
The loaned securities are not removed from the Groups consolidated statement of financial position, rather they are retained within the appropriate investment classification.
Collateral typically consists of cash, debt securities, equity securities and letters of credit.
At 31 December 2018, the Group has 8,278 million 31 December 2017: 8,232 million of lent securities and assets subject to repurchase agreements, of which 8,245 million 31 December 2017: 8,182 million related to the UK with-profits fund.
The cash and securities collateral held or pledged under such agreements were 8,750 million 31 December 2017: 8,733 million of which 8,662 million 31 December 2017: 8,679 million was held by the UK with-profits fund.
At 31 December 2018, the Group had entered into reverse repurchase transactions under which it purchased securities and had taken on the obligation to resell the securities.
The fair value of the collateral held in respect of these transactions was 10,633 million 31 December 2017: 10,550 million.
Collateral and pledges under derivative transactions At 31 December 2018, the Group had pledged 3,265 million 31 December 2017: 2,302 million for liabilities and held collateral of 2,012 million 31 December 2017: 3,958 million in respect of over-the-counter derivative transactions.
These transactions are conducted under terms that are usual and customary to collateralised transactions including, where relevant, standard securities lending and repurchase agreements.
The Group has entered into collateral arrangements in relation to over-the-counter derivative transactions, which permit sale or re-pledging of underlying collateral.
During the year, the Group has not sold any collateral held 2017: nil.
As of 31 December 2018, the value of collateral re-pledged by the Group amounted to 698 million 31 December 2017: 852 million.
