Factors that may affect future tax charges At 31 August 2018 the Company had a potential deferred tax asset of 6,913,000 2017 5,714,000 on taxable losses which is available to be carried forward and offset against future taxable profits.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised on these losses as it is considered unlikely that the Company will make taxable revenue profits in the future and it is not liable to tax on its capital gains.
The potential deferred tax asset has been calculated using a corporation tax rate of 17% 2017 17%.
Due to the Companys status as an investment trust, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided for deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.

The revenue reserve and the capital reserve to the extent it constitutes realised profits are distributable.
15 Net Asset Value per Ordinary Share The net asset value per ordinary share and the net assets attributable to the ordinary shareholders at the year end calculated in accordance with the Articles of Association were as follows: 2018 2017 2018 2017 000 000 Ordinary shares of 5p 835.8p 685.8p 756,104 575,221 Net asset value per ordinary share is based on the net assets as shown above and 90,459,925 2017 83,879,925 ordinary shares, being the number of ordinary shares in issue at the year end.
Deducting borrowings at fair value would have the effect of reducing net asset value per ordinary share from 835.8p to 834.0p.
Taking the market price of the ordinary shares at 31 August 2018 of 855.0p, this would have given a premium to net asset value of 2.5% as against 2.3% on the basis of deducting borrowings at par.
At 31 August 2017 the net asset value per share after deducting borrowings at fair value was 682.4p.
Taking the market price of the ordinary shares at 31 August 2017 of 711.5p, this would have given a premium to net asset value of 4.3% as against 3.7% on the basis of deducting borrowings at par.
16 Contingent Liabilities, Guarantees and Financial Commitments There were no contingent liabilities, guarantees or financial commitments at either year end.
17 Related Party Transactions The Directors fees for the year and Directors shareholdings at 31 August 2018 are detailed in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 28 and 29 respectively.
No Director has a contract of service with the Company.
The management fee due to Baillie Gifford and Co Limited is set out in note 3 on page 40 and the amount accrued at 31 August 2018 is set out in note 11 on page 43.
Details of the Investment Management Agreement are set out on page 20.
44 Annual Report 2018 Financial Report 18 Financial Instruments The Company invests in medium to smaller sized Japanese companies and makes other investments so as to achieve its investment objective of long term capital growth.
The Company borrows money when the Board and Managers have sufficient conviction that the assets funded by borrowed monies will generate a return in excess of the cost of borrowing.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Company is exposed to various types of risk that are associated with the financial instruments and markets in which it invests and could result in a reduction in the Companys net assets.
These risks are categorised here as market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Board monitors closely the Companys exposures to these risks but does so in order to reduce the likelihood of a permanent loss of capital rather than to minimise the short term volatility.
The risk management policies and procedures outlined in this note have not changed substantially from the previous accounting period.
Market Risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument or other investment held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk.
The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and the Companys Investment Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making individual investment decisions as well as monitoring the overall level of market risk across the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
Details of the Companys investment portfolio are shown on pages 17 and 18. i Currency Risk The Companys assets, liabilities and income are principally denominated in yen.
The Companys functional currency and that in which it reports its results is sterling.
Consequently, movements in the yen sterling exchange rate will affect the sterling value of those items.
The Investment Manager monitors the Companys yen exposure and any other overseas currency exposure and reports to the Board on a regular basis.
The Investment Manager assesses the risk to the Company of the overseas currency exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and income of a movement in the rates of exchange to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
However, the currency in which a companys share price is quoted is not necessarily the one in which it earns its profits.
The movement in exchange rates on overseas earnings may have a more significant impact upon a companys valuation than a simple translation of the currency in which the share price of the company is quoted.
Yen borrowings are used periodically to limit the Companys exposure to anticipated future changes in the yen sterling exchange rate which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments.
The Company has the authority to use forward currency contracts to limit the Companys exposure if it so chooses to anticipated future changes in exchange rates so that the currency risks entailed in holding the assets are mainly eliminated.
No forward currency contracts have been used in the current or prior year.
Exposure to currency risk through asset allocation, which is calculated by reference to the currency in which the asset or liability is quoted, is shown below.
Currency Risk Sensitivity At 31 August 2018, if sterling had strengthened by 10% against the yen, with all other variables held constant, total net assets and net return on ordinary activities after taxation would have decreased by 75,722,000 2017 63,926,000.
A 10% weakening of sterling against the yen, with all other variables held constant, total net assets and net return on ordinary activities after taxation would have had a similar but opposite effect on the Financial Statement amounts.
The Baillie Gifford Japan Trust PLC 45 Financial Report 18 Financial Instruments continued ii Interest Rate Risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable on cash deposits.
They may also impact upon the market value of the Companys investments as the effect of interest rate movements upon the earnings of a company may have a significant impact upon the valuation of that companys equity.
The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment decisions and when entering borrowing agreements.
The Board reviews on a regular basis the amount of investments in cash and the income receivable on cash deposits.
The Company finances part of its activities through borrowings at approved levels.
The amount of such borrowings and the approved levels are monitored and reviewed regularly by the Board.
The interest rate risk profile of the Companys interest bearing financial assets and liabilities at 31 August 2018 is shown below.
Financial Assets Cash deposits generally comprise overnight call or short term money market deposits and earn interest at floating rates based on prevailing bank base rates.
Financial Liabilities The interest rate risk profile of the Companys loans at 31 August was: 2018 2018 2017 2017 2018 Weighted Weighted 2017 Weighted Weighted Book value average average period Book value average average period 000 interest rate until maturity 000 interest rate until maturity Bank loans: Yen denominated 114,486 2.0% 53 months 82,500 1.9% 24 months Interest Rate Risk Sensitivity An increase of 100 basis points in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, would have decreased the Companys total net assets and total return on ordinary activities for the year ended 31 August 2018 by 156,000 2017 293,000.
This is mainly due to the Companys exposure to interest rates on its revolving bank loans.
A decrease of 100 basis points would have had an equal but opposite effect.
The Company does not hold bonds.
iii Other Price Risk Changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may also affect the value of the Companys net assets.
The Companys exposure to changes in market prices relates to the fixed asset investments as disclosed in note 9.
The Board manages the market price risks inherent in the investment portfolio by ensuring full and timely access to relevant information from the Investment Manager.
The Board meets regularly and at each meeting reviews investment performance, the investment portfolio and the rationale for the current investment positioning to ensure consistency with the Companys objectives and investment policies.
The portfolio does not seek to reproduce the index, investments are selected based upon the merit of individual companies and therefore performance may well diverge from the comparative index.
Other Price Risk Sensitivity A full list of the Companys investments is shown on pages 17 and 18.
In addition, various analyses of the portfolio by growth category, length of time held, industrial sector and exchange listing are shown on pages 14 to 16.
111.4% 2017 113.5% of the Companys net assets are invested in Japanese quoted equities.
A 10% increase in quoted equity valuations at 31 August 2018 would have increased total net assets and net return on ordinary activities after taxation by 84,205,000 2017 65,260,000.
A decrease of 10% would have had an equal but opposite effect.
46 Annual Report 2018 Financial Report 18 Financial Instruments continued Liquidity Risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Liquidity risk is not significant as the majority of the Companys assets are in investments that are readily realisable.
The Board provides guidance to the Investment Managers as to the maximum exposure to any one holding see Investment Policy on page 7.
The Company has the power to take out borrowings, which give it access to additional funding when required.
The Companys borrowing facilities are detailed in note 12.
The maturity profile of the Companys financial liabilities at 31 August was: 2018 2017 000 000 In less than one year 31,731 In more than one year, but not more than five years 49,958 50,769 In more than five years 64,528 114,486 82,500 Credit Risk This is the risk that a failure of a counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Company suffering a loss.
This risk is managed as follows: where the Investment Manager makes an investment in a bond or other security with credit risk, that credit risk is assessed and then compared to the prospective investment return of the security in question: the Depositary is liable for the loss of financial instruments held in custody.
The Depositary will ensure that any delegate segregates the assets of the Company.
The Depositary has delegated the custody function to Bank of New York Mellon International Limited.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of the custodian may cause the Companys rights with respect to securities held by the custodian to be delayed.
The Investment Manager monitors the Companys risk by reviewing the custodians internal control reports and reporting its findings to the Board: investment transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers whose creditworthiness is reviewed by the Investment Manager.
Transactions are ordinarily undertaken on a delivery versus payment basis whereby the Companys custodian bank ensures that the counterparty to any transaction entered into by the Company has delivered on its obligations before any transfer of cash or securities away from the Company is completed: the creditworthiness of the counterparty to transactions involving derivatives, structured notes and other arrangements, wherein the creditworthiness of the entity acting as broker or counterparty to the transaction is likely to be of sustained interest, are subject to rigorous assessment by the Investment Manager: and cash is only held at banks that are regularly reviewed by the Investment Manager.
Credit Risk Exposure The exposure to credit risk at 31 August was: 2018 2017 000 000 Cash and cash equivalents 27,788 10,585 Debtors 4,647 759 32,435 11,344 None of the Companys financial assets are past due or impaired.
Fair Value of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities The Companys investments are stated at fair value and the Directors are of the opinion that the reported values of the Companys other financial assets and liabilities approximate to fair value with the exception of the long term borrowings which are stated at amortised cost.
The fair value of borrowings is shown below.
2018 2018 2017 2017 Book Fair Book Fair value value value value 000 000 000 000 Yen bank loans 114,486 116,111 76,051 82,500 The fair value of each bank loan is calculated with reference to a Japanese government bond of comparable yield and maturity.
The Baillie Gifford Japan Trust PLC 47 Financial Report 18 Financial Instruments continued Capital Management The Company does not have any externally imposed capital requirements other than the loan covenants detailed in note 12 on page 43.
The capital of the Company is the ordinary share capital as detailed in note 13.
It is managed in accordance with its investment policy in pursuit of its investment objective, both of which are detailed on page 7, and shares may be repurchased or issued as explained on pages 21 and 22.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments The fair value hierarchy used to analyse the basis on which the fair values of financial instruments held at fair value through the profit or loss account are measured is described below.
Fair value measurements are categorised on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
Level 1 using unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in an active market: Level 2 using inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are directly or indirectly observable based on market data : and Level 3 using inputs that are unobservable for which market data is unavailable.
The valuation techniques used by the Company are explained in the accounting policies on page 39.
The financial assets designated as valued at fair value through profit or loss are all categorised as Level 1 in the above hierarchy.
None of the financial liabilities are designated at fair value through profit or loss in the Financial Statements.
