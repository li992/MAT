Financial instruments and related disclosures continued Cash flow hedges During 2018, the Group entered into forward foreign exchange contracts which have been designated as cash flow hedges.
These were entered into to hedge the foreign exchange exposure arising on cash flows from Euro denominated coupon payments relating to notes issued under the Groups European Medium Term Note programme, on the buyout of Novartis non-controlling interest in the Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture in 2018 and on the planned divestment of Horlicks and other nutrition brands in 2019.
The Group manages its cash flow interest rate risk by using floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps.
In addition, the Group carries a balance in reserves that arose from pre-hedging fluctuations in long-term interest rates when pricing bonds issued in prior years.
The balance is reclassified to finance costs over the life of these bonds.
Foreign exchange forward contracts and swaps In the current year, the Group has designated certain foreign exchange forward contracts and swaps as cash flow and net investment hedges.
The following tables detail the foreign exchange forward contracts and swaps outstanding at the end of the reporting period, as well as information on the related hedged items.
Foreign exchange derivative financial assets and liabilities are presented in the line Derivative financial instruments either as assets or liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheet.
The notional value of foreign exchange forward contracts and swaps is the absolute total of outstanding positions at the balance sheet date.
Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument.
The Group enters into hedge relationships where the critical terms of the hedging instrument match exactly with the terms of the hedged item, and so a qualitative assessment of effectiveness is performed.
If changes in circumstances affect the terms of the hedged item such that the critical terms no longer match exactly with the critical terms of the hedging instrument, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method to assess effectiveness.
The main source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedging relationships is the effect of the counterparty and the Groups own credit risk on the fair value of the foreign exchange forward contracts and swaps, which is not reflected in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates.
No other sources of ineffectiveness emerged from these hedging relationships.
Consequently, there was no ineffectiveness to be recorded from cash flow hedges and net investments in foreign entity hedges.

The interest rate swap contracts, exchanging floating rate interest for fixed interest, have been designated as cash flow hedges to hedge the variability of the interest cash flows associated with floating rate debt relating to notes issued under the Groups European Medium Term Note programme.
The interest rate swaps and the interest payments on the loan occur simultaneously and the amount accumulated in equity is reclassified to profit or loss over the period that the floating rate interest payments affect profit or loss.
The critical terms of the interest rate swap contracts and their corresponding hedged items are the same.
A qualitative assessment of effectiveness is performed and it is expected that the value of the interest rate swap contracts and the value of the corresponding hedged items will systematically change in opposite directions in response to movements in the underlying interest rates.
The main sources of ineffectiveness in these hedge relationships are the effects of currency basis risk and the counterpartys and the Groups own credit risk on the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts, which are not reflected in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the change in interest rates.
The following tables provide information regarding interest rate swap contracts outstanding and the related hedged items at 31 December 2018.

There are also arrangements that do not meet the criteria for offsetting but still allow for the related amounts to be offset in certain circumstances, such as bankruptcy or the termination of a contract.
The following tables set out the financial assets and liabilities that are offset, or subject to enforceable master netting arrangements and other similar agreements but not offset, as at 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017.
The column Net amount shows the impact on the Groups balance sheet if all offset rights were exercised.

As there is presently not a legally enforceable right of offset, these amounts have not been offset in the balance sheet, but have been presented separately in the table above.

Financial instruments and related disclosures continued f Debt interest rate repricing table The following table sets out the exposure of the Group to interest rates on debt, including commercial paper.
The maturity analysis of fixed rate debt is stated by contractual maturity and of floating rate debt by interest rate repricing dates.
For the purpose of this table, debt is defined as all classes of borrowings other than obligations under finance leases.

The range of variables chosen for the sensitivity analysis reflects managements view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one-year period.
Foreign exchange sensitivity The Group operates internationally and is primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk in relation to Sterling against movements in US Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen.
Foreign exchange risk arises from the translation of financial assets and liabilities which are not in the functional currency of the entity that holds them.
Based on the Groups net financial assets and liabilities as at 31 December, a weakening and strengthening of Sterling against these currencies, with all other variables held constant, is illustrated in the tables below.
The tables exclude financial instruments that expose the Group to foreign exchange risk where this risk is fully hedged with another financial instrument.

Financial instruments and related disclosures continued The equity impact, shown below, for foreign exchange sensitivity relates to derivative and non-derivative financial instruments hedging the Groups net investments in its European Euro foreign operations and cash flow hedges of its foreign exchange exposure arising on Euro denominated coupon payments relating to notes issued under the Groups European Medium Term Note programme.

The majority of debt is issued at fixed interest rates and changes in the floating rates of interest do not significantly affect the Groups net interest charge, although the majority of cash and liquid investments earn floating rates of interest.
The table below hypothetically shows the Groups sensitivity to changes in interest rates in relation to Sterling, US Dollar and Euro floating rate financial assets and liabilities.
If the interest rates applicable to floating rate financial assets and liabilities were to have increased by 1% 100 basis points, and assuming other variables had remained constant, it is estimated that the Groups finance income for 2018 would have decreased by approximately 13 million 2017 5 million increase.
A 1% 100 basis points movement in interest rates is not deemed to have a material effect on equity.

Financial instruments and related disclosures continued h Contractual cash flows for non-derivative financial liabilities and derivative instruments The following tables provide an analysis of the anticipated contractual cash flows including interest payable for the Groups non-derivative financial liabilities on an undiscounted basis.
For the purpose of this table, debt is defined as all classes of borrowings except for obligations under finance leases.
Interest is calculated based on debt held at 31 December without taking account of future issuance.
Floating rate interest is estimated using the prevailing interest rate at the balance sheet date.
Cash flows in foreign currencies are translated using spot rates at 31 December.
Contractual cash flows in respect of operating lease vacant space provisions are excluded from the table below as they are included in the Commitments under non-cancellable operating leases table in Note 41, Commitments.

The table below provides an analysis of the anticipated contractual cash flows for the Groups derivative instruments excluding equity options which do not give rise to cash flows, and other embedded derivatives, which are not material, using undiscounted cash flows.
The gross cash flows of foreign exchange contracts are presented for the purpose of this table although, in practice, the Group uses standard settlement arrangements to reduce its liquidity requirements on these instruments.
