THE STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Regulatory matters In respect of regulatory risks, the group provides for anticipated costs where an outflow of resources is considered probable and a reasonable estimate can be made of the likely outcome.
Estimates are used in assessing the likely value of the regulatory risk.
The ultimate liability may vary from the amounts provided and will be dependent upon the eventual outcome of any settlement.
We hold provisions for regulatory risks.
These provisions cover the following issues: Deemed Consent Deemed Consent is an agreed process between Openreach and its Communications Provider CP customers, which allows Openreach to halt the installation and reschedule the delivery date for providing dedicated business services known as Ethernet in a number of specific circumstances where it is beyond its control.
Ofcom found that Openreach had breached its contractual and regulatory obligations by inadequately and retrospectively applying Deemed Consent to reduce compensation payments to CPs between January 2013 and December 2014.
We continue to estimate the total compensation payments will amount to around 300m.
However, the precise amount will result from discussions with affected parties, and could result in lower or higher payments.
Other regulatory matters The remaining provision reflects managements estimates of regulatory risks across a range of issues, including price and service issues.
The precise outcome of each matter depends on whether it becomes an active issue, and the extent to which negotiation or regulatory decision will result in financial settlement.
Post balance sheet events Changes to our segments From 1 April 2018, our existing BT Consumer and EE divisions have been brought together into a combined division, Consumer, to drive converged products and accelerate transformation.
From 1 October 2018, our existing Business and Public Sector and Wholesale and Ventures divisions will be brought together into a combined division, Enterprise, to accelerate transformation, simplify our operating model and strengthen accountabilities.
These businesses operated and were reported separately throughout 2017 18 and therefore have been presented as separate operating segments throughout these accounts.
These organisational changes do not impact the results of Global Services or Openreach and there is no impact on the total group results, balance sheet or cash flows.
There are no internal revenue and costs between EE and BT Consumer.
In 2017 18, there were 32m 2016 17: 22m, 2015 16: 24m of internal revenue and costs between Business and Public Sector and Wholesale and Ventures.
We have set out below the segment analysis outlining the impacts of this change that will be applicable to the annual financial statements for 2018 19.
Full details of the internal revenue and costs at the disaggregated level are provided in note 4.

Contingent liabilities Since the reporting date, we have reached a confidential settlement with the administrators of P4U regarding its claim for revenue share which relates to certain customers prior to P4U insolvency.
This settlement is in line with the accruals we held to cover potential payments required by EE.
Acquisition of spectrum In April 2018 we secured 40MHz of 3.4GHz spectrum at a cost of 304m allowing us to progress with our 5G plans and strengthening our position as the mobile network leader.
The spectrum auction bidding cut across the 2017 18 and 2018 19 financial years.
We had 325m on deposit with Ofcom at 31 March 2018, the excess deposit balance of 21m has since been refunded.
Strategy update In May 2018 we are announcing an update to our strategy to accelerate leadership in converged connectivity and services.
Our strategy will drive sustainable growth in value by focusing on delivering differentiated customer experiences, investing in integrated network leadership, and transforming our operating model and includes the repositioning of Global Services as a more focused digital business.
This also includes the next phase of our restructuring programme.
This programme involves the reduction of c13,000 mainly back office and middle management roles at a cost of 800m with a twoyear payback and expected year three cash cost reduction of 1.5bn.
The balances of the first phase of our restructuring programme 60m of cost and removal of 1,200 FTE roles and our EE integration programme further run rate synergies of 110m are included in the this wider transformation programme.

Details are set out in note 19.
