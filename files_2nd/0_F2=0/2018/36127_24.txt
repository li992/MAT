NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingencies at the balance sheet date.
If in future such estimates and assumptions, which are based on managements best judgement at the date of the consolidated financial statements, deviate from actual circumstances, the original estimates and assumptions will be modified, as appropriate, in the period in which the circumstances change.
The following areas are considered of greater complexity and or particularly subject to the exercise of judgement: - management estimates and judgements are required in assessing the impairment of assets, including capitalised development costs and fixtures and fittings within loss making retail stores, particularly in relation to the forecasting of future cash flows and the discount rate applied to the cash flows.
- judgement is involved in assessing the exposures in the provisions including inventory, loss making retail stores, other property, bad debt and returns and hence in setting the level of the required provisions.
New accounting standards There are no new accounting standards or interpretations effective in the current period which are relevant to the Group.
New standards, amendments to standards and interpretations which have been published but are not yet effective which are relevant to the Group are: - IFRS 16 Leases effective for the year ending 31 May 2020.
Under this new standard all leases will be required to be recognised on balance sheet.
Currently under IAS 17 Leases only leases categorised as finance leases are recognised on balance sheet, with leases categorised as operating leases not recognised.
In broad terms the impact will be to recognise a lease liability and corresponding asset for the operating lease commitments set out in note 29.
The Group is assessing the impact of the new standard and has commenced work on a project to manage this change.
- IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers effective for the year ending 2 June 2019.
Under this new standard the royalty minimum guarantee income will be recognised on inception of the contract.
Currently the minimum guarantee income is deferred and released in line with licensee sales.
In addition under the new standard, amounts receivable from customers in respect of delivery charges will be recognised as revenue.
Currently these are offset against the carriage cost to the Group within cost of sales.
The impact of the adoption of this new standard with respect to the royalty minimum guarantee income on 4 June 2018 will result in restating the results for the 53 weeks ended 3 June 2018 by increasing opening retained earnings by 3.9 million and reducing profit by 0.2 million.
The impact of the reclassification of delivery charges to revenue will be a credit to revenue of 1.4 million and a debit to cost of sales of 1.4 million for the 53 weeks ended 3 June 2018.
- IFRS 9 Financial instruments effective for the year ending 2 June 2019.
Under this new standard, provisions for impairment of trade receivables will be recognised at an amount based on expected credit losses and will be calculated from the initial recognition of the asset.
Currently provisions for impairment of trade receivables are not recognised until there is an indication of impairment.
The impact of adopting the new standard is not material to the financial statements.
The Group does not consider that any other standards, amendments or interpretations issued by the IASB, but not yet applicable, will have a significant effect on the financial statements.
Segment information As Games Workshop is a vertically integrated business, management assesses the performance of sales channels and manufacturing and distribution channels separately.
At 3 June 2018, the Group is organised as follows: - Sales channels.
These channels sell product to external customers, through the Groups network of retail stores, independent retailers and online via the global web stores.
The sales channels have been aggregated into segments where they sell products of a similar nature, have similar production processes, similar customers, similar distribution methods, and if they are affected by similar economic factors.
The segments are as follows: - Trade.
This sales channel sells globally to independent retailers, agents and distributors.
It also includes the Groups magazine newsstand business and the distributor sales from the Groups publishing business Black Library.
This includes sales through the Groups retail stores, the Groups visitor centre in Nottingham and global exhibitions.
This includes sales through the Groups global web stores and digital sales through external affiliates.
This includes the design and manufacture of the products and incorporates the production facility in the UK and the Group logistics and merchandising costs.
