Under the requirements of IFRS 8, Operating segments, operating and reportable segments are presented in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker, which has been identified as the Board of Legal & General Group Plc.
Reportable segments The group has five reportable segments that are continuing operations, comprising LGR, LGIM, LGC, LGI and General Insurance, as set out in Note 2.
Group central expenses and debt costs are reported separately.
Transactions between reportable segments are on normal commercial terms, and are included within the reported segments.
Reporting of assets and liabilities by reportable segment has not been included, as this is not information that is provided to key decision makers on a regular basis.
The groups assets and liabilities are managed on a legal entity rather than reportable segment basis, in line with regulatory requirements.
Financial information on the reportable segments is further broken down where relevant in order to better explain the drivers of the groups results.

200 Legal & General Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial Statements Additional financial information 30 Tax The tax shown in the Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax Current tax comprises tax payable on current year profits, adjusted for non-tax deductible or non-taxable items, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Current tax is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement unless it relates to items which are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income or directly in equity.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is calculated on differences between the accounting value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax values.
Deferred tax is also recognised in respect of unused tax losses to the extent it is probable that future taxable profits will arise against which the losses can be utilised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the Consolidated Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income or charged or credited directly in equity.
Tax attributable to policyholders and equity holders The total tax expense shown in the groups Consolidated Income Statement includes income tax borne by both policyholders and shareholders.
This has been apportioned between that attributable to policyholders returns and equity holders profits.
This represents the fact that the groups long-term business in the UK pays tax on policyholder investment return, in addition to the corporation tax charge charged on shareholder profit.
The separate presentation is intended to provide more relevant information about the tax that the group pays on the profits that it makes.
For this apportionment, the equity holders tax on long-term business is estimated by applying the statutory tax rate to profits attributed to equity holders.
This is considered to approximate the corporation tax attributable to shareholders as calculated under UK tax rules.
The balance of income tax associated with UK long-term business is attributed to income tax attributable to policyholders returns and approximates the corporation tax attributable to policyholders as calculated under UK tax rules.
Use of estimates Tax balances include the use of estimates and assumptions which affect items reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Income Statement.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current circumstances and future events and actions, actual results may differ from those estimates.
For tax this includes the determination of liabilities recoverables for uncertain tax positions and estimation of future taxable income supporting deferred tax asset recognition.
As the group operates internationally, it is exposed to uncertain tax positions and changes in legislation in the jurisdictions in which it operates.
Theassessment of uncertain tax positions is subjective and significant management judgement is required.
This judgement is based on interpretation of legislation, management experience and professional advice.
The directors have assessed the groups uncertain tax positions and are comfortable that the provisions in place are not material individually or in aggregate, and that a reasonable possible alternative outcome in the next financial year would not have a material impact to the results of the group.

The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the awards, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
At each balance sheet date, the group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments which are expected to become exercisable.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the Consolidated Income Statement and a corresponding adjustment is made to equity.
On vesting or exercise, the difference between the expense charged to the Consolidated Income Statement and the actual cost to the group is transferred to retained earnings.

New performance conditions attached to awards from 2014 result in the number of options that vest being equally dependent on the groups relative TSR and earnings per share EPS dividend per share DPS growth.
In addition, the awards vest after the end of the three year performance period and become exercisable in thirds over three, four and five years.
Further changes were made to the performance conditions for awards granted in 2018.
The number of options that vest in respect of these awards is equally dependent on the groups relative TSR and EPS growth subject to Solvency II objectives.
The majority of awards vest after the end of the three year performance period and become exercisable in thirds in year three, four and five.
Awards granted to Executive Directors and Persons Delivering Managerial Responsibilities vest after three years but any options that vest will not become exercisable until year five.
The Share Bonus Plan SBP awards restricted shares, combined awards of CSOP options and restricted shares and combined awards of CSOP options and nil-paid options.
With the exception of the Executive Directors, recipients of restricted shares are entitled to both vote and receive dividends.
Fair value is calculated as the market value on the grant date, adjusted to reflect the eligibility for dividend payments.
Under the HMRC tax-advantaged Employee Share Plan ESP, permanent UK employees may elect to purchase group shares from the market at the prevailing market price on a monthly basis.
The group supplements the number of shares purchased by giving employees one free matching share for every one share purchased up to the first 20 of the employees contributions and one free matching share for every two shares purchased with contributions between 20 and 125.
There is currently no match on contributions between 125 and 150.
From time to time, the group may make a grant of free shares.
Both the free and matching shares must be held in trust for three years.
The fair value of granted shares is equal to the market value at grant date.

34 Share capital, share premium and employee scheme treasury shares An equity instrument is any contract which evidences a residual interest in the net assets of an entity.
It follows that a financial instrument is treated as equity if: there is no contractual obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or liabilities on unfavourable terms: and the instrument is either a non-derivative which contains no contractual obligation to deliver a variable number of own equity instruments, or is a derivative which will be settled only by the group exchanging a fixed amount of cash, or other financial assets, for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
Where any group entity purchases the companys equity share capital, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes, is deducted from equity attributable to shareholders.
Where such shares are subsequently sold, reissued or otherwise disposed of, any consideration received is included in equity attributable to shareholders, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects.
Shares held on behalf of employee share schemes are disclosed as such on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

210 Legal & General Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial Statements Additional financial information 39 Contingent liabilities, guarantees and indemnities Provision for the liabilities arising under contracts with policyholders is based on certain assumptions.
The variance between actual experience fromthat assumed may result in those liabilities differing from the provisions made for them.
Liabilities may also arise in respect of claims relating tothe interpretation of policyholder contracts, or the circumstances in which policyholders have entered into them.
The extent of these liabilities is influenced by a number of factors including the actions and requirements of the PRA, FCA, ombudsman rulings, industry compensation schemes and court judgements.
Various group companies receive claims and become involved in actual or threatened litigation and regulatory issues from time to time.
The relevant members of the group ensure that they make prudent provision as and when circumstances calling for such provision become clear, and that each has adequate capital and reserves to meet reasonably foreseeable eventualities.
The provisions made are regularly reviewed.
It is not possible to predict, with certainty, the extent and the timing of the financial impact of these claims, litigation or issues.
In 1975, Legal and General Assurance Society Limited LGAS was required by the Institute of London Underwriters ILU to execute the ILU form of guarantee in respect of policies issued through the ILUs Policy Signing Office on behalf of NRG Victory Reinsurance Company Ltd Victory, a company which was then a subsidiary of LGAS.
In 1990, Nederlandse Reassurantie Groep Holding NV the assets and liabilities of which have since been assumed by Nederlandse Reassurantie Groep NV under a statutory merger in the Netherlands acquired Victory and provided an indemnity to LGAS against any liability LGAS may have as a result of the ILUs requirement, and the ILU agreed that its requirement of LGAS would not apply to policies written or renewed after the acquisition.
Nederlandse Reassurantie Groep NV is now owned by Columbia Insurance Company, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
Whether LGAS has any liability as a result of the ILUs requirement and, if so, the amount of its potential liability is uncertain.
LGAS has made no payment or provision in respect of this matter.
Group companies have given warranties, indemnities and guarantees as a normal part of their business and operating activities or in relation to capital market transactions or corporate disposals.
