The Group has a policy of reviewing the financial information of prospective occupiers and only dealing with those that are creditworthy and obtaining sufficient rental cash deposits or third party guarantees asameans of mitigating financial loss from defaults.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the large and diverse occupier base.
Accordingly, the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of rent deposits obtained.
Details of the Groups receivables are summarised in note 14 of the financial statements.
The Groups cash deposits are placed with a diversified range of banks, and strict counterparty limits ensure the Groups exposure to bank failure is minimised.
Capital risk The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns and as such it aims to maintain an appropriate mix of debt and equity financing.
The current capital structure of the Group consists of a mix of equity and debt.
Equity comprises issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Group statement of changes in equity.
Debt comprises long-term debenture stock, private placement notes, convertible bonds and drawings against committed revolving credit facilities from banks.
The Group aims to maintain a loan-to-property value of between 10% 40% see note 9.
The Group operates solely in the United Kingdom, and its operating profits and net assets are Sterling denominated.
As a result, the Groups policy is to have no unhedged assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.
The currency risk on overseas transactions has historically beenfully hedged through foreign currency derivatives to create a synthetic sterling exposure.
Annual Report 2018 Great Portland Estates 163 17 Financial instruments continued Liquidity risk The Group operates a framework for the management of its short-, mediumand long-term funding requirements.
Cash flow and funding needs are regularly monitored to ensure sufficient undrawn facilities are in place.
The Groups funding sources are diversified across a range of bank and bond markets and strict counterparty limits are operated on deposits.
The Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through the utilisation of its revolving credit facility.
The availability of this facility depends on the Group complying with a number of key financial covenants: these covenants and the Groups compliance with them are set out in the table below: March 2018 Key covenants Covenant actuals Group Net debt net equity 1.25x n a Inner borrowing unencumbered asset value unsecured borrowings 1.66x n a Interest cover 1.35x n a Due to the Group being in a net cash position at the balance sheet date, and there was no interest charge as measured under our debt covenants in the year, none of the Groups debt covenants were measurable.
The Group has undrawn credit facilities of 451.0 million and has substantial headroom above all of its key covenants.
As a result, thedirectors consider the Group to have adequate liquidity to be able to fund the ongoing operations of the business.

It is the risk that future cash flows arising from a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in interest rates.
It is the Groups policy to reduce interest rate risk in respect of the cash flows arising from its debt finance either through the use of fixed rate debt or through the use of interest rate derivatives such as swaps, caps and floors.
It is the Groups usual policy to maintain the proportion of floating interest rate exposure to between 20%40% of forecast total debt.
However, this target is flexible, and may not be adhered to at all times depending on, for example, the Groups view of future interest rate movements.
Interest rate floors Under the terms of an interest rate floor, one party the seller makes a payment to the other party the buyer if an underlying interest rate is below a specified rate.
The Group has bought an interest rate floor, which, when combined with fixed rate debt, gives rise to the same economic effect as purchasing an interest rate cap in respect offloating rate debt.
Cross currency swaps Cross currency swaps enable the Group to exchange receipts or payments denominated in currencies other than sterling for receipts or payments denominated in Sterling.
Such contracts allow the Group to eliminate foreign exchange risk arising from fluctuating exchange rates between Sterling and other currencies.
