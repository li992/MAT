It was decided that, with effect from the financial year to 31 October 2018, the Company would allocate 65% of both eligible expenses and interest to capital, with the remaining 35% of each allocated to revenue.
This compares with the previous 50% 50%.
Expenses not eligible to be charged to capital would be wholly charged to revenue.
If this new allocation policy had been in place in the financial year to 31 October 2017, the net effect would have resulted in a small increase to net income per share of 0.7p to 23.7p.

Actuarial valuations are obtained triennially and are updated at each balance sheet date.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out as at 31 July 2016 by XPS Pensions Group which disclosed a scheme deficit of 6,942,000.
The Company agreed to meet this deficit over fifteen years and seven months.
It should be noted that this deficit differs from that disclosed by Financial Reporting Standard 102 FRS102 which is set out below and which is the liability required to be shown in the Financial Statements.
The main reason for the difference is that FRS102 requires future liabilities to be calculated actuarially using a rate of return based on the yield from investment grade corporate bonds which is lower than the expected rate of return on the equities in which the scheme is invested.
The FRS102 liability is separately disclosed in the balance sheet.
For the defined benefit scheme, the amounts charged against revenue, as part of staff costs, are the actuarial estimation of current service costs that is, the increase in scheme liabilities arising from employee service for the current accounting period and gains and losses from settlements whereby the Company is relieved of a pension obligation and from curtailments whereby the estimated years of future service are reduced in the period.
The cost of past service benefits which have vested are charged against revenue as they arise.
Where such benefits have not vested, costs are accrued until vesting occurs.

Financial instruments continued Risk management policies and procedures As an investment trust, the Company invests in equities and other investments for the long term so as to secure its investment objective stated on the inside front cover.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in a reduction in the Companys net assets and a reduction in the profits available for dividend.
The main risks include investment and market price risk comprising foreign currency risk and interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Directors approach to the management of these risks is set out below.
The Directors of the Company and of S. I. T. Savings Limited coordinate the Companys risk management.
The Companys policies and processes for managing the risks, and the methods used to measure the risks, which are set out below, have not changed from those applied in the previous year.
Investment and market price risk The holding of securities and investing activities involve certain inherent risks, principally in relation to market risk.
A contrarian investment approach is a distinctive style that may deviate from comparator indices and peer group performance over discrete periods.
Whilst performance is compared against major global and UK indices, the composition of indices has no influence on investment decisions or the construction of the portfolio.
As a result, it is expected that the Companys investment portfolio and performance may deviate from the comparator indices.
Events may occur which affect the value of investments.
From time to time, the Company may wish to use derivatives in order to protect against a specific risk or to facilitate a change in investment strategy such as the movement of funds from one area to another.
No such transaction may take place without the prior authorisation of the Board.
Management of the risk Company performance is monitored at each Board meeting, including investment performance.
The Company holds a portfolio which is well diversified across industrial and geographical areas to help minimise these risks.
The contrarian investment approach is explained in our shareholder communications and through meetings with media and the investor community.
The levels of gearing and gross gearing are monitored closely by the Board and the Manager.
The Board currently limits gearing to 20%.
While gearing will be employed in a typical range of 0% to 20%, the Company retains the ability to lower equity exposure to a net cash position if deemed appropriate.
Foreign currency risk Approximately 73% of the Companys assets are invested overseas which gives rise to a currency risk.
From time to time, specific hedging transactions may be undertaken.
The Companys overseas income is subject to currency movements.
The currency profile of the Companys monetary assets and liabilities is set out below.
Management of the risk Management monitors the Companys exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis, and reports to the Board at regular intervals.
Management measures the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and income of a movement in the rates of exchange to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
Foreign currency borrowings and forward currency contracts may be used to limit the Companys exposure to anticipated future changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments or the income received from them.
These borrowings and contracts are limited to currencies and amounts commensurate with the asset exposure to those currencies.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
The Company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is receivable and its receipt.
indd 62 07 12 2018 14:58 | The Scottish Investment Trust PLC Annual Report 2018 63 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 16.

Financial instruments continued Foreign currency sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the total return for the year and the shareholders funds in regard to the Companys financial assets and financial liabilities.
It assumes a 10% depreciation of sterling against both the US dollar and the euro at 31 October 2018.
These percentages have been determined based on the average market volatility in exchange rates in the previous twelve months.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary foreign currency financial instruments held at each balance sheet date.
2018 2017 US $ Euro US $ Euro 000 000 000 000 If sterling had weakened by 10% against the currencies shown, this would have had the following effect: Income statement return on ordinary activities after taxation: Revenue return 984 462 604 417 Capital return 29,856 8,861 23,957 12,266 Return attributable to shareholders 30,840 9,323 24,561 12,683 A 10% strengthening of sterling against the above currencies would result in an equal and opposite effect on the above amounts.
In the opinion of the Directors, the above sensitivity analyses are broadly representative of the whole of the current and comparative years.
c. Interest rate risk The Company finances its operations through a combination of investment realisations, retained revenue reserves, debenture stocks and secured bonds.
All debenture stocks and secured bonds are at fixed rates.
Details of interest rates on financial assets are included in note 8 on page 58.
Details of interest rates on financial liabilities are included in note 12 on page 59.
Management of the risk The Company finances part of its activities through borrowings at levels which have been approved and are monitored by the Board.
Interest rate exposure The exposure, at the year end, of financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk is shown below.

Financial instruments continued Interest rate sensitivity If interest rates had decreased by 5%, with all other variables held constant, the return attributable to shareholders as shown on the Income Statement would have decreased by the amounts shown in the table below: 2018 2017 000 000 Return attributable to shareholders 23 10 A 5% increase in interest rates would result in an equal and opposite effect on the above amounts.
d. Liquidity risk Almost all of the Companys assets comprise listed securities which represent a ready source of funds.
The maturity profile of the Companys borrowings is included in note 12 on page 59.
Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not as significant as the other risks as most of the Companys assets are investments in quoted equities and are readily realisable.
Management reviews the liquidity of the portfolio when making investment decisions.
e. Credit risk The failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Company suffering a loss.
Credit risk exposure The amounts shown in the balance sheet under debtors and cash and deposits represent the maximum exposure to credit risk at the current and comparative year ends.
Cash comprises balances held by banks with a satisfactory credit rating 2017: same.
Management of the risk This risk is managed as follows: by dealing only with brokers and banks which have been approved by the Audit Committee and which have credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies: and by setting limits on the maximum exposure to any one counterparty at any time, which are reviewed semi-annually at meetings of the Audit Committee.
f. Capital management policies and procedures The Company carries on its business as a global growth investment trust.
Its objective is to provide investors, over the longer term, with above-average returns through a diversified portfolio of international equities and to achieve dividend growth ahead of UK inflation.
The levels of gearing and gross gearing are monitored closely by the Board and management.
The Board, with the assistance of management, monitors and reviews the structure of the Companys capital on an ongoing basis.
This review includes the planned level of gearing which will take into account managements view on the market, the need to buy back shares for cancellation and the level of dividends.
The Companys policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from the previous year.
