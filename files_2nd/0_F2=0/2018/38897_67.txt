Pension schemes continued G6.3 Abbey Life Staff Pension Scheme continued Derivative values above include interest rate and inflation rate swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts.
The Abbey Life Scheme has hedged its inflation risk through an inflation swap.
It is currently exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that the holdings in bonds are mismatched to the scheme liabilities.
The long-term intention is to fully hedge this risk through an interest rate swap.
Further key risks that will remain are longevity and credit spread exposures.
Defined benefit obligation The calculation of the defined benefit obligation can be allocated to the Abbey Life Schemes members as follows: Active scheme members: nil% 2017: 5% Deferred scheme members: 49% 2017: 55% : and Pensioners: 51% 2017: 40% The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2018 is 17 years 2017: 18 years.
Principal assumptions The principal financial assumptions of the Abbey Life Scheme are set out in the table below: 2018 2017 % % Rate of increase for pensions in payment 3.10 3.05 Rate of increase for deferred pensions CPI subject to caps 2.40 2.20 Discount rate 2.80 2.50 Inflation RPI 3.20 3.20 Inflation CPI 2.40 2.20 Rate of salary increases N A 4.20 Commutation of benefits to lump sums on retirement 20.00 15.00 The discount rate and inflation assumptions have been determined by considering the shape of the appropriate yield curves and the duration of the Abbey Life Scheme liabilities.
This method determines an equivalent single rate for each of the discount and inflation rates, which is derived from the profile of projected benefit payments.
It has been assumed that post-retirement mortality is in line with a scheme-specific table which was derived from the actual mortality experience in recent years, performed as part of the actuarial funding valuation as at 31 March 2015, using the SAPS S2 Light tables for males and for females based on year of use.
Future longevity improvements are based on CMI 2017 Core Projections 2017: CMI 2016 Core Projections and a long-term rate of improvement of 1.75% per annum for males and 1.50% per annum for females up to and including age 85 then decreasing linearly to 0% per annum at age 110 unchanged from 2017.
Under these assumptions the average life expectancy from retirement for a member currently aged 45 retiring at age 65 is 25.7 years and 27.2 years for male and female members respectively 2017: 25.8 years and 27.2 years respectively.
A quantitative sensitivity analysis for significant actuarial assumptions is shown below: 2018 Assumptions Base Discount rate RPI Life expectancy 25bps 25bps 25bps 25bps 1 year 1 year Sensitivity level increase decrease increase decrease increase decrease Impact on the defined benefit obligation m 307 12 13 9 9 12 11 2017 Assumptions Base Discount rate RPI Life expectancy 25bps 25bps 25bps 25bps 1 year 1 year Sensitivity level increase decrease increase decrease increase decrease Impact on the defined benefit obligation m 321 15 15 11 11 10 9 The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the statement of financial position.
