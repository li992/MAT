Derivative financial instruments Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value at the balance sheet date.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
At the inception of the transaction the Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are effective in offsetting changes in fair values of hedged items.
Certain financial instruments are not designated or do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Typically the Group will not designate financial instruments for hedge accounting where a perfect or near perfect offset is expected between the change in value of assets and liabilities.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments in this category are immediately recognised in the incomestatement.
Where financial instruments are designated for hedge accounting they are designated as either fair value hedge, net investment hedge or cash flow hedge.
When designating cross currency swaps, the cost of hedging has been excluded from the relationship and any movement in the fair value related to the cost of hedging is deferred in equity and amortised over the life of the hedged item.
a Fair value hedge These instruments are used to hedge exposure to changes in the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recognised in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
b Net investment hedge These instruments are used to hedge exposure on translation of net investments in foreign operations.
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income: the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
In the event of disposal of a foreign operation, the gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are recognised in the income statement.
c Cash flow hedge These instruments are used to hedge a highly probable forecast transaction or a change in the cash flows of a recognised asset or liability.
The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income.
Any ineffective portion is immediately recognised in the income statement.
The gains or losses that are recognised in comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement in the same period in which the hedged cash flows affect the income statement.
In the event the hedged item occurs or is no longer expected to occur, accumulated gains or losses held in the cash flow hedge reserve are immediately recognised in the income statement.
In the event the hedged item is expected to occur but no longer meets the requirements of hedge accounting, accumulated gains or losses remain in other comprehensive income and are only recognised in the income statement when the forecast transaction occurs or is no longer expected to occur.
Cash flow hedge accounting has been applied to derivatives marked as cash flow hedge in the table on page 143 in accordance with IFRS 9.
Where no hedge accounting has been applied, related derivatives have been marked as non-hedge.
Any ineffectiveness on the cash flow hedge is taken directly to finance costs.
There was no ineffectiveness to be recorded from net investment in foreign entity hedges or those derivatives in a cash flow hedge relationship.
Cash flow hedge accounting has been applied to 54.4m of the 500m 2019 bond, hedging the changes in cash flow due to volatility in the GBP EUR exchange rate.
Cash flow hedge has also been applied to the floating interest of the $50m term loan maturing in 2020 that has been swapped to a fixed rate.
At the end of the year, the amount in comprehensive income related to cash flow hedge accounting was a gain of 9.5m 2017: 2.6m loss.
