Notes on the EEV basis results continued 6 Effect of changes in economic assumptions i Group summary for long-term business operations 2018 m 2017 m note ii Asia 115 95 note iii US 197 136 note iv UK and Europe 166 129 Group total 146 102 ii Asia 2018 m 2017 m Hong Kong 165 321 Indonesia 94 81 Malaysia 19 59 Singapore 70 131 Other 7 45 Total 115 95 Note The positive effect in 2018 of 115 million largely arises from movements in long-term interest rates, resulting in higher assumed fund earned rates in Hong Kong and Singapore, partially offset by the impact of valuing future profits for health and protection business at higher discount rates in Indonesia and Malaysia.
iii US 2018 m 2017 m Variable annuity business 365 101 Fixed annuity and other general account business 168 35 Total 197 136 Note For 2018, the credit of 197 million mainly reflects the increase in the assumed separate account return following the 30 basis points increase in the US 10-year treasury yield over the year, resulting in higher projected fee income and a decrease in projected benefit costs for variable annuity business.
For fixed annuity and other general account business, the impact reflects the effect on the present value of future projected spread income from the combined increase in interest rates and credit spreads in the year.
In June 2018, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC formally approved changes to RBC capital factors that reflected the December 2017 US tax reform.
Consequently, the effect of changes in economic assumptions for 2018 of 197 million includes a negative 23 million impact resulting from these changes.
iv UK and Europe 2018 m 2017 m Shareholder-backed annuity business 1 28 With-profits and other business 167 101 Total 166 129 Note The charge of 166 million includes the impact of the movement in expected long-term rates of investment return, resulting from market movements and changes in the asset mix in the year, and risk discount rates.
In addition, the effect of changes in economic assumptions for with-profits and other business of 167 million includes a 78 million charge for the effect on lower fund earned rates on equities and property as a result of the change in UK indexation of capital gains rules effective from 1 January 2018.
