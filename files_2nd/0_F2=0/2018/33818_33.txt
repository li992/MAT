This has led to changes in the data from previous years.
The majority of adjustments made are not material individually, except for business air travel new data supplier, leading to restated baseline and product use phase recalculated using improved life-cycle emissions data.
Thedata quoted in this Annual Report are generated from the revised data.
2 Included in this section are GHGs from direct fuel combustion, process and engineering emissions at our sites and from fuel use in our vehicle fleet.
3 GHGs from imported electricity are calculated using the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance January 2015 requiring the dual reporting using two emissions factors for each site Market-based and Location-based.
Our corporate emissions reporting and targets follow the Market-based approach.
4 In previous years, this data has been reported one year in arrears.
GHG accounting has been updated to align the 2016 and 2017 reporting with the actual year's emissions data.
For 2018 reporting, a significant proportion has been estimated and will be refined in future external reports.
