Pensions The primary pension arrangement is a funded final salary pension plan in the UK under which retired employees draw the majority of their benefit as an annuity.
This pension plan is governed by a corporate trustee whose board is composed of four member-nominated directors, four company-nominated directors, an independent director, and an independent chairman nominated by the company.
The trustee board is required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants and is responsible for setting certain policies, such as investment policies of the plan.
The plan is closed to new joiners but remains open to ongoing accrual for current members.
New joiners are eligible for membership of a defined contribution plan.
The level of contributions to funded defined benefit plans is the amount needed to provide adequate funds to meet pension obligations as they fall due.
During 2018 the aggregate level of contributions was $490 million 2017 $509 million.
The aggregate level of contributions in 2019 is expected to be approximately $262 million, and includes contributions we expect to be required to make by law or under contractual agreements, as well as an allowance for discretionary funding.
