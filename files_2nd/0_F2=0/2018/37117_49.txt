Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 19.
Financial Instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Groups Statement of Financial Position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire or are transferred.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Financial Assets The Groups financial assets are all categorised as loans and receivables with the exception of derivative assets.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
The Groups loans and receivables comprise Trade and other receivables and Cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise short-term cash deposits with major clearing banks earning floating rates of interest based upon bank base rates or rates linked to LIBOR and EURIBOR.
The currency profile of cash and cash equivalents is shown below: 2018 2017 m m Cash and cash equivalents 347.5 247.6 Sterling 218.7 159.1 Euros 97.4 75.6 US Dollars 12.5 5.1 Australian Dollars 9.2 4.2 New Zealand Dollars 0.3 0.2 Swedish Krona 0.6 0.3 Danish Krone 3.7 1.3 Other 5.1 1.8 347.5 247.6 Financial Liabilities The Groups financial liabilities are all categorised as other financial liabilities.
Other financial liabilities, with the exception of foreign exchange forward contracts and put option liabilities are measured at amortised cost.
The Groups other financial liabilities comprise Interest-bearing loans and borrowings and Trade and other payables.
The currency profile of interest-bearing loans and borrowings is shown below: 2018 2017 m m Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 37.8 34.0 Sterling 7.7 25.7 Euros 13.0 0.7 Australian Dollars 7.9 7.1 South Korean Won 7.0 - Other 2.2 0.5 37.8 34.0 Risk Management The Groups operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk and its liquidity position.
The Group manages these risks through the use of derivative instruments, which are reviewed on a regular basis.
Derivative instruments are not entered into for speculative purposes.
There are no concentrations of risk in the period to 3 February 2018.

Financial Instruments continued Interest Rate Risk The Group finances its operations by a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
The Groups borrowings are at floating rates, partially hedged by floating rate interest on deposits, reflecting the seasonality of its cash flow.
Interest rate risk therefore arises from bank borrowings.
Interest rate hedging has not been put in place on the current facility.
The Directors continue to be mindful of the potential volatility in base rates, but at present do not consider a long term interest rate hedge to be necessary given the inherent short term nature of both the revolving credit facility and working capital facility.
This position is reviewed regularly, along with the level of facility required.
The Group has potential bank floating rate financial liabilities on the 215 million committed bank facility, together with overdraft facilities in subsidiary companies see note 18.
At 3 February 2018 nil was drawn down from the committed bank facility 2017: nil.
When drawdowns are made, the Group is exposed to cash flow interest risk with interest paid at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 1.1% 2017: 1.1%.
As at 3 February 2018 the Group has liabilities of 3.8 million 2017: 1.0 million, in respect of finance lease or similar hire purchase contracts.
A change of 1.0% in the average interest rates during the year, applied to the Groups floating interest rate loans and borrowings as at the reporting date, would change profit before tax by 0.1 million 2017: 0.1 million and would change equity by 0.1 million 2017: 0.1 million.
The calculation is based on any floating interest rate loans and borrowings drawn down at the period end date.
This includes the Groups committed bank facility, Tiso Group Limiteds overdraft, Next Athleisure Pty Limiteds overdraft, Go Outdoors Limiteds bank loans and JD Sports Fashion South Korea bank loans.
Calculations are performed on the same basis as the prior year and assume that all other variables remain unchanged.
Foreign Currency Risk Foreign Currency Translation Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange at the reporting date.
Exchange differences in monetary items are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange at the reporting date.
Income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the accounting period.
Foreign currency differences are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and are presented in the foreign currency translation reserve.
Derivative Financial Instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational, financing and investment activities.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value and remeasured at each period end.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
Interest rate swaps are recognised at fair value in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position with movements in fair value recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement for the period.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the reporting date, taking into account current interest rates and the respective risk profiles of the swap counterparties.
152 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 19.
Financial Instruments continued Hedging of Monetary Assets and Liabilities Where a derivative financial instrument is used to hedge the foreign exchange exposure of a recognised monetary asset or liability, no hedge accounting is applied and any gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than pound sterling.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are the Euro and US Dollar with sales made in Euros and purchases made in both Euros and US Dollars principal exposure.
To protect its foreign currency position, the Group sets a buying rate in each country for the purchase of goods in US Dollars at the start of the buying season typically six to nine months before the product actually starts to appear in the stores and then enters into a number of local currency US Dollar contracts whereby the minimum exchange rate on the purchase of dollars is guaranteed.
As at 3 February 2018, options have been entered into to protect approximately 96% of the US Dollar trading requirement for the period to January 2019.
The balance of the US Dollar requirement for the period will be satisfied at spot rates.
As at 3 February 2018, the fair value of these instruments was a liability of 24.8 million 2017: liability of 3.3 million and these are all classified as due within one year.
A loss of 21.5 million 2017: loss of 4.4 million has been recognised in cost of sales within the Consolidated Income Statement for the change in fair value of these instruments.
We have considered the credit risk of the Groups and counterpartys credit risk and this is not expected to have a material effect on the valuation of these options.
A 10.0% strengthening of sterling relative to the following currencies as at the reporting date would have reduced profit before tax and equity as follows: Profit before tax Equity 2018 2017 2018 2017 m m m m Euros 2.9 4.9 14.6 13.1 US Dollars 0.9 0.4 0.9 0.4 Australian Dollars 0.7 0.3 1.1 0.7 Other 0.5 0.1 1.8 - 5.0 5.7 18.4 14.2 A 10.0% weakening of sterling relative to the following currencies as at the reporting date would have increased profit before tax and equity as follows: Profit before tax Equity 2018 2017 2018 2017 m m m m Euros 3.6 5.9 18.7 16.3 US Dollars 1.1 0.5 1.1 0.5 Australian Dollars 0.9 0.3 1.4 0.9 Other 0.5 0.2 2.2 - 6.1 6.9 23.4 17.7 Calculations are performed on the same basis as the prior year and the method assumes that all other variables remain unchanged.

Financial Instruments continued Credit Risk Credit risk arises from the possibility of customers and counterparties failing to meet their obligations to the Group.
Investments of cash surpluses, borrowings and derivative instruments are made through major clearing banks, which must meet minimum credit ratings as required by the Board.
All customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and provision is made for impairment where amounts are not thought to be recoverable see note 16.
At the reporting date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk and receivables which are not impaired are believed to be recoverable.
The Group considers its maximum exposure to credit risk to be equivalent to total trade and other receivables of 146.3 million 2017: 118.5 million and cash and cash equivalents of 347.5 million 2017: 247.6 million.
Liquidity Risk The Group manages its cash and borrowing requirement to minimise net interest expense, whilst ensuring that the Group has sufficient liquid resources to meet the operating needs of the business.
The forecast cash and borrowing profile of the Group is monitored on an ongoing basis, to ensure that adequate headroom remains under committed borrowing facilities.
The Board review 13 week and annual cash flow forecasts each month.
Information about the maturity of the Groups financial liabilities is disclosed in note 18.

Fair Values The fair values together with the carrying amounts shown in the Statement of Financial Position as at 3 February 2018 are as follows: Carrying amount Fair value 2018 2018 Note m m Trade and other receivables 16 87.6 87.6 Cash and cash equivalents 17 347.5 347.5 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings current 18 26.8 26.8 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings non-current 18 11.0 9.5 Trade and other payables current 548.7 548.7 Trade and other payables non-current 40.2 39.8 191.6 189.7 Unrecognised gains 1.9 154 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 19.
Financial Instruments continued The comparatives at 28 January 2017 are as follows: Carrying amount Fair value 2017 2017 Note m m Trade and other receivables 16 73.0 73.0 Cash and cash equivalents 17 247.6 247.6 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings current 18 31.5 31.5 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings non-current 18 2.5 2.0 Trade and other payables current 399.4 399.4 Trade and other payables non-current 7.5 6.4 120.3 118.7 Unrecognised gains 1.6 In the opinion of the Board, the fair value of the Groups current financial assets and liabilities as at 3 February 2018 and 28 January 2017 are not considered to be materially different to that of the book value.
On this basis, the fair value hierarchy reflects the carrying values.
In respect of the Groups non-current financial assets and liabilities as at 3 February 2018 and 28 January 2017, the fair value has been calculated using a pre-tax discount rate of 10.1% 2017: 10.7% which reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the specific risks applicable to the liability.
Estimation of Fair Values For trade and other receivables payables, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
Fair Value Hierarchy As at 3 February 2018, the Group held the following financial instruments carried at fair value on the Statement of Financial Position: Foreign exchange forward contracts non-hedged Put and call options The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly Level 3: techniques which use inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data 155
