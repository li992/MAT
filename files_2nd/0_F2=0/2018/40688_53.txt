CAPITAL AND FUNDING ORDINARY SHARES Ordinary shares are classified as equity.

INTERNAL HOLDINGS The ordinary shares numbered 1 to 2,400 inclusive in NV Special Shares and deferred stock of PLC are held as to one half of each class by N. V. Elma a subsidiary of NV and one half by United Holdings Limited a subsidiary of PLC.
This capital is eliminated on consolidation.
SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION The Group operates a number of share-based compensation plans involving options and awards of ordinary shares of NV and PLC.

Certain bonds are designated as being part of a fair value hedge relationship.
In these cases, the bonds are carried at amortised cost, adjusted for the fair value of the risk being hedged, with changes in value shown in profit and loss.
Other financial liabilities, excluding derivatives, are subsequently carried at amortised cost, with the exception of: Financial liabilities which the group has elected to measure at fair value through profit or loss: Derivative financial liabilities see note 16 on page 110 The Groups Treasury activities are designed to: maintain a competitive balance sheet in line with at least A A2 rating see below : secure funding at lowest costs for the Groups operations, M&A activity and external dividend payments see below : protect the Groups financial results and position from financial risks see note 16 : maintain market risks within acceptable parameters, while optimising returns see note 16 : and protect the Groups financial investments, while maximising returns see note 17.

The Group manages its capital so as to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern and to optimise returns to our shareholders through an appropriate balance of debt and equity.
The capital structure of the Group is based on managements judgement of the appropriate balance of key elements in order to meet its strategic and day-to-day needs.
We consider the amount of capital in proportion to risk and manage the capital structure in light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
Our current long-term credit rating is A A1 and our short-term credit rating is A1 P1.
We aim to maintain a competitive balance sheet which we consider to be the equivalent of a credit rating of at least A A2 in the long term.
This provides us with: appropriate access to the debt and equity markets: sufficient flexibility for acquisitions: sufficient resilience against economic and financial uncertainty while ensuring ample liquidity: and optimal weighted average cost of capital, given the above constraints.
