The issued capital and reserves of the Company are largely consistent with Cairn Energy PLC Group Financial Statements.
Refer to note 6.1 of the Group Financial Statements.
Key estimates and assumptions in this section: Impairment testing of investments in subsidiaries The Companys investment in Capricorn Oil Limited has been tested for impairment by comparison against the underlying value of exploration appraisal and development producing assets, held within the Capricorn Oil sub-group, based on fair value less costs of disposal.
The fair values are calculated using the same assumptions as noted in section 2.
7.1 Basis of Preparation The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU.
The Company applies accounting policies consistent with those applied by the Group.
To the extent that an accounting policy is relevant to both Group and Company Financial Statements, refer to the Group Financial Statements for disclosure of the accounting policy.
Material policies that apply to the Company only are included as appropriate.
Cairn has used the exemption granted under s408 of the Companies Act 2006 that allows for the non-disclosure of the Income Statement of the Parent company.
The net assets in the Company Balance Sheet remain in excess of the Groups total net assets as a result of historic impairment tests.
The Group Balance Sheet reflects past impairments charged against UK & Norway exploration assets included in past business combinations.
The Companys direct investment in subsidiaries have not suffered the same impairment as the fall in value of the UK & Norway assets is offset by the increase in the value of Senegal assets.

Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 175 Financial Statements 7.7 Investments in Subsidiaries Accounting policy The Companys investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less provisions resulting from impairment.
In testing for impairment the carrying value of the investment is compared to its recoverable amount, being its fair value less costs of disposal.
The fair value is based on the discounted future net cash flows of oil and gas assets held by the subsidiary, using estimated cash flow projections over the licence period.
For exploration assets, estimated discounted cash flows are risk-weighted for future exploration success.
Discounted future net cash flows are calculated using an estimated short-term oil price based on the forward curve and long-term oil price of US$70 per boe 2017: long-term oil price of US$70 per boe, escalation for prices and costs of 2.0% 2017: 2.0% and a discount rate of 10% 2017: 10%.
Full details on the assumptions used for valuing oil and gas assets can be found in section 2.
These represent the award of share options of the Company to the employees of Capricorn Energy Limited a principal subsidiary of Capricorn Oil Limited.
At the year end, investments in subsidiaries were reviewed for indicators of impairment and impairment tests conducted where indicators were identified.
Following this review, the Companys investment in Capricorn Oil Limited was impaired to reflect the fair value of the underlying assets of the Capricorn Oil Group.
A charge of US$299.7m was made to the Income Statement in 2018 2017: US$nil.
The fall in the value of the underlying assets of the Capricorn Oil Group reflects a fall in the value of UK producing assets and revised economic workings for the planned development of the Senegal exploration appraisal asset.
