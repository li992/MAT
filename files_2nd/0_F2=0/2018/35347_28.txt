Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information SECTION 3: OPERATING ASSETS AND WORKING CAPITAL This section gives further information on the operating assets we use to generate revenue and the short-term liquid assets and liabilities, managed during day-to-day operations, that comprise our working capital balances.
3.1 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT This note shows the cost, depreciation and net book value of the physical assets controlled by us that we use in our businesses to generate revenue.
The cost of an asset is what we paid to purchase or construct the asset.
Depreciation reflects the usage of the asset over time and is calculated by taking the cost of the asset, net of any residual value, to the income statement evenly over the useful economic life of the asset.
An assets net book value is its cost less any depreciation including impairment, if required charged to date.
Accounting policy Property, plant and equipment are initially measured at cost.
Cost comprises the purchase price after deducting trade discounts and rebates, any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management and the estimate of the present value of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site.
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment in value.
We construct many of our assets as part of long-term development projects.
Assets that are in the course of construction are not depreciated until they are ready for us to use in the way intended.
This category has been shown separately for the first time in 2018.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write down assets to their residual value evenly over their estimated useful economic lives UEL of the assets from the date of acquisition where relevant, limited to the expected decommissioning date of the power station currently expected to be 2039.
The table below shows the range of useful lives at the date of acquisition and the average remaining useful life at the balance sheet date of the main categories of asset we own in years: Range of Average UEL UELs at remaining acquisition Freehold buildings 23 833 Plant and equipment Electricity generation assets: Drax Power Station common plant 13 233 Drax Power Station biomass-specific assets 17 226 Drax Power Station coal-specific assets 5 319 Pellet production plant 14 520 Other plant, machinery and equipment 5 133 Decommissioning asset 21 34 Plant spare parts 21 Up to 34 Freehold land held at cost is considered to have an unlimited useful life and is not depreciated.
Electricity generation assets are grouped according to the fuel type of the plant.
Certain assets at Drax Power Station are common to the whole plant and are shown separately.
Pellet production plant includes the US-based assets of the Groups Pellet Production segment.
Within the plant and equipment categories shorter lives are attributed to components that are overhauled and upgraded as part of rolling outage cycles.
The majority of assets within these categories have a remaining useful life in excess of 15 years.
Plant spare parts are depreciated over the remaining useful life of the power station.
Costs relating to major inspections, overhauls and upgrades to the power station are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, if the recognition criteria are met: namely, when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually, taking into account regulatory change and commercial and technological obsolescence, as well as normal wear and tear.
Residual values are based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Any changes are applied prospectively.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 135 SECTION 3: OPERATING ASSETS AND WORKING CAPITAL continued 3.1 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT continued Significant estimation uncertainty Asset lives are reviewed annually at each balance sheet date.
Following the Governments announcement relating to the cessation of coal generation, the Group concluded that coal generation will cease during 2025, but that the two existing coal units will be retained for conversion to alternative fuels in the period to 2039.
The useful lives of electricity generation plant currently fuelled by biomass are unaffected by this change.
No changes to the useful economic lives of assets have been made as a result of the most recent review.
At each balance sheet date the Group reviews its property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that these assets may be impaired.
The Groups accounting policy in respect of impairment, along with details of the impairment review conducted during 2018, are set out in note 2.4.

Issues and transfers reflect changes in the categorisation of assets during the period e. g. when an asset under construction is complete, it is transferred to the relevant depreciable asset category, or the issue of spare parts for use in repair and maintenance projects.
When spares are utilised in such projects, the cost of the part is transferred from the property, plant and equipment balance and recognised as an expense in the income statement within operating costs.
3.2 OTHER FIXED ASSET INVESTMENTS Other fixed asset investments include equity investments held by the Group.
Accounting policy Other fixed asset investments are recognised at fair value, based on quoted market prices where available, at the date of transfer.
The Group designates its investments as at fair value through other comprehensive income, as they are intended to be held and not traded, in accordance with IFRS 9.
Where quoted market prices are not available and investments cannot be fair valued, they are held at cost and are reviewed for impairment annually.

As these shares are not listed, a value cannot be reliably estimated and the investment is held at cost.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 137 SECTION 3: OPERATING ASSETS AND WORKING CAPITAL continued 3.3 ROC ASSETS We earn Renewable Obligation Certificate ROC assets, which are accredited by the Office for Gas and Electricity Markets Ofgem, as a result of burning sustainable compressed wood pellets to generate electricity.
This note sets out the value of these assets that we hold at the year end.
Accounting policy ROCs are recognised as current assets in the period they are generated and are initially measured at fair value based on anticipated sales prices.
The value of ROCs earned is recognised in the income statement as a reduction in fuel costs in that period.
Where our B2B Energy Supply business incurs an obligation to deliver ROCs to Ofgem, that obligation is provided for in the period incurred.
At each reporting date the Group reviews the carrying value of ROC assets held against updated anticipated sales prices.
Where relevant, this takes account of agreed forward sale contracts and the likely utilisation of ROCs generated to settle our own ROC obligations.
Any impairment is recognised in the period incurred.
Significant estimation uncertainty The fair values and net realisable values of ROCs referred to above are calculated based on assumptions regarding future sales prices in the market, taking into account agreed forward sale contracts where appropriate.
Historic experience indicates that the assumptions used in the valuation are reasonable: however, actual sales prices may differ from those assumed.
ROC valuations also include an estimate of the future benefit that may be obtained from the ROC recycle fund at the end of the compliance period.
The recycle fund provides a benefit where supplier buy-out charges incurred by suppliers who do not procure sufficient ROCs to satisfy their obligations are paid over to renewable generators on a pro-rata basis.
The estimate is based on assumptions about likely levels of renewable generation and supply over the compliance period and is thus subject to some uncertainty.
The Group utilises external sources of information in addition to its own forecasts in making these estimates.
Past experience indicates that the values arrived at are reasonable but they remain subject to possible variation.
Total m Carrying amount: At 1 January 2017 257.6 Earned from generation 480.9 Purchased from third parties 33.7 Utilised by our B2B Energy Supply business 258.8 Sold to third parties 367.9 At 1 January 2018 145.5 Earned from generation 467.7 Purchased from third parties 582.6 Utilised by our B2B Energy Supply business 319.8 Sold to third parties 659.3 At 31 December 2018 216.7 Recognition of revenue from sales of ROCs is described in further detail on page 126.
The Group has increased sales and purchases of ROCs in the year as a result of working capital arrangements as described in note 4.4.
3.4 INVENTORIES We hold stocks of fuels and other consumable items that we use in the process of generating electricity and raw materials used in the production of compressed wood pellets.
This note shows the cost of coal, biomass, other fuels and plant consumables held at the end of the year, including items at Drax Power Station, our facilities in the US and those off-site locations.
Accounting policy Our raw materials and fuel stocks are valued at the lower of the weighted average cost to purchase and net realisable value.
The cost of fuel stocks includes all direct costs and overheads incurred in bringing the fuel to its present location and condition, including the purchase price, import duties and other taxes including amounts levied on coal under the UK carbon price support mechanism and transport handling costs.
The Group uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge the costs denominated in foreign currencies.
Where these contracts are designated into hedge relationships in accordance with IFRS 9, the stock cost is recognised at the hedged value.
In previous periods, the cost of fuel stock also included gains and losses arising from fair value changes on maturing derivative contracts that did not qualify for hedge accounting.
This practice has been discontinued and all such gains and losses are now included in cost of sales when they arise.
The prior year has not been restated for this change in policy as the impact was not material.
138 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information 3.4 INVENTORIES continued Both coal and biomass stocks are weighed when entering, moving within or exiting our sites using technology regularly calibrated to industry standards.
Fuel burn in the electricity generation process is calculated using a combination of weights and thermal efficiency calculations to provide closing stock volumes.
Both calibrated weighers and efficiency calculations are subject to a range of tolerable error.
All fuel inventories are subject to regular surveys to ensure these measurements are sufficiently accurate.
Coal stocks are verified by an independent stock survey carried out by a suitably trained specialist and a provision is made where the survey indicates a lower level of stock than indicated by the methods described above.
Despite being an independent process, the survey depends on estimates and assumptions and as a result actual values may differ.
The characteristics of biomass require specialist handling and storage.
On-site biomass at Drax Power Station is stored in sealed domes with a carefully controlled atmosphere for fire prevention purposes and thus cannot be surveyed using traditional methods.
Biomass stock is surveyed using regularly calibrated state-of-the-art RADAR scanning technology.
As at 31 December 2018 2017 m m Coal 81.0 44.5 Biomass 114.7 205.2 Other fuels and consumables 26.8 22.4 222.5 272.1 Inventories of biomass include 0.6 million of fibre and other raw materials utilised in the production of compressed wood pellets 2017: 1.5 million and 0.9 million of work in progress 2017: 0.1 million in our Pellet Production business.
Other fuels and consumables include 4.4 million of consumables acquired as part of the ScottishPower acquisition.
The cost of inventories recognised as an expense in the year ended 31 December 2018 was 1,601.1 million 2017: 1,285.8 million.
3.5 TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES Trade receivables represent amounts owed to us by our customers for goods or services we have provided but not yet been paid for.
Accrued income represents income earned in the period but not yet invoiced, largely in respect of power delivered that will be invoiced the following month.
Accounting policy Trade and other receivables are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is measured at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit loss.
The transition to IFRS 9 has not had a significant impact on the calculation of the provision.
Years ended 31 December 2017 2018 Restated m m Amounts falling due within one year: Trade receivables 162.6 125.7 Accrued income 197.0 203.7 Contract assets 4.3 5.3 Prepayments and other receivables 104.9 82.8 468.8 417.5 Trade receivables and accrued income principally represent sales of energy to counterparties within both our Power Generation and B2B Energy Supply businesses.
At 31 December 2018, the Group had amounts receivable from two 2017: five significant counterparties representing 12% 2017: 20% of total trade receivables and accrued income.
Of total trade receivables and acrrued income at 31 December 2018 266.6 million 2017: 255.7 million relates to B2B Energy Supply sales.
Contract assets have been separated from accrued income for the first time on application of IFRS 15.
The 2017 figures have been updated on the same basis.
Contract assets relate to amounts for goods or services provided under customer contracts, where the entitlement to consideration is contingent on something other than the passage of time.
The Group has recognised a contract asset for any work performed where payment is not yet due.
Any amount previously recognised as a contract asset is reclassified to trade receivables at the point at which it is invoiced to the customer, usually in the following financial period.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 139 SECTION 3: OPERATING ASSETS AND WORKING CAPITAL continued 3.5 TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES continued The movement in the allowance for doubtful debts is laid out in the following table: Years ended 31 December 2018 2017 m m At 1 January 28.2 4.0 Receivables written off 15.6 14.2 Additional amounts provided against 33.6 18.7 Acquisition 19.7 Amounts reversed as recovered 0.8 Changes in models risks parameters 1.4 At 31 December 44.0 28.2 The Group does not consider there to be any requirement for further provisions in excess of the provision for doubtful debts of 44.0 million 2017: 28.2 million.
This provision, which principally relates to B2B Energy Supply receivables, has been determined using a lifetime expected credit loss calculation.
Assumptions made regarding the recoverability of balances have been determined with reference to past default experiences in line with our policies and future prospects reflecting our understanding of our customer base.
Specific balances are provided against where default events have occurred.
Balances are only written off if deemed irrecoverable after all credit control procedures have been exhausted or the customer is in administration.
The expected credit loss rates have been reviewed and updated during 2018 in order to reflect current cash collection rates in the B2B Energy Supply business and expectations of future cash collection rates.
The change in rates applied has not had a material impact on the total provision in the current period and is not expected to significantly impact future periods.
However, it has resulted in more balances having a provision applied.
As a result, the value of trade receivables that are past due but are completely unprovided against, in accordance with the assessment described above, has reduced to 1.2 million 2017: 32.2 million.
Credit and counterparty risk are both discussed in further detail in note 7.1.
In the B2B Energy Supply business amounts provided against trade and other receivables increased by 33.6 million in the year, with a net charge in the income statement of 31.4 million, following a deterioration in cash collection rates in the first half of the year.
During the second half of the year, collection processes were reviewed and improved.
We expect this improvement to be indicative of future collection rates.
At the end of the year, provisions of 44.0 million were 15.8 million higher than the end of the prior year.
The following table shows the risk profile of amounts due from customers based on the Groups provision matrix at 31 December 2018.
Trade receivables days past due Balances Up to More than More than More than not yet due 30 days 30 days 60 days 90 days Total Group Expected credit loss rate % 1% 7% 19% 32% 59% 26% Estimated total gross carrying amount at default m 18.4 75.2 11.5 6.8 58.6 170.5 Lifetime expected credit losses m 0.1 5.2 2.2 2.2 34.3 44.0 The expected credit loss rate is a weighted average for the portfolio of trade receivables associated with the B2B Energy Supply business.
The majority of balances not yet due are held in the Power Generation business where the risk of default is considered to be very low.
The analysis above excludes receivables acquired in business combinations see note 5.1.
140 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information 3.6 CONTRACT COSTS The Group incurs costs of obtaining contracts in the B2B Energy Supply businesses.
Accounting policy Management expects that incremental broker fees paid to intermediaries as a result of obtaining electricity and gas contracts are recoverable.
The Group has therefore capitalised them as contract costs and amortises them on a straight line basis over the contract period in line with the recognition of revenue.
The balance is included within prepayments in note 3.5.
This amount includes both current and non-current balances.
Amounts capitalised on the Consolidated balance sheet were 39.0 million at 31 December 2018 2017: 39.3 million.
In 2018 the amount of amortisation was 37.2 2017: 24.4 and there was no impairment loss recognised.
3.7 TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES Trade and other payables represent amounts we owe to our suppliers for trade purchases and ongoing costs, tax authorities and other creditors that are due to be paid in the ordinary course of business.
We make accruals for amounts that will fall due for payment in the future as a result of our activities in the current year e. g. fuel we have received but for which we have not yet been invoiced.
Accounting policy Trade and other payables are measured at amortised cost.
As at 31 December 2017 2018 Restated m m Amounts falling due within one year: Trade payables 110.5 79.5 Fuel accruals 128.1 95.3 Energy supply accruals 309.8 291.9 Other accruals 183.0 136.6 Other payables 187.1 101.5 Contract liabilities 20.0 27.6 938.5 732.4 Energy supply accruals includes 235.5 million 2017: 225.0 million in relation to the Groups obligation to deliver ROCs arising from B2B Energy Supply activities.
The remaining balance principally comprises third party grid charge accruals of 51.7 million 2017: 36.8 million and Feed-in-Tariff accruals of 14.1 million 2017: 25.9 million.
The Group recognises a liability in respect of its unsettled obligations to deliver emissions allowances under the EU Emission Trading Scheme ETS.
Accruals at 31 December 2018 include nil 2017: 30.6 million with respect to the Groups estimated net liability to deliver CO emissions allowances.
Allowances are purchased in the market and are recorded at cost.
2 Other payables includes 87.0 million 2017: Nil due under payment facilities described in note 4.4.
Contract liabilities primarily relate to the advance consideration received from customers for fixed price electricity and gas contracts, for which revenue is recognised based on the stage of completion of the multi-year contract.
This has been shown separately for the first time in 2018 due to the implementation of IFRS 15.
The prior year has been restated to the same format.
The balance reduces as revenue is subsequently recognised in the following period, offset by further advance consideration received.
