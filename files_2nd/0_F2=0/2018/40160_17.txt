Company financial statements continued Company accounting policies a Basis of preparation These separate financial statements are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006.
The Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under Financial Reporting Standard 100 FRS 100 issued by the Financial Reporting Council FRC.
In the year ended 31 December 2018 the Company has adopted Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101 as issued by the FRC and has transitioned from reporting under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB as endorsed by the European Union EU to FRS 101.
Accordingly, these financial statements were prepared in accordance with FRS 101 incorporating the Amendments to FRS 101 issued by the FRC up to March 2018.
This transition to FRS 101 had no impact on measurement or recognition in the financial statements.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL.
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions available under that standard: A cash flow statement and related notes Capital management Effect of IFRSs issued but not effective Related party transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries As equivalent disclosures are given in the consolidated financial statements, we have also applied the disclosure exemptions for share based payments and financial instruments.
Other than in relation to IFRS 9, as discussed below, the principal accounting policies adopted are the same as those given in the consolidated financial statements, together with the Company specific policies set out below, and have been consistently applied to all financial reporting periods presented in these financial statements.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its own income statement in these financial statements.
The auditors remuneration for audit and other services is disclosed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
The Company has no employees.
a i Standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards that have been adopted by the Company IFRS 9 Financial Instruments effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 On 1 January 2018 the company adopted IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Financial assets are classified at initial recognition based on whether their contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest SPPI and the nature of the business model they are managed under.
This has resulted in the Companys equity securities and interests in pooled investment funds being classified as fair value through profit or loss FVTPL and the Companys debt securities, loans to subsidiaries, receivables and other financial assets and cash being measured at amortised cost except where they do not meet the SPPI test and are therefore classified as FVTPL.
Derivative instruments are measured at fair value.
Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method unless they are derivatives or they are designated as FVTPL.
Changes in fair value of all financial instruments classified as FVTPL and derivative instruments are recognised in profit or loss except for derivative instruments that are designated as a hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge.
Interest is credited to profit or loss using the effective interest rate method for financial instruments measured at amortised cost.
An expected credit loss impairment model is applied to financial assets measured at amortised cost.
Impairment losses representing the expected credit loss in the next 12 months are recognised unless there has been a significant increase in credit risk from initial recognition in which case lifetime expected losses are recognised.
Where the terms of a financial liability are modified and the modification does not result in the derecognition of the liability, the liability is adjusted to the net present value of the future cash flows less transaction costs with a modification gain or loss recognised in the income statement.
The Company has elected to continue applying the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39.
Therefore the hedge accounting policy is the same as that given in the consolidated financial statements.
The main impact of adopting IFRS 9 is that the Companys debt securities previously classified as available-for-sale AFS and therefore measured at fair value are now measured at amortised cost.
As permitted by IFRS 9 comparatives have not been restated.
At 31 December 2017 the fair value of AFS securities was 857m with a corresponding AFS financial assets reserve balance of 15m and deferred tax liability of 3m.
On reclassification, the Companys debt securities were recognised at 1 January 2018 at their amortised cost less expected credit losses of 839m.
The available-for-sale financial assets reserve balance and the related deferred tax liability were no longer recognised.
The expected credit losses at 1 January 2018 were less than 1m.
228 Standard Life Aberdeen 2018 FINANCIAL INFORMATION a ii Investment in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures The Company has certain subsidiaries which are investment vehicles such as open-ended investment companies, unit trusts and limited partnerships whose primary function is to generate capital or income growth through holding investments.
This category of subsidiary is held at FVTPL since they are managed on a fair value basis.
Investments in subsidiaries other than those measured at FVTPL, associates other than those measured at FVTPL and joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and subsequently held at cost less any impairment charge.
An impairment charge is recognised when the carrying amount of the investment exceeds its recoverable amount.
Any gain or loss on disposal of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture is recognised in profit for the year.
Distributions received of non-cash assets, including investments in subsidiaries, are recognised at fair value in the balance sheet and as dividends in specie in the income statement.
b Critical accounting estimates and judgement in applying accounting policies The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions and exercise judgements in applying the accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses arising during the year.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The areas where judgements have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are as follows: Financial statement area Critical accounting estimates and assumptions Related notes Investments in subsidiaries Determining the cash-generating unit to be used in Note A relation to the recoverable amount of investments in subsidiaries The areas where assumptions and other sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are as follows: Financial statement area Critical accounting estimates and assumptions Related notes Investments in subsidiaries, associates Determination of the recoverable amount Note A and B and joint ventures held at cost Standard Life Aberdeen 2018 229 9.

c Disposals During 2018, the Company made the following disposals of subsidiaries measured at cost: On 30 August 2018, SLAL repaid a loan from the Company with the principal amount of 500m.
This bond had been classified as an equity investment in SLAL and its repayment reduced the Companys investment in SLAL by 486m.
On 19 April 2018 the Company redeemed 2m of equity capital in Standard Life Mauritius Holdings 2006 Limited through the cancellation of 30,000 Participating shares During 2017, the Company made the following disposals of subsidiaries measured at cost: On 22 November 2017 the Company reduced its investment in Standard Life Mauritius Holdings 2006 Limited through the disposal of 494,589.5 participating shares for a cash consideration of 37m, as a result of a share capital reduction by Standard Life Mauritius Holdings 2006 Limited d Impairment The company holds investments in Aberdeen and Standard Life Investments Holdings Limited SLIH.
As Aberdeen and SLIH are managed and reported together within the Asset management and platforms segment, and the synergies from the merger of these entities are expected to benefit both entities, we judge that it is appropriate to consider the recoverable amount of these entities on a combined basis.
The Company impaired its investments in Aberdeen and SLIH by 570m 2017: nil.
The recoverable amount was 5,508m which was its value in use and was determined using a pre-tax discount rate of 11.1%.
The impairments are as a result of a decrease in projected future revenues of the entities.
Following the impairment loss recognised in the period, the recoverable amount was equal to the carrying amount.
Therefore any adverse movement in a key assumption would lead to further impairment.
The sensitivity of the carrying value of the investments in Aberdeen and SLIH to changes in key assumptions is the same as the sensitivity of Aberdeen Standard Investments goodwill to changes in key assumptions provided in Note 14 of the Group financial statements.
The Companys investment in its subsidiary Focus Solutions Group Limited Focus was impaired during 2018 by 19m 2017: 7m.
