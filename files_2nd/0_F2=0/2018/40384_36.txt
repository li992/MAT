Notes to the Financial Statements continued 12 Related party transactions The Directors consider that, under the classification of related party transactions outlined in the Association of Investment Companies SORP, issued November 2014 and updated in February 2018, Franklin Templeton entities are not classified as related parties under IAS 24 as adopted by the EU.
Accordingly there were no transactions with related parties, other than the fees paid to the Directors during the year ended 31 March 2018, which have a material effect on the results or the financial position of the Company.
13 Risk management In pursuing the Company Objective, set out on page 8 of this Annual Report, the Company holds a number of financial instruments which are exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction of the profits available for dividends.
The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are market risk which comprises market price risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk, other price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing these risks, and the methods used to measure the risk, are set out below.
These policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the year to which these financial statements relate.
Investment and concentration risk The Company may invest a greater portion of its assets than the benchmark in the securities of one issuer, securities domiciled in a particular country, or securities within one industry group than other types of fund investments.
As a result, there is the potential for increased concentration of exposure to economic, business, political or other changes affecting similar issues or securities, which may result in greater fluctuation in the value of the portfolio.
Market price risk Market risk arises mainly from uncertainties about future prices of financial instruments held.
It represents the potential loss that the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
The Directors meet quarterly to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio in order to minimise the risk associated with particular countries or industry sectors whilst continuing to follow the investment objectives.
The Investment Manager has responsibility for monitoring the existing portfolio selected in accordance with the overall asset allocation parameters described above, and seeks to ensure that individual stocks also meet the risk reward profile on an ongoing basis.
The Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge the investment portfolio against market price risk as, in the Investment Managers opinion, the cost of such a process could result in an unacceptable level of cost and or a reduction in the potential for capital growth.

If share prices had decreased by 10% with all other variables remaining constant, the income statement capital return and the netassets attributable to equity shareholders would have decreased by 237,034,635 2017: 216,595,020.
The analysis for last year assumes a share price decrease of 10%.
A 10% increase 10% increase in share prices would have resulted in a proportionate equal and opposite effect on the above amounts, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.
Foreign currency risk Currency translation movements can significantly affect the income and capital value of the Companys investments, as the majority of the Companys assets and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling, which is the Companys functional currency.
The Investment Manager has identified three principal areas where foreign currency risk could affect the Company: Movements in rates affect the value of investments: Movements in rates affect short-term timing differences: and Movements in rates affect the income received.
The Company does not hedge the sterling value of investments that are priced in other currencies.
The Company may be subject to short-term exposure to exchange rate movements, for instance where there is a difference between the date an investment purchase or sale is entered into and the date on which it is settled.
The Company receives income in currencies other than sterling and the sterling values of this income can be affected by movements in exchange rates.
The Company converts all receipts of income into sterling on or near the date of receipt.
However, it does not hedge or otherwise seek to avoid rate movement risk on income accrued but not received.

Interest rate risk The Company is permitted to invest in fixed rate securities.
Any change to the interest rates relevant to particular securities may result in income either increasing or decreasing, or the Investment Manager being unable to secure similar returns on the expiry of contracts or the sale of securities.
In addition, changes to prevailing rates or changes in expectations of future rates may result in an increase or decrease in the value of the securities held and the interest payable on bank loans when interest rates are reset.
co. uk Templeton Emerging Markets Investment Trust PLC 85 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Interest rate risk profile The exposure of the financial assets and liabilities to interest rate risks at 31 March is shown below: Within Within one year one year 2018 2017 000 000 Bank loans 144,690 83,732 Cash 67,843 65,265 Net exposure at year end 76,847 18,467 Exposures vary throughout the year as a consequence of changes in the make-up of the net assets of the Company.
Cash balances are held on call deposit and earn interest at the banks daily rate.
The Companys net assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates on borrowings.
There was no exposure to fixed interest investment securities during the year or at the year end.
Interest rate sensitivity If the above level of cash was maintained for a year, a 1.0% increase or decrease in interest rates would impact the net profit after taxation by the following amounts: 2018 2017 1.0% 1.0% 1.0% 1.0% increase in decrease in increase in decrease in rate rate rate rate 000 000 000 000 Profit loss for the year Revenue 244 244 185 185 Capital 1,013 1,013 Total 769 769 185 185 In the opinion of the Directors, this sensitivity analysis may not be representative of the Companys future exposure to interest rate changes due to fluctuations in the level of cash balances and amounts drawn down on the Companys loan facilities.
Liquidity risk The Companys assets comprise mainly of securities listed on the stock exchanges of emerging economies.
Liquidity can vary from market to market and some securities may take longer to sell.
As a closed ended investment trust, liquidity risks attributable to the Company are less significant than for an open ended fund.
The risk of the Company not having sufficient liquidity at any time is not considered by the Board to be significant, given the large number of quoted investments held in the portfolio and the liquid nature of the portfolio of investments.
The Investment Manager reviews liquidity at the time of making each investment decision and monitors the evolving liquidity profile of the portfolio regularly.

co. uk Notes to the Financial Statements continued Investments held by the Company are valued in accordance with the accounting policies at bid price.
Other financial assets and liabilities of the Company are included in the Balance Sheet at fair value.
Credit risk Certain transactions in securities that the Company enters into expose it to the risk that the counterparty will not deliver the investment purchase or cash in relation to sale or declared dividend after the Company has fulfilled its responsibilities.
The Company only buys and sells through brokers which have been approved by the Investment Manager as an acceptable counterparty.
In addition, limits are set as to the maximum exposure to any individual broker that may exist at any time.
These limits are reviewed regularly.
The amount of credit risk that the Company is exposed to is disclosed under the interest rate risk profile and represents the maximum credit risk at the Balance Sheet date.
The Company has an ongoing contract with its custodian JPMorgan Chase Bank for the provision of custody services.
As part of the annual risk and custody review, the Company reviewed the custody services provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank and concluded that, while there are inherent custody risks in investing in emerging markets, the custody network employed by TEMIT has appropriate controls in place to mitigate those risks, and that these controls are consistent with recommended industry practices and standards.
Securities held in custody are held in the Companys name or to its accounts.
Details of holdings are received and reconciled monthly.
Cash is actively managed by Franklin Templeton s Trading Desk in Edinburgh and is typically invested in overnight time deposits in the name of TEMIT with an approved list of counterparties.
Any excess cash not invested by the Trading Desk will remain in a JPMorgan Chase interest bearing account.
There is no significant risk on debtors and accrued income or tax at the year end.
Fair Value Fair values are derived as follows: Where assets are denominated in a foreign currency, they are converted into the sterling amount using yearend rates of exchange: Non-current financial assets on the basis set out in the accounting policies: and Cash at the face value of the account.
The tables below analyse financial instruments carried at fair value by valuation method.
The different levels have been defined as follows: Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Level 2 I nputs other than quoted prices included with level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly prices or indirectly derived from prices.
Level 3 I nputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
