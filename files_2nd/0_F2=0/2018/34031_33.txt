There is no intention to sell the brands in the foreseeable future and, therefore, it is not anticipated that any of the deferred tax liability in respect of brands will reverse in the 12 months following the balance sheet date.
The deferred tax asset in respect of share schemes represents an estimate of the future tax deduction available on the exercise or vesting of awards under those schemes.
Whilst it is anticipated that an element of the remaining deferred tax assets and liabilities will reverse during the 12 months following the balance sheet date, at present it is not possible to accurately quantify the value of all of these reversals.
In addition to the deferred tax liability shown above, the Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset of 2.0m 2017: 2.0m in respect of capital and other losses amounting to 11.5m 2017: 11.5m because these are not considered recoverable in the foreseeable future.

1 Nature and carrying value of inventories Section The Groups principal activities are housebuilding and commercial development.
The majority of the development activity is not contracted prior to the development commencing.
Accordingly, the Group has in its Balance Sheet at 30 June 2018 current assets that are not covered by a forward sale.
The Groups internal controls are designed to identify any developments where the balance sheet value of land and work in progress is more than 3 theprojected lower of cost or net realisable value.
During the year the Group has conducted six-monthly reviews of the net realisable value of specific sites identified as at high risk of Working capital impairment, based upon a number of criteria including low site profit margins and sites with no forecast completions.
Where the estimated net realisable value of a site was less than its current carrying value within the Balance Sheet, the Group has impaired the land and work inprogress value.
3.1 Inventories During the year, due to performance variations, changes in assumptions and changes to viability on individual sites, there were gross impairment charges of 13.2m 2017: 16.8m andgross impairment reversals of 9.9m 2017: 3.3m, resulting in a net impairment charge of 3.3m 2017: 13.5m included within profit from operations.

Judgements applied in determining the classification of joint arrangements 1 The Group holds two joint venture investments Barratt Wates Horley Limited and Barratt Metropolitan LLP not in equal share, and one Ravenscraig Limited with more than one other party.
However, in each case, the Group has equal voting rights and control over the activities of the companies with the other parties.
In addition, the Group and the other parties to the agreements only have rights to the net assets of these companies through the terms of the contractual arrangements.
These entities are therefore classified as joint ventures.
2 The Groups interests in a number of the entities classified as joint ventures are held indirectly.
Barratt Wates East Grinstead No.
2 Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Groups joint venture, Barratt Wates East Grinstead Limited, and is therefore classified as a joint venture of the Group.
Aldgate Land One Limited and Aldgate Land Two Limited are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Groups joint venture, Aldgate Place GP Limited, and are therefore classified as joint ventures of the Group.
BDWZest Developments LLP, Alie Street LLP, Queensland Road LLP, Fulham Wharf LLP, and Nine Elms LLP, form a group of limited liability partnerships jointly owned directly or indirectly by BDWZest LLP and ZestBDW LLP, both of which are joint ventures of the Group.
Nine Elms One Limited and Nine Elms Two Limited are wholly owned subsidiaries of Nine Elms LLP, and Fulham Wharf One Limited and Fulham Wharf Two Limited are wholly owned subsidiaries of Fulham Wharf LLP.
All of these entities are therefore classified as joint ventures of the Group.

Other than new share capital: arranging debt to meet liability payments: and selling assets to reduce debt.
this, neither the Group nor the Company have a significant concentration of credit risk, as their exposure is spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The Group manages credit risk in the following ways: The Group has a credit policy that is limited to financial institutions with high credit ratings, as set by international credit rating agencies, and has a policy determining the maximum permissible exposure to any single counterparty.
The Group only contracts derivative financial instruments with counterparties with which theGroup has an ISDA Master Agreement in place.
These agreements permit net settlement, thereby reducing the Groups credit exposure to individual counterparties.
The maximum exposure to any counterparty at 30 June 2018 was 152.3m 2017: 140.0m of cash on deposit with a financial institution.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the Financial Statements, net of any allowance for losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
