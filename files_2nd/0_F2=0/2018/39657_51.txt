FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NET DEBT AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE 13 Cash flow and net debt This note analyses our operational cash generation, shows the movement in our net debt in the year, and explains what is included within our cash balances and borrowings at the year end.
Cash generated from operations is the starting point of our consolidated statement of cash flows.
This section outlines the adjustments for any non-cash accounting items to reconcile our accounting profit for the year to the amount of cash we generated from our operations.
Net debt represents the amount of cash held less borrowings, overdrafts, and cash held on behalf of customers.
Borrowings are mostly made up of fixed-term external debt which the Group has taken out in order to finance acquisitions in the past.
