Financial instruments Classification and measurement Accounting policy The Group classifies its financial assets into the following measurement categories: amortised cost: fair value through other comprehensive income: and fair value through profit or loss.
Financial liabilities are classified as either amortised cost, or held at fair value through profit or loss.
Management determines the classification of its financial assets and liabilities at initial recognition of the instrument or, where applicable, at the time of reclassification.
Financial assets held at amortised cost and fair value through other comprehensive income Debt instruments held at amortised cost or held at fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI have contractual terms that give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest SPPI characteristics.
Principal is the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition but this may change over the life of the instrument as amounts are repaid.
Interest consists of consideration for the time value of money, for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period and for other basic lending risks and costs, as well as a profit margin.
In assessing whether the contractual cash flows have SPPI characteristics, the Group considers the contractual terms of the instrument.
This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition.
In making the assessment, the Group considers: Contingent events that would change the amount and timing of cash flows Leverage features Prepayment and extension terms Terms that limit the Groups claim to cash flows from specified assets e. g. non-recourse asset arrangements : and Features that modify consideration of the time value of money e. g. periodical reset of interest rates Whether financial assets are held at amortised cost or at FVOCI depend on the objectives of the business models under which the assets are held.
A business model refers to how the Group manages financial assets to generate cash flows.
The Group makes an assessment of the objective of a business model in which an asset is held at the individual product business line and, where applicable, within business lines depending on the way the business is managed and information is provided to management.
Factors considered include: How the performance of the product business line is evaluated and reported to the Groups management How managers of the business model are compensated, including whether management is compensated based on the fair value of assets or the contractual cash flows collected The risks that affect the performance of the business model and how those risks are managed The frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and expectations about future sales activity The Groups business model assessment is as follows: Business model Business objective Characteristics Businesses Products Hold to collect Intent is to originate financial Providing financing and originating Corporate Lending Loans and advances assets and hold them to assets to earn interest income as Corporate Finance Debt securities maturity, collecting the primary income stream Transaction Banking contractual cash flows over Performing credit risk management Retail Lending the term of the instrument activities Treasury Markets Costs include funding costs, Loans and transaction costs and Borrowings impairment losses Financial Markets selected Hold to collect Business objective met Portfolios held for liquidity needs: or Treasury Markets Derivatives and sell through both hold to where a certain interest yield profile Debt securities collect and by selling is maintained: or that are normally financial assets rebalanced to achieve matching of duration of assets and liabilities Income streams come from interest income, fair value changes, and impairment losses Fair value All other business objectives, Assets held for trading All other business lines Derivatives through profit or including trading and Assets that are originated, Trading portfolios loss managing financial assets purchased, and sold for profit Financial Markets on a fair value basis taking or underwriting activity.

Financial instruments continued Financial assets which have SPPI characteristics and that are held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets to collect contractual cash flows hold to collect are recorded at amortised cost.
Conversely, financial assets which have SPPI characteristics but are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets hold to collect and sell are classified as held at FVOCI.
Both hold to collect business and a hold to collect and sell business model involve holding financial assets to collect the contractual cash flows.
However, the business models are distinct by reference to the frequency and significance that asset sales play in meeting the objective under which a particular group of financial assets is managed.
Hold to collect business models are characterised by asset sales that are incidental to meeting the objectives under which a group of assets is managed.
Sales of assets under a hold to collect business model can be made to manage increases in the credit risk of financial assets but sales for other reasons should be infrequent or insignificant.
Cash flows from the sale of financial assets under a hold to collect and sell business model by contrast are integral to achieving the objectives under which a particular group of financial assets are managed.
This may be the case where frequent sales of financial assets are required to manage the Groups daily liquidity requirements or to meet regulatory requirements to demonstrate liquidity of financial instruments.
Sales of assets under hold to collect and sell business models are therefore both more frequent and more significant in value than those under the hold to collect model.
Equity instruments designated as held at FVOCI Non-trading equity instruments acquired for strategic purposes rather than capital gain may be irrevocably designated at initial recognition as held at FVOCI on an instrument by instrument basis.
Dividends received are recognised in profit or loss.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of these instruments, including foreign exchange gains and losses, are recognised directly in equity and are never reclassified to profit or loss even on derecognition.
Financial assets and liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets which are not held at amortised cost or that are not held at fair value through other comprehensive income are held at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial assets and liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss are either mandatorily classified fair value through profit or loss or irrevocably designated at fair value through profit or loss at initial recognition.
Mandatorily classified at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets and liabilities which are mandatorily held at fair value through profit or loss are split between two subcategories as follows: Trading, including: Financial assets and liabilities held for trading, which are those acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short-term: and Derivatives Non-trading mandatorily at fair value through profit or loss, including: Instruments in a business which has a fair value business model see the Groups business model assessment which are not trading or derivatives: Hybrid financial assets that contain one or more embedded derivatives: Financial assets that would otherwise be measured at amortised cost or FVOCI but which do not have SPPI characteristics: Equity instruments that have not been designated as held at FVOCI: and Financial liabilities that constitute contingent consideration in a business combination.
Designated at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets and liabilities may be designated at fair value through profit or loss when the designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities on a different basis accounting mismatch.
Interest rate swaps have been acquired by the Group with the intention of significantly reducing interest rate risk on certain debt securities with fixed rates of interest.
To significantly reduce the accounting mismatch between assets and liabilities and measurement bases, these debt securities have been designated at fair value through profit or loss.
Similarly, to reduce accounting mismatches, the Group has designated certain financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss where the liabilities either: Have fixed rates of interest and interest rate swaps or other interest rate derivatives have been entered with the intention of significantly reducing interest rate risk: or Are exposed to foreign currency risk and derivatives have been acquired with the intention of significantly reducing exposure to market changes: or Have been acquired to fund trading asset portfolios or assets Financial liabilities may also be designated at fair value through profit or loss where they are managed on a fair value basis or have a embedded derivative where the Group is not able to bifurcate and separately value the embedded derivative component.

Financial instruments continued Financial liabilities held at amortised cost Financial liabilities that are not financial guarantees or loan commitments and that are not classified as financial liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss are classified as financial liabilities held at amortised cost.
Preference shares which carry a mandatory coupon that represents a market rate of interest at the issue date, or which are redeemable on a specific date or at the option of the shareholder, are classified as financial liabilities and are presented in other borrowed funds.
The dividends on these preference shares are recognised in the income statement as interest expense on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method.
Financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments The Group issues financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments in return for fees.
Under a financial guarantee contract, the Group undertakes to meet a customers obligations under the terms of a debt instrument if the customer fails to do so.
Loan commitments are firm commitments to provide credit under prespecified terms and conditions.
Financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments issued at below market interest rates are initially recognised as liabilities at fair value, while financial guarantees and loan commitments issued at market rates are recorded off-balance sheet.
Subsequently, these instruments are measured at the higher of the expected credit loss provision, and the amount initially recognised less the cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the principles of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
Refer to Note 8 page 255 for expected credit loss on loan commitments and financial guarantees.
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal market for the asset or liability, or in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market to which the Group has access at the date.
The fair value of a liability includes the risk that the bank will not be able to honour its obligations.
The fair value of financial instruments is generally measured on the basis of the individual financial instrument.
However, when a group of financial assets and financial liabilities is managed on the basis of its net exposure to either market risk or credit risk, the fair value of the group of financial instruments is measured on a net basis.
The fair values of quoted financial assets and liabilities in active markets are based on current prices.
A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
If the market for a financial instrument, and for unlisted securities, is not active, the Group establishes fair value by using valuation techniques.
Initial recognition Purchases and sales of financial assets and liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss, and debt securities classified as financial assets held at fair value through other comprehensive income, are initially recognised on the trade-date the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Loans and advances and other financial assets held at amortised cost are recognised on the settlement date the date on which cash is advanced to the borrowers.
All financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value, which is normally the transaction price, plus directly attributable transaction costs for financial assets which are not subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss.
In certain circumstances, the initial fair value may be based on a valuation technique which may lead to the recognition of profits or losses at the time of initial recognition.
However, these profits or losses can only be recognised when the valuation technique used is based solely on observable market data.
In those cases where the initially recognised fair value is based on a valuation model that uses unobservable inputs, the difference between the transaction price and the valuation model is not recognised immediately in the income statement but is amortised or released to the income statement as the inputs become observable, or the transaction matures or is terminated.
Subsequent measurement Financial assets and financial liabilities held at amortised cost Financial assets and financial liabilities held at amortised cost are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method see Interest income and expense.
Foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in the income statement.
Where a financial instrument carried at amortised cost is the hedged item in a qualifying fair value hedge relationship, its carrying value is adjusted by the fair value gain or loss attributable to the hedged risk.
Financial assets held at FVOCI Debt instruments held at FVOCI are subsequently carried at fair value, with all unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in fair value including any related foreign exchange gains or losses recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity.
Foreign exchange gains and losses on the amortised cost are recognised in income.
Changes in expected credit losses are recognised in the profit or loss and are accumulated in equity.
On derecognition, the cumulative fair value gains or losses, net of the cumulative expected credit loss reserve, are transferred to the profit or loss.
Equity investments designated at FVOCI are subsequently carried at fair value with all unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in fair value including any related foreign exchange gains or losses recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity.
On derecognition, the cumulative reserve is transferred to retained earnings and is not recycled to profit or loss.
Financial assets and liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets and liabilities mandatorily held at fair value through profit or loss and financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value, with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recorded in the net trading income line in the profit or loss unless the instrument is part of a cash flow hedging relationship.
Contractual interest income on financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss is recognised as interest income in a separate line in the profit or loss.
267 notes to the Financial statements financial statements 13.
Financial instruments continued Financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss Financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss are held at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in the net trading income line in the profit or loss, other than that attributable to changes in credit risk.
Fair value changes attributable to credit risk are recognised in other comprehensive income and recorded in a separate category of reserves unless this is expected to create or enlarge an accounting mismatch, in which case the entire change in fair value of the financial liability designated at fair value through profit or loss is recognised in profit or loss.
Derecognition of financial instruments Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or where the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
If substantially all the risks and rewards have been neither retained nor transferred and the Group has retained control, the assets continue to be recognised to the extent of the Groups continuing involvement.
Where financial assets have been modified, the modified terms are assessed on a qualitative and quantitative basis to determine whether a fundamental change in the nature of the instrument has occurred, such as whether the derecognition of the pre-existing instrument and the recognition of a new instrument is appropriate.
On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognised and the sum of the consideration received including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed and any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in profit or loss except for equity instruments elected FVOCI see above and cumulative fair value adjustments attributable to the credit risk of a liability that are held in other comprehensive income.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when they are extinguished.
A financial liability is extinguished when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires and this is evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively.
However, where a financial liability has been modified, it is derecognised if the difference between the modified cash flows and the original cash flows is more than 10 per cent.
If the Group purchases its own debt, it is derecognised and the difference between the carrying amount of the liability and the consideration paid is included in Other income except for the cumulative fair value adjustments attributable to the credit risk of a liability that are held in other comprehensive income which are never recycled to the profit or loss.
Modified financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities whose original contractual terms have been modified, including those loans subject to forbearance strategies, are considered to be modified instruments.
Modifications may include changes to the tenor, cash flows and or interest rates among other factors.
Where derecognition of financial assets is appropriate see Derecognition, the newly recognised residual loans are assessed to determine whether the assets should be classified as purchased or originated credit-impaired assets POCI.
Where derecognition is not appropriate, the gross carrying amount of the applicable instruments is recalculated as the present value of the renegotiated or modified contractual cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate or credit adjusted effective interest rate for POCI financial assets.
The difference between the recalculated values and the pre-modified gross carrying values of the instruments are recorded as a modification gain or loss in the profit or loss.
Gains and losses arising from modifications for credit reasons are recorded as part of Credit impairment see credit Impairment policy.
Modification gains and losses arising for non-credit reasons are recognised either as part of Credit impairment or within income depending on whether there has been a change in the credit risk on the financial asset subsequent to the modification.
Modification gains and losses arising on financial liabilities are recognised within income.
The movements in the applicable expected credit loss loan positions are disclosed in further detail in Risk review.
Reclassifications Financial liabilities are not reclassified subsequent to initial recognition.
Reclassifications of financial assets are made when, and only when, the business model for those assets changes.
Such changes are expected to be infrequent and arise as a result of significant external or internal changes such as the termination of a line of business or the purchase of a subsidiary whose business model is to realise the value of pre-existing held for trading financial assets through a hold to collect model.
Financial assets are reclassified at their fair value on the date of reclassification and previously recognised gains and losses are not restated.
Moreover, reclassifications of financial assets between financial assets held at amortised cost and financial assets held at fair value through other comprehensive income do not affect effective interest rate or expected credit loss computations.
Reclassified from amortised cost Where financial assets held at amortised cost are reclassified to financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss, the difference between the fair value of the assets at the date of reclassification and the previously recognised amortised cost is recognised in profit or loss.
For financial assets held at amortised cost that are reclassified to fair value through other comprehensive income, the difference between the fair value of the assets at the date of reclassification and the previously recognised gross carrying value is recognised in other comprehensive income.
Additionally, the related cumulative expected credit loss amounts relating to the reclassified financial assets are reclassified from loan loss provisions to a separate reserve in other comprehensive income at the date of reclassification.
Standard Chartered 268 Annual Report 2018 Strategic report Directors report Risk review and capital review Financial statements Supplementary information 13.
Financial instruments continued Reclassified from fair value through other comprehensive income Where financial assets held at fair value through other comprehensive income are reclassified to financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to the profit or loss.
For financial assets held at fair value through other comprehensive income that are reclassified to financial assets held at amortised cost, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is adjusted against the fair value of the financial asset such that the financial asset is recorded at a value as if it had always been held at amortised cost.
In addition, the related cumulative expected credit losses held within other comprehensive income are reversed against the gross carrying value of the reclassified assets at the date of reclassification.
Reclassified from fair value through profit or loss Where financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss are reclassified to financial assets held at fair value through other comprehensive income or financial assets held at amortised cost, the fair value at the date of reclassification is used to determine the effective interest rate on the financial asset going forward.
In addition, the date of reclassification is used as the date of initial recognition for the calculation of expected credit losses.
Where financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss are reclassified to financial assets held at amortised cost, the fair value at the date of reclassification becomes the gross carrying value of the financial asset.
The Groups classification of its financial assets and liabilities is summarised in the following tables.

In practice, for credit mitigation, the Group is able to offset assets and liabilities which do not meet the IAS 32 netting criteria set out above.
Such arrangements include master netting arrangements for derivatives and global master repurchase agreements for repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions.
These agreements generally allow that all outstanding transactions with a particular counterparty can be offset but only in the event of default or other predetermined events.
In addition, the Group also receives and pledges readily realisable collateral for derivative transactions to cover net exposure in the event of a default.
Under repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements the Group pledges legally sells and obtains legally purchases respectively, highly liquid assets which can be sold in the event of a default.

Further details of the Groups own credit adjustment OCA valuation technique is described later in this Note.
Valuation of financial instruments Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal market or, in the absence of this, the most advantageous market to which the Group has access at that date.
The fair value of a liability reflects the Groups non-performance risk.
However, when a group of financial assets and financial liabilities is managed on the basis of its net exposure to either market risks or credit risk, the fair value of the group of financial instruments is measured on a net basis.
Wherever possible, fair values have been calculated using unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical instruments held by the Group.
Where quoted market prices are not available, or are unreliable because of poor liquidity, fair values have been determined using valuation techniques which, to the extent possible, use market observable inputs, but in some cases use non-market observable inputs.
Valuation techniques used include discounted cash flow analysis and pricing models and, where appropriate, comparison with instruments that have characteristics similar to those of the instruments held by the Group.

Financial instruments continued Valuation of financial instruments continued The Valuation Control function is responsible for independent price verification, oversight of fair value and prudent value adjustments and escalation of valuation issues.
Independent price verification is the process of determining that the valuations incorporated into the financial statements are validated independent of the business area responsible for the product.
The Valuation Control function has oversight of the fair value adjustments to ensure the financial instruments are priced to exit.
These are key controls in ensuring the material accuracy of the valuations incorporated in the financial statements.
The market data used for price verification may include data sourced from recent trade data involving external counterparties or third parties such as Bloomberg, Reuters, brokers and consensus pricing providers.
Valuation Control performs a semi-annual review of the suitability of the market data used for price testing.
Price verification uses independently sourced data that is deemed most representative of the market the instruments trade in.
To determine the quality of the market data inputs, factors such as independence, relevance, reliability, availability of multiple data sources and methodology employed by the pricing provider are taken into consideration.
The Valuation and Benchmarks Committee VBC is the valuation governance forum consisting of representatives from Group Market Risk, Product Control, Valuation Control and the business, which meets monthly to discuss and approve the independent valuations of the inventory.
For Principal Finance, the Investment Committee meeting is held on a quarterly basis to review investments and valuations.
Significant accounting estimates and judgements The Group evaluates the significance of financial instruments and material accuracy of the valuations incorporated in the financial statements as they involve a high degree of judgement and estimation uncertainty in determining the carrying values of financial assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date.
Fair value of financial instruments are determined using valuation techniques and estimates see below which, to the extent possible, use market observable inputs, but in some cases use non-market observable inputs.
Changes in the observability of significant valuation inputs can materially affect the fair values of financial instruments When establishing the exit price of a financial instrument using a valuation technique, the Group estimates valuation adjustments in determining the fair value page 276 In determining the valuation of financial instruments, the Group makes judgements on the amounts reserved to cater for model and valuation risks, which cover both Level 2 and Level 3 assets, and the significant valuation judgements in respect of Level 3 instruments page 277 Where the estimate measurement of fair value is more judgemental in respect of Level 3 assets, these are valued based on models that use a significant degree of non-market-based unobservable inputs Valuation techniques Refer to the fair value hierarchy explanation Level 1, 2 and 3 page 277 Financial instruments held at fair value Debt securities asset-backed securities: Asset-backed securities are valued based on external prices obtained from consensus pricing providers, broker quotes, recent trades, arrangers quotes, etc.
Where an observable price is available for a given security, it is classified as Level 2.
In instances where third-party prices are not available or reliable, the security is classified as Level 3.
The fair value of Level 3 securities is estimated using market standard cash flow models with input parameter assumptions which include prepayment speeds, default rates, discount margins derived from comparable securities with similar vintage, collateral type, and credit ratings.
Therefore, once external pricing has been verified, an assessment is made of whether each security is traded with significant liquidity based on its credit rating and sector.
If a security is of high credit rating and is traded in a liquid sector, it will be classified as Level 2, otherwise it will be classified as Level 3 Debt securities in issue: These debt securities relate to structured notes issued by the Group.
Where independent market data is available through pricing vendors and broker sources these positions are classified as Level 2.
Where such liquid external prices are not available, valuations of these debt securities are implied using input parameters such as bond spreads and credit spreads, and are classified as Level 3.
These input parameters are determined with reference to the same issuer if available or proxies from comparable issuers or assets Derivatives: Derivative products are classified as Level 2 if the valuation of the product is based upon input parameters which are observable from independent and reliable market data sources.
Derivative products are classified as Level 3 if there are significant valuation input parameters which are unobservable in the market, such as products where the performance is linked to more than one underlying variable.
Examples are foreign exchange basket options, equity options based on the performance of two or more underlying indices and interest rate products with quanto payouts.
In most cases these unobservable correlation parameters cannot be implied from the market, and methods such as historical analysis and comparison with historical levels or other benchmark data must be employed Equity shares private equity: The majority of private equity unlisted investments are valued based on earning multiples Price-toEarnings P E or enterprise value to earnings before income tax, depreciation and amortisation EV EBITDA ratios of comparable listed companies.
The two primary inputs for the valuation of these investments are the actual or forecast earnings of the investee companies and earning multiples for the comparable listed companies.
To ensure comparability between these unquoted investments and the comparable listed companies, appropriate adjustments are also applied for example, liquidity and size in the valuation.
In circumstances where an investment does not have direct comparables or where the multiples for the comparable companies cannot be sourced from reliable external sources, alternative valuation techniques for example, discounted cash flow models, which use predominantly unobservable inputs or Level 3 inputs, may be applied.
Even though earning multiples for the comparable listed companies can be sourced from third-party sources for example, Bloomberg, and those inputs can be deemed Level 2 inputs, all unlisted investments excluding those where observable inputs are available, for example, over-the-counter OTC prices are classified as Level 3 on the basis that the valuation methods involve judgements ranging from determining comparable companies to discount rates where the discounted cash flow method is applied 275 notes to the Financial statements financial statements 13.
Financial instruments continued Valuation techniques continued Loans and advances: These primarily include loans in the global syndications business which were not syndicated as of the balance sheet date and other financing transactions within Financial Markets and loans and advances including reverse repurchase agreements that do not have SPPI cash flows or are managed on a fair value basis.
These loans are generally bilateral in nature and, where available, their valuation is based on market observable credit spreads.
If observable credit spreads are not available, proxy spreads based on comparable loans with similar credit grade, sector and region, are used.
Where observable credit spreads and market standard proxy methods are available, these loans are classified as Level 2.
Where there are no recent transactions or comparable loans, these loans are classified as Level 3 Other debt securities: These debt securities include convertible bonds, corporate bonds, credit and structured notes.
Where quoted prices are available through pricing vendors, brokers or observable trading activities from liquid markets, these are classified as Level 2 and valued using such quotes.
Where there are significant valuation inputs which are unobservable in the market, due to illiquid trading or the complexity of the product, these are classified as Level 3.
The valuations of these debt securities are implied using input parameters such as bond spreads and credit spreads.
These input parameters are determined with reference to the same issuer if available or proxied from comparable issuers or assets Financial instruments held at amortised cost The following sets out the Groups basis for establishing fair values of amortised cost financial instruments and their classification between Levels 1, 2 and 3.
As certain categories of financial instruments are not actively traded, there is a significant level of management judgement involved in calculating the fair values: Cash and balances at central banks: The fair value of cash and balances at central banks is their carrying amounts Debt securities in issue, subordinated liabilities and other borrowed funds: The aggregate fair values are calculated based on quoted market prices.
For those notes where quoted market prices are not available, a discounted cash flow model is used based on a current market related yield curve appropriate for the remaining term to maturity Deposits and borrowings: The estimated fair value of deposits with no stated maturity is the amount repayable on demand.
The estimated fair value of fixed interest-bearing deposits and other borrowings without quoted market prices is based on discounted cash flows using the prevailing market rates for debts with a similar credit risk and remaining maturity Investment securities: For investment securities that do not have directly observable market values, the Group utilises a number of valuation techniques to determine fair value.
Where available, securities are valued using input proxies from the same or closely related underlying for example, bond spreads from the same or closely related issuer or input proxies from a different underlying for example, a similar bond but using spreads for a particular sector and rating.
Certain instruments cannot be proxies as set out above, and in such cases the positions are valued using non-market observable inputs.
This includes those instruments held at amortised cost and predominantly relates to asset-backed securities.
The fair value for such instruments is usually proxies from internal assessments of the underlying cash flows Loans and advances to banks and customers: For loans and advances to banks, the fair value of floating rate placements and overnight deposits is their carrying amount.
The estimated fair value of fixed interest-bearing deposits is based on discounted cash flows using the prevailing money market rates for debts with a similar credit risk and remaining maturity.
The Groups loans and advances to customers portfolio is well diversified by geography and industry.
Approximately a quarter of the portfolio reprices within one month, and approximately half re-prices within 12 months.
Loans and advances are presented net of provisions for impairment.
The fair value of loans and advances to customers with a residual maturity of less than one year generally approximates the carrying value.
The estimated fair value of loans and advances with a residual maturity of more than one year represents the discounted amount of future cash flows expected to be received, including assumptions relating to prepayment rates and credit risk.
Expected cash flows are discounted at current market rates to determine fair value.
The Group has a wide range of individual instruments within its loans and advances portfolio and as a result providing quantification of the key assumptions used to value such instruments is impractical Other assets: Other assets comprise primarily of cash collateral and trades pending settlement.
The carrying amount of these financial instruments is considered to be a reasonable approximation of fair value as they are either short-term in nature or reprice to current market rates frequently Fair value adjustments When establishing the exit price of a financial instrument using a valuation technique, the Group considers adjustments to the modelled price which market participants would make when pricing that instrument.
The main valuation adjustments described further below in determining fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are as follows: 31.12.18 31.12.17 $million $million Bid-offer valuation adjustment 67 82 CVA 196 229 DVA 143 66 Model valuation adjustment 6 6 FVA 60 79 Others including day one 159 148 Total 345 478 Standard Chartered 276 Annual Report 2018 Strategic report Directors report Risk review and capital review Financial statements Supplementary information 13.
Financial instruments continued Fair value adjustments continued Bid-offer valuation adjustment: Where market parameters are marked on a mid-market basis in the revaluation systems, a bid-offer valuation adjustment is required to quantify the expected cost of neutralising the business positions through dealing away in the market, thereby bringing long positions to bid and short positions to offer.
The methodology to calculate the bid-offer adjustment for a derivative portfolio involves netting between long and short positions and the grouping of risk by strike and tenor based on the hedging strategy where long positions are marked to bid and short positions marked to offer in the systems Credit valuation adjustment CVA : The Group makes CVA adjustment against the fair value of derivative products.
CVA is an adjustment to the fair value of the transactions to reflect the possibility that our counterparties may default and we may not receive the full market value of the outstanding transactions.
It represents an estimate of the adjustment a market participant would include when deriving a purchase price to acquire our exposures.
CVA is calculated for each subsidiary, and within each entity for each counterparty to which the entity has exposure and takes account of any collateral we may hold.
The Group calculates the CVA by using estimates of future positive exposure, marketimplied probability of default PD and recovery rates.
Where market-implied data is not readily available, we use market-based proxies to estimate the PD.
Wrong-way risk occurs when the exposure to a counterparty is adversely correlated with the credit quality of that counterparty, and the Group has implemented a model to capture this impact for certain key wrong-way exposures.
The Group also captures the uncertainties associated with wrong-way risk in its Prudential Valuation Adjustments Day one profit and loss: In certain circumstances the initial fair value may be based on a valuation technique which may lead to the recognition of profits or losses at the time of initial recognition.
However, these profits or losses can only be recognised when the valuation technique used is based primarily on observable market data.
In those cases where the initially recognised fair value is based on a valuation model that uses inputs which are not observable in the market, the difference between the transaction price and the valuation model is not recognised immediately in the income statement.
The difference is amortised to the income statement until the inputs become observable, or the transaction matures or is terminated Debit valuation adjustment DVA : The Group calculates DVA adjustments on its derivative liabilities to reflect changes in its own credit standing.
The Groups DVA adjustments will increase if its credit standing worsens and conversely, decrease if its credit standing improves.
For derivative liabilities, a DVA adjustment is determined by applying the Groups probability of default to the Groups negative expected exposure against the counterparty.
The Groups probability of default and loss expected in the event of default is derived based on bond spreads associated with the Groups issuances and market standard recovery levels.
The expected exposure is modelled based on the simulation of the underlying risk factors over the life of the deal booked against the particular counterparty.
This simulation methodology incorporates the collateral posted by the Group and the effects of master netting agreements Funding valuation adjustment FVA : The Group makes FVA adjustments against derivative products.
FVA reflects an estimate of the adjustment to its fair value that a market participant would make to incorporate funding costs that could arise in relation to the exposure.
FVA is calculated by determining the net expected exposure at a counterparty level and then applying a funding rate to those exposures that reflect the market cost of funding.
The FVA for collateralised derivatives is based on discounting the expected future cash flows at the relevant overnight indexed swap OIS rate after taking into consideration the terms of the underlying collateral agreement with the counterparty.
The FVA for uncollateralised including partially collateralised derivatives incorporates the estimated present value of the market funding cost or benefit associated with funding these transactions Model valuation adjustment: Valuation models may have pricing deficiencies or limitations that require a valuation adjustment.
These pricing deficiencies or limitations arise due to the choice, implementation and calibration of the pricing model In addition, the Group calculates own credit adjustment OCA on its issued debt designated at fair value, including structured notes, in order to reflect changes in its own credit standing.
The Groups OCA adjustments will increase if its credit standing worsens and conversely, decrease if its credit standing improves.
The Groups OCA adjustments will reverse over time as its liabilities mature.
For issued debt and structured notes designated at fair value, an OCA adjustment is determined by discounting the contractual cash flows using a yield curve adjusted for market observed secondary senior unsecured credit spreads.
The OCA at 31 December 2018 is $476 million, other comprehensive income gain $394 million 31 December 2017: $82 million, other comprehensive income loss $249 million.
Fair value hierarchy financial instruments held at fair value Assets and liabilities carried at fair value or for which fair values are disclosed have been classified into three levels according to the observability of the significant inputs used to determine the fair values.
Changes in the observability of significant valuation inputs during the reporting period may result in a transfer of assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy.
The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy when there is a significant change in either its principal market or the level of observability of the inputs to the valuation techniques as at the end of the reporting period.
Level 1: Fair value measurements are those derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: Fair value measurements are those with quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets and financial instruments valued using models where all significant inputs are observable Level 3: Fair value measurements are those where at least one input which could have a significant effect on the instruments valuation is not based on observable market data 277 notes to the Financial statements financial statements 13.

The ranges of values used are reflective of the underlying characteristics of these Level 3 financial instruments based on the market conditions at the balance sheet date.
However, these ranges of values may not represent the uncertainty in fair value measurements of the Groups Level 3 financial instruments 2 Weighted average for non-derivative financial instruments has been calculated by weighting inputs by the relative fair value.
Weighted average for derivatives has been provided by weighting inputs by the risk relevant to that variable.
N A has been entered for the cases where weighted average is not a meaningful indicator 3 The Group has an equity investment in the Series B preferred shares of Ripple Labs, Inc. which owns a digital currency XRP and is being carried at a fair value based on the shares initial offering price.
The shares will continue to be valued at the initial offering price until such time as a reliable means of valuing the cash flows and underlying assets is possible or additional sales are observable 283 notes to the Financial statements financial statements 13.
Financial instruments continued Level 3 summary and significant unobservable inputs continued The following section describes the significant unobservable inputs identified in the valuation technique table: Commodities correlation: This refers to the correlation between two commodity underlyings over a specified time Comparable price yield is a valuation methodology in which the price of a comparable instrument is used to estimate the fair value where there are no direct observable prices.
Yield is the interest rate that is used to discount the future cash flows in a discounted cash flow model.
Valuation using comparable instruments can be done by calculating an implied yield or spread over a liquid benchmark from the price of a comparable instrument, then adjusting that yield or spread to derive a value for the instrument.
The adjustment should account for relevant differences in the financial instruments such as maturity and or credit quality.
Alternatively, a price-to-price basis can be assumed between the comparable instrument and the instrument being valued in order to establish the value of the instrument for example, deriving a fair value for a junior unsecured bond from the price of a senior secured bond.
An increase in price, in isolation, would result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the asset.
An increase in yield, in isolation, would result in an unfavourable movement in the fair value of the asset Correlation is the measure of how movement in one variable influences the movement in another variable.
An equity correlation is the correlation between two equity instruments while an interest rate correlation refers to the correlation between two swap rates Credit spread represents the additional yield that a market participant would demand for taking exposure to the credit risk of an instrument Discount rate refers to the rate of return used to convert expected cash flows into present value EV EBITDA ratio multiples: This is the ratio of Enterprise Value EV to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortisation EBITDA.
EV is the aggregate market capitalisation and debt minus the cash and cash equivalents.
An increase in EV EBITDA multiples in isolation, will result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the unlisted firm Interest rate curves is the term structure of interest rates and measure of future interest rates at a particular point in time Liquidity discounts in the valuation of unlisted investments: A liquidity discount is primarily applied to the valuation of unlisted firms investments to reflect the fact that these stocks are not actively traded.
An increase in liquidity discount will result in unfavourable movement in the fair value of the unlisted firm Price-Book P B multiple: This is the ratio of the market value of equity to the book value of equity.
An increase in P B multiple will result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the unlisted firm Price-Earnings P E multiples: This is the ratio of the market capitalisation to the net income after tax.
The multiples are determined from multiples of listed comparables, which are observable.
An increase in P E multiple will result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the unlisted firm Price-Sales P S multiple: This is the ratio of the market value of equity to sales.
An increase in P S multiple will result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the unlisted firm Recovery rates are the expectation of the rate of return resulting from the liquidation of a particular loan.
As the probability of default increases for a given instrument, the valuation of that instrument will increasingly reflect its expected recovery level assuming default.
An increase in the recovery rate, in isolation, would result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the loan Volatility represents an estimate of how much a particular instrument, parameter or index will change in value over time.
Generally, the higher the volatility, the more expensive the option will be Standard Chartered 284 Annual Report 2018 Strategic report Directors report Risk review and capital review Financial statements Supplementary information 13.

The Group applies a 10 per cent increase or decrease on the values of these unobservable inputs, to generate a range of reasonably possible alternative valuations.
The percentage shift is determined by statistical analyses performed on a set of reference prices based on the composition of our Level 3 assets.
Favourable and unfavourable changes are determined on the basis of changes in the value of the instrument as a result of varying the levels of the unobservable parameters.
This Level 3 sensitivity analysis assumes a one-way market move and does not consider offsets for hedges.
