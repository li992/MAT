AVEVA Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 98 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Corporate information AVEVA Group plc is a public limited Company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The address of the registered office is given on the inside back cover.
AVEVA Group plcs shares are publicly traded on the Official List of the London Stock Exchange.
2 Key accounting policies Explained below are the key accounting policies of the Group.
The full Statement of Group Accounting Policies is included on pages 135 to 139. a Basis of preparation The accounting policies which follow, set out those policies which apply in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2018.
The Consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand 000 except when otherwise indicated.
The Consolidated financial statements of AVEVA Group plc and all its subsidiaries the Group have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, as adopted by the European Union, as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 March 2018.
The Groups financial statements are also consistent with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.
In accordance with IFRS 3, these financial statements have been prepared as a reverse acquisition of AVEVA Group by the Schneider Electric software business.
Therefore, although these consolidated financial statements have been issued in the name of AVEVA Group plc, the legal acquirer, the Groups activity is in substance, the continuation of the financial information of the Schneider Electric Software Business, to which the comparative financial information presented relates.
For the year ended 31 March 2018, the consolidated financial statements comprise the results of the Schneider Electric software business for the full year, and the results of the AVEVA Group from 1 March 2018, the date of the reverse acquisition hereafter referred to as the Combination.
The Schneider Electric software business previously prepared standalone combined financial information for the years ended 31 March 2017, 2016 and 2015, which were included in the prospectus dated 5 September 2017.
The Schneider Electric software business did not in the past form a legal group.
As a result, the combined financial information was prepared by aggregating financial information that was prepared for the purposes of consolidation of the Schneider Electric software business.
The financial information included as comparatives within these consolidated financial statements does not constitute statutory accounts, but has been prepared under IFRS and in line with the group accounting policies disclosed.
Schneider Electric software business entities are a combination of software legal entities in certain countries and the software portion of other legal entities that also include non-software related businesses.
The software portion of these legal entities has been carvedout and included in this combined financial information as described in this basis of preparation.
Assets and liabilities have been measured at the carrying amount at which they would be included in each of the combined entities separate financial statements whether resulting from a carve-out from a larger legal entity or incorporated in a separate legal entity as a subsidiary, based on Schneider Electric Group's date of transition to IFRS as endorsed by the EU on 1 April, 2004.
Assets and liabilities of software operations carved-out from legal entities with other non-software operations have been initially recorded through group funding expressed as amounts receivable from payable to related parties at their carrying value in the separate financial statements of the legal entity to which these assets and liabilities belong to as described above.
Subsequently, the cash generated or consumed by such carved-out entities has been reflected as a debit or credit to group funding and has been reflected accordingly in the cash flow statement in the line change in funding with related parties.
Last, at the time of the legal reorganisation of each of these carved-out operations into a separate dedicated legal entity subsidiary, group funding has been recorded as equity or current account with a related party the Schneider Electric Group.
Some of the operations of Schneider Electric software business reflected in the combined financial information have not existed as separate legal entities for the entire financial years for which information is presented.
The revenues and costs of these operations have been carved-out from the legal entities in which these operations are included using historical information relating to Schneider Electric software business transactions included in the accounting information systems and management reporting of the Schneider Electric Group.
Direct and indirect costs reflected in the combined financial statements include costs that were charged to the Schneider Electric software business by Schneider Electric Group related to the operations of the Schneider Electric software business.
Indirect costs relate to certain support functions that, prior to completion of the combination, were provided on a centralised basis within Schneider Electric Group and Schneider Electric Group shared service centre locations.
For all carved-out operations, other indirect costs incurred have been allocated using reasonable and consistent conventions based on the type of costs involved to provide the fairest approximation of the cost of services received based on amounts actually attributable to the carved-out Schneider Electric software business operations.
Current income tax, other than taxes owed to a tax jurisdiction i. e. for combined entities that are not a separate tax group of their own but are included or consolidated in a larger tax entity, was deemed to have been settled by or to Schneider Electric and recorded against group funding when income tax profits deficits continue to belong to the combined entity under applicable tax law or contract with their tax parent, in the year the related income tax was recorded.
The current income tax charge and position included in the combined financial information may not be indicative of the financial position, results and cash flow that would have been presented if the Schneider Electric Industrial Software Business had been a standalone entity.
Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements 99 b Restatements and reclassifications From 1 April 2017, certain income statement and balance sheet lines have been reclassified, and the financial statements of the year ended 31 March 2017 have been restated accordingly.
Previously, the centralised functions of real estate and facilities were allocated by function between cost of sales, Research & Development costs and selling and administrative expenses.
In order to align classifications with the heritage AVEVA Group, the presentation has been updated to present the costs of these centralised functions within selling and distribution expenses in full.
Comparatives have been restated accordingly, resulting in an increase of 8,607,000 to selling and distribution expenses and a corresponding decrease of 5,164,000 to cost of sales and 3,443,000 to Research & Development costs in the year ended 31 March 2017.
There has been no impact on profit from operations.
Amortisation previously disclosed separately in the income statement has been allocated to the respective function.
Amortisation in relation to purchased software rights and developed technology is recognised within Research & Development costs, and amortisation in relation to customer relationships and purchased brands and trademarks within selling and administrative expenses.
Comparatives have been restated accordingly, resulting in an increase of 20,204,000 to Research & Development costs and 14,159,000 to selling and distribution expenses.
In addition, 8,417,000 of amortisation previously recognised within cost of sales has been reclassified resulting in an increase to Research & Development of 7,301,000 and administrative expenses of 1,116,000.
Amounts previously disclosed as other income related to share-based payments, restructuring and integration.
These have been reclassified resulting in an increase of 3,412,000 to selling and administrative expenses, 1,625,000 to Research & Development costs, and 291,000 to cost of sales.
Amounts related to income tax payable were previously recognised within trade and other payables.
The balance of 15,391,000 has been reclassified to current tax liabilities.
A balance of 42,145,000 has been reclassified from trade and other payables to deferred revenue.
The classification of revenue as presented in Note 3 has been revised to present revenue within the categories of support and maintenance, including annual fees: rental and subscriptions: initial fees and perpetual licences: and training and services.
Revenue has been reclassified accordingly.
A prior year restatement has been made resulting in a decrease to both inventories and deferred revenue of 8,115,000.
This is as a result of an error identified in the previously reported financial statements.
Sales of goods and services to related parties in the year ended 31 March 2017 were previously reported as 40,332,000.
During the financial year ended 31 March 2018, commercial agreements were signed between the Schneider Electric software business and the Schneider Electric Group to deliver software services relating to comingled contracts and delayed businesses, making this revenue related party in nature.
To ensure consistency, sales of goods and services to related parties in the year ended 31 March 2017 has been restated to 59,788,000, to also include 19,456,000 of sales relating to comingled contracts and delayed business.
Amortisation of capitalised R&D has now been included within normalised adjustments, such that adjusted profit before tax is stated before this amortisation expense 2018 7,277,000, 2017 8,656,000.
The Directors believe that the revised presentations most appropriately and consistently reflect the nature of the enlarged Groups operations.
c Non-GAAP measures The Group presents a non-GAAP performance measure on the face of the Consolidated income statement.
The Directors believe that the adjusted profit before tax and adjusted diluted and basic earnings per share measures presented provide a reliable and consistent presentation of the underlying performance of the Group.
Adjusted profit is not defined by IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable with the adjusted profit measures of other companies.
The business is managed and measured on a day to day basis using adjusted results.
To arrive at adjusted results, certain adjustments are made for normalised and exceptional items that are individually important and which could, if included, distort the understanding of the performance for the year and the comparability between periods.
Normalised items These are recurring items which management considers to have a distorting effect on the underlying results of the Group, and are non-cash items.
These items relate to amortisation of intangibles excluding other software, share-based payment charges and fair value adjustments on financial derivatives, although other types of recurring items may arise.
Recurring items are adjusted each year irrespective of materiality to ensure consistent treatment.
Exceptional items These are items which are non-recurring and are identified by virtue of either their size or their nature.
These items can include, but are not restricted to, the costs of significant restructuring exercises, fees associated with business combinations and costs incurred in integrating acquired companies.
The parent company financial statements of AVEVA Group plc are included on pages 129 to 134.
AVEVA Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 100 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Key accounting policies continued d Business Combinations Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
Identifying the acquirer in a business combination is based on the concept of control.
Normally, where an acquisition is affected by an exchange of equity interests, the shareholders of the entity that issues securities the legal parent entity retain the majority holding in the combined group.
The positions might be reversed in certain circumstances, where it is the legal subsidiary entitys shareholders who effectively control the combined group, even though the other party is the legal parent.
In this case, the financial statements are a continuation of the accounting acquirer Schneider Electric Industrial Software Business and reflect the acquisition of the legal acquirer AVEVA Group plc.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, which is measured at acquisition date fair value.
In the case of a reverse acquisition, this represents the consideration transferred by the accounting acquirer, as opposed to the legal acquirer.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Contingent consideration classified as equity is not remeasured and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.
Contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability that is a financial instrument and within the scope of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, is measured at fair value with the changes in fair value recognised in the statement of profit or loss in accordance with IAS 39.
Other contingent consideration that is not within the scope of IAS 39 is measured at fair value at each reporting date with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included in administrative expenses.
In the case of a reverse acquisition, the costs incurred by the legal acquirer AVEVA Group plc are considered to be pre-acquisition and are not therefore included within the income statement.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
In the case of a reverse acquisition, the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, are those of the legal acquirer AVEVA Group plc.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
e Revenue The Group generates its revenue principally through the supply of: Initial and perpetual licence fees: Support and maintenance fees, including mandatory annual fees: Rental and subscription licences: and Professional services.
Revenue is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents the amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the ordinary course of business, net of discounts and sales taxes.
For each revenue stream, revenue is not recognised unless and until: a clear contractual arrangement can be evidenced: delivery has been made in accordance with that contract: if required, contractual acceptance criteria have been met: and the fee has been agreed and collectability is probable.
Where extended payment terms beyond 90 days exist, appropriate approvals are obtained to ensure there is sufficient comfort that collectability is probable and the fee is determinable.
If approvals are not obtained, revenue is deferred until payment is due.
Initial and perpetual licence agreements Customers are charged an initial or perpetual licence fee upon installation for a set number of users.
Licence fees are recognised once the above conditions have been met.
Annual licence fees and support and maintenance fees Customers that have purchased an initial licence pay obligatory annual fees each year.
Annual fees consist of the continuing right to use, and support and maintenance, which includes core product upgrades and enhancements, and remote support services.
Users must continue to pay annual fees in order to maintain the right to use the software.
Customers that have purchased a perpetual licence have the option to pay for support and maintenance.
Annual and support and maintenance fees are recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the contract, which is typically 12 months.
If annual or support and maintenance fees are charged at a discount, an amount is allocated out of the initial perpetual licence fee at fair market value, based on the value established when annual or support and maintenance fees are charged separately to customers.
Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements 101 Rental and subscriptions The Group also supplies its software under rental licence agreements.
Rental licence fees which are invoiced monthly and which are cancellable by the customer are recognised on a monthly basis.
Other rental licence agreements typically cover a contract period of one year, are non-cancellable and consist of two separate components, the initial software delivery, and the continuing right to use with support and maintenance.
Revenue in respect of the continuing right to use and support and maintenance element is valued at fair market value based on the value established when annual fees are charged separately to the customer.
This component is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the contract.
The residual amount representing the implied initial or perpetual fee element is recognised up front, provided all of the above criteria have been met.
Where uncertainty exists and it is not possible to reliably determine the fair value of the support and maintenance element, all revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the contract.
Services Services consist primarily of consultancy, implementation services and training.
Revenue from these services is recognised as the services are performed and stage of completion is determined by reference to the costs incurred as a proportion of the total estimated costs of the service project.
If a contract cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is recognised only to the extent that costs have been incurred.
Provision is made as soon as a loss is foreseen.
If an arrangement includes both licence and service elements, licence fee revenue is recognised upon delivery of the software, provided that services do not include significant customisation or modification of the base product and the payment terms for licences are not subject to acceptance criteria.
In all other cases, revenues from both licence and service elements are recognised as services are performed.
When a transaction combines a supply of goods with the provision of a significant service, revenue from the provision of the service is recognised separately from the revenue from the sale of goods by reference to the stage of completion of the service, unless the service is essential to the functionality of the goods supplied, in which case the whole transaction is treated as a long-term service contract.
Revenue from a service that is incidental to the supply of goods is recognised at the same time as the revenue from the supply of goods.
For service contracts covering a specific period and providing services during that period, as and when required by the customer, revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis over the specified period unless there is evidence that some other method better represents the stage of completion.
Revenue from short-term one-off contracts is recognised when the service is complete.
f Significant accounting judgements Business combinations Acquirer From a legal perspective AVEVA Group plc is the acquirer, however from an accounting perspective, in accordance with IFRS 3, the Schneider Electric software business is the acquirer.
The rationale for this judgement is based on the following indicators: the former shareholders of the legal subsidiary as a group retain or receive the largest portion of the voting rights in the combined company the former shareholder of the SES companies SE will obtain a 60% shareholding of the combined group post merger the relative size measured in, for example, assets, revenues or profit of the Schneider Electric software business is significantly greater than that of the existing AVEVA business Delayed interests At the date of the completion of the combination not all the Schneider Electric software businesses had been carved out into separate legal entities, which were legally acquired by AVEVA Group plc.
Control of these businesses has been considered in line with IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements.
As set out under the merger agreement Schneider Electric Group shall act in accordance with lawful instructions provided to it by AVEVA Group plc in relation to the conduct of these businesses, from the point of Completion.
Reimbursement will be made by AVEVA Group plc to the extent that funding has been provided by Schneider Electric in acting on those instructions.
In accordance with these terms, AVEVA Group plc has power over the delayed businesses, an exposure to a variable return, and an ability to affect its returns, from the point of Completion.
It is therefore considered that all three requirements of control are satisfied, and as such the delayed entities have been consolidated in full in these financial statements.
Earnings per share Due to the combination being accounted for as a reverse acquisition and also due to the financial statements of the Schneider Electric Software business being a carve-out from the Schneider Electric Group, the financial statements present Earnings per share calculated on the following basis: The weighted average number of shares used reflects the legal acquirers AVEVAs weighted average pre-combination ordinary shares multiplied by the exchange ratio established in the combination, and the weighted average total actual shares of the legal parent in issue after the date of acquisition.
In the absence of issued ordinary shares in relation to the Schneider Electric Software Business we have used the number of issued ordinary shares of AVEVA Group plc as the starting point for the calculation.
AVEVA Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 102 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Key accounting policies continued g Significant accounting estimates Revenue recognition The assessments and estimates used by the Group for revenue recognition could have a significant impact on the amount and timing of revenue recognised.
Revenue from sales of software licences when these are combined with the delivery of significant implementation or customisation services is recognised in line with the delivery of the services to the customer.
This policy involves the assessment of which customer projects include significant customisation or implementation and also an assessment of the stage of completion of such projects.
The fair value estimate of the element of a customer rental fee attributable to the continuing right to use, and to customer support and maintenance, is reviewed periodically.
On average, the element attributable to customer support and maintenance as a proportion of the initial software delivery is 17-18%.
Provision for impairment of receivables The Group makes provision for the impairment of receivables on a customer-specific basis.
The determination of the appropriate level of provision involves an estimate of the potential risk of default or non-payment by the Groups customers and management consider a number of factors, including the financial strength of the customers, the level of default that the Group has suffered in the past, the age of the receivable outstanding and the Groups trading experience with that customer.
The provision for impairment of receivables at 31 March 2018 was 1,790,000 2017 2,063,000.
Details of the provision for impairment of receivables are contained in note 20.
Intangible assets IFRS 3 requires the identification of acquired intangible assets as part of a business combination.
The methods used to value such intangible assets require the use of estimates including forecast performance and customer attrition rates.
Future results are impacted by the amortisation periods adopted and changes to the estimated useful lives would result in different effects on the income statement.
Due to the completion of the combination with the Schneider Electric Industrial Software Business occurring just one month prior to the end of the financial year, the purchase price allocation presented in these financial statements is provisional and may therefore be subject to change.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.
Tests for impairment are based on discounted cash flows and assumptions including discount rates, timing and growth prospects which are inherently subjective.
Further details about the assumptions used are set out in note 15.
Retirement benefit obligations The determination of the Groups obligations and expense for defined benefit pensions is dependent on the selection, by the Board of Directors, of assumptions used by the pension scheme actuary in calculating these amounts.
The assumptions applied, together with sensitivity analysis, are described in note 28 and include, amongst others, the discount rate, the inflation rate, rates of increase in salaries and mortality rates.
While the Directors consider that the assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in the actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the reported amount of the Groups future pension obligations, actuarial gains and losses included in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income in future years and the future staff costs.
The net carrying amount of retirement benefit obligations at 31 March 2018 was 5,231,000 2017 5,160,000. h Impairment of assets Goodwill arising on acquisition is allocated to the cash-generating units expected to benefit from the combinations synergies and represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and generates cash flows, which are independent of other cash-generating units.
The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstance indicate that it might be impaired.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstance indicate the carrying value may be impaired.
If any such indication exists and where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount, the assets or cash-generating units are written down to their recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the greater of net selling price and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement in the selling and administrative expenses line item.

4 Segment information The combination of the AVEVA Group plc business with the business of Schneider Electric Software was completed at 1 March 2018 and the new Executive Leadership Team for the enlarged Group was formed shortly thereafter.
The Executive Leadership Team has decided how it plans to monitor and appraise the business and this will be on a geographic basis with 3 operating regions: Asia Pacific: Europe, Middle East and Africa EMEA : and Americas.
These three regions are the basis of the Groups primary operating segments reported in the financial statements.
Performance shall be evaluated based on regional contribution using the same accounting policies as adopted for the Groups financial statements.
There is no inter-segment revenue.
Balance sheet information will not be included in the information provided to the Executive Leadership Team.
However, as the Combination of the two businesses completed so close to the end of the financial year it was not possible to report cost data between the three regions for either the year ended 31 March 2018 or the comparative period.
Neither was it possible to consistently report the combined business on any other segmental basis.
Therefore, the segmental information provided has had to be limited to regional revenue only.
Segmental cost data will be reported for future accounting periods.

In addition, a divestment made by the Schneider Electric software business in China resulted in an exceptional write off of 858,000, offset by an exceptional gain of 1,866,000 made by selling the property relating to the same write off.
The impairment of capitalised R&D related to a development project that was ceased, prior to completion, following a divestment of a Schneider Electric Software joint venture operation with Schneider Electric.
Also included are the previously capitalised development costs related to a project.
Further to a commercial review of the project and the financial prospects for the developed technology, it was concluded that the carrying value of the development costs should be fully impaired.

At this balance sheet date, the US government had substantively enacted a federal tax rate reduction from 35% to 21% from 1 January 2018.
The effect of this reduction to the US net deferred tax liability is 21,985,000.
12 Dividends paid and proposed on equity shares No dividends are included in the consolidated statement of changes in shareholders equity, as no dividends were declared and paid since the date of the reverse acquisition and there were no dividends relating to the Schneider Electric Industrial Software Business.
The following dividends were declared, paid and proposed in relation to the legal entity AVEVA Group plc: 2018 2017 000 000 Declared and paid during the year No interim 2017 18 dividend paid 2016 17 interim dividend paid of 13.0 pence per ordinary share 8,316 Final 2016 17 dividend paid of 27.0 pence 2015 16 30.0 pence per ordinary share 17,268 19,184 17,268 27,500 Proposed for approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting Final proposed dividend 2017 18 of 27.0 pence 2016 17 27.0 pence per ordinary share 43,576 17,271 The proposed final dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 11 July 2018 and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.

13 Earnings per share 2018 2017 Pence Pence Earnings per share for the year: basic 46.97 39.99 diluted 46.73 39.82 Adjusted earnings per share for the year: basic 78.83 69.09 diluted 78.43 68.80 2018 2017 Number Number Weighted average number of ordinary shares for basic earnings per share 101,464,203 96,034,353 Effect of dilution: employee share options 514,438 403,086 Weighted average number of ordinary shares adjusted for the effect of dilution 101,978,641 96,437,439 The calculations of basic and diluted earnings per share are based on the net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent for the year of 47,657,000 2017 38,404,000.
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of AVEVA Group plc ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
For the purpose of the calculation, the number of shares prior to the Combination is considered to be 96,034,353.
This is the number of AVEVA Group plc ordinary shares as at 1 March 2018, adjusted by the exchange ratio of the Combination.
AVEVA Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 108 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 13 Earnings per share continued Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year as described above, plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the potentially dilutive share options into ordinary shares for the period from 1 March 2018 to 31 March 2018.
Details of the terms and conditions of share options are provided in note 29.
Details of the calculation of adjusted earnings per share are set out below: 2018 2017 000 000 Profit after tax for the year 47,657 38,404 Intangible amortisation excluding software 45,240 41,894 Share-based payments 1,383 1,300 Loss on fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts 68 Exceptional items 23,642 2,813 Tax effect on exceptional items 1,399 1,002 Tax effect on other normalised adjustments 36,611 17,062 Adjusted profit after tax 79,980 66,347 The denominators used are the same as those detailed above for both basic and diluted earnings per share.
The adjustment made to profit after tax in calculating adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share have been adjusted for the tax effects of the items adjusted.
The Directors believe that adjusted earnings per share is more representative of the underlying performance of the business.
14 Business combinations On 1 March 2018 AVEVA Group plc acquired the Schneider Electric software business.
For accounting purposes, this has been treated as a reverse acquisition under IFRS 3: Business Combinations, being the acquisition of AVEVA Group plc by the Schneider Electric software business.
The AVEVA Group is fully consolidated in the financial statements with effect from 1 March 2018, and all financial results prior to this date are for the Schneider Electric software business only.
As at 31 March 2018 the accounting for the business combination had been completed subject to the finalisation of the purchase price allocation, the final allocation of goodwill and finalisation of the completion accounts and working capital statement to be agreed with the Schneider Electric Group.
The finalisation of the completion accounts and working capital statement could result in a change in the consideration paid.
A preliminary purchase price allocation has been completed and this resulted in intangible assets with a fair value of 525,981,000 being recognised.
Due to the completion of the combination occurring just one month prior to the end of the financial year, the purchase price allocation is provisional and may therefore be subject to change.
The following table shows the preliminary fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed of AVEVA Group at the acquisition date.

In addition, the consideration also includes 550,000,000 payment from Schneider Electric and the fair value of the pre-acquisition cost relating to 697,240 outstanding share options acquired on 28 February 2018, amounting to 3,381,997.
The main factors leading to the recognition of goodwill are the value of the assembled AVEVA Group workforce and the future synergy benefits expected to arise from integrating of the two combined businesses.
All associated transaction costs were expensed and are included in administrative expenses and more details of these are included in note 7.
The attributable costs of the issuance of the shares of 1,700,000 have been charged directly to equity as a reduction in share premium.
The revenue and profit included in the consolidated income statement since 1 March 2018 contributed by AVEVA were 42,700,000 and 15,000,000 respectively.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 April 2017, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income would have presented revenue of 704,600,000 and profit after tax of 66,000,000 at an effective tax rate of -2% 15 Goodwill 2018 2017 000 000 At 1 April 42,442 30,580 Acquisitions 1,259,870 7,255 Exchange adjustment 3,989 4,607 At 31 March 1,298,323 42,442 Goodwill impairment tests The following table shows the allocation of the carrying value of goodwill at the end of the year by cash generating unit.
2018 2017 000 000 EMEA 7,096 7,255 Americas 31,357 35,187 Unallocated at 31 March 1,259,870 1,298,323 42,442 Unallocated goodwill relates to goodwill arising on the reverse acquisition of AVEVA Group plc by the Schneider Electric software business as detailed in note 14.
As the Combination of the two businesses completed so close to the end of the financial year it was not possible to allocate the goodwill to the cash generating units.
As the initial allocation of goodwill acquired in the business combination cannot be completed before the end of the first annual period in which the business combination was effected, that initial allocation shall be completed before the end of the first annual period beginning after the acquisition date.
The initial allocation will be reported in the annual report for the year ended 31 March 2019, being the first annual period beginning after the acquisition date.
The carrying value of goodwill allocated to the EMEA and Americas CGUs relates to acquisitions made by the Schneider Electric software business in previous financial years.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
In 2017 18 the goodwill impairment testing was carried out on a value in use VIU basis using the most recently approved management budgets for the year ended 31 March 2019 together with the most recent three-year business plan extrapolated to a duration of five years in total.
Projected cash flows beyond five years have been assumed at the long-term growth rate for that region and these have been used to formulate a terminal value for the discounted cash flow calculation.
Key assumptions The key assumptions in the most recent annual budget on which the cash flow projections are based relate to discount rates, longterm growth rates and operating margins.
The cash flow projections have been discounted using the Groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the country and market risk.
Long-term growth rates used are assumed to be equal to the long-term growth rate in the gross domestic product of the region in which the CGU operates.
CGU operating margin is based on past results.
Discount Long-term Rate growth rate EMEA 11.9% 1.9% Americas 11.9% 1.9% AVEVA Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 110 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 15 Goodwill continued Summary of results During the year all goodwill that had been allocated to CGUs was tested for impairment, with no impairment charge resulting.
As the VIU is most sensitive to a change in the discount rate and long-term growth rate, the Directors have considered combinations of a reduction in the long-term growth rate and an increase in the discount rate and concluded that no reasonably foreseeable changes in key assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill, such is the margin by which the estimate exceeds the carrying value.
For the purposes of the adjusted earnings per share calculation note 13, intangible asset amortisation excludes the charge relating to other software of 1,060,000 2017 1,046,000.
Unless otherwise stated, the Groups percentage of equity capital and voting rights is 100%.
The results of all subsidiaries have been consolidated in these financial statements.

Drawings under these facilities have an interest rate of 1.19% and are repayable on 3 September 2018.
The revolving credit facility permits 15 loans to be outstanding at any one time.
Interest on drawings is calculated at LIBOR plus a margin, initially 0.5%, rising only if net leverage position deteriorates considerably.
Additionally, a quarterly commitment fee is charged on the undrawn facility at 35% of the margin.

These leases have a duration of between one and ten years.
Certain property leases contain an option for renewal.
26 Financial risk management The Groups principal financial instruments comprise cash and short-term deposits, and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables, trade payables and borrowings, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to manage currency risks arising from the Groups operations.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing such risks on a regular basis as summarised below: a Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Groups income or the value of its holding of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters.
Interest rate risk The Group holds net funds and hence its interest rate risk is associated with short-term cash deposits.
The Groups overall objective with respect to holding these deposits is to maintain a balance between security of funds, accessibility and competitive rates of return.
For the presentation of market risks, IFRS 7 requires sensitivity analysis that show the effects of hypothetical changes of relevant risk variables on profit or loss and shareholders equity.
The Group is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on its cash and cash equivalents.
Borrowings are at a fixed rate of interest.
The impact is determined by applying sensitised interest rates to the cash and cash equivalents balances.
A 1% point decrease in the Sterling and US Dollar interest rates would have reduced interest income by approximately 500,000 2017 200,000 and profit after tax by 350,000 2017 140,000.
Foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk arises from the Group undertaking a significant number of foreign currency transactions in the course of operations.
These exposures arise from sales in currencies other than the Groups presentational currency of Sterling.
The Group manages exchange risks, where possible, by using forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to match forecast cash flows arising from its recurring revenue base.
In addition, it enters into specific forward foreign exchange contracts for individually significant revenue contracts, when the timing of forecast cash flows is reasonably certain.
Other currency exposures are harder to hedge cost effectively.
At 31 March 2018, the Group had outstanding currency exchange contracts to sell $12.38 million and 8.15 million.
The Group has not applied hedge accounting during the current year and therefore all gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts have been included in the Consolidated income statement.
The Group has investments in foreign operations whose net assets are exposed to currency translation risk.
Gains and losses arising from these structural currency exposures are recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
AVEVA Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 116 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 26 Financial risk management continued Foreign currency sensitivity analysis For the presentation of market risks, IFRS 7 requires sensitivity analysis that shows the effects of hypothetical changes in the foreign exchange rates in profit or loss or shareholders equity.
The impact is determined by applying the sensitised foreign exchange rate to the monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date.
Currency risks as defined by IFRS 7 arise on account of financial instruments being denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency and being of a monetary nature: differences resulting from the translation of financial statements into the Groups presentation currency are not taken into consideration.
A 10% change in the US Dollar against Sterling would have impacted equity and profit after tax by the amounts shown below as at the reporting date shown.
In managements opinion, this is a reasonably possible change given current market conditions.
Our analysis indicates that a 10% change in other currencies would not have a significant impact.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular, interest rates and other foreign currencies, remain constant.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2016 17.

Counterparties for cash and cash equivalents are governed by the treasury policy, which has been approved by the Board, and are limited to financial institutions which have a high credit rating assigned by international credit rating agencies.
As set out in the Groups treasury policy, the amount of exposure to each counterparty is subject to a specific limit, up to a maximum of 50% of the Groups total counterparty risk.
Within this overall limit, some counterparties are subject to more restrictive caps on counterparty exposure.
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties and provides credit to customers in the normal course of business.
The amounts presented in the Consolidated balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event, which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The Group has credit control functions to monitor receivable balances on an ongoing basis.
Credit checks are performed before credit is granted to new customers.
Due to the credit control procedures in place, we believe all the receivables are of good quality.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset.
The exposure to credit risk is mitigated where necessary by either letters of credit or payments in advance.
The Group does not require collateral in respect of its financial assets.
c Liquidity risk The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity of financial assets and liabilities.
As at 31 March 2018 the Group has access to undrawn borrowing facilities of 90,000,000 2017 nil.

The carrying amounts of these financial assets and liabilities in the Groups financial statements approximates their fair values.
In addition, the Groups financial assets include forward foreign exchange contracts.
Financial instruments that are recognised at fair value subsequent to initial recognition are grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
The three levels are defined as follows: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
At 31 March 2018, the Group had forward foreign exchange contracts which were measured at Level 2 fair value subsequent to initial recognition.
The fair value of the asset in respect of foreign exchange contracts was 451,000 at 31 March 2018 2017 asset of 1,547,000 and liability of 1,929,000.
The resulting loss of 68,000 2017 nil on the movement of the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is recognised in the Consolidated income statement within administrative expenses.
e Capital management The Groups policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, market, creditor, customer and employee confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The capital structure of the Group consists of equity attributable to the equity holders of AVEVA Group plc comprising issued share capital, other reserves and retained earnings.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
The Board monitors the capital structure on a regular basis and determines the level of annual dividend.
The Group is not exposed to any externally imposed capital requirements.
27 Deferred tax The following are the major deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised by the Group and the movements thereon, during the current and previous year: Retirement Other benefit Intangible Share temporary obligations assets options Losses differences Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 At 1 April 2016 67,902 67,902 Credit to income statement 16,478 1,984 18,462 Exchange adjustment 9,380 93 9,287 At 31 March 2017 60,804 2,077 58,727 Acquired 946 91,271 706 568 1,982 88,961 Credit to income statement 33,595 4,773 38,368 Credit to other comprehensive income 1,479 1,479 Credited to equity 4,222 898 3,324 Exchange adjustment 5,468 664 4,804 At 31 March 2018 533 117,234 706 568 9,066 106,361 Other temporary differences consist principally of deferred tax on fixed assets and timing differences in respect of revenue recognition.
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: 2018 2017 000 000 Deferred tax liabilities 115,412 60,804 Deferred tax assets 9,051 2,077 106,361 58,727 Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements 119 It is likely that the majority of the overseas earnings would qualify for the UK dividend exemption.
However, 20,354,000 2017 18,893,000 of the undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries may still result in a tax liability principally as a result of withholding taxes levied by the overseas jurisdictions in which they operate.
No liability has been recognised because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of 21,570,000 2017 9,237,000 available for offset against future profits.
Of the total deferred tax asset of 9,051,000 2017 2,077,000, 568,000 2017 nil has been recognised and is included above.
All other losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
28 Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes in the UK, Sweden, Italy, Japan and Germany.
The Group also provides certain post employment benefits to its South Korean employees.
The UK defined benefit pension scheme, previously available to all UK employees, was closed to new applicants in 2002 and closed to future accrual from 31 March 2015.
UK employees are now offered membership of a defined contribution scheme.
The German unfunded defined benefit schemes are closed to new applicants and provide benefits to nine deferred members.
No current employees participate in the schemes.
The Group provides pension arrangements to its Swedish employees through an industry-wide defined benefit scheme.
It is not possible to identify the share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the scheme which is attributable to the Group on a fair and reasonable basis.
Therefore the Group has applied the provisions in IAS 19 to account for the scheme as if it was a defined contribution scheme.
The movement on the provision for retirement benefit obligations was as follows: German UK defined defined South Korean benefit benefit severance IPS Japan scheme schemes pay Italy plan Plan Other Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 At 31 March 2016 1,014 1,339 1,054 453 3,860 Current service cost 88 231 165 187 671 Net interest on pension scheme liabilities 20 4 24 Actuarial remeasurements 136 30 106 Employer contributions 4 54 58 Exchange adjustment 136 175 188 58 557 At 31 March 2017 1,394 1,741 1,381 644 5,160 On acquisition 4,277 1,899 1,598 780 Current service cost 78 236 141 479 934 Net interest on pension scheme liabilities 171 18 6 110 305 Return on pension scheme assets 160 160 Actuarial remeasurements 556 101 2,802 2,347 Employer contributions 1,297 210 247 494 2,248 Exchange adjustment 41 25 98 295 327 At 31 March 2018 5,563 2,874 1,598 1,792 1,284 3,246 5,231 The following is the analysis of the retirement benefit balances: 2018 2017 000 000 Retirement benefit surplus 5,563 Retirement benefit liabilities 10,794 5,160 5,231 5,160 AVEVA Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 120 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 28 Retirement benefit obligations continued The UK defined benefit scheme surplus has been recognised as a non-current asset as the Group has a right to any remaining surplus after all liabilities are paid.
The Trustees may not distribute any surplus without the agreement of the Group.
If such agreement is withheld, the Trustees are required to repay any remaining funds to the Group.
a UK defined benefit scheme The Group operates a UK defined benefit pension plan providing benefits based on final pensionable pay which is funded.
This scheme was closed to new employees on 30 September 2002 with the option of reopening if required and was converted to a Career Average Revalued Earnings basis on 30 September 2004.
The scheme closed to future benefit accrual with effect from 1 April 2015.
Pensions are also payable to dependants on death.
Administration on behalf of the members is governed by a trust deed, and the funds are held and managed by professional investment managers who are independent of the Group.
Contributions to the scheme are made in accordance with advice from an external, professionally qualified actuary, Broadstone Corporate Benefits Limited, at rates which are calculated to be sufficient to meet the future liabilities of the scheme.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates.
The principal assumptions used in determining the pension valuation were as follows: 2018 2017 % % Main assumptions: Discount rate 2.60 Inflation assumption RPI 3.50 Rate of salary increases 5.50 Rate of increase of pensions in payment 3.20 Rate of increase of pensions in deferment 2.50 Cash Commutation 20% of pension The duration of the scheme liabilities is estimated to be 17 years.
For the years ended 31 March 2018 and 2017, the mortality assumptions adopted imply the following weighted average life expectancies at age 65: 2018 2017 Years Years Male currently aged 65 22.9 Female currently aged 65 23.9 Male currently aged 45 23.9 Female currently aged 45 25.1 Company contributions were 1,297,000 2017 nil, comprising deficit contributions totalling 117,000 per annum plus an administration charge of 180,000, and a one off additional Company contribution of 1,000,000.
The total contributions in 2018 19 and 2019 20 are expected to be approximately 1,580,000 in each year.
The PPF levy of approximately 15,854 was payable in addition 2017 28,000.
The assumed discount rate, inflation rate and mortality all have a significant effect on the IAS 19 accounting valuation.
The following table shows the sensitivity of the valuation to changes in these assumptions: Impact on liabilities increase decrease 2018 2017 000 000 0.25 percentage point increase to: discount rate 3,422 inflation including pension increases linked to inflation 2,412 Additional one-year increase to life expectancy 2,334 The assets and liabilities of the scheme at 31 March 2018 and 2017 were as follows: 2018 2017 000 000 Equities 33,160 Bonds 27,096 Other 23,121 Total fair value of assets 83,377 Present value of scheme liabilities 77,814 Net pension asset 5,563 Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements 121 The amounts recognised in the Consolidated income statement and Consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year are analysed as follows: 2018 2017 000 000 Finance revenue Interest income on pension scheme assets 160 Finance costs Interest on pension scheme liabilities 171 Taken to Consolidated statement of comprehensive income Actual return on pension scheme assets 160 Less: interest income on pension scheme assets 160 Remeasurement gain on defined benefit plan Analysis of movements in the present value of the defined benefit pension obligations during the year are analysed as follows: 2018 2017 000 000 At 1 April On acquisition 77,643 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 171 At 31 March 77,814 The above defined benefit obligation arises from a plan that is wholly funded.
Changes in the fair value of plan assets are as follows: 2018 2017 000 000 At 1 April On acquisition 81,920 Interest income 160 Contributions by employer 1,297 At 31 March 83,377 b German defined benefit schemes The Group operates four defined benefit pension schemes.
There are three defined benefit pension schemes in AVEVA GmbH.
Tribon Solutions GmbH operated an unfunded defined benefit scheme that provides benefits to three deferred members following an acquisition in 1992.
No current employees participate in the scheme and it is closed to new applicants.
Benefit payments are made as they fall due.
Since the acquisition of Bocad in May 2012, AVEVA Software GmbH had been responsible for the pension obligations of six former Bocad employees.
At the time of the acquisition, the pension obligations were only partly financed via external funding vehicles.
In March 2013, AVEVA concluded an agreement with an external insurance provider which resulted in the insurance company being obliged to provide all benefits as detailed in the individual pension commitments, with AVEVA only having an obligation if the external insurance provider defaults.
In addition, AVEVA GmbH operates a defined benefit pension scheme for one employee.
This scheme is closed to new members.
There are two unfunded defined benefit schemes in the German Schneider Electric software business.
Seven current employees participate in the schemes, both schemes are closed to new applicants.
Details of the actuarial assumptions used to value these schemes in accordance with IAS 19 are set out below: 2018 2017 Rate of increase of pension in payment 1.5%-2.5% Discount rate 1.2%-1.6% Mortality 13-20 years Rate of salary increases n a Retirement age 60-63 AVEVA Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 122 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 28 Retirement benefit obligations continued c South Korean severance pay South Korean employees are entitled to a lump sum on severance of their employment equal to one months salary for each year of service.
d Italy plan Certain employees in Italy have an accrued entitlement to Defined Benefit termination indemnity payments.
e IPS Japan plan Employees enrolled in the IPS Japanese plan receive a lump sum payment on retirement or earlier exit.
f Other retirement schemes Swedish employees employed by AVEVA AB aged 28 or over are members of the ITP, an industry scheme for salaried employees which provides benefits in addition to the state pension arrangements.
The ITP scheme is managed by Alecta, a Swedish insurance company.
It is a multi-employer defined benefit scheme with a supplementary defined contribution component.
AVEVA AB pays monthly premiums to the insurers which vary by age, service and salary of the employee.
AVEVA AB is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the scheme on a fair and reasonable basis because this information is not provided by the scheme and therefore has accounted for the scheme as if it was a defined contribution pension scheme.
At 31 March 2018, Alectas surplus in the form of collective funding level was 152% which was calculated in accordance with the Swedish Annual Accounts Act for Insurance Companies.
The total cost charged to the income statement was 66,599.
Certain employees in Australia have a statutory right to receive a Long Service Leave payment at dates agreed with the employee after the qualifying period.
Employees in UAE and Saudi Arabia are entitled to a lump sum benefit on retirement or termination.
This is based on service and final salary and is a legal requirement in these countries.
Certain employees in India have a statutory right to receive a gratuity payment when they leave service.
They also have a leave encashment plan where unused annual leave can be used to purchase an additional retirement benefit.
g Defined contribution schemes The Group operates defined contribution retirement schemes for certain employees.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group.
The total cost charged to income of 8,580,000 2017 6,466,000 represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at the rates specified in the rules of the plans.
29 Share-based payment plans The Group has four equity-settled share schemes: the AVEVA Group plc Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP : the AVEVA Group Management Bonus Deferred Share Scheme: the AVEVA Group plc Senior Employee Restricted Share Plan 2015: and the AVEVA Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme 2007.
No grants have been made under the 2007 scheme which was approved at the Annual General Meeting on 12 July 2007.
Details of these plans are set out below.
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average exercise prices WAEP of, and movements in, share options for the schemes during the year: 2018 20167 2018 WAEP 2017 WAEP Number Pence Number Pence Outstanding at start of year On acquisition 697,240 3.49 Granted during year 574,607 1.68 Outstanding at end of year 1,271,847 2.67 Exercisable at end of year 5,317 3.56 Included within the options granted during the year are 270,384 options granted as a result of modifications to existing options 2017 none.
Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements 123 During the year, modifications occurred under the Companys employee share plans in relation to the Return of Value to the Companys shareholders, which was implemented by means of a B Share Scheme.
The modifications operated to increase the number of Shares held under the awards by a factor of 1.53846 and rounded down to the nearest number of whole shares.
Modifications were also made in relation to a dividend equivalent.
The following modifications were made to certain of the Companys vested and unvested awards.

As a result of the reverse acquisition accounting, existing share option awards were revalued using the relevant inputs as at the acquisition date, using a consistent methodology as outlined above.
The element relating to service prior to the acquisition date has been included within consideration, as outlined in Note 14, with the post-acquisition element reflecting the ongoing charge in the income statement.
The following table lists the inputs to the model used for each of the awards: 2017 18 2016 17 awards awards Common to all plans: Expected volatility 48% Risk-free interest rate 0.54% Expected life of option Remaining life of option Weighted average share price 18.26 Dividend yield 2.48% LTIP March Weighted average share price 20.34 Dividend yield 2.22% Return of value and Dividend equivalents Weighted average share price 18.26 Dividend yield 2.48% The weighted average remaining contractual life for the options outstanding at 31 March 2018 is 7.12 years 2017 nil years.
The average fair value of options granted during the year was 19.14 2017 nil.
In calculating the fair value, the expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.
In the year ended 31 March 2018 the Group recognised an expense of 1,230,000 related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions 2017 nil and 153,000 related to cash-settled share-based payment transactions 2017 1,300,000.
Details of the share option plans are as follows: a Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP The following awards have been made under the LTIP.
The exercise price is equal to the nominal value of the underlying shares, which is 3.56 pence.
Options under the LTIP are normally exercisable in full or in part between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant.
2017 18 awards In 2017 18, a total of 127,531 share options were awarded to Executive Directors and senior management under the LTIP.

b Deferred annual bonus share plan In 2008, the Company established the AVEVA Group Management Bonus Deferred Share Scheme 2008 the Deferred Share Scheme.
Directors and senior management participate in the scheme.
Subject to the achievement of performance conditions relating to a single financial year, these incentive arrangements are intended to reward the recipient partly in cash and partly in ordinary shares in the Company to be delivered on a deferred basis.
In July 2017, the AVEVA Group Employee Benefit Trust 2008 awarded 15,444 2017 2,160 deferred shares to the Executive Directors and senior management in respect of the bonus earned in the year ended 31 March 2017 2017 bonus earned in year ended 31 March 2016.
