IFRS 16 Leases The standard does not impact the Groups financial position as a lessor or the Groups rental income from its investment properties.
The standard requires lessees to recognise a right-of-use asset and related lease liability representing the obligation to make lease payments.
The interest expense on the lease liability and depreciation on the right-of-use asset will be recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Having reviewed the Groups current operating leases, the most significant are leases for the Groups offices in London, Reading, Paris and Dublin.
It is estimated that the Group would recognise a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability of approximately 13 million and the net impact on the income statement will not be material.
Amendments to IFRS 2 Share Based Payments and Amendments to IAS 40 Investment Property were effective from 1 January 2018.

In the UK, the Group has been a REIT since 2007 and a SIIC in France since 2004.
These tax regimes exempt the Groups property income and gains from corporate taxes provided a number of conditions in relation to the Groups activities are met including, but not limited to, distributing at least 90% of the Groups UK tax exempt profit as property income distributions PID.
The residual business in both the UK and France are subject to corporation tax as normal.
The Irish properties are held in a QIAIF which provides similar tax benefits to those of a UK REIT but which subject distributions from Ireland to the UK to a 20% withholding tax.

Valuations have been prepared in accordance with the RICS Valuation Global Standards 2017 based on certain assumptions as set out in note 1.
Valuation fees are based on a fixed amount agreed between the Group and the valuers and are independent of the portfolio value.
Summaries of the valuers reports are available on the Companys website: www.
In the case of leasehold properties, valuations are net of any obligation to freeholders or superior leaseholders.
To comply with IAS 40 and IAS 17 these obligations and the related leasehold assets are included in the balance sheet within Obligations under head leases note 21 and Interests in leasehold properties respectively.
Further information is provided in Significant accounting policies on page 133.
As noted in Significant judgements and key estimates on page 131, real estate valuations are complex, derived from data which is not widely publicly available and involve a significant degree of estimation.
For these reasons, and consistent with EPRAs guidance, we have classified the valuations of our property portfolio as Level 3 as defined by IFRS 13.

Borrowings are arranged to ensure an appropriate maturity profile and to maintain short-term liquidity.
Acquisitions may be financed initially using short-term funds before being refinanced for the longer term when market conditions are appropriate.
Long-term debt mainly comprises the Groups fixed rate unsecured bonds.

At 31 December 2018 the carrying value of derivatives designated in a cash flow hedge was a liability of 30.6 million 2017: 2.8 million.
Currency basis is not included in this designation and a cost of hedging reserve is not presented separately as it is considered to be immaterial.
This designation allows exchange differences on hedging instruments to be recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve and then recycled to net finance costs in the income statement, to offset against the exchange differences on US dollar borrowings also recognised in net finance costs.

Management monitors the Groups current and projected financial position against these guidelines.
Further details of these ratios are provided in the Financial review on page 54.
D: Cash management and liquidity Cash levels are monitored to ensure sufficient resources are available to meet the Groups operational requirements.
Short-term money market deposits are used to manage cash resources to maximise the rate of return, giving due consideration to risk.
Liquidity requirements are met with an appropriate mix of short and longer-term debt as explained in note 20A.
The maturity analysis of the undrawn element of the revolving credit facilities at 31 December 2018 is summarised below: 2018 2017 m m Expiry Within two to five years 627.0 692.6 E: Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are trade receivables, restricted monetary assets, cash and deposits, balances due from joint ventures, other investments, loans receivable, participative loans to associates and derivative financial instruments.
The Groups credit risk is attributable to its trade receivables, restricted monetary assets, cash and deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The credit risk on balances due from joint ventures, other investments, loans receivable and participative loans is limited as they are supported by investment properties held within the joint ventures and associates.
Trade receivables consist principally of rents due from tenants.
The balance is low relative to the scale of the balance sheet and the Groups tenant base is diversified, with tenants generally of good financial standing.
The majority of tenant leases are long-term contracts with rents payable quarterly in advance.
Rent deposits and personal or corporate guarantees are held in respect of some leases.
Taking these factors into account, the risk to the Group of individual tenant default and the credit risk of trade receivables are considered low.
Trade receivables are presented after deducting a loss allowance provision, as set out in note 15.
The Groups most significant tenants are set out in Table 92 of the Additional disclosures on page 179.
The credit risk on cash and deposits and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks, who are committed lenders to the Group, with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
At 31 December 2018 the fair value of interest rate and currency swap assets was 28.6 million 2017: 16.6 million, and the fair value of currency swap liabilities was 110.8 million 2017: 100.6 million, as shown in note 20A.
These financial instruments have interest accruals of 10.6 million 2017: 11.0 million which are recognised within other receivables in note 15.
After taking into account the netting impact included within our International Swap and Derivatives Association ISDA agreements with each counterparty which are enforceable on the occurrence of future credit events such as a default, the net positions, including accrued interest would be derivative financial assets of 7.4 million 2017: 4.0 million and derivative financial liabilities of 79.0 million 77.0 million.
The combined value of derivative financial instruments at 31 December 2018 was therefore a liability of 71.6 million 2017: 73.0 million.
The credit risk on restricted monetary assets, being cash held by the Group and its managing agents on behalf of third parties, is similarly considered low.
At 31 December 2018, the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk was 338.3 million 2017: 488.6 million which excludes derivative financial instruments and balances supported by investment properties.

G: Sensitivity analysis In managing interest rate and currency risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the Groups earnings.
Changes in foreign exchange and interest rates may have an impact on consolidated earnings over the longer term.

The sensitivity has been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the floating rate borrowings, net of interest rate swaps, at the year end.

This has been calculated by retranslating the year-end euro-denominated financial instruments at the year-end foreign exchange rate changed by 10%.
Forward foreign exchange contracts have been included in this estimate.

The following valuation techniques have been applied to determine the fair values of borrowings and interest rate swaps: Valuation technique Financial instrument Quoted market prices Unsecured bonds Calculating present value of cash flows using appropriate market Senior notes, unsecured bank loans and overdrafts, fair value of discount rates currency swaps and fair value of interest rate swaps Calculation based on the underlying net asset values of the Villages in which Participative loans to associates the Reported Group holds interests: the assets of the Villages mainly comprise properties held at professional valuation see note 14C 2018 2017 Level 3 financial instruments - Participative loans within investments in associates note 14C m m Balance at 1 January 128.8 113.7 Total gains in share of results of associates 5.9 14.7 1 in other comprehensive income 1.6 4.1 Other movements acquisitions 32.1 movement in advances 1.0 3.7 Balance at 31 December 169.4 128.8 1.
For the year ended 31 December 2017 the total of 4.1million comprised foreign exchange differences of 4.6 million included in the translation reserve, partly offset by changes in the fair value of the participative loans of 0.5 million included in retained earnings.
For the year ended 31 December 2018, 1.6 million of these foreign exchange differences have been included in the translation reserve.
Following the adoption of IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018, fair value changes in the participative loans are included in share of results of associates see note 1 on page 129.
The valuation technique applied for Level 3 financial instruments is described in the above table.
All other factors remaining constant, an increase of 5% in the net asset values of the Villages would increase the carrying amount of the Level 3 financial instruments by 10.8 million.
Similarly, a decrease of 5% would decrease the carrying amount by 10.8 million.

From 1 January 2018, the loan is classified entirely as an asset at fair value through profit and loss.
The presence of the embedded derivative has resulted in the decision to designate the participative loan balances as assets at fair value through profit and loss.

This includes cumulative losses of 8.3 million recycled from the net investment hedge reserve to the income statement on disposal of foreign operations.
In 2017, the equity losses on hedging instruments of 53.4 million shown as the total movement in the hedging reserves on page 127 comprise a gain of 2.0 million in relation to currency swaps and a loss of 55.4 million for loans.
The Group risk management strategies and hedge documentation comply with the requirements of IFRS 9 and are thus treated as continuing hedges.
As at 31 December 2018, amounts relating to continuing hedges in the net investment hedge reserve were 230.1 million 2017: 249.5 million.
These hedges are due to mature between 2019 and 2031.
The movements in the net investment hedge reserve are offset by foreign exchange translation gains during the year of 41.5 million 2017: 157.9 million which arise from the retranslation of the net investment in foreign operations and 10.3 million 2017: 54.4 million of cumulative gains recycled on disposal of foreign operations.
These are shown in the Consolidated statement of changes in equity as movements in the translation reserve on pages 126 and 127.
The Group designated as a cash flow hedge the cross currency swaps used to manage its foreign currency risk on US dollar loans.
In 2018 a gain of 27.7 million 2017: 36.9 million loss was recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve in respect of these derivatives of which 23.6 million 2017: 36.6 million loss was recycled to net finance costs.
At 31 December 2018 the cash flow hedge reserve includes a loss of 8.2 million 2017: 12.3 million, all of which relates to continuing cash flow hedges.
The cash flows are expected to occur between 2019 and 2024.
The ratio for hedging instruments designated in both net investment and cash flow hedge relationships was 1:1.
Ineffectiveness could be recognised on either hedging relationship due to significant changes in counterparty credit risk or a reduction in the notional amount of the hedged item during the designated hedging period.
