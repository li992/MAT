OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CONTINUED 11 Post-employment benefits This note explains the accounting policies governing the Groups pension schemes, analyses the deficit on the defined benefit pension scheme and shows how it has been calculated.
The majority of the Groups employees are members of defined contribution pension schemes.
Additionally, the Group operates two small defined benefit schemes in France and Switzerland.
For defined contribution schemes, the Group pays contributions into separate funds on behalf of the employee and has no further obligations to employees.
The risks associated with this type of plan are assumed by the member.
Contributions paid by the Group in respect of the current period are included within the income statement.
The defined benefit scheme is a pension arrangement under which participating members receive a pension benefit at retirement determined by the scheme rules, salary and length of pensionable service.
The income statement charge for the defined benefit scheme is the current past service cost and the net interest cost which is the change in the net defined benefit liability that arises from the passage of time.
The Group underwrites both financial and demographic risks associated with this type of plan.
Accounting policy Obligations under defined contribution schemes are recognised as an operating cost in the income statement as incurred.
The Group also operates a small defined benefit pension scheme in Switzerland and other post-employment benefit schemes in France.
The assets of these schemes are held separately from the assets of the Group.
Under French legislation, the Group is required to make one-off payments to employees in France who reach retirement age while still in employment.
The costs of providing benefits under these schemes are determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method.
The current service cost and gains and losses on settlements and curtailments are included in selling and administrative expenses in the income statement.
Past service costs should be recognised on the earlier of the date of the plan amendment and the date the Group recognises  costs.
Interest on the pension plan assets and the imputed interest on pension plan liabilities are included within selling and administrative expenses in the income statement.
Changes in the post-employment benefit obligation due to experience and changes in actuarial assumptions are included in the statement of comprehensive income in full in the period in which they arise.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme is the present value of the defined benefit obligation and future administration costs at the end of the reporting period, less the fair value of plan assets.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximate to the terms of the related pension liability.
The calculation of the defined benefit obligation of a defined benefit plan requires estimation of future events, for example salary and pension increases, inflation and mortality rates.
In the event that future experience does not bear out the estimates made in previous years, an adjustment will be made to the plans defined benefit obligation in future periods which could have a material effect on the Group.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed on the significant assumptions.
The significant assumptions are deemed to be the discount rate and salary increases, as these are most likely to have a material impact on the defined benefit obligations.
The analysis has been performed by the independent actuaries.
