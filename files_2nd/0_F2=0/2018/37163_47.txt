Disclosures regarding financial instruments measured at fair value The Companys financial instruments within the scope of FRS 102 that are held at fair value comprise its investment portfolio and derivative financial instruments.
The investments are categorised into a hierarchy consisting of the following three levels: 1 The unadjusted quoted price in an active market for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable i. e. : developed using market data for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly 3 Inputs are unobservable i. e. : for which market data is unavailable for the asset or liability Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset.
Details of the valuation techniques used by the Company are given in note 1 b on page 60.
The following table sets out the fair value measurements using the FRS 102 hierarchy at 31st December.
There were no transfers between Level 1, 2 or 3 during the year 2017: nil.
A reconciliation of the fair value measurements in Level 3 is set out below.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies As an investment trust, the Company invests in equities and other securities for the long term so as to secure its investment objective stated on the Features page.

The Directors policy for managing these risks is set out below.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks and the methods used to measure the risks that are set out below, have not changed from those applying in the comparative year.
The Companys classes of financial instruments are as follows: investments in US equity shares, which are held in accordance with the Companys investment objective: cash held within a liquidity fund: short term debtors, creditors and cash arising directly from its operations: a debenture issued by the Company and bank loans, the purpose of which is to finance the Companys operations: and forward foreign currency contracts, the purpose of which is to manage the currency risk arising from the Companys investment activities.
a Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk.
Information to enable an evaluation of the nature and extent of these three elements of market risk is given in parts i and iii of this note, together with sensitivity analyses where appropriate.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and these policies have remained unchanged from those applying in the comparative year.
The Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
i Currency risk The majority of the Companys assets and income are denominated in US dollars.
Sterling is the Companys functional currency and the currency in which it reports.
As a result, movements in exchange rates will affect the sterling value of those items.
Management of currency risk The Manager monitors the Companys exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the Board, which meets on at least five occasions each year.
The Manager measures the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and income of a movement in the rates of exchange to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
It is the Companys policy to hedge any currency risk in respect of the geared portion of the portfolio using three month forward contracts.
However the 50 million debenture settling in US currency matured in June 2018, therefore there is no requirement to hedge currency risk presently, since all debt is denominated in sterling.
Accordingly there were no open forward currency contracts as at 31st December 2018.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
The Company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.
Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies continued a Market risk continued i Currency risk continued Foreign currency exposure The fair value of the Companys monetary items that have foreign currency exposure at 31st December are shown below.
Where the Companys equity investments which are not monetary items are priced in a foreign currency, they have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.

Foreign currency sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of return after taxation for the year and net assets with regard to the Companys monetary financial assets, financial liabilities and equity investments and exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary currency financial instruments and equity investments held at each balance sheet date and the income receivable in foreign currency and assumes a 10% 2017: 10% appreciation or depreciation in sterling against the US Dollar which is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on the volatility of exchange rates during the year.

The Companys exposure to floating interest rates, giving cash flow interest rate risk when rates are reset, is as follows: 2018 2017 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates Cash and short term deposits 53 19 JPMorgan US Dollar Liquidity Fund 7,866 13,670 Bank loans 55,443 Total exposure 7,919 41,754 Interest receivable on cash balances, or paid on overdrafts, is at a margin below or above LIBOR respectively 2017: same.
The target interest earned on the JPMorgan US Dollar Liquidity Fund is the 7 day US dollar London Interbank Bid Rate.
Details of the bank loans are given in notes 13 and 14 on page 67.
Interest rate sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and net assets to a 1.0% 2017: 1.0% increase or decrease in interest rates in regards to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities.
This level of change is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on observation of current market conditions.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary financial instruments held at the balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.

iii Other price risk Other price risk includes changes in market prices, other than those arising from interest rate risk, which may affect the value of equity investments.
Management of other price risk The Board considers on a regular basis the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors.
The investment management team has responsibility for monitoring the portfolio, which is selected in accordance with the Companys investment objectives and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.

Other price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and net assets to an increase or decrease of 10% 2017: 10% in the market values.

Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the Companys assets comprise mainly readily realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.

c Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that the failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in loss to the Company.
Management of credit risk Portfolio dealing The Company invests in markets that operate Delivery Versus Payment DVP settlement.
The process of DVP mitigates the risk of losing the principal of a trade during the settlement process.
The Manager continuously monitors dealing activity to ensure best execution, a process that involves measuring various indicators including the quality of trade settlement and incidence of failed trades.
Counterparty lists are maintained and adjusted accordingly.
Cash and cash equivalents Counterparties are subject to regular credit analysis by the Manager and deposits can only be placed with counterparties that have been approved by JPMAMs Counterparty Risk Group.
The Board regularly reviews the counterparties used by the Manager.
