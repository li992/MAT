At 31 December 2018, EVRAZ plc is jointly controlled by a group of 3 shareholders: Greenleas International Holdings Limited BVI, Abiglaze Limited Cyprus and Crosland Global Limited Cyprus.
Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Preparation These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, as adopted by the European Union and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. International Financial Reporting Standards are issued by the International Accounting Standard Board IASB.
IFRSs that are mandatory for application as of 31 December 2018, but not adopted by the European Union, are not expected to have a significant impact on the Companys financial statements.
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as the directors believe there are no material uncertainties which could create a significant doubt as to the Companys ability to continue as a going concern in the foreseeable future.
Foreign Currency Transactions The presentation and functional currency of the Company is the US dollar.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in US dollars at the rate on the date of transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date.

Significant Accounting Policies continued Investments Investments in subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures are initially recorded at acquisition cost.
Writedowns are recorded if, in the opinion of the management, there is any impairment in value.
The initial cost of the investment in Evraz Group S. A. was measured at the carrying amount of the equity items of Evraz Group S. A. as a separate legal entity at the date of the reorganisation Note 3. Dividend income is recognised as revenue when the Companys right to receive the payment is established.
All purchases and sales of investments are recognised on the settlement date, which is the date when the investment is delivered to or by the Company.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method: any difference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption amount is recognised as interest expense over the period of the borrowings.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, and when it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Where the Company expects a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.
Financial Guarantee Liabilities Financial guarantee liabilities issued by the Company are those contracts that require a payment to be made to reimburse the incurred losses because the specified debtor or counterparty to a contract fails to make payments or to perform the agreed terms of a contract.
Financial guarantees issued by the Company are recognised initially as a liability at fair value, being equal to the estimated future cash inflows receivable from the subsidiaries under the guarantee agreements, with a corresponding recognition of the same amount as receivables from related parties.
Subsequently, the liability is amortised over the lives of the guarantees through the statement of comprehensive income, unless it is considered probable that a guarantee will be called, in which case it is measured at the value of the guaranteed amount payable, if higher.
