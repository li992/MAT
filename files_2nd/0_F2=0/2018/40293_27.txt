com Our Financials Notes to the Group and Company Financial Statements for the 52 weeks ending 28 April 2018 1.
Principal accounting policies a Basis of preparation The financial statements of Superdry Plc the Company and Superdry Plc and its subsidiary undertakings in the UK, the Republic of Ireland, Belgium, France, India, Hong Kong, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Scandinavia and the United States of America as detailed in note 20 the Group have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention as modified by fair values, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS adopted for use in the European Union, and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The current period 2018 is for the 52 weeks ended 28 April 2018 2017: 52 weeks ended 29 April 2017 2017.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies note 2.
These policies have been consistently applied to all periods presented unless otherwise stated.
The Group financial statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest hundred thousand except where indicated.
b Basis of consolidation Consolidated subsidiaries are those entities over which the Group has control.
The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
The results of any subsidiaries acquired during the period are included in the Group statement of comprehensive income from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries are changed when necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies adopted by the Group.
Under IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures.
The classification depends on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor, rather than the legal structure of the joint arrangement.
The Group determines, at each reporting date, whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in joint ventures is impaired.
If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the joint ventures and the carrying value and recognises the amount adjacent to share of profit or loss of joint venture in the statement of comprehensive income.
Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.
c Business combinations The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations of entities not under common control.
The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group.
The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
If this is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in profit or loss.
d Foreign currencies The consolidated financial information is presented in Sterling, which is the Companys functional and the Groups presentation currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Resulting exchange gains and losses are recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
Upon consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items of foreign operations are translated at the actual rate or average rate if not materially different.
Differences on translation are recognised in other comprehensive income.

Principal accounting policies continued e Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, or receivable, and represents amounts receivable for goods supplied, stated net of discounts, returns and value added taxes.
The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity and when specific criteria have been met for each of the Groups activities, as described below.
Own store revenue Own store revenue from the provision of sale of goods is recognised at the point of sale of a product to the customer.
Own store sales are settled in cash or by credit or payment card.
It is the Groups policy to sell its products to the customer with a right to exchange or full refund within 28 days.
Provisions are made for own store returns based on the expected level of returns, which in turn is based upon the historical rate of returns.
Concession revenue Concession revenues from the provision of sale of goods are recognised gross at the point of sale of a product to the customer: this is on the basis that the vendor acts as principal.
Concession revenues are settled in cash, by the concession grantors net of commissions or other fees payable.
It is the concessions policy to sell its products with a right to exchange within 28 days and a cash refund within 14 days.
Provisions are made for concession returns based on the expected level of returns, which in turn is based upon the historical rate of returns.
Ecommerce revenue Revenue from the provision of the sale of goods on the internet is recognised at the point that the risks and rewards of the inventory have passed to the customer, which is the point of dispatch.
Transactions are settled by credit card, payment card or PayPal.
Customers have a right to exchange or full refund within a range of 21 to 100 days, depending on the website the purchase is made from.
Provisions are made for Ecommerce credit notes based on the expected level of returns, which in turn is based upon the historical rate of returns.
Wholesale revenue Wholesale revenues from the sale of goods are recognised at the point that the risks and rewards of the inventory have passed to the customer, which depends on the specific terms and conditions of sales transactions and which are typically upon either dispatch or delivery.
Revenues are settled in cash, net of discounts.
Provisions are made for Wholesale credit notes based on the expected level of returns, which in turn is based upon the historical rate of returns.
f Finance income Finance income comprises interest receivable on funds invested.
Finance income is recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income using the effective interest method.
g Finance expenses Finance expenses comprise interest payable on interest-bearing loans and short-term borrowings.
Finance expenses are recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income using the effective interest method.
h Leasing and similar commitments Leases are accounted for as operating leases as the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor and the rental charges are charged to the Group statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Cash contributions Cash contributions from landlords are initially recognised as deferred income in the balance sheet at the point at which the recognition criteria in the lease are met.
They are credited to selling, general and administrative expenses in the Group statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease commencing from the opening date.
Cash contributions are not discounted.
Rent-free periods A deferred income liability is built up on the balance sheet during the rent-free period, which is then credited to the Group statement of comprehensive income over the life of the lease.
The effect is to recognise a reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses on a straight-line basis over the longer of the term of the lease, or from the property access date to the end of the lease.
Rent-free periods are not discounted.
Principal accounting policies continued h Leasing and similar commitments continued Lease premiums Lease premiums paid to landlords are initially recognised as a prepayment, and lease premiums paid to previous tenants are initially recognised as an intangible asset, in the balance sheet, at the point the recognition criteria in the lease are met, and debited to selling, general and administrative expenses in the Group statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease commencing from the opening date.
i Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation.
Cost includes the original purchase price and the costs attributable to bringing the asset into its working condition.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds received with the carrying amount and are recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write down the cost of the assets, less their estimated residual values, over their remaining useful economic lives as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years on a straight-line basis Leasehold improvements 5 10 years on a straight-line basis Furniture, fixtures and fittings 5 10 years on a straight-line basis Computer equipment 3 5 years on a straight-line basis Land is not depreciated.
Residual values and useful economic lives are reviewed annually and adjusted if appropriate.
j Impairment The carrying values of non-financial assets are tested annually to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows which are independent from other assets, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit CGU to which the asset belongs is estimated.
The recoverable amount of a non-financial asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell, and its value in use.
Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or CGU.
An impairment loss is recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income whenever the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss in a subsidiary consolidated under predecessor accounting note 1ab is recognised as a movement in the merger reserve and retained earnings in addition to recognising a loss on the statement of comprehensive income.
k Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are recognised initially at cost.
An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised outside goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Intangible assets with a finite life have no residual value and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives as follows: Trademarks 10 years Website and software 5 years Lease premiums Over the life of the lease on a straight-line basis Distribution agreements 6 23 years Trademarks comprise the external cost of registration and associated legal costs.
Website and software costs consists of externally incurred development costs for the Order Management System, Product Life Cycle Management System and Multi Warehouse Management System for regional distribution centres.
Lease premiums comprise the amount paid to the previous tenant to acquire the lease.
Distribution agreements comprise the fair value, at the date of acquisition, of distribution agreements acquired as part of a business combination.
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.
indd 113 26 07 2018 17:00:58 SUPERDRY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2018 Notes to the Group and Company Financial Statements 1.
Principal accounting policies continued l Investments Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at historical cost, less any provision for impairment.
Equity investments where the shareholding is less than 20% are accounted for as financial assets at fair value through the Group statement of comprehensive income.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value are recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income within other gains and losses.
The Group applies IFRS 11 to all joint arrangements.
Under IFRS 11, investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor.
The Group has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements and determined them to be joint ventures.
Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting after initially being recognised at cost in the consolidated balance sheet.
m Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at their fair value and re-measured at fair value at each period end.
Derivative financial instruments are categorised as held at fair value through the Group statement of comprehensive income.
The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
The Group has not applied hedge accounting.
Foreign forward exchange derivative gains and losses are recognised in other gains and losses net.
n Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
Cost comprises costs associated with the purchase and bringing of inventories to the distribution centres and is based on the weighted average principle.
Provisions are made for obsolescence, mark-downs and shrinkage.
o Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised at original invoice amount less impairment losses.
A provision for the impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due, according to the original terms.
Significant financial difficulties of the customer, probability that the customer will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable may be impaired.
The movement in the provision is recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
p Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity date of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts are offset against cash when a right of offset exists and the Group uses this right of offset.
For the purpose of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits, less overdrafts, which are repayable on demand.
q Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is more likely than not that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Provisions are discounted if the impact on the provision is deemed to be material.
r Employee benefit obligations Wages, salaries, payroll tax, paid annual leave and sick leave, bonuses, and non-monetary benefits are accrued in the year in which the associated services are rendered by employees of the Group.
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme for the benefit of its employees.
The Group pays contributions into an independently administered fund via a salary sacrifice arrangement.
The costs to the Group of providing these benefits are recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income and comprise the amount of contributions payable to the scheme in the year.
s Share based payments Group operated schemes The Group operates several equity settled share based compensation plans.
The fair value of the shares under such plans is recognised as an expense in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
Fair value is determined using the BlackScholes Option Pricing Model.
The amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of share incentives excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
Non-market vesting conditions are considered as part of the assumptions about the number of share incentives that are expected to vest.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of share incentives that are expected to vest.
The impact of the revision on original estimates, if any, is recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income, with a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.
Principal accounting policies continued t Share based payments Founder Share Plan The Founders of Superdry operate a share based compensation plan that awards both cash and shares.
For the purposes of IFRS 2 it is considered to be an equity settled share based compensation plan.
The Founder Share Plan see note 9 for further details falls within the scope of IFRS 2 despite the Group neither purchasing, nor issuing the shares, nor the cost of the cash being a Company expense.
Fair value is determined using the Monte Carlo Pricing Model.
The amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of share incentives, adjusted at the grant of each of share incentive for dilution assumptions.
These dilution assumptions are not revised after the grant of the share incentive.
u Long term loans receivable Long term loans are recognised on an amortised cost basis less any provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of long term loans is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover all amounts due, according to the original terms.
Significant financial difficulties and probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation are considered indicators that the long term loan may be impaired.
v Trade and other payables Trade and other payables, excluding lease incentives see note 1h, are non-interest bearing and are initially recognised at their fair value which approximates book value.
w Taxation The policy for current and deferred tax, when relevant, is as follows: tax on the profit or loss for the period will comprise current and deferred tax: current tax expense is calculated using the tax rates which have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years: deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes: the amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date: a deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised see note 22 : and deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
x Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability and deducted from equity at the balance sheet date only if they have been approved before or on the balance sheet date and not paid.
Interim dividends are recognised in the period they are paid.
y Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
The share capital represents the nominal value of shares that have been issued.
z Share premium The share premium account represents the excess of the issue price over the nominal value on ordinary shares issued, less incremental costs directly attributable to issue the new shares.
aa Retained earnings The retained earnings reflect the accumulated profits and losses of the Group.

Principal accounting policies continued ab Merger reserve and other reserves The consolidation of the subsidiaries acquired in advance of the Initial Public Offering in March 2010 C-Retail Limited, DKH Retail Limited, SuperGroup Concessions Limited, SuperGroup International Limited, SuperGroup Internet Limited and SuperGroup Retail Ireland Limited into the financial statements of Superdry Plc has been prepared under the principles of predecessor accounting, whereby an acquirer is not required to be identified, and all entities are included at their pre-combination carrying amounts.
This accounting treatment leads to differences on consolidation between consideration and fair value of the underlying net assets and this difference is included within equity as a merger reserve.
All subsequent business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting note 1c.
ac Segment reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision-Maker.
The Chief Operating Decision-Maker, which is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Executive Committee.
ad Cost of sales Cost of sales comprises movements between opening and closing inventories, purchases, carriage in, commissions payable, and other related expenses.
ae Exceptional and other items Non-underlying adjustments constitute exceptional and other items and are disclosed separately in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
In determining whether events or transactions are treated as exceptional and other items, management considers quantitative as well as qualitative factors such as the frequency or predictability of occurrence.
Examples of charges or credits meeting the above definition and which have been presented as exceptional and other items in the current and or prior years include: Exceptional items acquisitions disposals of significant businesses and investments: impact on deferred tax assets liabilities for changes in tax rates: business restructuring programmes: and asset impairment charges.
Other items the movement in the fair value of unrealised financial derivatives: and IFRS 2 charges in respect of Founder Share Plan FSP.
In the event that other items meet the criteria, which are applied consistently from year to year, they are also treated as exceptional and other items.
Further information about the determination of exceptional and other items in financial year 2018 is included in note 35.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying accounting policies The preparation of the financial statements requires judgements, estimates and assumptions to be made that affect the reported value of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.
The nature of estimation and judgement means that actual outcomes could differ from expectation.
Critical accounting estimates and assumptions Management consider that accounting estimates and assumptions made in relation to the following items have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial period.
Store impairments and onerous lease provisions Store assets as with other financial and non-financial assets are subject to impairment reviews based on whether current or future events and circumstances suggest that their recoverable amount may be less than their carrying value.
Recoverable amount is based on the higher of the value in use and fair value less costs to dispose.
Value in use is calculated from expected future cash flows using suitable discount rates and includes management assumptions and estimates of future performance.
There are nine stores being closely monitored for indicators of impairment.
During the period an impairment of fixed assets was made of 0.3m in aggregate in respect of these nine stores.
A 1% reduction in the sales growth per annum assumptions in the Groups long-term financial plan would result in a further impairment of fixed assets of 2.1m for these stores.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying accounting policies continued Critical accounting estimates and assumptions continued Store impairments and onerous lease provisions continued In addition, an impairment of the fixed assets in the Berlin Kranzler store of 5.0m was made during the period.
This impairment was based on estimates of performance over the remaining term of the lease.
Lease obligations are subject to onerous lease reviews based on whether the net present value of the future cash flows excluding rent are lower than the net present value of the future rent obligations within the lease.
An onerous lease provision of 2.2m was recognised during the period in relation to the Berlin Kranzler store based on assumptions relating to a sub-tenancy arrangement.
If the timing of the sub-tenancy is delayed by one year, this would result in an increase in the provision of 0.9m for the Berlin Kranzler store.
Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policies Management consider that judgments made in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies that could have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Group financial statements are as follows: Exceptional and other items Judgements are required as to whether items are disclosed as exceptional and other items, with consideration given to both quantitative as well as qualitative factors.
The following critical accounting estimates and judgements have been removed in financial year 2018, as management consider they are no longer key areas of uncertainty as they will not have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the amounts recognised in the Group financial statements: Provisions and Recognition of deferred tax assets for losses.
New accounting pronouncements New standards and interpretations issued but not yet effective At the balance sheet date there are a number of new standards and amendments to existing standards in issue but not yet effective including IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, which is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers, which is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, and IFRS 16 Leases, which is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
The Group has not early adopted any of these new standards or amendments to existing standards.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments supersedes IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, and will be effective in the Group financial statements for the 52 weeks ending 27 April 2019.
The standard will be applied retrospectively, with comparatives restated from the transition date of 30 April 2017.
The new standard introduces three key changes: a principles-based approach to the classification and measurement of financial instruments: an impairment model based on expected credit losses: and changes to hedge accounting to closer align it with the Groups underlying risk management.
The Group has concluded that adoption of this new standard will not have a material impact on either the Group statement of comprehensive income or the consolidated balance sheet.
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers supersedes IAS 18 Revenue, and will be effective in the Group financial statements for the 52 weeks ending 27 April 2019.
The new standard provides a principles-based single model for revenue recognition based on when identified performance obligations are satisfied, using a five-step approach.
The approach now focuses on the transfer of control rather than the transfer of risks and rewards, and applies to all contracts with customers, except those in the scope of other standards.
The Group does not expect there to be a material effect on revenue recognition or measurement as currently: Own store and concession revenue is recognised at the point of sale of a product: and Wholesale and Ecommerce revenue is recognised on either dispatch or delivery.
indd 117 26 07 2018 17:00:59 SUPERDRY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2018 Notes to the Group and Company Financial Statements 3.
New accounting pronouncements continued New standards and interpretations issued but not yet effective continued This is currently consistent with the passing of control under IFRS 15.
The standard will however require a balance sheet reclassification between current liabilities and current assets of the value of returned inventory, which forms part of the returns provision.
The Group considers there to be minimal judgement involved in assessing the timing of the transfer of control, and as such has concluded that adoption of this new standard will not have a material impact on either the Group statement of comprehensive income or the consolidated balance sheet.
IFRS 16 Leases replaces the current lease accounting requirements including IAS 17 Leases, and becomes effective for the accounting period ended 26 April 2020.
The standard will be applied retrospectively with comparatives restated from the transition date of 28 April 2018.
IFRS 16 requires all leases with exceptions for short-term leases and low value assets to be recognised on the balance sheet as right of use assets with corresponding liabilities.
As such, there will no longer be a distinction between operating leases and finance leases.
The Groups IFRS16 project team has made progress in terms of: identifying the leases and contracts that now qualify as leases: collating lease data required to support the impact assessment calculations: determining the appropriate discount rates to use: refining judgements on the treatment of lease options such as break points and renewals: and identifying changes to processes required for reporting under IFRS 16.
The Group expects there to be a material adjustment to the value of retained earnings, lease liabilities and right of use assets.
An associated finance charge and depreciation charge will replace the existing operating lease charge, and as a result there is expected to be an impact on operating profit in future periods.
There is also anticipated to be an impact on classifications within cash flows.
The work to determine the impact assessment of transition to IFRS 16 is anticipated to conclude over the next financial year.
As such, it is not currently considered practical to provide an estimate of the financial effect of transition until this has been finalised.
Other new standards and interpretations in issue, but not yet effective, which are not expected to have a material impact on the Group are: Annual improvements to IFRS: 2014 2016 Cycle: Amendment to IFRS 2 Share-based payment on clarifying share-based payment transactions: Amendment to IAS 40 Investment property transfers of investment property: Amendment to IAS 12 Income taxes on recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses: Amendment to IAS 7 Cash flow statements disclosure initiative: and IFRIC 22 Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration.
Segment information The Groups operating segments under IFRS 8 have been determined based on the reports reviewed by the Groups Chief Operating Decision-Maker Executive Committee members: the CODM.
The CODM assesses the performance of the operating segments based on profit before interest, before inter-segment royalties.
The CODM considers the business from a customer perspective only, being Retail and Wholesale.
The CODM reviews the balance sheet at a Group level.
No separate balance sheet measures are provided between the Retail and Wholesale segments.
The CODM receives information, reviews the performance of the business, allocates resources and approves budgets for two operating segments, and therefore information is disclosed in respect of the following two segments: Retail principal activities comprise the operation of UK, Republic of Ireland, European and US stores, concessions and all internet sites.
Revenue is derived from the sale to individual consumers of own brand clothing, footwear and accessories.
Wholesale principal activities comprise the ownership of brands, wholesale distribution of own brand products clothing, footwear and accessories worldwide and trade sales.
Segment results and assets include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
The Group reports and manages central functions separately to the Retail and Wholesale operations, which includes design, finance, HR, IT, legal, merchandising, property, sourcing and the goodwill and intangibles arising on consolidation.
The revenue from external parties reported to the CODM is measured in a manner consistent with that of the IFRS financial statements.
Inter-segment royalties, transfers or transactions entered into under a cost plus pricing structure are not reflected in the performance of each business segment.

The store has not achieved expected paybacks due to sales underperformance.
While initially believed to be linked to the impact on footfall from a number of terror incidents actual and threatened in the immediate period after the store commenced trading, this underperformance has continued.
Discount rates are derived from the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 7.3% 2017:10.5%.
The discount rate used in calculating the value in use is the pre-tax weighted cost of capital of 9.2% 2017:13.6%.
An impairment of fixed assets has therefore been made on the basis that their recoverable amount is less than their carrying value.
The impairment is split as follows: m Leasehold improvements 4.6 Fixtures and fittings 0.4 Total 5.0 In addition, an onerous lease provision of 2.2m has been recognised, reflecting the shortfall in the net present value of the future cash flows compared to the net present value of the future rent obligations within the lease.
This provision will be reviewed at the end of each reporting period.

Deferred tax exceptional The exceptional tax charge of 1.2m is as a result of the change in the US federal corporation tax rate from 35% to 21% and the subsequent impact on deferred tax assets liabilities.
The prior year exceptional tax charge of 0.9m was a result of the change in the UK corporation tax rate from 18% to 17% and the subsequent impact on deferred tax assets liabilities.

Share based Long-Term Incentive Plans LTIP Equity settled awards are granted to employees in the form of share awards.
No consideration is payable by the employees when share awards vest, other than the nominal value of 5p per share.
The vesting period is three years.
Share awards will also expire if the employee leaves the Group prior to the exercise or vesting date subject to the discretionary powers of the Remuneration Committee.
Performance Share Plan The award of shares is made under the Superdry Performance Share Plan PSP.
Shares have no value to the participant at the grant date, but subject to the satisfaction of earnings per share and total shareholder return performance targets can convert and give participants the right to be granted nil-cost shares other than the nominal value of 5p per share at the end of the performance period.
The movement in the number of share awards outstanding is as follows: Group & Company 2018 2017 Number of Number of shares shares At start of the period 1,012,363 875,930 Granted 402,580 334,513 Exercised 215,428 103,457 Forfeited 107,557 94,623 Cancelled 141,392 Total number of outstanding share awards at end of the period 950,566 1,012,363 None of the share awards were exercisable at the period end date 2017: nil.

Share based Long-Term Incentive Plans LTIP continued Performance Share Plan continued The terms and conditions of the award of shares granted under the PSP during the year are as follows: Group & Company Number of Vesting Grant date Type of award shares period August 2017 Share awards 358,947 3 years April 2018 Share awards 43,633 3 years The fair value of the shares awarded at the grant date during the year is 5.3m 2017: 4.9m.
The fair value of the award is determined using a BlackScholes pricing model.
A charge of 3.7m 2017: charge of 2.2m has been recorded in the Group statement of comprehensive income during the year.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the period was 1,720p.
The options outstanding at 28 April 2018 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 16 months: these shares have an exercise price of 5p.
The inputs into the BlackScholes pricing model are as follows: expected volatility of 38.3%: expected term of three years: risk free rate of 0.34%: and an expected dividend yield of nil.
Save As You Earn A Save As You Earn scheme is operated by the Group.
A charge of 0.2m 2017: charge of 0.1m has been recorded in the Group statement of comprehensive income during the year.
Buy As You Earn A Buy As You Earn scheme is operated by the Group which commenced in August 2016.
In the year 4,240 shares have been purchased under the scheme.
The charge to the Group statement of comprehensive income is highly immaterial and therefore has not been accounted for.
Other schemes Share options were issued in the year as part of bonus reward packages for certain members of senior management.
These options are subject to leavers provisions and the exercise period is three years in addition to the year to which the bonus relates.
The share award has therefore been spread over four years.
The charge to the Group statement of comprehensive income in financial year 2018 for these awards is 0.1m 2017: 0.1m.
Founder Share Plan On 12 September 2017, the Founders of Superdry the Founders, Julian Dunkerton and James Holder, announced the launch of a long-term incentive scheme, the Founder Share Plan FSP under which they will share their wealth with employees of the Group.
The FSP will run from 1 October 2017 to 30 September 2020.
At the conclusion of the scheme, the Founders will transfer into a fund 20% of their gain from any increase in the Groups share price over a threshold of 18.
The gain to be transferred into the fund will be calculated using the market value of the shares calculated as the average price of a Superdry Plc share over the 20 dealing days prior to the maturity date 30 September 2020.
The proceeds from this fund will be shared across the Superdry colleague base worldwide, including those who work part-time.
Each 5 increase in the share price over the 18 threshold would see the Founders putting 30m into the fund.
Awards will be made to employees in shares or an equivalent cash award if considered more appropriate.
The vesting period for the awards differs depending on the seniority of the colleagues in question.
To be eligible for the award, employees need to remain in employment on the vesting date, details of which are as follows: Share settled element Senior management 50% - 31 January 2021 50% - 31 January 2022 Cash and share settled elements All other colleagues 50% - 31 January 2021 50% - 31 July 2021 The award will be settled in full by the Founders with no cost to the Group and hence in accordance with IFRS 2 has been accounted for as an equity settled share based payment scheme.
The fair value of the award is determined using a Monte Carlo pricing model.
The share based payment charge associated with the FSP will accrue over five financial periods, up until financial year 2022.
A charge of 2.1m has been recorded in the Group statement of comprehensive income during the year.
The total fair value of the entire outstanding share awards not including any future share award issues, taking into consideration managements estimate of the share awards meeting the vesting conditions and achieving the performance targets, is 11.4m.
The number of share awards granted in the period is 6,879,904.
The number still in issue as at 28 April 2018 is 5,847,510.
The weighted average remaining contractual life of the outstanding options as at 28 April 2018 is 27 months, these options have a nil exercise price.

The tax credit on exceptional and other items is 7.3m 2017: 0.4m credit and the exceptional tax charge in relation to tax rate changes is 1.2m 2017: 0.9m charge, so the net position being disclosed as a non-underlying tax charge in the period is 6.1m 2017: 0.5m charge.
The exceptional tax charge of 1.2m is as a result of the change in the US Federal tax rate from 35% to 21% and the subsequent impact on deferred tax assets liabilities.
The exceptional tax charge of 0.9m in the prior period is as a result of the change in the UK corporation tax rate from 18% to 17% and the subsequent impact on deferred tax assets liabilities.
Factors affecting the tax expense for the period are as follows: Group 2018 2017 m m Profit before tax 65.3 84.8 Profit multiplied by the standard rate in the UK 19.0% 2017: 19.9% 12.4 16.9 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 1.2 1.2 Non-deductible joint venture loss 0.6 0.5 Overseas tax differentials 1.6 2.4 Deferred tax asset movements on partially recognised tax losses 1.4 1.5 Adjustment in respect of prior periods 0.6 0.2 Total tax expense excluding exceptional items 13.4 17.9 Exceptional tax expense 1.2 0.9 Total tax expense including exceptional items 14.6 18.8 The Groups tax expense on underlying profit of 20.7m represents an effective tax rate of 21.3% for the period ended 28 April 2018.
The Groups underlying effective tax rate of 21.3% is higher than the statutory rate of 19.0%, primarily due to the deferred tax asset movements on partially recognised losses, depreciation and amortisation on non-qualifying assets, non-allowable expenses and the nondeductibility of JV loss in the period.
In addition to the above tax charged to the Group comprehensive income statement, there is a tax charge to equity of 0.1m 2017: nil in respect of deferred tax relating to employee share schemes.

Included within note 6 is an exceptional tax charge of 1.2m which relates to the impact of the tax rate change on the deferred asset held in respect of tax losses.
During the prior period, the 17% rate for UK corporation tax effective from 1 April 2020 was substantively enacted.
Included within note 6 is an exceptional tax charge of 0.9m, of which 0.6m relates to the impact of the tax rate change on goodwill and intangibles.
The remainder of 0.3m tax charge is included within other movements such as depreciation in excess of capital allowances and temporary differences.

An impairment test is a comparison of the carrying value of assets of a business or cash-generating unit CGU to their recoverable amount.
The Group has defined its CGUs as Retail and Wholesale.
Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment results.
The recoverable amounts in financial year 2018 were measured based on post-tax value in use 2017: based on post-tax value in use.
This methodology is considered reasonable given the significant levels of headroom noted from this assessment.
Detailed forecasts for the next five years have been used which are based on approved annual budgets and strategic projections representing the best estimate of future performance.
Key assumptions In determining the recoverable amount it is necessary to make a series of assumptions to estimate the present value of future cash flows.
In each case, these key assumptions have been made by management reflecting past experience and are consistent with relevant external sources of information.
Discount rates Discount rates are derived from the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 7.3% 2017:10.5%.
The pre-tax weighted cost of capital is 9.2% 2017:13.6%.
indd 133 26 07 2018 17:01:01 SUPERDRY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2018 Notes to the Group and Company Financial Statements 19.
Intangible assets continued Operating cash flows The main assumptions, which are derived from past experience and external information, within the forecast operating cash flows, include the achievement of future sales prices, volumes, raw material input costs and the level of ongoing capital expenditure over a five year period.
Long-term growth rates To forecast beyond the five years, a long-term average growth rate of 2% 2017: 2% has been used.
Goodwill sensitivity analysis The results of the Groups impairment tests are dependent on estimates made by management, particularly in relation to the key assumptions described above.
A sensitivity analysis as to potential changes in key assumptions has therefore been performed.
The present values of the future cash flows of the Retail and Wholesale CGUs are significant and are insensitive to any changes to reasonably possible changes to key assumptions.

The future growth prospects of the US onshore business are based on estimates over a five year time frame.
These growth estimates include a new store opening programme and the developments of the wholesale business in line with the Board approved Group long-term financial plan.
The deferred tax asset recognised in the financial statements in respect of US tax losses is 7.5m.
A 1.0% reduction in the EBIT growth assumptions would reduce the deferred tax asset recognised by 0.2m.
US tax losses are recognised at a rate of 26.5%, being the federal rate of 21.0% and a blended state tax rate of 5.5%.
The US federal tax reforms that came into force on 1 January 2018 included a number of changes to US federal tax law.
The reduction in the federal tax rate has reduced the value of the brought forward deferred tax asset in respect of US tax losses by 1.2m.
The Group does not consider that any of the other law changes will have a material impact on the Group in the medium term.

Financial risk management The Companys and Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including: market risk including foreign currency risk and cash flow interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures.
Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a Group basis through a shared service centre based in Cheltenham.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, as well as credit exposures to Wholesale and to a lesser extent Retail customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
For Wholesale customers, management assesses the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors.
The Group mitigates risk in certain markets or with customers considered higher risk with payments in advance, accelerated and bank guarantees, as well as adopting credit insurance where appropriate.
Sales to Retail customers are settled in cash, major credit cards or by PayPal.
The Group regularly monitors its exposure to bad debts in order to minimise exposure.
Credit risk from cash and cash equivalents is managed via banking with well-established banks with a strong credit rating.
Foreign currency risk The Groups foreign currency exposure arises from: transactions sales purchases denominated in foreign currencies: monetary items mainly cash receivables and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies: and investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation.
The Group is mainly exposed to US Dollar and Euro currency risks.
The exposure to foreign exchange risk within each company is monitored and managed at Group level.
The Groups policy on foreign currency risk is to economic hedge a portion of foreign exchange risk associated with forecast overseas transactions, and transactions and monetary items denominated in foreign currencies.
The Groups approach is to hedge the risk of changes in the relevant spot exchange rate.
The Group uses forward contracts to hedge foreign exchange risk.
As at 28 April 2018 and 29 April 2017, the Group had entered into a number of foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge part of the aforementioned translation risk.
Any remaining amount remains unhedged.
Forward exchange contracts have not been formally designated as hedges and consequently no hedge accounting has been applied.
Forward exchange contracts are carried at fair value.
Currency exposure arising from the net assets of the Groups foreign operations are not hedged.
Financial risk management continued At 28 April 2018, if the currency had weakened strengthened by 10% against both the US Dollar and Euro with all other variables held constant, profit for the period would have been 7.3m 2017: 6.1m higher lower, mainly as a result of foreign exchange gains losses on translation of US Dollar Euro trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and trade payables.
The figure of 10% used for sensitivity analysis has been chosen because it represents a range of reasonably probable fluctuations in exchange rates.
The Groups foreign currency exposure is as follows: Group 2018 2017 US Dollar Euro US Dollar Euro m m m m Financial assets Trade receivables 0.2 51.0 1.1 32.1 Cash and cash equivalents 16.6 28.6 Financial assets 16.8 79.6 1.1 32.1 Financial liabilities Trade payables 9.2 12.9 5.6 7.8 Provisions 1.6 Cash and cash equivalents 5.9 74.5 Financial liabilities 9.2 14.5 11.5 82.3 Net exposure 7.6 65.1 10.4 50.2 The US Dollar and Euro overdrafts form part of an offset arrangement and as such, each currency is netted off against other cash balances in the same currency and is not recognised as an overdraft in its own right.
Cash flow interest rate risk The Group has financial assets and liabilities which are exposed to changes in market interest rates.
Changes in interest rates impact primarily on deposits, loans and borrowings by changing their future cash flows variable rate.
Management does not currently have a formal policy of determining how much of the Groups exposure should be at fixed or variable rates and the Group does not use hedging instruments to minimise its exposure.
However, at the time of taking out new loans or borrowings, management uses its judgement to determine whether it believes that a fixed or variable rate would be more favourable for the Group over the expected period until maturity.
Sensitivity analysis has not been provided due to the low level of loans and borrowings within the Group.
The Groups significant interest-bearing assets and liabilities are disclosed in notes 25 and 26.
Liquidity risk Cash flow forecasting is performed on a Group basis by the monitoring of rolling forecasts of the Groups liquidity requirements to ensure that it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs.
The maturity profile of the Groups liabilities is analysed in notes 26 and 27.

Alternative performance measures Introduction The Directors assess the performance of the Group using a variety of performance measures, some are IFRS, and some are adjusted and therefore termed non-GAAP measures or Alternative Performance Measures APMs.
The Directors principally discuss the Groups results on an underlying basis.
The APMs used in the financial statements are: Global Brand revenue, underlying gross profit and margin, underlying operating profit and margin, underlying profit before tax, underlying tax expense, underlying profit before tax for core operations, underlying effective tax rate, underlying earnings per share, operating trading loss - China and net cash debt.
A reconciliation from these non-GAAP measures to the nearest measure prepared in accordance with IFRS is presented below.
There have been no changes in definitions from the prior period.
Global Brand revenue is a new measure in the period, further details are below.
Exceptional and other items The Groups statement of comprehensive income and segmental analysis separately identify trading results before exceptional and other items.
The Directors believe that presentation of the Groups results in this way is an alternative analysis of the Groups financial performance, as exceptional and other items are identified by virtue of their size, nature or incidence.
This presentation is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and reported to the Board and the Executive Committee and assists in providing a relevant analysis of the trading results of the Group.
Examples of charges or credits meeting the above definition and which have been presented as exceptional and other items in the current and or prior years include: Exceptional items Acquisitions disposals of significant businesses and investments: Impact on deferred tax assets liabilities for changes in tax rates: Business restructuring programmes: and Asset impairment charges and onerous lease provisions.
Other items The movement in the fair value of unrealised financial derivatives: and IFRS 2 charges in respect of Founder Share Plan FSP.

Alternative performance measures continued Exceptional and other items in this period The following items have been included within exceptional and other items for the period ended 28 April 2018: Fair value re-measurement of foreign exchange contracts Financial years 2018 and 2017 item The fair value of unrealised financial derivatives is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and unrealised losses gains are recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
The Directors consider unrealised losses gains to be exceptional and other items due to both their size and nature.
The size of the movement on the fair value of the contracts is dependent in particular on the spot foreign exchange rate at the balance sheet date and an assessment of future foreign exchange volatility applied to the relevant contract currencies, as such the size of the movements can be substantial.
The unrealised foreign exchange contracts have been entered into in order to achieve an economic hedge against future payments and receipts and are not a reflection of historical performance.
The Directors do not therefore consider these unrealised losses gains to be a reflection of the trading performance in the period.
When contracts mature, the profit or loss is reflected in underlying profit before tax.
Store asset impairment and onerous lease provision - Berlin Kranzler new item in financial year 2018 The Berlin Kranzler store was approved by the Board on 21 May 2015 and opened on 4 December 2016.
An impairment of 5.0m of fixed assets has therefore been made on the basis their recoverable amount is less than their carrying value.
In addition, an onerous lease provision of 2.2m has been recognised, reflecting the shortfall in the net present value of the future cash flows compared to the net present value of the future rent obligations within the lease.
The Directors consider the store impairment and onerous lease provision to be an exceptional and other item due to the materiality of the charge.
In addition, the Directors believe the charge, while considered significant, is not a reflection of the underlying trading performance in the period.
Please see note 6 for further details.
Buy-out of Netherlands agent new item in financial year 2018 On 23 November 2017, Superdry signed an agreement to terminate the licence granted in 2009 to Portare B. V. the Groups Netherlands licence partner.
The Directors consider the termination payment to be an exceptional and other item due to the size and one-off nature of the charge.
Founder Share Plan FSP IFRS 2 charge new item in financial year 2018 While there are no cost or cash implications for the Group, the Founder Share Plan FSP falls within the scope of IFRS 2.
The Group has included the IFRS 2 charge and related deferred tax movement in relation to the FSP within exceptional and other items for the current and subsequent periods.
The Directors consider the plan to be one-off in nature and unusual in that the share awards are being funded exclusively by the Founders.
The full year charge for FY19, FY20 and FY21 has been estimated between 3m 5m each period.
While the charge is spread over a number of financial years, the plan is a one-time scheme.
Accordingly the IFRS 2 charge in respect of the FSP is considered to be an exceptional and other item due to the size, nature and incidence of the scheme.
There are no known recent examples within quoted companies of incentive arrangements operating in a similar way to the FSP.
While unusual in terms of size, the plan is also unusual with regard to its treatment in what is essentially a personal arrangement, with no net cost or cash and minimal administrative burden to the Company.
There are no other adjustments anticipated in respect of the scheme other than the IFRS 2 charge.
Therefore the Directors consider the charge to be significant in terms of its potential influence on the readers interpretation of the Groups financial performance and not a reflection of the trading performance in the period.
See note 9 for further details of the FSP.
Global Brand revenue Global Brand revenue represents the equivalent value of Group revenue at the values paid by consumers.
It is calculated by uplifting all revenues by applicable sales tax rates and uplifting revenues in our Wholesale division by a factor representing the applicable mark up from wholesale to consumer prices.
In the opinion of the Directors, uplifting revenues in this way to show Global Brand revenue is useful to understand the growth of the brand, offering a consistent measure despite the variances that result from multiple routes to market.
Alternative performance measures continued Global Brand revenue continued A reconciliation from reported revenue to Global Brand revenue is set out below: 2018 2017 m m Reported revenue 872.0 752.0 Uplift to reflect values paid by consumers 732.2 561.7 Global Brand revenue 1,604.2 1,313.7 Underlying gross profit and margin In the opinion of the Directors, underlying gross profit and margin are measures which seek to reflect the underlying performance of the Group that will contribute to long-term sustainable profitable growth.
It is a key internal management metric for assessing segmental performance.
As such, they exclude the impact of exceptional and other items.

Alternative performance measures continued Underlying profit before tax In the opinion of the Directors, underlying profit before tax is a measure which seeks to reflect the underlying performance of the Group that will contribute to long-term sustainable profitable growth.
The Directors consider this to be an important measure of Group performance and is consistent with how the business performance is reported to and assessed by the Board and the Executive Committee.
This is a measure used within the Groups incentive plans.
Refer to the Remuneration Report on page 78 for explanation of why this measure is used within incentive plans.
As such, underlying profit before tax excludes the impact of exceptional and other items.
A reconciliation from profit before tax, the most directly comparable IFRS measures, to the underlying profit before tax, is set out below.
2018 2017 m m Profit before tax 65.3 84.8 Exceptional and other items 31.7 2.2 Underlying profit before tax 97.0 87.0 Underlying profit before tax for core operations In the opinion of the Directors, underlying profit before tax for core operations is a useful measure to review the performance of the Group as it excludes those costs that will be non-recurring in the longterm.
These excluded costs are exceptional and other items, initial trading losses in development markets and distribution centre migration costs.
A reconciliation from profit before tax, the most directly comparable IFRS measures, to profit before tax for core operations, is set out below.
2018 2017 m m Profit before tax 65.3 84.8 Exceptional and other items 31.7 2.2 Underlying profit before tax 97.0 87.0 Initial trading losses in development markets 5.1 2.2 Distribution centre migration costs 0.5 2.1 Underlying profit before tax for core operations 102.6 91.3 Underlying tax expense and underlying effective tax rate In the opinion of the Directors, underlying tax expense is the total tax charge for the Group excluding the tax impact of exceptional and other items.
Correspondingly, the underlying effective tax rate is the underlying tax expense divided by the underlying profit before tax.
These measures are an indicator of the ongoing tax rate of the Group.
A reconciliation from tax expense, the most directly comparable IFRS measures, to the underlying tax expense, is set out below: 2018 2017 m m Underlying profit before tax 97.0 87.0 Tax expense 14.6 18.8 Exceptional and other items tax impact of items included in profit before tax 7.3 0.4 Exceptional and other items impact on deferred tax assets liabilities for changes in tax rates 1.2 0.9 Underlying tax expense 20.7 18.3 Underlying effective tax rate 21.3% 21.0% 152 26056 26 July 2018 5:00 PM Proof 2 SuperGroup Back Section.
Alternative performance measures continued Underlying earnings per share In the opinion of the Directors, underlying earnings per share is calculated using basic earnings, adjusted to exclude exceptional and other items net of current and deferred tax.
A reconciliation from the basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share, the most directly comparable IFRS measures, to underlying basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share, is set out below: 2018 2017 m m Underlying profit before tax 97.0 87.0 Underlying tax expense 20.7 18.3 Underlying profit after tax 76.3 68.7 Profit after tax 50.7 66.0 Basic Earnings per share pence 62.2 81.2 Underlying basic earnings per share pence 93.6 84.5 2018 2017 Diluted Earnings per share pence 61.9 80.7 Underlying diluted earnings per share pence 93.1 84.0 Weighted average number of shares basis 81,510,921 81,303,378 Weighted average number of shares diluted 81,956,045 81,751,539 Operating trading loss China The operating trading loss in respect of China represents the net impact of the joint venture on Group profit after tax, taking into account licence fee income from the joint venture, which is then offset against the share in the joint venture loss.
The Directors believe this is an important indicator of performance of this development market.

It is the total of all short and long term loans and borrowings, less cash and cash equivalents.
The Group is in a net cash position at 28 April 2018.
