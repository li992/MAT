Both valuations reflect the level of policyholder benefits including guaranteed benefits and discretionary bonuses and associated charges, together with management actions in response to emerging investment and fund solvency conditions.
The increase in the cost of time value of guarantees for Asia operations from 186 million at 31 December 2017 to 981 million at 31 December 2018 reflects the interaction between these effects on the two valuations at the respective level of interest rates and equity markets, as well as growth in the business over the year.
The increase in the cost of time value of guarantees for the US operations from 650 million at 31 December 2017 to 1,446 million at 31 December 2018 primarily reflects the reduction in US equity markets during the fourth quarter of 2018. ii In June 2018, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC formally approved changes to RBC capital factors that reflected the December 2017 US tax reform.
The 2018 EEV results reflect these changes, with a resulting increase in required capital and a corresponding reduction in free surplus of 165 million.
