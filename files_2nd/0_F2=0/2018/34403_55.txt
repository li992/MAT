British Telecommunications plc and certain of its subsidiaries act as a funder and deposit taker for cash related transactions for both its parent and ultimate parent company.
The loan arrangements described below with these companies reflect this.
Cash transactions usually arise where the parent and ultimate parent company are required to meet their external payment obligations or receive amounts from third parties.
These principally relate to the payment of dividends, the buyback of shares, the exercise of share options and the issuance of ordinary shares.
Transactions between the ultimate parent company, parent company and the group are settled on both a cash and non-cash basis through these loan accounts depending on the nature of the transaction.
In 2001 02 the group demerged its former mobile phone business and as a result BT Group plc became the listed ultimate parent company of the remaining group.
The demerger steps resulted in the formation of an intermediary holding company, BT Group Investments Limited, between BT Group plc and British Telecommunications plc.
This intermediary company held an investment of 18.5bn in British Telecommunications plc which was funded by an intercompany loan facility with British Telecommunications plc.
No dividend was declared in relation to the year ended 31 March 2017 and therefore there was no settlement in the year ended 31 March 2018 31 March 2017: 2,350m.
A dividend of 2,500m has been declared in relation to the year ended 31 March 2018.
This was declared after 31 March 2018 so no liability amount owed to parent company is recorded in these financial statements.
See note 10 and the group statement of changes in equity.
The loan facilities with both the parent company and ultimate parent company accrue interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 102.5 basis points, and are subject to an overall maximum of 25bn and 10bn respectively.
The parent company currently finances its obligations on the loan as they fall due through dividends paid by the company.
In 2015 16 the ultimate parent company of the group raised 1.0bn from an equity placing and entered into an additional intercompany loan agreement with British Telecommunications plc for this amount.
This amount was raised to support BT Group plcs planned acquisition of EE.
