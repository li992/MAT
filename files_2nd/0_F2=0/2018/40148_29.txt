We communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any indications of non-compliance throughout the audit.
The potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably.

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the revaluation of certain properties, derivative financial instruments, the convertible bond and the defined benefit section of the Groups pension scheme.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The directors have considered the factors likely to affect the future development, performance and position of the Group and reviewed the current financial position of the Group, including its joint ventures and associates.
This review included an assessment of future funding requirements, valuation projections and the ability of the Group to meet covenants on its existing borrowing facilities, taking into consideration the ability of the Group to robustly defend the short-term impacts of a hard Brexit.
As a result of this review, the directors believe that the Group has adequate resources to fund its operations for the foreseeable future and so have determined that it remains appropriate for the financial statements to be prepared on a going concern basis.
Further detail is contained in the going concern statement on page 117 and in the viability statement on page 65.
In the current year the Group has adopted: Amendments to IAS 7 Disclosure Initiative Amendments to IAS 12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses Amendments to IAS 40 Transfers of Investment Property Amendments to IFRSs Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014 2016 Cycle The adoption of the amendments to IAS 7 Disclosure Initiative has resulted in a reconciliation of liabilities arising from financing activities being disclosed in note 15d to the Group financial statements.
The adoption of the amendments to IAS 40 Transfers to Investment Property has resulted in the Group changing its accounting policy for transferring inventories to investment properties.
Previously these transfers occurred on commencement of an operating lease and now they occur when a change in use is evidenced, for example by the inception of an operating lease.
This amendment has been applied prospectively from 1 December 2017 as it was not considered to be possible to apply this retrospectively without the use of hindsight.
The impact of adopting these amendments to IAS 40 has been to increase investment properties by 25.1m, reduce inventories by 19.5m, increase development profits by 5.6m and increase the taxation charge and liability by 1.1m.
This has resulted in increases of 4.5m in profit for the year, 2.0p in basic earnings per share and 1.8p in diluted earnings per share.
The adoption of the other amendments above has had no material impact to the Groups financial statements.
The Companys functional currency together with that of all of its subsidiaries and the presentation currency for the Group is pounds sterling and its principal EU IFRS accounting policies are set out below.
Basis of consolidation The Groups financial statements consolidate the financial statements of St. Modwen Properties PLC and the entities it controls.
Control comprises exposure, or rights, to variable returns, the power to direct the relevant activities of the investee and the investors ability to use its power over the investee to affect the returns.
This is achieved through direct or indirect ownership of voting rights or by contractual agreement.
A list of the entities controlled is given in note C to the Company financial statements.
All entities are consolidated from the date on which the Company obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expense are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets that are not held by the Group and are presented separately within equity in the Group balance sheet.
Interests in joint arrangements Arrangements under which the Group has contractually agreed to share control with another party or parties are assessed to determine whether they represent joint ventures or joint operations.
Joint arrangements are classified as joint ventures where the parties have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.
Should the parties have rights to each of the assets and obligations for each of the liabilities relating to the arrangement they would instead be classified as joint operations.
Currently, all arrangements where the Group has contractually agreed to share control have been determined to be joint ventures.
The Group recognises its interests in joint ventures using the equity method of accounting.
Under the equity method, the interest in the joint venture is carried in the Group balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of its net assets, less distributions received and less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
The Group income statement reflects the Groups share of the joint ventures results after interest and tax.
Financial statements of joint ventures are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies used into line with those of the Group.
The Group statement of comprehensive income reflects the Groups share of any income and expense recognised by the joint venture entities outside the Group income statement.
St. Modwen Properties PLC 132 Annual report and financial statements 2018 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Additional information Interests in associates The Groups interests in its associates, being those entities over which it has significant influence and which are neither subsidiaries nor joint arrangements, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, as described above.
Investment properties Investment properties, being freehold and leasehold properties held to earn rental income, for capital appreciation and or for undetermined future use, together with land options where the land is for an undetermined future use, are carried at fair value following initial recognition at the present value of the consideration payable.
To establish fair value, investment properties are independently valued on the basis of market value.
Any surplus or deficit arising is recognised in the Group income statement for the year.
Investment properties are not depreciated.
Once classified as an investment property, a property remains in this category until development with a view to sale commences, at which point the asset is transferred to inventories at current valuation.
Where an investment property is being redeveloped for continued use as an investment property, the property remains within investment property and any movement in valuation is recognised in the Group income statement.
Capital expenditure, including capitalised interest on qualifying assets and labour costs where applicable, that is directly attributable to the redevelopment or refurbishment of investment property, up to the point of it being completed for its intended use, is included in the carrying value of the property.
Investment property disposals are recognised on completion.
Profits and losses arising are recognised through the Group income statement and the profit or loss on disposal is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset.
Inventories Inventories principally comprise properties previously developed and held for sale, properties under construction with a view to sale and land under option with a view to future sale.
All inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises land, direct materials and, where applicable, capitalised interest on qualifying assets and direct labour costs that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
When inventory includes a transfer from investment properties, cost is recorded as the book value at the date of transfer.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less any further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
Inventory is transferred to investment properties only when the asset meets the definition of an investment property and there is evidence of a change in use, for example, the inception of an operating lease.
Property, plant and equipment and intangibles Operating property, plant and equipment Operating property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Such cost includes the purchase price and costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended.
Depreciation is provided on all operating property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset evenly over its expected useful life as follows: leasehold operating properties over the shorter of the lease term and 25 years: office fit out and equipment over three to 10 years: and plant and equipment over two to five years.
Owner-occupied property Owner-occupied property is held at fair value following initial recognition at the present value of the consideration payable or the transfer value from investment properties.
To establish fair value, owner-occupied property is independently valued on the basis of market value.
Any surplus or deficit arising is recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income for the year within a separate revaluation reserve.
Any deficits in excess of the balance within this revaluation reserve are recognised in the Group income statement.
Intangibles Intangibles are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Such cost includes the purchase price and costs directly attributable to the asset.
Amortisation is provided on all intangibles at rates calculated to write off the cost of each asset evenly over its expected useful life as follows: software over the software licence term: and other intangibles over two to five years.
