The Group accounts for the year ended 31 March 2018 are presented in sterling and rounded to 0.1 million.
They are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, modified by the revaluation of retirement benefit obligations and certain financial assets and liabilities including derivative financial instruments as explained in the relevant note.
The principal accounting policies have been consistently applied unless otherwise stated.
Basis of consolidation The Group accounts comprise the results, assets and liabilities of the Company and all its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and include the Employee Benefit Trust EBT and the Groups interest in a joint venture.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company.
The joint venture is accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Intra-group transactions and balances are eliminated in preparing the Group accounts and no profit or loss is recognised on intra-group transactions.
Unrealised gains or losses arising from transactions with the joint venture are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the entity.
Estimates and judgements The preparation of accounts in conformity with IFRS requires the Group to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
Except for judgements involved in estimations, no judgements have been made in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies that have had a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the accounts.
The significant estimates made in preparing the accounts were in relation to retirement benefit obligations Note 9, inventories Note 17, and uncertain tax positions Note 10.
Further details on the application of these estimates can be found in the relevant notes.
The Group is also required to make estimates in the review of intangibles and other assets for impairment.
Further details are provided in Note 13.
Actual results in the longer term may differ from these estimates.
Foreign currency Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated at the rate ruling at that date and the gains and losses on translation are recognised in operating profit.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated at the rate ruling at the date the fair value was determined.
Translation of foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The income statement and cash flows of foreign operations are translated at the average rate for the period.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of foreign operations, and of related qualifying hedges, are taken to other comprehensive income.
They are reclassified to the income statement upon disposal of the net investment.
The Group elected under IFRS 1 on transition to IFRS to set the cumulative translation differences balance at 1 April 2004 to nil.

There was no material impact on the reported results or financial position of the Group.
Standards or interpretations issued but not yet applied The following standards and interpretations have been issued but are not yet applicable.
The Group does not consider that any other standards or interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, but not yet applicable, will have a significant impact on the accounts.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9 replaces the existing guidance in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
IFRS 9 includes revised guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments, impairment on financial assets and new general hedge accounting requirements plus expanded disclosures.
The Group will apply IFRS 9 retrospectively from 1 April 2018, with the practical expedients permitted under the standard.
Comparatives for 2018 will not be restated and the impact will be adjusted in opening retained earnings as of 1 April 2018.
Under the new standard, the assessment of impairment of the Groups trade receivables will change from an incurred loss model to an expected loss model, which is not expected to have a material effect on the level of impairment of trade receivables.
There are no other changes that impact the Groups accounting for financial instruments or hedging.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognised.
The standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognised when control of goods or services transfers to the customer.
The Group has performed an impact assessment and does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on the Groups results but there will be an increase in disclosures.
The Group will adopt IFRS 15 on 1 April 2018 using the modified retrospective approach, comparatives will not be restated and the cumulative impact will be recognised in retained earnings as of 1 April 2018.
IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 will be adopted by the Group on 1 April 2019 and will result in almost all leases being recognised on the balance sheet, as the distinction between operating and finance leases is removed.
Under the new standard, an asset the right to use the leased item and a financial liability to pay rentals discounted to present value will be recognised.
The only exceptions are short-term and low-value leases.
As at 31 March 2018, the Group has non-cancellable operating lease commitments of 45.5 million see Note 25.
Some of this relates to contracts that are short term or for low-value assets which will be recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term as an operating expense.
The accounting for leases under IFRS 16 will result in higher operating profit, with a lower lease expense partly offset by depreciation of the right-of-use asset, and higher interest expense due to the unwinding of the discount on the present value of the liability.
There will be changes to the Groups net assets due to bringing the right-of-use assets and the financial liabilities onto the balance sheet.
The Group is currently reviewing its leases and quantifying the likely effect of these changes.

Non-current assets exclude interest rate swaps and deferred tax assets.
Certain operations have been reclassified to better reflect their geographical location and prior year amounts have been re-presented accordingly.
Such APMs are not defined terms under IFRS.
The Directors believe that the APMs are important when assessing the underlying financial and operating performance of the Group.
The APMs improve the comparability of information between reporting periods by adjusting for factors such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, number of trading days and items, such as reorganisation costs, that are substantial in scope and impact and do not form part of recurring operational or management activities that the Directors would consider part of underlying performance.
The APMs are used internally for performance analysis and in employee incentive arrangements, as well as in discussions with the investment analyst community.
As a result of a review of its and other companies APMs, the Group has renamed some of its APMs in order to make them more consistent with other companies and reduce confusion.
Headline has been renamed adjusted and underlying renamed like-for-like.
The definition of these APMs has not changed and so is consistent with prior years.
Like-for-like revenue growth Like-for-like revenue growth is growth in revenue adjusted to eliminate the impact of changes in exchange rates and trading days year on year.
It is calculated by comparing the current year revenue with the prior years revenue converted at the current years average exchange rates and pro-rated for the same number of trading days as the current year.
This measure enables management and investors to track more easily, and consistently, the underlying revenue performance of the Group.

Revenue represents the sale of goods and services and is stated net of sales taxes and volume discounts.
Freight recharged to customers is included within revenue.
5 Profit before tax Cost of sales comprises the cost of goods delivered to customers and the write-down of inventories to net realisable value.
The Group receives rebates from certain vendors relating mainly to the volume of purchases made in a specified time period.
These rebates are recognised as a reduction in cost of sales to the extent that the inventories purchased from the vendor and eligible for rebates have been sold in the financial year.
Rebates on purchases that remain in inventories are deducted from the cost of inventories, thus reducing cost of sales in the income statement in the period in which the inventories are expensed.
The Group recognises the rebate only where there is evidence of a binding arrangement with the vendor, the amount can be estimated reliably and receipt is probable.
In calculating the amount of vendor rebate to be recognised, the Group must estimate i the volume of purchases over the rebate period and ii the amount of products sold and the amount remaining in inventories based on the inventory turnover.
The Group must also make judgements to determine whether and when the amount of vendor rebates can be reliably estimated and receipt is probable so as to support recognition of a receivable.
As at 31 March 2018 the Group has 2.8 million 2017: 2.5 million of vendor rebates recognised within trade and other receivables.

6 Substantial reorganisation costs The Performance Improvement Plan PIP was launched in November 2015 and sought to drive the Groups strategic priorities.
This year the first phase concluded and gave rise to the following substantial reorganisation costs which are excluded from adjusted performance measures: 2018 2017 m m Redundancy and associated costs 2.2 2.1 Onerous lease costs 2.1 Asset write-offs 0.2 Profit on disposal of warehouse 1.2 Total substantial reorganisation costs 4.5 0.9 During the year, the Group consolidated its Oxford-based headquarters with its London-based digital office into one enlarged head office and digital hub in Kings Cross, London.
As a result, onerous lease costs on the Oxford premises as well as redundancy costs associated with the office closure were incurred.
Also, the Group incurred some other labour-related restructuring costs.
During the year ended 31 March 2017, the Group undertook restructuring activities across Europe in order to centralise and consolidate standard processes, resulting in costs of 2.1 million.
Also, the sale of the warehouse and associated land in Singapore was completed, which resulted in a profit on disposal of 1.2 million.

8 Share-based payments The Group operates several share-based payment schemes which are the Deferred Share Bonus Plan, the Recruitment Award, the Long Term Incentive Plan and the Savings-Related Share Option Scheme.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the grant date, calculated using an appropriate option pricing model.
The fair value is expensed with a corresponding increase in equity on a straight-line basis over the period that employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards.
The income statement charge is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of vesting associated with non-market performance related criteria.
Cash-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date, taking into account the estimated number of awards that will actually vest and the relative completion of the vesting period.
This fair value is included in liabilities and changes in the value of these liabilities are recognised in the income statement.
The EBT established to administer the schemes owns shares in the Company which are shown in equity.
Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSBP equity settled Under the DSBP, one-third of the total bonus earned by plan participants is awarded as shares and deferred for two years, normally subject to the continued employment of the participant within the Group.
There are no other performance conditions.
A cash payment equivalent to the dividends that would have accrued on the shares is made to the participants on vesting.
Deferred share awards relating to the bonus for the year ended 31 March 2018 will be awarded in June 2018.
The fair value of the shares awarded during the year was 579.5p 2017: 261.7p per share award which was the share price at the date of award.
The movements in the DSBP awards were: 2018 2017 Number of Number of awards awards Outstanding at 1 April 107,693 197,151 Forfeited during the year 16,934 18,557 Exercised during the year 30,561 152,080 Granted during the year 150,368 81,179 Outstanding at 31 March 210,566 107,693 Recruitment Award equity settled During the year ended 31 March 2016, Lindsley Ruth was granted 513,784 awards under the Recruitment Award plan.

During the year ended 31 March 2018, 256,892 shares vested.
The remaining 256,892 shares will vest on 31 December 2018.

Under the LTIPs, awards of shares are made to plan participants subject to service conditions and, generally, performance conditions.
At the vesting date, the share award will either vest, in full or in part, or expire depending on the outcome of the performance conditions.
Those awards made under the LTIP 2014 in July 2014 and July 2015 that are subject to performance conditions are subject to a market performance condition based on Total Shareholder Return TSR of the Group versus the FTSE 250 and a non-market performance condition based on cumulative growth in adjusted earnings per share EPS over the vesting period.
Under the LTIP 2016, awards are subject to a market performance condition based on TSR of the Group versus a defined comparator group see the Directors Remuneration Report for details, a non-market performance condition based on cumulative growth in adjusted EPS over the vesting period and a non-market performance condition based on Group ROCE.
Awards under the LTIP 2016 may include a further award a multiplier that vests if the Group achieves exceptional adjusted EPS performance over the vesting period.
Some of the awards are equity-settled and some are cash-settled.
All awards have nil exercise price and receive accrued dividends on settlement.
The fair value of equity-settled LTIP awards subject to market conditions was calculated at the grant date using a Monte Carlo model, with the assumptions below.

The UK element is equity settled and the overseas element is cash settled.
The option price is based on the average market price of the Companys shares over the three days prior to the offer, discounted by 20%.
The option exercise conditions are the employees continued employment for a three-year period and the maintenance of employees regular monthly savings.
Failure of either of these conditions is normally deemed a forfeiture of the option.
Employees may subscribe to the three-year or five-year scheme.
At the end of the period, the employee has six months to either purchase the shares at the agreed price, or withdraw their savings with accrued interest.
There are no market conditions attached to the vesting of the options.

9 Retirement benefit obligations For defined benefit schemes, the surplus or deficit recognised in the balance sheet is the difference between the fair value of the scheme assets and the present value of the obligations at the balance sheet date.
The present value of the obligations is measured using the projected unit credit method and a discount rate reflecting yields on high-quality corporate bonds.
The operating profit charge comprises the current service cost, net interest cost, past service costs, curtailment gains and losses and settlement gains and losses.
The net interest cost is based on the discount rate at the beginning of the year, contributions paid in and the surplus or deficit during the year.
Past service costs and curtailment gains and losses are recognised at the earlier of when the scheme amendment or curtailment occurs and when any related reorganisation costs or termination benefits are recognised.
Settlement gains and losses are recognised when the settlement occurs.
Remeasurements, representing returns on scheme assets excluding amounts included in interest and actuarial gains and losses arising from changes in demographic and financial assumptions and experience adjustments, are recognised in other comprehensive income.
The Groups largest defined benefit pension scheme is in the UK, providing benefits based on final pensionable pay for eligible employees who joined on or before 1 April 2003.
The scheme is administered by a corporate trustee and the funds are independent of the Groups finances.
For UK employees who joined after 1 April 2003 the Group provides a defined contribution pension scheme.
The Group also has defined benefit pension schemes in Germany and the Republic of Ireland, which are closed to both new members and accruals for future service, and defined benefit retirement indemnity schemes in France and Italy.
For defined contribution schemes, the costs are charged to operating profit as they fall due.
The Group has defined contribution schemes in the UK, Australia, North America, Germany and the Republic of Ireland.
The Group also contributes to government schemes in France, Italy, Scandinavia and Asia and these are defined contribution schemes.
Regulatory framework and governance The UK scheme, the Electrocomponents Group Pension Scheme, is a registered scheme established under trust law and, as such, is subject to UK pension, tax and trust legislation.
It is managed by a corporate trustee, Electrocomponents Pension Trustees Limited the Trustee.
The Trustee includes representatives appointed by both the Company and employees.
Although the Company bears the financial cost of the scheme the Trustee directors are responsible for the overall management of the scheme, including compliance with applicable regulations and legislation.
The Trustee directors are required by law to act in the interest of all relevant beneficiaries and to set certain policies, to manage the day-to-day administration of the benefits and to set the scheme investment strategy in consultation with the Company.
UK pensions are regulated by the Pensions Regulator whose statutory objectives and regulatory powers are described on its website: www.
Deficit position and funding The rules of the Electrocomponents Group Pension Scheme give the Trustee powers to wind up the scheme, which it may exercise if the Trustee is aware that the assets of the scheme are insufficient to meet its liabilities.
Although the scheme is currently in deficit on a statutory funding basis, the Trustee and the Company have agreed a plan to eliminate the deficit over time and the Trustee has confirmed that it has no current intention of exercising its power to wind up the scheme.
The funding of the UK defined benefit scheme is assessed using assumptions in accordance with the advice of independent actuaries.
These assumptions may be different to those used for the accounting valuation.
The last triennial funding valuation was carried out as at 31 March 2016 and revealed a funding deficit of 60.8 million.
Under the associated recovery plan, the Company agreed to make shortfall contribution payments of 4.3 million per annum throughout the period to 28 February 2023.
For the period up to 28 February 2023, the Company may also be required to pay an additional shortfall contribution of up to 2.7 million per annum and this payment will be dependent on the Trustees assessment of the schemes funding position at the preceding March.
Both of these shortfall contributions increase at each 1 April in line with the Retail Price Index for the year to the preceding December.
Based on the funding position as at 31 March 2018, in the year to 31 March 2019 the Group expects to contribute 10.4 million to the UK defined benefit scheme, including 7.5 million of shortfall contribution payments, and 0.5 million to the other defined benefit schemes.

At 31 March 2018, all schemes were in a deficit position so no adjustments under IFRIC 14 have been made.
In addition, the Company has not disclosed any further liabilities at 31 March 2018 under the minimum funding requirements as these are lower than the accounting deficit.
Investment strategy and risk exposure The defined benefit schemes expose the Group to actuarial risks such as longevity, interest rate, inflation and investment risks.
For the UK scheme, following consultation with the Company, the Trustee has reviewed the investment strategy with the aim of fide-risking the investments over time.
Following this review, a fide-risking cash flow driven investment strategy has been developed which will see a move away from growth assets equities and diversified growth funds to a predominantly fixed income strategy with lower risk credit assets, gilts and corporate bonds.
The approach for managing the UK schemes risks is set out below.
Interest rate risk The Trustee has set a benchmark for total investment in bonds government and corporate, interest rate swaps, inflation swaps, gilt repurchase agreements and cash as part of its matching asset portfolio comprising the qualifying investor alternative investment fund QIAIF, a bespoke pooled structure in which the scheme is the sole investor.
Under this strategy, if gilt yields fall, the value of the investments within the matching asset portfolio will rise to help match the increase in the valuation of the liabilities arising from a fall in the discount rate, which is derived from gilt yields.
Similarly, if gilt yields rise, the value of the matching asset portfolio will fall, as will the valuation of the liabilities because of an increase in the discount rate.
Inflation risk The scheme holds index-linked gilts, inflation swaps and repurchase agreements to manage against inflation risk associated with pension liability increases.
Longevity risk Prudent mortality assumptions are used that appropriately allow for future improvements in life expectancy.
These assumptions are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure they remain appropriate.
The Trustee uses the Club Vita Service to provide a better estimate of the mortality rates of the schemes membership than the standard tables.
With effect from 1 June 2008 the scheme introduced a mortality risk sharing mechanism whereby members benefits for pensionable service after 1 June 2008 will be reduced if the life expectancy of the schemes members increase more quickly than a pre-determined rate.
Assumptions Financial assumptions The principal assumptions used to determine the defined benefit obligations were: 2018 2017 UK Other UK Other Discount rate 2.70% 1.74% 2.60% 1.87% Rate of increase in pensionable salaries Nil 2.13% Nil 2.13% Rate of RPI inflation 3.00% 1.73% 3.10% 1.73% Rate of CPI inflation 2.00% 1.73% 2.10% 1.73% Rate of pension increases RPI inflation capped at 5.0% p. a.
2.05% n a 2.20% n a Life expectancy assumptions Based upon the demographics of scheme members, the weighted average life expectancy assumptions used to determine the UK defined benefit obligations were: 2018 2017 Years Years Member aged 65 current life expectancy male 22.7 22.7 Member aged 65 current life expectancy female 24.0 23.9 Member aged 45 life expectancy at aged 65 male 24.0 23.9 Member aged 45 life expectancy at aged 65 female 26.6 26.5 At 31 March 2018, the weighted average duration of the UK defined benefit obligation was 20 years.

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
The Group recognises deferred tax assets and liabilities based on estimates of future taxable income and recoverability.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The amount of deferred tax provided is calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date that are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which these temporary differences can be utilised.
No deferred tax liabilities are recognised on the initial recognition of goodwill.
However, when goodwill arises in a jurisdiction where it is deductible in determining taxable profit, the amortisation for tax purposes of goodwill creates a taxable temporary difference and this resulting deferred tax liability is recognised.
Significant estimates in tax The Group recognises a current tax provision when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is considered probable that there will be a future outflow of funds.
As an international business, the Group is exposed to the income tax laws of the large number of jurisdictions in which it operates.
These laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by taxpayers and tax authorities.
The Groups uncertain tax positions principally relate to cross-border transfer pricing.
The assessment of uncertain tax positions is subjective.
It is based on the Groups interpretation of country-specific tax law and its application and interaction, on previous experience and on managements professional judgement supported by external advisors where necessary.
Provisions for uncertain tax positions are included within current tax liabilities.
As at 31 March 2018, the total value of these tax provisions was 7.8 million 2017: 3.6 million.
The Group has arrived at this estimate by making judgements about the position likely to be taken by each tax authority.
It is possible that the amounts paid will be different from the amounts provided.

US deferred tax balances have been remeasured at this new rate and this results in a deferred tax credit of 27.9 million which is excluded from adjusted profit for the year.
The income tax expense for the year can be reconciled to the profit per the income statement as follows: 2018 2017 m m Profit before tax 168.6 127.1 Expected tax charge at UK corporation tax rate of 19% 2017: 20% 32.0 25.4 Recurring items Differences in overseas corporation tax rates 9.6 8.2 Impact of tax losses 0.2 0.8 Items not taxable for tax purposes 0.2 1.8 Items not deductible for tax purposes 1.2 1.3 Other local taxes suffered overseas 0.3 0.4 Non-recurring items Remeasurement of US deferred tax balances 27.9 Movement in uncertain tax provisions in current year 4.6 1.9 Movement in uncertain tax provisions for prior years 0.4 0.8 Prior year adjustments 0.4 0.4 19.0 35.0 10 108 8 El Ele ectr ctrocompone ocomponent nts pl s plc c Ann Annual Re ual Rep port an ort and d A Acc ccounts fo ounts for r t the ye he year ende ar ended 31 M d 31 Ma arch rch 2 2018 018 F FIINANCIAL ST financial STATEM ATEME ENTS NTS 10 Taxation continued In 2017, the Groups effective tax rate was favourably impacted by its internal financing arrangements which involved borrowing by its US operations from the UK, the interest on which had the effect of reducing the amount of tax payable.
This delivered a benefit of 1.8 million in the year ended 31 March 2017.
This benefit has not recurred in 2018 and will not recur in future years.
The Groups effective tax rate reflects the impact of higher tax rates in overseas jurisdictions where the Group earns profits.
In September 2016, the UK government enacted a change in the UK corporation tax rate from 19% to 17% effective from 1 April 2020 and so the UK deferred tax balances have been recalculated at the new rate.
Based on current business plans, the mix of profits is not expected to change significantly in the future.
The change in the US corporate income tax rate is expected to reduce the Groups effective tax rate to the mid-20s for the year ending 31 March 2019.

Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares to assume the conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
The share-based payment schemes which result in the issue of shares at a value below the market price of the shares are potentially dilutive.

Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed annually for impairment.
Acquisition-related costs are charged to the income statement as incurred.
Software and other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any provisions for impairment.
Amortisation is calculated to write off the cost of software on a straight-line basis at annual rates of 10% 50%.
Amortisation is included in distribution and marketing expenses in the income statement.
The residual value is reassessed annually.
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Of the total goodwill, 186.0 million 2017: 207.7 million relates to the Allied cash generating unit CGU which is the Groups North American business.
The goodwill relating to Allied has been fully amortised for tax purposes.

In addition, goodwill and any other intangible assets that are not yet being amortised are subject to annual impairment reviews.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is calculated as the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash flows, the recoverable amount is determined for the CGU to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount of goodwill is based on value-in-use calculations, which use cash flow projections based on the Groups budget and strategic plan which cover the next five years.
The key assumptions used are the revenue and gross margin growth rates, the selection of which involves significant judgement.
These are determined using internal forecasts based upon historical growth rates and future medium-term plans together with relevant macroeconomic indicators.
These cash flow projections are then extrapolated using the relevant long-term growth rate for the CGU and discounted at the Groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the estimated tax cash flows and risk applicable for the CGU.
For the Allied CGU, the long-term growth rate is 2.0% 2017: 2.0% which is consistent with the prudent market estimate of long-term average growth rates for the distribution industry and does not exceed expected long-term GDP growth for North America.
The selection of both of these involves significant judgement.
There is significant headroom between the carrying amount and the value in use of goodwill, therefore the Directors believe that currently all reasonably likely changes in the key assumptions referred to above would not give rise to an impairment charge.
14 Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for impairment.
The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and certain direct overheads.
No depreciation has been charged on freehold land.
Other assets are depreciated to residual value, which is reassessed annually, on a straight-line basis at the following annual rates: Freehold and leasehold buildings 2% or the lease term if shorter Plant and machinery 10% 20% Computer equipment 20% 33% Land and Plant and Computer buildings machinery equipment Total m m m m Cost At 1 April 2016 110.8 142.4 71.4 324.6 Additions 0.3 4.2 1.9 6.4 Disposals 1.5 2.1 4.3 7.9 Translation differences 5.7 4.1 2.3 12.1 At 31 March 2017 115.3 148.6 71.3 335.2 Additions 2.0 8.2 3.2 13.4 Disposals 1.8 0.6 0.3 2.7 Translation differences 1.0 0.9 1.0 2.9 At 31 March 2018 114.5 155.3 73.2 343.0 Depreciation At 1 April 2016 43.0 121.3 64.3 228.6 Charge for the year 2.4 5.0 3.1 10.5 Disposals 1.8 1.7 4.3 7.8 Translation differences 1.7 3.3 2.0 7.0 At 31 March 2017 45.3 127.9 65.1 238.3 Charge for the year 2.3 4.9 2.7 9.9 Disposals 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.9 Translation differences 0.1 0.7 0.8 1.6 At 31 March 2018 47.2 131.8 66.7 245.7 Net book value At 31 March 2018 67.3 23.5 6.5 97.3 At 31 March 2017 70.0 20.7 6.2 96.9 Included in above are 2.1 million of property, plant and equipment under construction at 31 March 2018 2017: nil.

17 Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is calculated on a weighted average basis and for finished goods and goods for resale includes attributable overheads.
The Group estimates the net realisable value of inventories in order to determine the value of any provision required and in this estimation judgements are made in relation to the duration of product life cycles, anticipated revenue over these life cycles and the value recoverable from any inventories that exceed anticipated demand.
The Group bases its estimates on historical experience and knowledge of the products on hand.

20 Financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to cover its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational and financing activities.
It principally employs forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge against changes in exchange rates over fixed terms of between three and six months for the majority of its operating companies.
In addition, there are a small number of cross currency interest rate swaps which swap certain fixed rate loans into fixed rates or floating rates in different currencies.
In accordance with its treasury policies, the Group designates the majority of its derivative financial instruments as cash flow hedges, fair value hedges or net investment hedges.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivatives are recognised at fair value.
Derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for cash flow or net investment hedge accounting are classified as held for trading and changes in their fair values are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Cash flow hedge accounting The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction.
The effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income, whilst any ineffective part is recognised immediately in the income statement.
When the hedged item subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability the associated cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to the initial carrying amount of the asset or liability.
When the hedged item subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or liability, the associated cumulative gain or loss that was recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to the income statement in the same period that the hedged item affects the income statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is reclassified from equity when the transaction occurs in accordance with the above policy.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is reclassified to the income statement.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is the difference between their discounted contractual forward price and their current forward price.
For the year ended 31 March 2018, cash flow hedge losses of 4.8 million 2017: 3.0 million gains were reclassified from equity to inventories and cash flow hedge losses of 6.2 million 2017: 8.1 million gains were recognised directly in equity.
Fair value hedge accounting The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge exposure to interest rate and exchange rate risks arising from financing activities, holding cross currency interest rate swaps which swap certain fixed rate loans into floating rates or into fixed rates in the relevant currency.
The fair value of the swaps is the market value of the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates.
Changes in fair values of derivatives designated as fair value hedges and changes in fair value of the related hedged item are recognised directly in the income statement.

The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts taken to other comprehensive income are reclassified from equity to the income statement when the foreign operations are sold or liquidated.
Other financial instruments All other financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs.
Subsequent measurement is as follows: Borrowings are measured at amortised cost unless they are designated at being fair value hedged, in which case they are remeasured for the fair value changes in respect of the hedged risk with these changes recognised in the income statement.
All other financial assets and liabilities, including short-term receivables and payables, are measured at amortised cost less any impairment provision.

Market risk includes foreign currency transaction risk and interest rate risk.
Each of these is managed in accordance with Board-approved policies.
Liquidity risk The Groups key priority is to ensure that it can meet its liabilities as they fall due.
The Group ensures this by having sufficient committed debt facilities in place to meet its anticipated funding requirements.
The Groups forecast funding requirements and its committed debt facilities are reported to and monitored by the Treasury Committee monthly.
As at 31 March 2018 the Group had the following committed debt finance in place: Private placement loan notes of $100 million with a maturity in June 2020 A syndicated multi-currency facility for $75 million, 85 million and 50 million with a maturity of August 2022 As at 31 March 2018, the Group had 152.5 million 2017: 181.4 million of available undrawn committed debt facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.
The Group also uses bank overdrafts, uncommitted short-term money market loans, cash and short-term investments.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage the Groups day-to-day funding and liquidity requirements.

The amounts in the balance sheet represent the maximum credit risk exposure at the balance sheet date.
There were no significant concentrations of credit risk at the balance sheet date, as exposure is spread over a large number of counterparties, customers and geographic locations.
The Group does not believe its credit risk has materially altered during the year.
The Group identifies counterparties of suitable creditworthiness based on ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies and has procedures to ensure that only these parties are used, that exposure limits are set based on the external credit ratings and that these limits are not exceeded.
All operating companies have credit policies and monitor their credit exposure on an ongoing basis.
Each operating company performs credit evaluations on all customers seeking credit over a certain amount.
Trade receivables are stated net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by local management based on prior experience of customers and assessment of their current economic environment.
There are no significant individual allowances for doubtful receivables included within this amount.
For countries with no local operating company presence, export credit limits are set and monitored on a country basis monthly by the Treasury Committee.
Given the profile of our customers, whereby credit risk is spread amongst a large number of customers with small balances, no further material credit risk has been identified with the trade receivables not past due other than those balances for which an allowance has been made.

The Group also uses money market funds to invest surplus cash thereby diversifying credit risk and at 31 March 2018 its exposure to these funds was 15.0 million 2017: 6.8 million.

The Group also has foreign currency translation risk resulting from investment in US and European subsidiaries and debt mainly in US dollars.
Hedging of currency exposures during periods when operating companies cannot easily change their selling prices is implemented in order to shelter the forecast gross profits during those periods.
In this way the impacts of currency fluctuations can be smoothed until selling prices can be changed in the light of movements in exchange rates.
The hedges are enacted through forward foreign exchange contracts entered into by Group Treasury based on trading projections provided by the operating companies.
The Groups largest exposures relate to euros and US dollars.
As at 31 March 2018, net forecasted exposures in euros and US dollars were hedged by euro forward foreign exchange contracts of 32.6 million 2017: 35.8 million and US dollar forward foreign exchange contracts of 34.5 million 2017: 40.8 million.
In addition specific cash flows relating to material transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the local business are hedged when the commitment is made.
The Group classifies forward foreign exchange contracts as hedging instruments against forecast receivables payables and designates them as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes.
The forecast cash flows are expected to occur evenly throughout the forecast period from the year end, which is between three and six months, and will affect the income statement in the period in which they occur.
Foreign currency transaction exposures, and the hedges in place to mitigate them, are monitored monthly by the Treasury Committee.
The Group does not believe its foreign currency transaction risk has materially altered during the year.
The $85 million of fixed interest private placement loan notes issued in June 2010 and the related cross currency interest rate swaps both contracted and bifurcated that swapped the debt into sterling at floating interest rates and were designated as a fair value hedge, matured in June 2017.
In June 2015 the Group issued a further $100 million of fixed interest private placement loan notes, maturing in June 2020.
Using cross currency interest rate swaps, $20 million of this debt is swapped, at a fixed interest rate into sterling and designated as a fair value hedge.
It is expected to remain highly effective over the life of the private placement loan notes.
The Group has designated $80 million 2017: $80 million of the private placement loan notes and 32.7 million 2017: 4.4 million of external borrowings and 2017: 28.3 million of cross currency interest rate swaps as hedges of net investments in its US and European subsidiaries.
In the year ended 31 March 2018, a foreign exchange gain of 5.7 million 2017: 9.8 million loss was recognised in equity on net investment hedges.
No other foreign currency translation exposures are explicitly hedged although local currency debt is used where economically and fiscally efficient in the financing of subsidiaries and this provides a degree of natural hedging.
Guidelines are in place to manage the currency mix of the Groups net debt.
The Group does not believe its foreign currency translational risk has materially altered during the year.
Borrowings after taking into account the effect of the cross currency interest rate swaps are analysed by currency as: Unsecured Unsecured Unsecured private bank bank placement overdrafts facilities loan notes Total m m m m 31 March 2018 Sterling 73.0 13.4 86.4 US dollar 3.9 57.6 61.5 Hong Kong dollar 4.3 4.3 Euro 0.4 28.7 29.1 Other 5.9 1.2 7.1 Total borrowings 87.5 29.9 71.0 188.4 31 March 2017 Sterling 40.5 41.3 81.8 US dollar 2.3 82.1 84.4 Hong Kong dollar 8.5 8.5 Euro 0.3 3.8 24.1 28.2 Other 3.7 2.0 5.7 Total borrowings 55.3 5.8 147.5 208.6 11 118 8 El Ele ectr ctrocompone ocomponent nts pl s plc c Ann Annual Re ual Rep port an ort and d A Acc ccounts fo ounts for r t the ye he year ende ar ended 31 M d 31 Ma arch rch 2 2018 018 F FIINANCIAL ST financial STATEM ATEME ENTS NTS 22 Financial risk management continued Market risk interest rate risk The Group has relatively high interest cover and therefore the Group adopts a policy of paying and receiving most of its interest on a variable interest rate basis, as in the opinion of the Group this minimises interest cost over time.
This policy is subject to regular monitoring of the effect of potential changes in interest rates on its interest cost with a view to taking suitable actions should exposure reach certain levels.
During the year the Board approved a temporary deviation to the policy as the Groups borrowings consisted predominantly of fixed-rate private placement loan notes.
The Group does not believe its interest rate risk has materially altered during the year.
As at 31 March 2018, the Group had $100 million of its private placement loan notes fixed until June 2020, of which it had swapped $20 million to sterling at a fixed interest rate.
As at 31 March 2017, the Group also had $85 million of private placement loan notes of which it had swapped $45 million from US dollar fixed rates to sterling floating rates and $40 million to euro floating rates: these matured in June 2017.
All other borrowings were at a variable rate.
At 31 March 2018, 108% 2017: 70% of the Groups net debt was at fixed rates.
A fair value loss of 4.4 million 2017: 8.7 million gain on cross currency interest rate swaps designated as a fair value hedge and a fair value gain of 4.4 million 2017: 8.6 million loss on the private placement loan notes fair value hedged, have been recognised within finance income or costs.
Sensitivity analysis of exposure to interest rates and foreign exchange rates The sensitivity analysis is based on the following: Change of one percentage point in market interest rates affecting all variable rate elements of financial instruments: and Change of 5% in euro and US dollar exchange rates affecting the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments and other financial assets and liabilities.
The transactional foreign exchange effect in equity due to net investment hedges included below would be offset in full by the translation of the US and European subsidiaries.

Capital management The Boards policy is to always maintain a strong capital base, with an appropriate debt to equity mix, to ensure investor, creditor and market confidence and to support the future development of the business.
The Board monitors the return on capital employed ROCE, which the Group defines as adjusted operating profit as a percentage of net assets excluding net debt and retirement benefit obligations, and the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.
The Group seeks to raise debt from a variety of sources and with a variety of maturities.
As at 31 March 2018, the Group had a revolving credit facility of 85 million, $75 million and 50 million with a maturity of August 2022 and $100 million of private placement loan notes due in 2020.
The Groups debt covenants are EBITA to interest to be greater than 3:1 and net debt to adjusted EBITDA to be less than 3.25:1.
At the year end the Group comfortably met these covenants.
The covenants exclude the impact of accounting changes relating to IFRS 16 when adopted by the Group.
There were no significant changes in the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
