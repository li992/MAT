28 Long-term employee benefits Defined contribution pension scheme The group operates a defined contribution group personal pension scheme and contributes to various other personal pension arrangements for certain directors and employees.
The total of contributions made to these schemes during the year was 7,959,000 2017: 6,213,000.
The group also operates a defined contribution scheme for overseas employees, for which the total contributions were 36,000 2017: 47,000.
Defined benefit pension schemes The group operates two defined benefit pension schemes that operate within the UK legal and regulatory framework: the Rathbone 1987 Scheme and the Laurence Keen Retirement Benefit Scheme.
The schemes are currently both clients of Rathbone Investment Management, with investments managed on a discretionary basis, in accordance with the statements of investment principles agreed by the trustees.
Scheme assets are held separately from those of the group.
The trustees of the schemes are required to act in the best interest of the schemes' beneficiaries.
The appointment of trustees is determined by the schemes trust documentation and legislation.
The group has a policy that one third of all trustees should be nominated by members of the schemes.
Following a recent high court ruling, the cost of equalising pension benefits for the impact of unequal Guaranteed Minimum Pensions GMP has been recognised.
Only the Laurence Keen Scheme is impacted.
The Rathbone 1987 Scheme was never contracted out, meaning there are no GMP benefits in this scheme.
Ahead of a specific method for equalisation being agreed with the scheme trustees, the cost has been estimated using a method consistent with that deemed by the high court to be the minimum necessary requirements to achieve equality.
This has resulted in a plan amendment loss of 125,000 being recognised in staff costs.
The Laurence Keen Scheme was closed to new entrants and future accrual with effect from 30 September 1999.
Past service benefits continue to be calculated by reference to final pensionable salaries.
From 1 October 1999, all the active members of the Laurence Keen Scheme were included under the Rathbone 1987 Scheme for accrual of retirement benefits for further service.
The Rathbone 1987 Scheme was closed to new entrants with effect from 31 March 2002 and to future accrual from 30 June 2017.
This resulted in a plan amendment gain of 5,523,000 being recognised in operating income on that date.
The group provides death in service benefits to all employees through the Rathbone 1987 Scheme.
Third party insurance is purchased for the benefits where possible and 913,000 of related insurance premiums were expensed to profit or loss in the year 2017: 1,167,000.
The estimated present value of the uninsured death in service benefits is included in long term employee benefits liabilities.
The schemes are valued by independent actuaries at least every three years using the projected unit credit method, which looks at the value of benefits accruing over the years following the valuation date based on projected salary to the date of termination of services, discounted to a present value using a rate that reflects the characteristics of the liability.
The valuations are updated at each balance sheet date in between full valuations.
The latest full actuarial valuations were carried out as at the following dates: Rathbone 1987 Scheme 31 December 2016 Laurence Keen Scheme 31 December 2016 The next triennial valuations of the two schemes will be carried out as at 31 December 2019, and are likely to result in changes to the funding commitments.
The assumptions used by the actuaries, to estimate the schemes' liabilities, are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions.
Due to the timescale covered by the liability, these assumptions may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
