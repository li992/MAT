The Company Registration number is 12901, and the Registered office is Exchange House, Primrose Street, London, EC2A 2NY, England.
The Company has conducted its affairs so as to qualify as an Investment Trust under the provisions of Section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010.
Approval of the Company under Section 1158 has been received.
The Company intends to conduct its affairs so as to enable it to continue to comply with the requirements of Section 1158.
Such approval exempts the Company from UK Corporation Tax on gains realised in the relevant year on its portfolio of fixed asset investments and derivatives.
There have been no significant changes to the Companys accounting policies during the year ended 31 December 2018, as set out in note 2 below.
Significant accounting policies a Going concern As referred to in note 24 and the Statement of Directors Responsibilities, the Directors believe that it is appropriate for the accounts to be prepared on a going concern basis.
b Basis of accounting The accounts of the Company have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, modified to include fixed asset investments and derivatives at fair value, and in accordance with the Act, Financial Reporting Standard FRS 102 applicable in the United Kingdom and with the SORP issued in November 2014 and updated in February 2018.
There has been no impact on the basis of accounting as a result of this update.
The functional and presentational currency of the Company is pounds Sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates.
All of the Companys operations are of a continuing nature.
The Company had no operating subsidiaries at any time during the years ended 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017.
Consequently, consolidated accounts have not been prepared.
The Directors are of the opinion that the Companys activities comprise a single operating segment, which is investing internationally in equities to secure long-term growth in income and capital.
In accordance with the SORP, the Income Statement has been analysed between a Revenue Account dealing with items of a revenue nature and a Capital Account relating to items of a capital nature.
Revenue returns include, but are not limited to, dividend income and operating expenses and tax insofar as the expenses and tax are not allocated to capital, as described in notes 2 c vii and 2 c viii.
Net revenue returns are allocated via the revenue account to the Revenue Reserve, out of which interim and final dividend payments are made.
The amounts paid by way of dividend are shown in the Statement of Changes in Equity.
Capital returns include, but are not limited to, realised and unrealised profits and losses on fixed asset investments and derivatives and currency profits and losses on cash and borrowings.
The Company may distribute net capital returns by way of dividend.
It is the Boards current stated intention to continue paying dividends to equity shareholders out of the Revenue Reserve.

Significant accounting policies continued c Principal accounting policies The policies set out below have been applied consistently throughout the year ending 31 December 2018 and the prior year.
i Financial instruments Financial instruments include fixed asset investments, derivative assets and liabilities, long-term debt instruments, cash and short-term deposits, debtors and creditors.
FRS102 recognises a hierarchy of fair value measurements, for financial instruments measured at fair value in the Balance Sheet, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs Level 3.
The classification of financial instruments depends on the lowest significant applicable input, as follows: Level 1 Unadjusted, fully accessible and current quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Included within this category are investments listed on any recognised stock exchange or quoted on the AIM Market in the UK.
Level 2 Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities or other directly or indirectly observable inputs which exist for the duration of the period of investment.
Examples of such instruments would be forward exchange contracts and certain other derivative instruments.
Level 3 Where no active market exists and recent transactions for identical instruments do not provide a good estimate of fair value, the value is the Directors best estimate, based on advice from relevant knowledgeable experts, use of recognised valuation techniques and on assumptions as to what inputs other market participants would apply in pricing the same or similar instrument.
Included within this category are investments in private companies or securities, whether invested in directly or through pooled Private Equity vehicles, see Notes 10 and 25 d for further information.
ii Fixed asset investments As an investment trust, the Company measures its fixed asset investments at fair value through profit or loss and treats all transactions on the realisation and revaluation of investments held as fixed assets, as transactions on the Capital Account.
Purchases are recognised on the relevant trade date, less expenses which are incidental to the acquisition of the investments.
Sales are also recognised on the trade date, after deducting expenses incidental to the sales.
Quoted investments are valued at bid value at the close of business on the relevant date on the exchange on which the investment is quoted.
Investments which are not quoted or which are not frequently traded are stated at Directors best estimate of fair value.
In arriving at their estimate, the Directors make use of recognised valuation techniques and may take account of recent arms length transactions in the same or similar investment instruments.
Where no reliable fair value can be estimated, investments are carried at cost less any provision for impairment.
With respect specifically to investments in Private Equity, whether through funds or partnerships, the Directors rely on unaudited valuations of the underlying unlisted investments as supplied by the investment advisers or managers of those funds or partnerships.
The Directors regularly review the principles applied by the managers to those valuations to ensure they are in compliance with the above policies.
Distributions from Private Equity funds are recognised when the right to distributions is established.
iii Derivative Instruments Derivatives including forward exchange contracts, futures and options are accounted for as financial assets or liabilities.
Where it can be demonstrated that the derivative is connected to the maintenance of the Companys investments, the change in fair value is recognised as capital and shown in the Capital column of the Income Statement.
Where an option is written in the expectation that it will not be exercised, or that any losses on exercise will be outweighed by the value of the premiums received, the premiums are recognised in the Revenue column of the Income Statement.
The value of the premium is usually the options initial fair value and is recognised evenly over the life of the option.
Subsequent changes to fair value are adjusted in the Capital column of the Income Statement such that the total amounts recognised within Revenue and Capital represent the change in fair value of the option.
Significant accounting policies continued iv Debt Instruments The Companys debt instruments include the 4.25% perpetual debenture stock included in the Balance Sheet at proceeds received, net of issue costs, and bank borrowings and overdrafts, initially measured at the amount of cash received less direct issue costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
No debt instruments held during the year required hierarchical classification.
The fair market value of the bank borrowings and perpetual debenture stock are set out in notes 13, 15 and 16 on the accounts respectively.
Finance charges, including interest, are accrued using the effective interest rate method.
See 2 c vii below for allocation of finance charges within the Income Statement.
v Foreign currency Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are expressed in Sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the Balance Sheet date.
Purchases and sales of investment securities, dividend income, interest income and expenses are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the respective dates of such transactions.
Exchange profits and losses on fixed assets investments are included within the changes in fair value in the Capital Account.
Exchange profits and losses on other currency balances are separately credited or charged to the Capital Account except where they relate to revenue items.
vi Income Income from equity shares is brought into the Revenue Account except where, in the opinion of the Directors, its nature indicates it should be recognised within the Capital Account on the ex-dividend date or, where no ex-dividend date is quoted, when the Companys right to receive payment is established.
Fixed returns on non-equity shares and debt securities are recognised on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective yield on the investment.
Dividends are accounted for on the basis of income actually receivable, without adjustment for any tax credit attaching to the dividends.
Dividends from overseas companies are shown gross of withholding tax.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash scrip dividends, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised in the Capital Account.
Rebates on investee funds management fees are accounted for on a receipts basis.
vii Expenses, including finance charges Expenses inclusive of associated value added tax VAT are charged to the Revenue Account of the Income Statement, except as noted below: expenses incidental to the acquisition or disposal of fixed assets investments are charged to Capital Reserves via the Capital Account: costs of professional advice relating to the capital structure of the Company are charged to Capital Reserves see note 2 c xi : 100% of management fees, invoiced to the Company in respect of certain Private Equity investments, are allocated to Capital Reserves, via the Capital Account, in accordance with the Boards long-term expected split of returns from those investments: 75% of other management fees and finance costs both net of applicable tax relief are allocated to Capital Reserves via the Capital Account, in accordance with the Boards long-term expected split of returns from the investment portfolio excluding Private Equity investments of the Company.
All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
66 | F&C Investment Trust PLC Overview Chairmans Statement Strategic Report Governance Report Auditors Report Financial Report Notice of Meeting Other Information Financial Report viii Taxation Taxation currently payable is calculated using tax rules and rates in force at the year end, based on taxable profit for the period which differs from the net return before tax.
Note 7 b sets out those items which are not subject to UK Corporation Tax.
Deferred tax is provided for in accordance with FRS102 on all timing differences that have been enacted by the Balance Sheet date and are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of timing differences can be deducted.
In line with the recommendations of the SORP, the allocation method used to calculate the tax relief on expenses charged to capital is the marginal basis.
Under this basis, if taxable income is capable of being offset entirely by expenses charged through the Revenue Account, then no tax relief is transferred to the Capital Account.
ix Dividends payable Dividends are included in the financial statements on the date on which they are declared or, in the case of final dividends, when they are approved by shareholders.
x Capital Redemption Reserve This is a non-distributable reserve.
The nominal value of ordinary share capital repurchased for cancellation is transferred out of Share Capital and into the Capital Redemption Reserve, on a trade date basis.
Where shares are repurchased into treasury, the transfer of nominal value to the Capital Redemption Reserve is made if and when the shares are cancelled.
xi Capital Reserves These are distributable reserves which may be utilised for the repurchase of share capital and for distributions to shareholders by way of dividend.
Capital reserve arising on investments sold The following are accounted for in this reserve: gains and losses on the disposal of fixed asset investments and derivatives: realised exchange differences of a capital nature: costs of professional advice, including related irrecoverable VAT, relating to the capital structure of the Company: other capital charges and credits charged or credited to this account in accordance with the above policies: and costs of repurchasing ordinary share capital into treasury or for cancellation, including related stamp duty, are recognised on a trade date basis.
Capital reserve arising on investments held The following are accounted for in this reserve: increases and decreases in the valuation of fixed asset investments and derivatives held at the year end: and unrealised exchange differences of a capital nature.
xii Use of judgements, estimates and assumptions The presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting standards requires the Board to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on perceived risks, historical experience, expectations of plausible future events and other factors.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The areas requiring the most significant judgement and estimation in the preparation of the financial statements are: accounting for the value of unquoted investments: recognising and classifying unusual or special dividends received as either revenue or capital in nature: and setting the level of dividends paid and proposed in satisfaction of both the Companys long-term objective and its obligations to adhere to Investment Trust status rules under Section 1158.
Report and Accounts 2018 | 67 The policy for valuation of unquoted securities is set out in note 2 c ii and further information on Board procedures is contained in the Report of the Audit Committee and note 25 d. The fair value of unquoted Level 3 investments, as disclosed in note 10 on the accounts, represented 7.2% of total investments at 31 December 2018.
Under foreseeable market conditions the collective value of such investments may rise or fall in the short term by more than 25%, in the opinion of the Directors.
A fall of 25% in the value of the unlisted Level 3 portfolio at the year-end would equate to 67m or 1.9% of net assets and a similar percentage rise should be construed accordingly.
Dividends received which appear to be unusual in size or circumstance are assessed on a case-by-case basis, based on interpretation of the investee companies relevant statements, to determine their allocation in accordance with the SORP to either the Revenue Account or Capital Account.
Dividends which have clearly arisen out of the investee companys reconstruction or reorganisation are usually considered to be capital in nature and allocated to Capital Account.
Investee company dividends which appear to be paid in excess of current year profits will still be considered as revenue in nature unless evidence suggests otherwise.
The value of dividends received in the year treated as capital in nature, as disclosed in note 19, was not material in relation to capital reserves or the revenue account.
The value of special dividends receivable in any period cannot be foreseen as such dividends are declared and paid by investee companies and funds without prior reference to the Company.
Dividends paid and payable in respect of the year are set out in note 9.
The amount estimated to be transferred to revenue reserve is less than the maximum allowed under rules in the Corporation Tax Act 2010.
The Board assesses the minimum level of dividend payable in respect of any period in accordance with Section 1158 rules, after taking into account the audited annual net revenue available for distribution, and ensures that payments for each period comfortably exceed that minimum level.

Going Concern The Companys investment objective, strategy and policy are subject to a process of regular Board monitoring and are designed to ensure that the Company is invested mainly in readily realisable, publicly listed securities and that the level of borrowings is restricted.
The Company retains title to all assets held by the Custodian and agreements cover its borrowing facilities.
Cash is held with banks approved and regularly reviewed by the Manager and the Board.
The Directors believe that: the Companys objective and policy continue to be relevant to investors: the Company operates within a robust regulatory environment: and the Company has sufficient resources to continue operating within its stated policy for the 12 month period commencing from the date of this report.
Accordingly, the financial statements have been drawn up on the basis that the Company is a going concern.
Financial Risk Management The Company is an investment company, listed on the London Stock Exchange, and conducts its affairs so as to qualify in the UK as an investment trust under the provisions of Section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010.
In so qualifying, the Company is exempted in the UK from corporation tax on capital gains on its portfolio of investments.
The Companys investment objective is to secure long-term growth in capital and income through a policy of investing primarily in an internationally diversified portfolio of publicly listed equities, as well as unlisted securities and Private Equity, with the use of gearing.
In pursuing the objective, the Company is exposed to financial risks which could result in a reduction of either or both of the value of the net assets and the profits available for distribution by way of dividend.
These financial risks are principally related to the market currency movements, interest rate changes and security price movements, liquidity and credit.
The Board of Directors, together with the Manager, is responsible for the Companys risk management.
The Directors policies and processes for managing the financial risks are set out in a, b and c below.
The significant accounting policies which govern the reported Balance Sheet carrying values of the underlying financial assets and liabilities, as well as the related income and expenditure, are set out in note 2 on the accounts.
The policies are in compliance with UK Accounting Standards and best practice, and include the valuation of financial assets and liabilities at fair value except as noted in d below and in notes 15 and 16 in respect of loans and the perpetual debenture stock.
The Company does not make use of hedge accounting rules.
a Market risks The fair value of equity and other financial securities, including any derivatives, held in the Companys portfolio fluctuates with changes in market prices.
Prices are themselves affected by movements in currencies, interest rates and other macroeconomic, market and financial issues, including the market perception of future risks.
The Boards policies for managing these risks within the Companys objective are set out on page 9.
The Board meets regularly to review full, timely and relevant information on investment performance and financial results.
The Manager assesses exposure to market risks when making each investment decision and monitors ongoing market risk within the portfolio.
The Companys other assets and liabilities may be denominated in currencies other than Sterling and may also be exposed to interest rate risks.
The Manager and the Board regularly monitor these risks.
Borrowings are limited to amounts and currencies commensurate with the portfolios exposure to those currencies, thereby limiting the Companys exposure to future changes in foreign exchange rates.
The debenture deed and loan contracts are agreed and signed by the Board and compliance with the agreements is monitored by the Board at each meeting.
Gearing may be shortor long-term in Sterling and foreign currencies, and enables the Company to take a long-term view of the countries and markets in which it is invested without having to be concerned about short-term volatility.
The exchange rates applying against Sterling at 31 December, and the average rates during the year, were as follows: 2018 Average 2017 US Dollar 1.2736 1.3328 1.3527 Euro 1.1141 1.1291 1.1265 Yen 139.7330 147.1721 152.3873 Based on the financial assets and liabilities held, and exchange rates applying at each Balance Sheet date, a weakening or strengthening of Sterling against each of these currencies by 10% would have had the following approximate effect on annualised income after tax and on NAV per share: 2018 2017 US$ US$ Weakening of Sterling 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Income Statement Return after tax Revenue return 2,485 1,496 814 1,983 1,370 708 Capital return 208,636 39,102 31,899 193,925 48,495 37,653 Total return 211,121 40,598 32,713 195,908 49,865 38,361 NAV per share pence 38.93 7.49 6.03 36.13 9.20 7.08 Report and Accounts 2018 | 81 25.

Interest received on cash balances, or paid on bank overdrafts and borrowings, is at ruling market rates.
The interest rate applying on the debenture stock is set out in note 16.
There were no material holdings in fixed interest investment securities during the year or at the year end.
The Companys total returns and net assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates on cash and borrowings, except in respect of the debenture and loans see notes 13, 15 and 16, on which the interest rates are fixed.
82 | F&C Investment Trust PLC Overview Chairmans Statement Strategic Report Governance Report Auditors Report Financial Report Notice of Meeting Other Information Financial Report Based on the financial assets and liabilities held, and the interest rates pertaining, at each Balance Sheet date, a decrease or increase in interest rates by 2% would have the following approximate effects on the Income Statement revenue and capital returns after tax and on the NAV: 2018 2017 Increase Decrease Increase Decrease in rate in rate in rate in rate 000s 000s 000s 000s Revenue return 557 557 69 69 Capital return Total return 557 557 69 69 NAV per share pence 0.10 0.10 0.01 0.01 Other market risk exposures The portfolio of investments, valued at 3,717,610,000 at 31 December 2018 2017: 3,926,558,000 is exposed to market price changes.
The Manager assesses these exposures at the time of making each investment decision.
The Board reviews overall exposures at each meeting against indices and other relevant information.
An analysis of the portfolio by region and major industrial sector is set out in the Fund Managers Review.
Based on the portfolio of investments held at each Balance Sheet date, and assuming other factors remain constant, a decrease or increase in the fair values of the portfolio by 20% would have had the following approximate effects on the net capital return attributable to equity shareholders and on the NAV: 2018 2017 Increase Decrease Increase Decrease in value in value in value in value 000s 000s 000s 000s Income statement capital return 743,522 743,522 785,312 785,312 NAV per share pence 137.11 137.11 144.84 144.84 b Liquidity risk exposure The Company is required to raise funds to meet commitments associated with financial instruments, Private Equity investments and share buybacks.
These funds may be raised either through the realisation of assets or through increased borrowing.
The risk of the Company not having sufficient liquidity at any time is not considered by the Board to be significant, given: the large number of quoted investments held in the Companys portfolio over 450 at 31 December 2018 : the liquid nature of the portfolio of investments: the industrial and geographical diversity of the portfolio and the existence of ongoing overdraft and loan facility agreements.
Cash balances are held with approved banks, usually on overnight deposit.
The Manager reviews liquidity at the time of making each investment decision.
The Board reviews liquidity exposure at each meeting.
The Company has loan facilities of 400 million as set out in notes 13 and 15 on the accounts together with an option to extend by a further 100 million.
The facilities limit the amount which the Company may borrow at any one time as a proportion of the relevant portfolio of investments and cash.
The most onerous financial covenant limits total borrowings to 35% of the Companys adjusted net asset value, which at 31 December 2018 was 3,224 million.
Actual borrowings at market value at 31 December 2018 were 330.6 million in loans see notes 13 and 15 and 0.4 million in a debenture at market value see note 16.
At 31 December 2018 the Company had 202.8 million outstanding commitments to Private Equity investments, payable over more than one year see note 22.
Financial Risk Management continued The contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at each balance sheet date, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required, were as follows: More than three Three months months but less More than or less than one year one year Total 2018 000s 000s 000s 000s Forward exchange contracts 878 - - 878 Other creditors 35,633 110,283 - 145,916 1 Long-term liabilities including interest 273 5,314 305,726 311,313 36,784 115,597 305,726 458,107 1 See notes 15 and 16 for maturity dates More than three Three months months but less More than or less than one year one year Total 2017 000s 000s 000s 000s Other creditors 60,425 60,425 1 Long-term liabilities including interest 1,132 5,701 273,842 280,675 61,557 5,701 273,842 341,100 c Credit risk and counterparty exposure The Company is exposed to potential failure by counterparties to deliver securities for which the Company has paid, or to pay for securities which the Company has delivered.
The Board reviews all counterparties used in such transactions, which must be settled on the basis of delivery against payment except where local market conditions do not permit.
A list of pre-approved counterparties is maintained by the Manager.
Broker counterparties are selected based on a combination of criteria, including credit rating, balance sheet strength and membership of a relevant regulatory body.
The rate of default in the past has been negligible.
Payments in respect of Private Equity investments are made only to counterparties with whom a contracted commitment exists.
Cash and deposits are held with approved banks.
The Company has an ongoing contract with the Custodian for the provision of custody services.
The contract was reviewed and updated in 2017.
Details of securities held in custody on behalf of the Company are received and reconciled monthly.
The Depositary has regulatory responsibilities relating to segregation and safe keeping of the Companys financial assets, amongst other duties, as set out in the Directors Report.
The Board has direct access to the Depositary and receives regular reports from it via the Manager.
To the extent that the Manager carries out management and administrative duties or causes similar duties to be carried out by third parties on the Companys behalf, the Company is exposed to counterparty risk.
The Board assesses this risk continuously through regular meetings with the management of BMO GAM including the Fund Manager and with its Risk Management function.
In reaching its conclusions, the Board also reviews BMO GAMs annual Audit and Assurance Faculty Report.
The Company had no credit-rated bonds or similar securities in its portfolio at the year end 2017: none and does not normally invest in them.
None of the Companys financial liabilities is past its due date or impaired.
During the year the Company sold EUR 22.5m, USD 89.7m and JPY 1,444.0m for sterling resulting in a net exposure of 878,000 as at 31 December 2018.
No derivative transactions were undertaken in 2017.
The maximum exposure to credit risk on cash and debtors equates to their carrying amounts.
d Fair values of financial assets and liabilities The assets and liabilities of the Company are, in the opinion of the Directors, reflected in the balance sheet at fair value, or at a reasonable approximation thereof, except for the long-term loans which are carried at amortised cost and the debenture which is carried at proceeds less costs, in accordance with Accounting Standards.
The fair values of the long-term loans and debenture at 31 December 2018 are set out in notes 15 and 16.
Borrowings under overdraft and short-term loan facilities do not have a value materially different from their capital repayment amount.
Borrowings in foreign currencies are converted into Sterling at exchange rates ruling at each valuation date.
84 | F&C Investment Trust PLC Overview Chairmans Statement Strategic Report Governance Report Auditors Report Financial Report Notice of Meeting Other Information Financial Report Financial Risk Management continued The fair value of investments quoted on active markets is determined directly by reference to published price quotations in these markets.
Unquoted investments, including Private Equity investments, are valued based on professional advice and assumptions that are not wholly supported by prices from current market transactions or by observable market data.
The Directors make use of recognised valuation techniques including reference to: net assets: industry benchmarks: cost of investment: roll forward of calls and redemptions: and recent arms length transactions in the same or similar investments.
With respect specifically to investments in Private Equity funds or partnerships, the underlying investment advisers and managers provide regular estimated valuations to the Directors, based on the latest information available to the managers.
The Directors review these valuations for consistency with the Companys own accounting policies and with fair value principles.
The investment advisers and managers estimated valuations relating to the Private Equity funds period ends are compared annually by the Directors to the final audited annual valuations of those funds to ensure that the managers valuation techniques gave rise to valid estimates.
The Directors were satisfied with the results of this annual review, which took place most recently in June 2018, indicating that the Company can, all things being equal, continue to place reliance on the Private Equity advisers and managers estimates and valuation techniques.
e Capital risk management The objective of the Company is stated as being to secure long-term growth in capital and income.
In pursuing this long-term objective, the Board has a responsibility for ensuring the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.
It must therefore maintain an optimal capital structure through varying market conditions.
This involves the ability to: issue and buy back share capital within limits set by the shareholders in general meeting: borrow monies in the short and long terms: and pay dividends to shareholders out of current year revenue earnings as well as out of brought forward revenue and capital reserves.
Changes to ordinary share capital are set out in note 17. Dividend payments are set out in note 9.
The Directors have no current intention to pay dividends out of capital reserves.
Borrowings are set out in notes 13, 15 and 16.
AIFMD In accordance with the AIFMD, information in relation to the Companys leverage and the remuneration of the Companys AIFM are required to be made available to investors.
Detailed regulatory disclosures including those on the AIFMs remuneration policy and costs are available on the Companys website or from BMO on request.
The Companys maximum and actual leverage levels at 31 December 2018 are shown below: Gross Commitment Leverage exposure method method Maximum permitted limit 200% 200% Actual 109% 109% The Leverage limits are set by the AIFM and approved by the Board and are in line with the maximum leverage levels permitted in the Companys Articles of Association.
The AIFM is also required to comply with the gearing parameters set by the Board in relation to borrowings.
