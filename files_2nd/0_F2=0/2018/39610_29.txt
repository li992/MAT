NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS a Accounting policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the financial statements.
Notes a to i relate to the Company rather than the Group.
Except where indicated, values in these notes are in 000.
Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
The Company has applied Financial Reporting Standard 101 'Reduced Disclosure Framework' FRS 101 issued by the Financial Reporting Council FRC incorporating the Amendments to FRS 101 issued by the FRC in July 2015, and the amendments to Company law made by The Companies, Partnerships and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2015.
In these financial statements, the Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures: A Cash Flow Statement and related notes: Comparative period reconciliations for share capital and tangible fixed assets: Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries: Disclosures in respect of capital management: The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs: and Disclosures in respect of the compensation of Key Management Personnel.
The Company produces consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.
As the consolidated financial statements of the Company include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken the exemptions under FRS 101 available in respect of the following disclosures: IFRS 2 Share Based Payments in respect of Group settled share based payments: and The disclosures required by IFRS 7 and IFRS 13 regarding financial instrument disclosures have not been provided.
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
The Company accounts for intra-Group cross guarantees under IAS 37.
As permitted by s408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account or statement of comprehensive income for the year.
The profit attributable to the Company is disclosed in the footnote to the Company's balance sheet.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments are measured at cost less any provision for impairment and comprise investments in subsidiary companies.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Plant and machinery is depreciated by equal annual instalments by reference to their estimated useful lives and residual values at annual rates of between 10% and 33%.
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date.
Post-retirement benefits The Company participates in a UK Group pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable salary.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company.
The sponsoring employer for the Group pension scheme is Rotork Controls Ltd. No contractual agreement or policy is in place for charging to individual Group entities the net defined benefit cost for the plan as a whole.
As a result, in accordance with IAS 19, the amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the accounting period.
Classification of preference shares In line with the requirements of IAS 32, Financial Instruments, the cumulative redeemable preference shares issued by the Company are classified as long term debt.
The preference dividends are charged within interest payable.
Share-based payments The Company has adopted IFRS 2 and its policy in respect of share-based payment transactions is consistent with the Group policy shown in note 1 to the Group financial statements.
Costs in relation to share-based awards made to other Group company employees are recharged to each subsidiary company.
130 ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2018 Deferred taxation Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
Dividends Interim dividends are recorded in the financial statements when they are paid.
Final dividends are recorded in the financial statements in the period in which they are approved by the Company's shareholders.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements Estimates and judgements are regularly evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Company makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future.
The resulting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the actual results.
The estimates and assumptions that have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the next financial year are listed below.
There are no critical accounting estimates or judgements requiring evaluation.
