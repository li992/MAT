Notes to the consolidated financial statements Year ended 31 December 2018 1.
Alternative performance measures APMs Bodycote uses various APMs, in addition to those reported under IFRS, as management believe these measures enable users of the financial statements to assess the underlying trading performance of the business.
The APMs used include headline operating profit, return on sales, headline profit before taxation, EBITDA, headline EBITDA, headline tax rate, headline earnings per share EPS, headline operating cash flow, free cash flow, headline operating cash conversion, net cash and return on capital employed ROCE.
These measures reflect the underlying trading performance of the business as they exclude certain non-operational items, acquisition costs and amortisation of acquired intangible assets.
The Group also uses revenue growth percentages adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange movements, where appropriate, also to better represent the underlying performance of the business.
The measures described above are also used in the targeting process for executive and management annual bonuses headline operating profit, operating cash-flow and share schemes headline operating profit, headline operating cash flow, headline EPS.
The constant exchange rate comparison uses the current year reported segmental information, stated in the relevant functional currency, and translates the results into its presentational currency using the prior years monthly exchange rates.
Expansionary capital expenditure is defined as capital expenditure invested to grow the Groups business.
APMs are defined and reconciled to the IFRS statutory measure as follows: Headline operating profit 2018 2017 m m Statutory operating profit 134.1 119.4 Add back: Amortisation of acquired intangibles 3.7 4.5 Acquisition costs 0.5 Headline operating profit 138.3 123.9 Return on sales 2018 2017 m m Headline operating profit 138.3 123.9 Revenue 728.6 690.2 Return on sales 19.0% 18.0% Headline profit before taxation 2018 2017 m m Profit before taxation 132.2 117.0 Add back: Amortisation of acquired intangibles 3.7 4.5 Acquisition costs 0.5 Headline profit before taxation 136.4 121.5 EBITDA and Headline EBITDA Earnings Before Interest, Taxation, Depreciation, and Amortisation 2018 2017 m m Operating profit 134.1 119.4 Depreciation and amortisation 65.7 64.3 Impairment of fixed assets 1.8 0.4 Profit on disposal of property, plant and equipment 1.7 0.7 Loss on disposal of businesses 0.6 Share-based payments 3.8 7.8 EBITDA 204.3 191.2 Acquisition costs 0.5 EBITDA and Headline EBITDA 204.3 191.2 Headline tax rate 2018 2017 m m Headline tax charge 29.5 27.8 Headline profit before taxation 136.4 121.5 Headline tax rate 21.7% 22.9% Headline tax charge excludes tax on amortisation of acquired intangibles and US tax reform impact in 2017: 0.9m 2017: 8.1m.

The range and type of services offered is common to all market sectors.
In accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments, the segmentation of Group activity reflects the way the Group is managed by the chief operating decision-maker, being the Group Chief Executive, who regularly reviews the operating performance of six operating segments, split between the Aerospace, Defence & Energy ADE and Automotive & General Industrial AGI business areas, as follows: ADE Western Europe: ADE North America: ADE Emerging markets: AGI Western Europe: AGI North America: and AGI Emerging markets.
The split of operating segments by geography reflects the business reporting structure of the Group.
In accordance with the aggregation criteria of IFRS 8, the operating segments are aggregated into the Groups two key business areas, ADE and AGI, the split being driven by customer behaviour and requirements.
Customers in the ADE segment tend to operate and purchase more globally and have long supply chains, whilst customers in the AGI segment tend to purchase more locally and have shorter supply chains.
Bodycote plants do not exclusively supply services to customers of a given market sector.
Allocations of plants between ADE and AGI is therefore derived by reference to the preponderance of markets served.

The Group operates in several jurisdictions, many of which have a tax rate in excess of the UK tax rate.
As such, a weighted average country tax rate is believed to provide the most meaningful information to the users of the financial statements.
The appropriate tax rate for this comparison is 26.5% 2017: 30.1%.
The reduction in the weighted average country tax rate is mainly a result of the reduction in the US tax rate following the passing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017.

Those costs in various juristictions not deductible in calculating taxable profits.
2018 prior year adjustments in current and deferred tax relate mainly to changes in assumptions and outcomes in UK and overseas tax positions, whilst the 2017 adjustments mainly related to changes in assumptions and outcomes in relation to overseas tax credits and other claims.
The Group is externally financed by a mix of cash flows from operations and short-term borrowings.
Internally, operating subsidiaries are predominantly financed via intercompany loans.
The effect is net of provisions based on managements estimation of tax risk relating to the potential disallowance of interest.
2.2m of interest deductions were restricted in the US in 2018 following the passing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017.
Prior year net exceptional impact of the passing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the US in December 2017, made up of i 6.8m oneoff tax gain resulting from a revaluation of the Groups US deferred tax liabilities, and ii 0.4m tax charge on accumulated overseas profits of US entities.
Includes provisions for local tax risks and non-financing cross border transactions.
As part of the calculation of the tax charge, the Group recognises a number of tax risk provisions in respect of ongoing tax enquiries and in recognition of the multinational tax environment that Bodycote operates in where the nature of the tax positions that are taken is often complex and subject to change.
Tax provisions totalling 16.1m were recognised at 31 December 2018 2017: 17.5m.
The provisions included are based on an assessment of a range of possible outcomes to determine reasonable estimates of the consequences of tax authority audits in the various tax jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
Management judgement is exercised to determine the quantum of the tax risk provisions based on an understanding of the appropriate local tax legislation, taking into consideration the differences of interpretation that can arise on a wide variety of issues including the nature of ongoing tax audits and the experience from earlier enquiries.
Note 30 to the accounts refers to a contingent liability in respect of the European Commission state aid investigation into the Group financing exemption in the UK controlled foreign company rules.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the business units that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
After recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to the Groups cashgenerating units, which are summarised in the following operating segments: 2018 2017 m m ADE: Western Europe 27.0 27.0 North America 48.4 47.5 AGI: Western Europe 24.3 24.1 North America 57.8 52.5 Emerging markets 6.4 6.5 163.9 157.6 The Group tests goodwill at least annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for those calculations are the discount rates and growth rates in respect of future cash flows.
Management estimates discount rates using pretax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash-generating units.
This rate is risk adjusted, for specific countries, where the Group perceives a risk premium is appropriate.
The rates used to discount the forecast cash flows for cash-generating units are between 9.8% 2017: 11.7% and 10.8% 2017: 12.7%.
The recoverable amount is the sum of the discounted cash flows as forecasted for the coming five years, together with a further estimate of cash flows to perpetuity.
The forecast sales reflect managements expectation of how sales will develop at this point in the economic cycle.
The expected profit margin reflects managements experience of each cash-generating units profitability at the forecast level of sales.
As outlined in the Business review, these forecasts take into account the current and expected economic environment both in respect of geography and market sectors.
Cash flows after five years are in the range of 2.3% 2017: 2.4% to 5.4% 2017: 5.4% depending on the geographical region of the cash-generating unit and are based on historical weighted average growth in GDP in the respective geographies.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.

The Group considers the North America ADE Heat Treatment and North America AGI Heat Treatment cash-generating units to be significant cash-generating units.
The long-term growth rates applied to cash flows after five years and the rates used to discount the forecast cash flows for these significant cash-generating units are shown below: Goodwill carrying Long-term value growth rate Discount rate 2018 2018 2018 Cash generating unit m % % North America ADE Heat Treatment 48.4 2.8 9.7 North America AGI Heat Treatment 57.8 2.8 9.7 Goodwill carrying Long-term value growth rate Discount rate 2017 2017 2017 Cash generating unit m % % North America ADE Heat Treatment 47.5 2.9 11.7 North America AGI Heat Treatment 52.5 2.9 11.7 The Group has conducted sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions applied to the value in use calculations for each cash generating unit.
The separate sensitivity scenarios analysed include a reduction in the forecast sales of 20% in the first year of the forecast and reduction of the long-term revenue growth assumptions of 50% to 100% from year five of the cash flows.
The directors do not consider that there are any reasonable possible sensitivities for the business that could arise in the next 12 months that could result in a material impairment charge being recognised.
The Board has concluded that no impairment charge is required in 2018.

This allowance has been determined by reference to expected credit losses.
The carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.
Included in the Groups trade receivables balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 32.0m 2017: 29.2m which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Accordingly the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
Included in the allowance for doubtful debts are individually impaired trade receivables with a gross balance of 6.2m 2017: 6.6m.
The impairment recognised represents the difference between the carrying amount of these trade receivables and the present value of the expected proceeds.

The Group holds a Revolving Credit Facility in the amount of 230m.
This unsecured facility commenced on 3 April 2017 and matures on 3 April 2022.
The multi-currency drawings under this facility carry an interest rate of between 0.90% and 1.75% above LIBOR.
At 31 December 2018, the Groups principal borrowing facility had drawings of nil 2017: nil.
All borrowings are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.
Given their short-term nature, the carrying amounts of bank overdrafts approximate their fair value.
17 Derivative financial instruments The Group uses foreign currency forward contracts in the management of its exchange rate exposures.
The contracts are primarily denominated in the currencies of the Groups principal markets.
The unrecognised gains and losses were not material in either 2018 or 2017.
The following summarises the aggregate notional amount aggregate face value of all open contracts and their related fair values as of the balance sheet date: Contractual Contractual or notional or notional amount Fair value amount Fair value Fair value hedges Currency forward foreign exchange contracts 0.9 3.0 In accordance with IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, the Groups financial instruments are considered to be classified as level 2 instruments.
Fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Fair value is determined using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts.
The Groups interest rate risk is primarily in relation to its fixed rate borrowings fair value risk and floating rate borrowings cash flow risk.
From time to time the Group will use interest rate derivative contracts to manage its exposure to interest rate movements within Group policy.
However, at the balance sheet date, the Group had no interest rate derivative contracts 2017: nil.
All forward foreign exchange contracts are on demand or due within one year.
114 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2018 26332 14 March 2019 3:53 pm Proof 7 Bodycote AR2018 proof 6. indd 114 14 03 2019 15:55:52 18 Financial risk management The Groups multinational operations expose it to a variety of financial risks.
In the course of its business, the Group is exposed to foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
Financial risk management policies are set by the Board.
The Groups treasury function provides a centralised service to the Group for funding, foreign exchange, interest rate management and counterparty risk.
Treasury activities have the objective of minimising risk and treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and guidelines reviewed and authorised by the Board.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not use or hold deriviative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
The Group may however use derivative instruments, for risk management purposes only, by specialist treasury personnel.
The use of financial instruments, including derivatives, is permitted when approved by the Board, where the effect is to minimise risk for the Group.
There has been no significant change during the financial year, or since the end of the year, to the types or scope of financial risks faced by the Group.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group might not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price.
Liquidity risk arises as a result of mismatches between cash inflows and outflows from the business.
This risk is monitored on a centralised basis through regular cash flow forecasting, a three-year rolling strategic plan, an annual budget agreed by the Board each December and a quarterly re-forecast undertaken during the financial year.
To mitigate the risk, the resulting forecast net debt cash is measured against the liquidity headroom policy which, at the current net debt cash levels, requires committed facilities plus long term loans in excess of one year to exceed net debt by 50% minimum facilities of 75m.
As at 31 December 2018, the Group had a revolving credit committed borrowing facility of 230.0m 2017: 230.0m which, together with net cash of 36.2m 2017: 39.6m, resulted in available funds of 266.2m 2017: 269.6m.
The Group also uses uncommitted short-term bank facilities to manage short-term liquidity but these facilities are excluded from the liquidity headroom policy.
The Group manages longer-term liquidity through its committed bank facilities and will, if appropriate, raise funds on capital markets.
As at 31 December 2018 the Groups principal committed bank facility of 230.0m had a maturity date of 3 April 2022 3.3 years to maturity and had drawings of nil 2017: nil.
Cash management pooling, netting and concentration techniques are used to minimise borrowings.
As at 31 December 2018, the Group had gross cash of 38.5m 2017: 41.0m.
Credit risk Credit risk primarily arises because a counterparty may fail to perform its obligations.
The Group is exposed to credit risk on financial assets such as cash balances, derivative financial instruments and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of appropriate allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash flows.
The quantitive analysis of credit risk relating to receivables is included in note 13.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high creditratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
Further disclosure of the Groups financial instrument risk management activities is set out in note 17.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises on borrowings and cash balances and derivative liabilities and assets which are at floating interest rates.
Changes in interest rates could have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the Groups net profit.
Under the Groups interest rate management policy, the interest rates on each of the Groups major currency monetary assets and liabilities are managed to achieve the desired mix of fixed and variable rates for each major net currency exposure.
The major interest rate risk is to UK rates but exposures also exist to rates in the USA, Europe and Sweden.
Measurement of this interest rate risk and its potential volatility to the Groups reported financial performance is undertaken on a monthly basis and the Board uses this information to determine, from time to time, an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rates.
As at 31 December 2018, 0% of gross debt and 0% of gross cash were at fixed rates 2017: 0% of gross debt, 0% of gross cash.
Currency risk Bodycote has operations in 23 countries and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange translation risk when the profits and net assets of these entities are consolidated into the Group accounts.
Ninety-two per cent of the Groups sales are in currencies other than sterling including EUR 39%, USD 34% and SEK 6%.
Cumulatively over the year, sterling rates moved such that the sales for the year were 7.7m lower than if sales had been translated at the rates prevailing in 2017.
It is Group policy not to hedge exposure for the translation of reported profits.
The Groups balance sheet translation policy is not to actively hedge currency net assets.
However, where appropriate, the Group will still match centrally held currency borrowings to the net assets.
The Group principally borrows in sterling but also maintains debt in US dollars, euro and Swedish krona, consistent with the location of the Groups assets.
The Group recognises foreign exchange movements in equity for the translation of net investment hedging instruments and balances.

It has been Group policy to hedge exposure to cash transactions in foreign currencies when a commitment arises, usually through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts.
Even though approximately 92% of the Groups sales are generated outside the UK, the nature of the business is such that cross border sales and purchases are limited and immaterial for the Group.
Market risk sensitivity analysis To represent managements best estimate of a reasonable range of potential outcomes, the Group has measured the estimated charge to the income statement and equity of either an instantaneous increase or decrease of 1% 100 basis points in market interest rates or a 10% strengthening or weakening in sterling against all other currencies from the applicable rates as at 31 December 2018, for all financial instruments with all other variables remaining constant.
This analysis is for illustrative purposes only.
The sensitivity analysis excludes the impact of market risks on net post employment benefit obligations.
Interest rate sensitivity The interest rate sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions: changes in market interest rates affect the interest income or expense of variable interest financial instruments: changes in market interest rates only affect the income statement in relation to financial instruments with fixed interest if these are recognised at their fair value: and changes in market interest rates affect the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments.
Under these assumptions, a one percentage point fall or rise in market interest rates for all currencies in which the Group has variable net cash or net borrowings at 31 December 2018 would reduce or increase profit before tax by approximately 0.3m 2017: 0.4m increase.
There is no significant impact on equity in the current or previous year.
Currency sensitivity Taking the 2018 sales by currency, a 10% weakening strengthening in the 2018 cumulative average rates for all currencies versus sterling would have given rise to a 74.4m -66.2m movement in sales respectively.
The impact on headline operating profit is affected by the mix of losses and profits in the various currencies.
However, taking the 2018 operating profit mix, a 10% weakening strengthening in 2018 cumulative average rates for all currencies would have given rise to a 15.7m -12.6m movement in headline operating profit.
Counterparty risk Counterparty risk encompasses settlement risk on derivative financial instruments and money market contracts and credit risk on cash, time deposits and money market funds.
The Group monitors its credit exposure to its counterparties via their credit ratings where applicable and through its policy, thereby limiting its exposure to any one party to ensure there is no significant concentration of credit risk.
Group policy is to enter into such transactions only with counterparties with a long-term credit rating of AA3 or better.
However, acquired businesses occasionally have dealings with banks with lower credit ratings.
Business with such banks is moved as soon as practicable.

At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of 34.2m 2017: 35.6m available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 9.0m 2017: 7.3m of such losses, based on management forecasts of future taxable profits against which the assets can be recovered in the relevant jurisdictions.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 25.2m 2017: 28.3m of such losses where there remains uncertainty over the timing of utilisation relating to future profitability.
The majority of losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
A deferred tax liability of 0.5m 2017: 0.5m relating to the temporary differences on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries has been recognised as the Group believes it is probable that these temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures are insignificant.

The Group provides for the costs of environmental remediation that have been identified, either as part of acquisition due diligence, or in other circumstances where remediation by the Group is required.
This provision is reviewed annually and is separated into restructuring environmental and environmental to identify separately environmental provisions relating to the restructuring programme from those arising in the ordinary course of business.
The majority of cash outflows in respect of these liabilities are expected to occur within five years.
Whilst the Groups use of chlorinated solvents and other hazardous chemicals continues to reduce, the Group remains exposed to contingent liabilities in respect of environmental remediation liabilities.
In particular, the Group could be subjected to regulatory or legislative requirements to remediate sites in the future.
However, it is not possible at this time to determine whether and to what extent any liabilities exist, other than for those recognised above.
Therefore no provision is recognised in relation to these items.

Vestings of awards are based upon two performance measures, over a three-year period.
Fifty per cent of the award is subject to a return on capital employed ROCE performance condition and 50% of the award is subject to an earnings per share EPS performance condition.
In the event that threshold performance for both EPS and ROCE is not achieved, none of the conditional awards will vest.
The number of outstanding share awards is as follows: BIP BIP 2018 2017 At 1 January 2,206,287 2,060,570 Granted during the year 1,043,457 759,058 Exercised during the year 491,116 90,533 Expired during the year 246,127 522,808 At 31 December 2,512,501 2,206,287 Average fair value of share awards granted during the year at date of grant pence 848.5 757.6 Fair value of awards granted during the year 8,853,733 5,750,623 Exercise Price nil.

The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
Where there are employees who leave the schemes prior to vesting fully in the contributions, the contributions payable by the Group are reduced by the amount of forfeited contributions.
The Groups employees in Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Italy and the Netherlands are members of state-managed retirement benefit schemes operated by the governments of each country.
The relevant subsidiaries are required to contribute a specified percentage of payroll costs to the retirement benefit schemes to fund the benefits.
The only obligation of the Group with respect to these retirement benefit schemes is to make the specified contributions.
The total cost charged to income of 7.0m 2017: 6.7m represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.
As at 31 December 2018 contributions of 0.2m 2017: 0.2m due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.
Defined benefit schemes The Group operated a number of pension schemes and provided leaving service benefits to certain employees during the year.
The defined benefit obligation less fair value of assets at the end of the year and total expense recognised in the income statement are summarised below as follows: 2018 2017 m m UK Scheme 2.4 Non-UK Schemes 16.8 17.6 16.8 15.2 Total expense recognised in income statement 2018 2017 m m UK Scheme 1.6 1.1 Non-UK Schemes 0.4 0.4 2.0 1.5 UK Scheme The Group sponsors the Bodycote UK Pension Scheme the Scheme which is a funded defined benefit arrangement for certain UK employees, and pays out pensions at retirement based on service, final pensionable pay and price inflation.
The Scheme is funded by the Group and current employee members.
The Scheme exposes the Company to actuarial risks such as longevity risk, interest rate risk and market investment risk.
The Scheme operates under UK trust law and the trust is a separate legal entity from the Group.
The Scheme is governed by a board of trustees, composed of two member representatives, two employer representatives and one independent trustee.
The trustees are required by law to act in the best interests of scheme members and are responsible for setting certain policies e. g. investment, funding together with the Group.
Funding of the Scheme is based on a separate actuarial valuation for funding purposes for which the assumptions may differ from the assumptions above.
Funding requirements are formally set out in the Statement of Funding Principles, Schedule of Contributions and Recovery Plan agreed between the Trustees and the Group.
The actuarial valuation of the Scheme as at 6 April 2018 was completed by a qualified independent actuary and the results of this have been updated on an approximate basis to 31 December 2018.
The contributions made by the employer over the financial year have been 0.7m, comprising 0.3m in respect of benefit accrual and 0.4m in respect of ongoing expenses.
It is the policy of the Group to recognise all actuarial gains and losses in the year in which they occur outside of the profit and loss account and in Other Comprehensive Income.
As the Group does not have an unconditional right to a return of any surplus in the Scheme under the wording of the Scheme Rules, the additional reporting requirements of IFRIC 14 apply.
As the Scheme is in surplus as at 31 December 2018 a restriction must be applied to the balance sheet.
The surplus recognised on the balance sheet has been restricted to nil.
No further liabilities need to be recognised at 31 December 2018 as the Group is not committed to paying any further deficit reduction contributions under the current Schedule of Contributions.

The Schemes present strategic target is to allocate 72.5% of the investment portfolio to non-LDI asset classes which includes creditbased investments, such as semi-liquid credit, corporate bonds and absolute return bonds and 27.5% to liability-matching asset classes, namely Liability Driven Investment LDI.
The LDI portion of assets has been put in place to reduce interest rate and inflation risk.

Against this backdrop, Bodycote has been monitoring developments and continues to engage transparently with the tax authorities in the countries where we operate.
In October 2017, the European Commission opened a state aid investigation into the Group Financing Exemption in the UK-controlled foreign company rules.
The Group Financing Exemption was introduced in legislation by the British Government in 2013.
In common with other UK-based international companies whose arrangements are in line with current UK CFC legislation, Bodycote may be affected by the outcome of this investigation.
If the preliminary findings of the European Commissions investigation into the UK legislation are upheld, we calculate the maximum potential liability to be approximately 20.0m 2017: 15.0m.
Based on a current assessment, Bodycote believes that no provision is required in respect of this matter.
