The credit principally arose on remeasuring the deferred tax liabilities in respect of intangibles and other assets for the change in the US Federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, resulting in an exceptional tax credit of 363 million $490 million, which is partially offset by 9 million $12 million exceptional tax charge in respect of repatriation of untaxed foreign earnings.
In addition, there was a one-off charge of 11 million $15 million to other comprehensive income and equity, in respect of the remeasurement of the deferred tax assets on post employment liabilities and share-based incentive plans as a result of applying the provisions of the TCJA.
ii In its interim announcement for the six months ended 31 December 2017, Diageo reported that discussions were being held with HMRC to seek clarity on Diageos transfer pricing and related issues, and that a preliminary assessment for diverted profits tax notice had been issued.

The agreement in respect of transfer pricing covers the period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2017 and has resulted in an additional UK tax charge of 143 million.
In the year ended 30 June 2018 an additional tax charge of 47 million has been recognised in current tax which is based on the approach agreed with HMRC.
