Note 2: Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of Ferrexpo plc and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for post-employment benefits measured in accordance with IAS 19 revised Employee benefits.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in thousands of US Dollars and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand except where otherwise indicated.
The detailed accounting policies are included in the disclosure notes to the specific financial statement accounts.
Going concern The Group has assessed that, taking into account: i its available cash and cash equivalents available at the date of authorisation of the consolidated financial statements: ii its cash flow projections for the period of managements going concern assessment: and iii events and conditions beyond the period of managements going concern assessment, it has sufficient liquidity to meet its present obligations and cover working capital needs for the aforementioned period and will remain in compliance with its financial covenants throughout this period.
Therefore, the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for the preparation of this set of financial statements.
See also the Directors Report on page 97 for further information.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements for Ferrexpo plc and its subsidiaries as at 31 December each year.
The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared as at the same reporting date as Ferrexpo plcs, using consistent accounting policies.
Subsidiaries acquired are fully consolidated from the date the Group obtains effective control.
Similarly, subsidiaries disposed of are deconsolidated from the date on which the Group ceases to hold effective control.
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary without obtaining or losing control is accounted for as an equity transaction.
All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated in full.
Unrealised losses are eliminated unless costs cannot be recovered.
Business combinations On the acquisition of a subsidiary, the business combination is accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregated amount of the consideration transferred, measured at the date of acquisition.
The consideration paid is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of fair values at the date of acquisition.
Acquisition costs are expensed when incurred and included in general and administrative expenses.
Functional and presentational currencies Based on the economic substance of the underlying business transactions and circumstances relevant to the parent, the functional currency of the parent has been determined to be the US Dollar, with each subsidiary determining its own functional currency based on its own circumstances.
The Group has chosen the US Dollar as its presentational currency.
The functional currency of Ukrainian subsidiaries, which is where the Groups main operations are based, is the Ukrainian Hryvnia.
Foreign currency translation For individual subsidiary company accounts, transactions in foreign currencies i. e. other than the functional currency are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency at the rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date and non-monetary assets and liabilities at the historic rate.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 116 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Note 2: Basis of preparation continued For presentation of the Groups consolidated accounts, if the functional currency of a subsidiary is different to the presentational currency as at the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of this entity are translated into the presentational currency at the rate ruling at the reporting date and the income statement is translated using the average exchange rate for the period based on the officially published rates by the National Bank of Ukraine NBU.
The foreign exchange differences arising are taken directly to a separate component of equity.
On disposal of a foreign entity the deferred cumulative amount of exchange differences recognised in equity relating to the particular foreign operation is recognised in the income statement.
Note 3: New accounting policies New standards and interpretations adopted The accounting policies and methods of computation adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the Groups annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 except for the adoption of new amendments and improvements to IFRSs effective as of 1 January 2018.
New standards and interpretations adopted with an impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements IFRS 9 Financial instruments The Group applied IFRS 9 Financial instruments, as revised in July 2014, for the first time as of 1 January 2018 and elected to apply the modified retrospective method in accordance with the transition provisions set out in the standard.
The new standard became effective as of 1 January 2018 and replaces IAS 39 and includes a new expected credit loss impairment model, changes to the classification and measurement requirements of financial assets and financial liabilities as well as to hedge accounting.
Additionally, the Group adopted as of 1 January 2018 the consequential amendments to IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures.
The impact from the application of IFRS 9 on the Groups consolidated financial statements is predominantly related to the expected credit loss impairment model as the new standard established a new approach for the assessment of loans and receivable balances, including trade receivables, with a focus on the risk of default in the future rather than based on incurred losses in the past.
Classification and measurement of financial instruments is unchanged on application of the new standard and the Group does not intend to apply hedge accounting under IFRS 9.
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers The Group applied IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers, as amended in April 2016, for the first time as of 1 January 2018.
The Group, in accordance with the transition provisions set out in IFRS 15, elected to apply the modified retrospective method, under which comparative financial information is not restated.
The new standard establishes the principles for the disclosure of useful information in the financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainties of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
Under IFRS 15 the revenue recognition model changed from one based on the transfer of risk and reward of ownership to the transfer of control of ownership.
The Groups revenue is predominantly derived from sales of iron pellets, where the point of recognition is dependent on the contractual sales terms based on the International Commercial terms Incoterms.
As the time of the transfer of risks and rewards coincides with the transfer of control, the timing and the amount of revenue recognised is not affected for the majority of the Groups sales.
For the Incoterms Cost, Insurance and Freight CIF, and Cost and Freight CFR, the Group must contract for and pay the freight necessary to bring the goods to the named port of destination.
Consequently, the freight service on sales contracts with CIF and CFR Incoterms meet the criteria of a separate performance obligation and a portion of the revenue earned under these contracts, representing the obligation to perform freight service, is deferred and recognised over time as this obligation is fulfilled, along with the associated costs.
The tables below and on the following page provide the details of the cumulative effects from the application of the new standards on the consolidated statement of financial position as of 1 January 2018 and the consolidated statement of financial position and the consolidated income statement as at 31 December 2018.
Effect from Effect from Balance as at application of application of Year ended US$000 01.01.18 IFRS 15 IFRS 9 31.12.17 Consolidated statement of financial position Assets Trade and other receivables 88,109 218 88,327 Prepayments and other current assets 24,727 7,213 17,514 Liabilities Accrued liabilities and contract liabilities 33,560 6,006 27,554 Equity Retained earnings 2,330,580 1,207 218 2,329,591 As disclosed above, the portion of revenue earned under sales contracts with CIF and CFR Incoterms, representing the obligation to perform freight services, is deferred and recognised over time as this obligation is fulfilled, along with the associated costs.
The effect from the expected credit loss impairment model to be applied under the new standard is primarily calculated based on publicly available ratings default risks of the Groups customers with outstanding receivable balances as at the end of a reporting period.
There are no non-current receivable balances to be considered in the computation of the Groups expected credit loss as all of the Groups receivable balances are classified as current based on the agreed terms and conditions.

The impact from the separate presentation of the total freight revenue related to the sales of iron pellets and concentrate is shown in Note 6 Revenue.
The adoption of the new accounting standards has not had any material impact on basic and diluted earnings per share.
New standards and interpretations adopted without an impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements IFRIC 22 Foreign currency transactions and advance considerations clarifies the accounting for transactions that include the receipt or payment of advance consideration in a foreign currency.
Amendment to IFRS 2 Share-based payments: Classification and measurement of share-based payments clarifies the classification of share-based payment transactions with net settlement features, the measurement of cash-settled share-based payment transactions that include a performance condition and of modifications of share-based payment transactions from cash-settled to equity-settled.
Annual improvements to IFRS standards 2014-2016 cycle contains amendments to IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of IFRS and IAS 28 Investments in associates and joint ventures.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted The Group has elected not to adopt early any revised and amended standards or interpretations that are not yet mandatory in the EU.
The standards and interpretations below could have an impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
IFRS 16 Leases The new standard was issued in January 2016, replacing the previous leases standard, IAS 17 Leases, and related interpretations.
IFRS 16 establishes the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for the customer lessee and the supplier lessor.
IFRS 16 eliminates the classification of leases as either operating or finance as is required by IAS 17.
Instead, it introduces a single lessee accounting model requiring a lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases unless the underlying asset has a low value or the lease term is 12 months or less.
Currently, the Group leases land and buildings under operating leases.
The vast majority of these operating leases are for land used for the extraction of ore and are not within the scope of IFRS 16 and will be accounted for under IFRS 6 Exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources.
The Group expects that the new standard will primarily result in the recognition of right-of-use assets and liabilities in respect of long-term rental contracts for several of its office premises, land not used for the direct extraction of ore as well as for lease equipment.
This new standard applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and the Group does not intend to early adopt this standard.
If the new standard were applied as of 31 December 2018, right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities of US$7,645 thousand would have been recognised without an effect on the operating result at this point of time.
Depreciation of right-of-use assets and resulting finance expense under the new standard are not expected to be materially different to the operating lease expense recognised in the past.
IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over income tax treatments The interpretation was issued in June 2017 and clarifies the accounting treatment for uncertainties in income taxes.
The new interpretation is to be applied to the determination of taxable results, tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates, when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments under IAS 12, and becomes effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2019 subject to EU endorsement.
The Group does not expect a material impact on its consolidated financial statements from this new interpretation.
Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2015-2017 Cycle The improvements are effective for the financial year beginning on 1 January 2020 and contain amendments to IAS 12 Income taxes and IAS 23 Borrowing costs.
The Group does not expect a material impact on its consolidated financial statements from these annual improvements.
Amendments to IFRS 9 Financial instruments: Prepayment features with negative compensation The amendments are effective for the financial year beginning on 1 January 2019 and clarify the classification of particular pre-payable financial assets and the accounting for financial liabilities following a modification.
The Group does not expect a material impact on its consolidated financial statements from these amendments.
Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 118 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Note 3: New accounting policies continued Amendments to IAS 19 Employee benefits: Plan amendment, curtailment or settlement The amendments are effective for the financial year beginning on 1 January 2020 and provide guidance, in the case of plan amendment, curtailment or settlement, on the measurement of the current service cost and the net interest for the period after the remeasurement.
Furthermore, they clarify the effect of a plan amendment, curtailment or settlement on the requirements regarding the asset ceiling.
Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS standards The revised Conceptual Framework was issued in March 2018 and is effective for the financial year beginning on 1 January 2020 subject to EU endorsement.
The amendments introduce a new chapter on measurement, guidance on reporting financial performance, improved definitions of an asset and a liability and clarifications in areas such as the roles of stewardship, prudence and measurement uncertainty in financial reporting.
The Group is in the process of performing the impact assessment.
The Group does not expect an impact on its consolidated financial statements from all other standards, interpretations and amendments issued at the reporting date, but not yet to be adopted for these financial statements.
Note 4: Use of critical estimates and judgements The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and judgements that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
These estimates and judgements are based on information available as at the date of authorising the consolidated financial statements for issue.
Actual results could therefore differ from those estimates and judgements.
The Group identified a number of areas involving the use of critical estimates and judgements made by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements and supporting information is embedded within the following disclosure notes: Critical estimates Note 16 Inventories lean and weathered ore Critical judgements Note 7 Operating expenses nature of the Groups community support donations Note 11 Taxation tax legislation in Ukraine Note 33 Related party disclosures completeness Note 5: Segment information The Group is managed as a single segment, which produces, develops and markets its principal product, iron ore pellets, for sale to the metallurgical industry.
While the revenue generated by the Group is monitored at a more detailed level, there are no separate measures of profit reported to the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
In accordance with IFRS 8 Operating segments, the Group presents its results in a single segment, which are disclosed in the income statement for the Group.
Management monitors the operating result of the Group based on a number of measures, including underlying EBITDA, gross profit and net debt.
Underlying EBITDA and gross profit The Group presents the underlying EBITDA as it is a useful measure for evaluating its ability to generate cash and its operating performance.
The Groups full definition of underlying EBITDA is disclosed in the Glossary on page 175.

Net debt is an Alternative Performance Measure APM.
Further information on the APMs used by the Group, including the definitions, is provided on pages 169 to 171.
In the current period, management has reviewed the presentation of the accrued interest and has reclassified it from interest-bearing loans and borrowings to accrued liabilities in order to better reflect the nature of this balance in the presentation.
US$9,358 thousand have been re-presented for the comparative year ended 31 December 2017 to be on a consistent basis and reducing the net debt by these amounts.
Disclosure of revenue and non-current assets The Group does not generate significant revenues from external customers attributable to the UK, the Companys country of domicile.
The information on the revenues from external customers attributed to the individual foreign countries is given in Note 6 Revenue.
The Group does not have any significant non-current assets that are located in the country of domicile of the Company.
The vast majority of the non-current assets are located in Ukraine.
Note 6: Revenue Accounting policy Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
The following specific recognition criteria are to be met before revenue is recognised: Sale of goods including sales of pellets and fuel from bunker business Revenue is recognised when the control of the goods has passed to the buyer and can be reliably measured.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, customs duties and sales taxes.
Revenues related to provisionally priced sales are initially recognised at the estimated fair value of the consideration receivable based on the forward price at each reporting date for the relevant period outlined in the different contracts.
The control of goods passes when title for the goods passes to the customer as determined by the terms of the sales agreement.
The sales are typically made under the following terms: CIF Cost Insurance and Freight : CFR Cost and Freight : DAP Delivery At Place : or FOB Free on Board.
Under DAP Incoterms, revenue is recognised when goods arrive at the agreed destination or at the border crossing, whereas under the other above-mentioned terms the title passes on the date of the bill of lading.
If the sales agreement allows for adjustment of the sales prices based on survey of the goods by the customer e. g. ore content the revenue is recognised based on the most recent determined product specification.
The freight services under CIF and CFR Incoterms meet the criteria of a separate performance obligation and a portion of the revenue earned under these contracts, representing the obligation to perform freight service, is deferred and recognised over time as this obligation is fulfilled, along with the associated costs.
The freight revenue related to the sales of iron ore pellets made under CIF and CFR Incoterms is shown separate from the revenue from sales of iron ore pellets and concentrate.
The Group has no unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligations relating to contracts with customers with original expected duration of more than one year.
The Group has therefore taken advantage of the practical expedient provided in IFRS 15 in respect of the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations.
Logistic services Revenue from logistic services rendered is recognised over time as services are completed.
Where services are invoiced in advance of discharge, amounts attributable to the time between the end of the reporting period and the discharge date are deferred as contract liabilities.
Other sales Other sales and services provided include predominantly the revenue generated from the sale of other materials and repair and maintenance works provided to third parties.
The revenues are recognised when the title passes for material sold or services provided are completed.
Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 120 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Note 6: Revenue continued The details on the first-time adoption of IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers are provided in Note 3 New accounting policies.

Sales to one customer that individually represented more than 10% of total sales in either the current or prior year amounted to US$290,825 thousand 2017: US$328,377 thousand.
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 121 Note 7: Operating expenses Accounting policy Operating expenses arise in the course of the ordinary activities of the Group and are recognised in the income statement when a decrease in future economic benefits related to a decrease in an asset or an increase of a liability has arisen that can be measured reliably.
Expenses are recognised in the income statement on the basis of a direct association between costs incurred and specific items of income.
When economic benefits are expected to arise over several accounting periods and the association with income can only be broadly or indirectly determined, expenses are systematically allocated to the accounting period in which the economic benefits are expected to arise.
Critical judgements Nature of the Groups community support donations The preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018 required management to determine the nature of the Groups community support donations.
In light of the ongoing Independent Review, it is currently considered that some of the funds donated to Blooming Land the Charity could have been misappropriated.
For further information see Independent Review Committee Report IRC on page 69.
In the absence of conclusive evidence that funds have not been used as intended, the Group has judged that it remains appropriate for it to present its community support donations to the Charity as such in the consolidated financial statements within operating expenses on the assumption that all material donations made by the Group have been applied as previously reported by the Charity to the Group.
If the IRC, based on new facts, reaches a different view to the above critical judgement this may require additional or alternative disclosures and, under certain circumstances, this may expose the Group to regulatory and other actions resulting in potential legal claims or penalties, fines or other liabilities.
For further information see Note 29 Commitments, contingencies and legal disputes on page 154.
Operating expenses for the year ended 31 December 2018 consisted of the following: Year ended Year ended US$000 31.12.18 31.12.17 Cost of sales 507,939 411,490 Selling and distribution expenses 260,422 219,703 General and administrative expenses 45,246 41,954 Other operating expenses 30,863 44,207 Total operating expenses 844,470 717,354 Operating expenses include: Year ended Year ended US$000 Notes 31.12.18 31.12.17 Inventories recognised as an expense upon sale of goods 481,366 367,161 Employee costs excl.

Borrowing costs incurred in respect of the financing of construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised up to the date when the asset is ready for its intended use.
See also Note 13 Property, plant and equipment for further details.
Finance income Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested and the effect of unwinding discounts recorded in previous periods.
Interest income is recognised as it accrues using the effective interest method.
Finance expense and income for the year ended 31 December 2018 consisted of the following: Year ended Year ended US$000 31.12.18 31.12.17 Finance expense Interest expense on loans and borrowings 43,468 53,560 Less capitalised borrowing costs 8,125 3,637 Interest on defined benefit plans 2,390 2,094 Bank charges 778 2,537 Other finance costs 1,713 584 Total finance expense 40,224 55,138 Finance income Interest income 843 364 Other finance income 49 8 Total finance income 892 372 Net finance expense 39,332 54,766 The presentation of the interest expense on loans and borrowings has been changed in the current period to reflect an interest expense measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method by presenting the effect from the amortisation of prepaid arrangement fees in interest expense on loans and borrowings and not in bank charges as done in the previous periods.
In order to be consistent with the presentation in the current period, the amount of US$7,013 thousand has been reclassified from bank charges to interest expense on loans and borrowings for the comparative year ended 31 December 2017.
The total finance expense remained unchanged.
Note 11: Taxation Accounting policy Current income tax Current income taxes are computed based on enacted or substantively enacted local tax rates and laws at the reporting date and the expected taxable incomes of the subsidiaries for the respective period.
Current income taxes are recognised as an expense or income in the consolidated income statement unless related to items recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income or directly in equity or if related to the initial accounting for a business combination.
Deferred income tax Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for taxable temporary differences if it is probable that they will become taxable.
Deferred income tax assets are generally recognised for deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
No deferred assets or liabilities are recognised if the temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction, other than in a business combination, which affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 125 Note 11: Taxation continued Deferred tax liabilities are recognised in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets in relation to temporary differences on such investments and interests are recognised to the extent that it is probable that there are sufficient taxable profits available against which the benefits of the temporary differences can be utilised and that they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised on temporary differences and available tax loss carry forwards when it is more likely than not that they will be recovered in a future period.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax assets to be utilised.
Additionally, unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax assets to be recovered.
Income tax effects on items directly recognised in other comprehensive income or equity are also recognised in other comprehensive income or equity.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
Critical judgements Tax legislation in Ukraine The Group prices its sales between its subsidiaries using international benchmark prices for comparable products covering product quality and applicable freight costs.
The Group judges these to be on terms, which comply with applicable legislation.
In August 2017, the State Fiscal Service of Ukraine SFS commenced a tax audit for the period from 1 September 2013 to 31 December 2015 at the Groups major subsidiary in Ukraine with a focus on cross-border transactions in terms of its pellet sales to another subsidiary of the Group.
In accordance with the current legislation, the SFS has completed this audit within 18 months from commencement and issued its official tax audit report on 27 December 2018, claiming a tax adjustment totalling UAH448 million US$16,180 thousand.
The Groups major subsidiary in Ukraine submitted its objections to the findings of the SFS on 25 January 2019 and following further discussions between the parties during February 2019, the SFS issued the formal claim on 12 March 2019 according to its earlier tax audit report.
The Groups Ukrainian subsidiary is going to initiate legal proceedings and to file a claim to the first court instance in Poltava on 22 March 2019.
As the Group considers that it has complied with applicable legislation for all cross-border transactions and periods, the Group expects to successfully defend its methodology applied to determine the prices between its subsidiaries.
Consequently, no provision has been recorded as at 31 December 2018.
The SFS may commence new audits on other cross-border transactions within the Group or on other periods and the Group also expects to successfully defend its pricing methodology against any further claims should they arise.

As a result of the final tax assessments received, a recorded tax accrual in Switzerland could be released in financial year 2017.
Tax effects on items charged to the statement of other comprehensive income consisted of the following for the year ended 31 December 2018: Year ended Year ended US$000 Notes 31.12.18 31.12.17 Tax effect of exchange differences arising on translating foreign operations 30 2,007 4,557 Tax effect of remeasurement gains on defined benefit pension liability 1,556 Total income taxes credited charged to other comprehensive income 2,007 6,113 The weighted average statutory corporate income tax rate is calculated as the average of the statutory tax rates applicable in the countries in which the Group operates, weighted by the profits and losses before tax of the subsidiaries in the respective countries, as included in the consolidated financial information.
The weighted average statutory corporate income tax rate was 15.5% for the financial year 2018 2017:13.5%.

Derecognition in 2017 of US$25,396 thousand in respect of temporary differences on restricted cash and deposits balances being of a non-recurring nature.
Note 29 Commitments, contingencies and legal disputes provides further information 2 Effective 1 January 2018, a temporary provision in the Ukrainian tax code allows a reduction in income tax payable for the amount of excise tax included in prices of fuel used for mining equipment.
This provision still applies for 2019 3 Effect in 2018 predominantly related to expenses not deductible in Ukraine whereas the effect in 2017 related to Ukraine and Switzerland.
The effect in Ukraine is expected to be recurring to a certain extent as a portion of operating expenses is historically not deductible for tax purposes according to the enacted local tax legislation whereas the one in Switzerland is expected to be non-recurring 4 Effective 1 January 2019, the relevant accounting framework for tax purposes changed from local GAAP to IFRS resulting in a reduction of temporary differences as of 31 December 2018 being of a nonrecurring nature 5 Effect in 2017 related to previously unrecognised losses and temporary differences for a Ukrainian subsidiary that became profitable during 2017.
As the entire balance of temporary differences and available losses from previous periods was recognised as deferred tax assets, the effect is expected to be of a non-recurring nature 6 Effect in 2018 and 2017 related to different tax rates applying to different income streams in Swiss subsidiaries as a result of their specific tax status.
The effect is of a recurring nature 7 Effect in 2017 related to final tax assessments received in Switzerland being of a non-recurring nature 8 Share of profit from associates is recognised net of taxes of the associates.

Note 12: Earnings per share and dividends paid and proposed Accounting policy Basic number of Ordinary Shares outstanding The basic number of Ordinary Shares is calculated by reducing the total number of Ordinary Shares in issue by the weighted average of shares held in treasury and employee benefit trust reserve.
The basic earnings per share EPS are calculated by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity shareholders of Ferrexpo plc by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares.
Dilutive potential Ordinary Shares The dilutive potential Ordinary Shares outstanding are calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue on the assumption of conversion of all potentially dilutive Ordinary Shares.
All share awards that are potentially dilutive are considered in the calculation of diluted earnings per share.
Distributable reserves Ferrexpo plc the Company is the Groups holding company, with no direct operating business, so its ability to make distributions to its shareholders is dependent on its ability to access profits held in the subsidiaries.
The Groups consolidated retained earnings shown in the consolidated statement of changes in equity do not reflect the profits available for distribution in the Group as of 31 December 2018.

This dividend was paid on 14 January 2019 and, in accordance with UK law, the liability recognised only on payment of the dividend in the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2019.
As of 31 December 2017, a dividend payable was recognised in respect of an interim special dividend proposed by the Directors on 7 December 2017 and payable on 15 January 2018.
The presentation of the comparatives as of 31 December 2017 has been restated to be consistent with the current year presentation by derecognising the interim special dividend of US$19,365 thousand comprising of US$16,008 thousand dividend payable and US$3,357 thousand withholding tax and recognising a corresponding credit to retained earnings.

Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the property, plant and equipment and borrowing costs for qualifying assets see below if the recognition criteria are met.
The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads.
Major spare parts and servicing equipment qualify as property, plant and equipment when they are expected to be used during more than one period.
Expenditure incurred after the assets have been put into operation, such as repairs and maintenance and overhaul costs, are charged to the income statement in the period the costs are incurred unless it can be demonstrated that the expenditure results in future economic benefits, when the expenditure is capitalised as an additional cost.
Upon recognition, items of property, plant and equipment are divided into components, which represent items with a significant value that have different useful lives.
Assets included in property, plant and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful life taking into account their own physical life limitations and the present assessment of economically recoverable reserves of the mine property at which the assets are located.
The remaining useful lives for major assets are reassessed on a regular basis.
Changes in estimates, which affect the unit of production calculations, are accounted for prospectively.
Except for mining assets, which are depreciated using the unit of production method, depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset, as follows: Buildings: 2050 years Vessels: 3040 years Plant and equipment: 315 years Vehicles: 715 years Fixtures and fittings: 2.510 years An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset.
Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item is included in the income statement in the period the item is derecognised.
Assets in the course of construction are initially recognised in assets under construction.
Assets under construction are not depreciated.
On completion of the asset and when available for use, the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate asset category in property, plant and equipment and depreciation commences.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Deferred stripping costs Rock, soil and other waste materials are typically to be removed to access an ore body, which is known as stripping activity.
Stripping work comprises overburden removal at pre-production, mine extension and production stages.
Pre-production stripping costs incurred in the development of a component of a mine before commercial production commences are capitalised as part of assets under construction.
After the commencement of commercial production, the respective capitalised pre-production stripping costs are transferred to mining assets and depreciated over the life of the respective component of the ore body on a unit of production UOP basis.
Production stripping costs are generally charged to the income statement as variable production costs unless these costs are related to gaining improved access to an identified component of the ore body to be mined in future periods.
Such production stripping costs are capitalised within mining assets provided all the following conditions are met: it is probable that the future economic benefit associated with the stripping activity will be realised: the component of the ore body for which access has been improved can be identified: and the costs relating to the stripping activity associated with the improved access can be reliably measured.
Once the commercial production of the specific component of the ore body commences, the capitalised production stripping costs are depreciated on a UOP basis over the life of the respective identified component.
No production stripping costs were capitalised as at 31 December 2018 2017: nil.
Mining assets Any capitalised stripping activities, either of a pre-production or production nature, are reclassified to mining assets at the point of time when the extraction of the ore body of the specific component starts.
Mining assets are depreciated using the UOP method based on the estimated economically recoverable reserves to which they relate.
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 131 Note 13: Property, plant and equipment continued Exploration and evaluation assets Costs incurred in relation to the exploration and evaluation of potential iron ore deposits are capitalised and classified as tangible or intangible assets depending on the nature of the expenditures.
Costs associated with exploratory drilling, researching and analysing of exploration data and costs of pre-feasibility studies are included in tangible assets whereas those associated with the acquisition of licences are included in intangible assets.
Capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditures are carried forward as an asset as long as these costs are expected to be recouped in full through successful development and exploration in a future period.
Exploration and evaluation assets are measured at cost and are neither amortised nor depreciated, but monitored for indications of impairment.
To the extent that the capitalised expenditures are not expected to be recouped, the excess is fully provided for in the financial year in which this is determined.
Upon reaching the development stage, exploration and evaluation assets are either transferred to assets under construction or other intangible assets, if those costs were associated with the acquisition of licences.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost of the respective asset.
All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period they occur.
Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs incurred in connection with the borrowing of the funds.
In the case of general borrowings used to fund the acquisition or construction of a qualifying asset, the borrowing costs to be capitalised are calculated based on a weighted average interest rate applicable to the relevant general borrowings of the Group during aspecific period.
Impairment testing Property, plant and equipment is considered to be part of a single cash-generating unit CGU.
The recoverable amount of the CGU is determined to be the fair value less cost of disposal.
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there are indications that assets may be impaired or previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset, such as goodwill, is required, the Group estimates the assets recoverable amounts.
If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered to be impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
Individual balances of receivables and prepayments are assessed at each reporting date and written off when management deems that there is no possibility of recovery.
Further information on the result of the annual impairment testing of goodwill is provided in Note 14 Goodwill and other intangible assets.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
In this case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount, but not exceeding the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Such reversal is recognised in the income statement and the basis for future depreciation is adjusted accordingly.
Impairment losses in respect of goodwill are not reversed.
Capitalised stripping costs Stripping costs are deferred and capitalised if related to gaining improved access to an identified component of an ore body to be mined in future periods.
The capitalised amount is determined based on the volume of waste extracted, compared with expected ore volume in the identified component of the ore body.
As at 31 December 2018, deferred pre-production stripping costs totalling US$101,305 thousand relate to components in operation and are included in mining assets 2017: US$110,124 thousand.
Deferred pre-production stripping costs in relation to components expected to be put into operation in a future period totalled US$34,498 thousand and are included in assets under construction 2017: US$22,734 thousand.
No production stripping costs are capitalised as of this point of time.
Once production commences, stripping costs are transferred to mining assets.
Property, plant and equipment includes capitalised borrowing costs on qualifying assets of US$25,499 thousand 2017: US$17,810 thousand.
The capitalised borrowing costs on general borrowings were determined based on the capitalisation rate of 9.65% 2017: 9.0%, which is the average effective interest rate on general borrowings during the period.
The Group has no specific borrowings in relation to qualifying assets during either reporting period.
The carrying value of equipment held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts at 31 December 2018 was US$1,881 thousand 2017: US$2,214 thousand.
Leased assets and assets under hire purchase contracts are pledged as security for the related finance leases and hire purchase liabilities.
US$42,340 thousand of property, plant and equipment have been pledged as security for liabilities 2017: US$47,921 thousand.
The gross value of fully depreciated property, plant and equipment that is still in use is US$40,041 thousand 2017: US$24,728 thousand.
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 133 Note 14: Goodwill and other intangible assets Accounting policy Goodwill If the cost of acquisition in a business combination exceeds the identifiable net assets attributable to the Group, the difference is considered as purchased goodwill, which is not amortised.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is reviewed for indication of impairment annually and, in case those are identified, an impairment assessment is conducted.
Animpairment loss recognised for goodwill is never reversed in a subsequent period.
In the case that the identifiable net assets attributable to the Group exceed the cost of acquisition, the difference is recognised in profit and loss as a gain on bargain purchase.
For each business combination, the Group measures the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets.
If the initial accounting for a business combination cannot be completed by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, only provisional amounts are reported, which can be adjusted during the measurement period of 12 months after acquisition date.
Exploration and evaluation assets See the policy disclosed in Note 13 Property, plant and equipment.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost and the useful lives are assessed as either finite or indefinite.
Following the initial recognition, the intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
If amortised, the intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset, ranging between one and three years.
Capitalised mineral licences are amortised on a unit of production basis.
The cost of other intangible assets acquired in a business combination is its fair value as at the date of acquisition.

This represents the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
The major component of other intangible assets comprises mining licences and purchased software.
Impairment testing Impairment testing was performed at 31 December 2018 based on a fair value less cost of disposal calculation using cash flow projections over the remaining estimated lives of the GPL and the Yerystivske deposits, which are expected to expire in 2038 and 2048, respectively, according to the current approved mine plans.
The estimated production volumes are based on these mine plans and do not take into account the effects of expected future mine life extension programmes.
The cash flow projection is based on a financial longterm model approved by the senior management covering the expected life of the mines.
The production capacity remains at a fixed level once full capacity is reached and therefore no perpetual growth rate is applied for the cash flow projections beyond this point of time.
The key assumptions used for the impairment testing are: Estimates assumptions Basis Future production Proved and probable reserves Commodity prices Contract prices and longer-term price estimates Capital expenditures Future sustaining capital expenditures Cost of raw materials and other production distribution costs Expected future costs Exchange rates Current market exchange rates Discount rates Cost of capital risk adjusted for the resource concerned Cash flows are projected based on managements expectations regarding the development of the iron ore and steel market and the cost of producing and distributing the pellets.
The Group takes into account two key assumptions: selling price and total production costs considering relevant macro and local factors.
In determining the future long-term selling price, the Group takes into account external and internal analysis of the longer-term and shorter-term supply and demand dynamics in the local region and throughout the world along with costs of production of competitors and the marginal cost of incremental production in a particular market.
The Group considers local supply and demand balances affecting its major customers and the effects this could have on the longer-term price.
The assumptions for iron ore prices ranged from US$62 per tonne to US$69 per tonne of 62% Fe fines CFR North China 2017: US$60 per tonne to US$63 per tonne.
Cost of production and shipping is considered taking into account local inflationary pressures, major exchange rate developments between local currency and the US Dollar, the longer-term and shorter-term trends in energy supply and demand and the effect on costs along with the expected movements in steel-related commodity prices, which affect the cost of certain production inputs.
For the purpose of the goodwill impairment test, the future cash flows were discounted using a pre-tax real discount rate of 12.7% 2017: 14.0% per annum.
These rates reflect the time value of money and risk associated with the asset, and are in line with the rates used by competitors with a similar background.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions Management believes that due to the available headroom resulting from the Groups impairment testing of its operating assets, no reasonable change in the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of these operating assets to materially exceed its recoverable amount.
Note 15: Other non-current assets As at 31 December 2018, other non-current assets comprised: As at As at US$000 31.12.18 31.12.17 Prepayments for property, plant and equipment 24,993 10,283 Prepaid bank arrangement fees 6,552 Other non-current assets 559 218 Total other non-current assets 32,104 10,501 STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 135 Note 16: Inventories Accounting policy Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition are accounted for as follows: Raw materials at cost on a first-in, first-out basis.
Finished goods and work in progress at cost of direct materials and labour and a proportion of manufacturing overheads based on normal operating capacity, but excluding borrowing costs.
Lean and weathered ore at cost, if lower than net realisable value.
The net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion conversion into pellets or concentrate and the estimated costs necessary to sell the product or goods.
Major spare parts and servicing equipment that meet the definition of property, plant and equipment are, in accordance with IAS 16, included in property, plant and equipment and not in inventory.
Critical estimates Lean and weathered ore Iron ore of various grades is being extracted at the Groups two operating mines GPL and Yerystivske.
In order to maximise the operational efficiency and output of the processing facility at FPM, management determines the optimal mix and grade of ore to be delivered to the processing facility from each mine.
During the last financial years, including the financial year 2018, ore of a lower iron content was stockpiled due to limited processing capacities.
It is the Groups intention to process the stockpiled ore once additional processing capacities are available.
This additional capacity is currently being constructed and expected to be completed in the first half of the financial year 2020 and as a consequence the entire balance is classified as non-current.
As at 31 December 2018, the stockpiled ore valued at cost totalled US$217,688 thousand 2017: US$175,831 thousand.
Critical estimates in determining the net realisable value of lean and weathered ore includes i utilisation of the ore over the period from 2020 to 2034, representing an average of 10% of total available processing capacity, and using an asset specific WACC based pre-tax discount rate of 19.0%: and ii forecast long-term iron ore prices of US$77 per tonne.
The net realisable value of lean and weathered ore is most sensitive to delays in the commencement of utilising the ore in the production process, which depends on the completion of the capacity upgrade programme at FPM.
Two separate stress tests assuming a one year delay and a US$5 per tonne lower forecast long-term iron ore price would result in a reduction in the net realisable value of US$46,700 thousand and US$25,500 thousand, respectively.
At 31 December 2018, inventories comprised: As at As at US$000 31.12.18 31.12.17 Raw materials and consumables 39,083 34,295 Spare parts 56,873 42,053 Finished ore pellets 43,097 15,482 Work in progress 3,153 2,475 Other 2,713 2,340 Total inventories current 144,919 96,645 Lean and weathered ore 217,688 175,831 Total inventories non-current 217,688 175,831 Total inventories 362,607 272,476 Inventories classified as non-current mainly comprise lean and weathered ore that are, based on the Groups current processing plans, not planned to be processed within the next year.
It is the Groups intention to process this ore at a later point of time and it is expected that it will take more than one year to process this stockpile, depending on the Groups future mining activities, processing capabilities and anticipated market conditions.
Note 17: Trade and other receivables Accounting policy Trade receivables are stated at original invoice amount less an allowance for expected credit losses.
The Group measures the loss allowance at an amount equal to the 12-month expected credit losses of its customers based on publicly available default risk ratings adjusted for current observable circumstances, forecast information and past history of credit losses.
All of the Groups receivable balances are classified as current based on the agreed terms and conditions and the Group has no history of credit losses.
Individual balances are written off when management deems that there is no possibility of recovery.
Trade receivables include provisionally priced sales, which are open at the end of the reporting period.
Certain contracts have embedded provisional pricing mechanisms, which have the character of commodity derivatives that are carried at fair value through profit and loss.
Revenues on these contracts are initially recognised at the estimated fair value of consideration receivable, based on the contractual price, and adjusted at the end of each subsequent reporting period on the basis of changes in iron ore prices and the specific underlying contract terms.
Final prices based on the relevant index are normally known within 60 days after the reporting period.
Further information on the fair value of the embedded provisional pricing mechanism at 31 December 2018 is disclosed in Note 26 Financial instruments.

Note 21: Pension and post-employment obligations Accounting policy The defined benefit costs relating to the plans operated by the Group in the different countries are determined and accrued in the consolidated financial statements using the projected unit credit method for those employees entitled to such payments.
The underlying assumptions are defined by management and the defined benefit pension liability is calculated by independent actuaries at the end of each annual reporting period.
Remeasurements, comprising actuarial gains and losses, are immediately reflected in the statement of financial position.
The corresponding charge or credit is recognised in the other comprehensive income of the period in which it occurred and immediately reflected in retained earnings as not reclassified to the income statement in subsequent periods.
The costs of managing plan assets are deducted from the return on plan assets reflected in other comprehensive income.
All other scheme administration costs are charged to the income statement.
The net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit pension liability or plan assets.
Any past service costs are recognised in the income statement at the earlier of when the plan amendment occurs or when related restructuring costs are recognised.
The service costs including current and past are included in cost of sales, selling and distribution expenses and general and administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement whereas the net finance expenses are included in finance expenses.
The effects from remeasurements are recognised in other comprehensive income.
The defined benefit pension liability is the aggregate of the defined benefit obligation less plan assets of funded schemes.
The Group operates funded and unfunded schemes.
The Groups expenses in relation to defined contribution plans are charged directly to the income statement.
The Group mainly operates defined benefit plans for qualifying employees of its subsidiaries in Ukraine and Switzerland.
All local defined benefit pension liabilities are calculated by independent actuaries applying accepted actuarial techniques.
In addition to the aforementioned schemes, the Group operates a defined benefit scheme in Austria and contribution plans for qualifying employees in the UK and in Singapore.
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 139 Note 21: Pension and post-employment obligations continued Details of the major defined benefit schemes in Ukraine and Switzerland are provided below: Ukraine The Groups subsidiaries in Ukraine make defined contributions to the Ukrainian State Pension scheme at statutory rates based on the gross salary payments made to the employees.
PJSC Ferrexpo Poltava Mining FPM and LLC Ferrexpo Yeristovo Mining FYM also have a legal obligation to compensate the Ukrainian State Pension Fund for additional pensions paid to certain categories of its current and former employees.
All pension schemes in Ukraine are unfunded.
There was no change in the Ukrainian pension legislation during the financial year 2018 whereas in the comparative year the Ukrainian pension legislation was changed in October 2017 by adjusting the average state salary for the years 2014 to 2018, stepwise increasing insurance length of services and decreasing the coefficient for one year of service.
Following the change to the pension legislation, the pensions for the current pensioners have been recalculated and have resulted in a past service cost gain of US$4,038 thousand as of 31 December 2017 for both Ukrainian schemes.
As of 1 December of the comparative year 2017, FPMs collective agreement was changed in order to remove FPMs obligation of additional payments to its employees reaching retirement age in order to improve their welfare.
This change affected 6,992 employees and resulted in a curtailment gain of US$655 thousand.
No changes in FPMs collective agreement were made during the financial year 2018.
At 31 December 2018, the pension schemes in Ukraine covered 4,377 current employees 2017: 4,302 people following the abovementioned change of the collective agreement for FPM.
There are 900 former employees currently in receipt of pensions 2017: 956 people.
Switzerland The employees of the Groups Swiss operation are covered under a collective pension plan multi-employer plan, which is governed in accordance with the requirements of Swiss law.
The funding, of which two-thirds is contributed by the employer and one-third by the employees, is based on the regulations of the pension scheme and Swiss law.
The pension scheme in Switzerland is funded and the assets of the pension scheme are held separately from those of the Group and are invested with an insurance company.
The accumulated capital of the employees is subject to interests determined by the local legislation and defined in the regulations of the pension scheme.
On retirement, employees are entitled to receive either a lump sum or an annual proportion of their accumulated capital as a pension underpinned by certain guarantees.
The Group, and in certain cases the employees, make contributions to the pension scheme as a percentage of the insured salaries and depending on the age of the employees.
At 31 December 2018, the Swiss pension scheme covered 21 people 2017: 20 people.

Contributions to the defined benefit plans, including benefits paid by employer and employee contributions, are expected to be US$1,566 thousand for the schemes in Ukraine and US$703 thousand in Switzerland in the next financial year.
The expenses in relation to the defined contribution plan in the UK and Singapore totalled US$60 thousand 2017: US$50 thousand.

Taking into account the requirements of Swiss law, it is assumed that equities and bonds reflect investments into quoted assets whereas a portion of the other assets in the portfolio could be investments into non-quoted assets.
Changes to interest rates and future salary increases in Ukraine are considered to be the main pension-related risks for the Group, as such changes are likely to affect the balance of the Groups defined benefit obligation.
The percentage used to calculate the sensitivities was set under consideration of the volatility for these assumptions for the Ukrainian schemes and has also been applied for the Groups less material schemes in other jurisdictions.
Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 142 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Note 21: Pension and post-employment obligations continued Following new rules in Ukrainian pension legislation, the pension indexation is defined by the future salary increases and the local inflation rate.
As a result of this change, no sensitivity for the indexation of pension is calculated anymore for the Ukrainian schemes, but the sensitivity for local inflation is used instead.

The methods and assumptions used for the sensitivity analysis for the prior year are unchanged.
Note 22: Provisions Accounting policy General Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Site restoration Site restoration provisions are made in respect of the estimated future costs of closure and restoration and for environmental rehabilitation costs determined by an independent expert in the accounting period when the related environmental disturbance occurs.
The provision is discounted, if material, and the unwinding of the discount is included in finance costs.
At the time of establishing the provision, a corresponding asset is capitalised where it gives rise to a future benefit and depreciated over future production from the mine to which it relates.
The provision is reviewed on an annual basis for changes in cost estimates, discount rates or the life of operations.
The provision for site restoration changed as follows during the financial year 2018: Year ended Year ended US$000 31.12.18 31.12.17 Opening balance 2,070 1,071 Unwind of the discount 272 150 Credit charge to the income statement 429 904 Translation differences 27 55 Closing balance 1,940 2,070 STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 143 Note 22: Provisions continued The costs of restoration of the different deposits in the Groups open pit mines are based on amounts determined by an independent and credited institute taking into account the codes of practice and laws applicable in Ukraine.
The useful lives of the different pits and mines are determined by the same institute based on expected annual stripping and production volumes having taken into account the expected timing and effect of future mine-life extension programmes.
It is expected that the restoration works of the GPL mine will start after the years 2038, 2041 and 2061 for the different areas within the mine.
The first minor restoration work of the Yerystivske mine is expected to start after2032 within the different dump areas, whereas the removal of equipment and the flooding of the pit will only begin at the end of the mines life.
The provision represents the discounted value of the estimated costs of decommissioning and restoring the mines at the dates when the deposits are expected to be depleted in the relevant areas within the mine.
The present value of the provision has been calculated in Ukrainian Hryvnia using a nominal pre-tax discount rate of 14% 2017: 13.0% and the costs are expected to be incurred once the restoration works begin in the different areas of the mines.
Uncertainties in estimating the provision include potential changes in regulatory requirements, decommissioning and reclamation alternatives and the discount and inflation rates to be used in the calculations.

Note 26: Financial instruments Accounting policy Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument.
Non-derivative financial instruments Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities e. g. promissory notes, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings and trade and other payables.
Derivative financial instruments Except for the provisionally priced receivables disclosed in Note 17 Trade and other receivables, the Group does not hold any derivative financial instruments.
Initial measurement Non-derivative financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value.
Any transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets or financial liabilities are added or deducted from its fair value except for financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through the income statement.
For those financial assets and financial liabilities, the transaction costs are recognised immediately in the income statement.
All regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date i. e. the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Regular way purchases or sales are those that require delivery of assets within the period generally established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.
The subsequent measurement is based on the classification of the financial instruments.
Subsequent measurement Financial assets Loans and receivables Except for the provisionally priced receivables disclosed in Note 17 Trade and other receivables, loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired along with the amortisation process.
Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 146 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Note 26: Financial instruments continued Other Other non-derivative financial assets are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any impairment losses.
Financial liabilities Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process.
Impairment of financial assets In addition to the individual assessment at each reporting date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired, the Group also assesses the expected credit losses on financial assets carried at amortised cost.
As all of the Groups loan and receivable balances are classified as current based on the agreed terms and conditions, the loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to the 12-month expected credit losses based on publicly available credit default ratings adjusted for current observable circumstances, forecast information and past history of credit losses.
This assessment is performed individually for all financial assets that are individually significant and collectively for those that are not individually significant and have similar credit risk characteristics.
The carrying amount of the financial assets is reduced by an allowance account with the change of the allowance being recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Assets carried at amortised cost If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced either directly or through use of an allowance account.
The amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement.
The Group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, and individually or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant.
If it is determined that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, the asset is included in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and that group of financial assets is collectively assessed for impairment.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and it is objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is to be reversed.
Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date.
The accounting classification of each category of financial instruments and their carrying amounts are set out below: As at 31.12.18 Financial liabilities measured at Loans and amortised US$000 Notes receivables cost Total Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents 24 62,996 62,996 Trade and other receivables 17 85,695 85,695 Other financial assets 456 456 Total financial assets 149,147 149,147 Financial liabilities Trade and other payables 20 34,292 34,292 Accrued liabilities 23 26,458 26,458 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 25 401,858 401,858 Total financial liabilities 462,608 462,608 STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 147 Note 26: Financial instruments continued As at 31.12.17 Financial liabilities measured at Loans and amortised US$000 Notes receivables cost Total Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents 24 97,742 97,742 Trade and other receivables 17 88,327 88,327 Other financial assets 620 620 Total financial assets 186,689 186,689 Financial liabilities Trade and other payables 20 32,420 32,420 Accrued liabilities 23 25,314 25,314 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 25 491,706 491,706 Total financial liabilities 549,440 549,440 Fair values and impairment testing Financial assets and other financial liabilities The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and payables are approximately equal to their carrying amounts due to their short maturity.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings The fair values of interest-bearing loans and borrowings are based on the discounted cash flows using market interest rates Level 2 except for the fair value of the Eurobond issued Level 1, which is based on the market price quotation at the reporting date.
The fair values of interest-bearing loans and borrowings totalled US$401,089 thousand 2017: US$514,515 thousand.
Fair value measurements recognised in the statement of financial position Except for the provisionally priced trade receivables Level 2 disclosed in Note 17 Trade and other receivables, the Group does not have any financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Level 1 to Level 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 in these periods.
Financial risk management Overview The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: credit risk: liquidity risk: market risk including currency and commodity risk.
This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Groups management of capital.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The Groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
The Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit.
Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee and the CFO.
The Group operates a centralised financial risk management structure under the management of the Executive Committee, accountable to the Board.
The Executive Committee delegates certain responsibilities to the CFO.
The CFOs responsibilities include authority for approving all new physical, commercial or financial transactions that create a financial risk for the Group.
Additionally, the CFO controls the management of treasury risks within each of the business units in accordance with a Board-approved treasury policy.
Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 148 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Note 26: Financial instruments continued Financial instrument risk exposure and management Natural hedges that can be identified and their effectiveness quantified are used in preference to financial risk management instruments.
Derivative transactions may be executed for risk mitigation purposes only speculation is not permitted under the approved treasury policy and are designed to have the effect of reducing risk on underlying market or credit exposures.
Appropriate operational controls ensure operational risks are not increased disproportionately to the reduction in market or credit risk.
The Group has not used any financial risk management instruments that are derivative in nature, or other hedging instruments, in this or prior periods.
Credit risk Trade and other receivables The Group, through its trading operations, enters into binding contracts, which contain obligations that create exposure to credit, counterparty and country risks.
It is the primary objective of the Group to manage such risks to reduce uncertainty of collection from buyers.
A secondary objective is to minimise the cost of reducing risks within acceptable parameters.
Trade finance is used to balance risk and payment.
These risks include the creditworthiness of the buyer, and the political and economic stability of the buyers country.
Trade finance generally refers to the financing of individual transactions or a series of revolving transactions and is often self-liquidating, whereby the lending bank stipulates that all sales proceeds to be collected are applied to settle the loan, with the remainder returned to the Group.
Trade finance transactions are approved by the Group Treasurer.
The primary objective is to ensure that the margins paid and conditions applicable should be the same as, or better than, those which other organisations with similar creditworthiness would achieve, and compared with other financing available to the Group.
Credit risk is the risk associated with the possibility that a buyer will default, by failing to make required payments in a timely manner or to comply with other conditions of an obligation or agreement.
Where appropriate, the Group uses letters of credit to assist in mitigating such risks.
Counterparty risk crystallises when a party to an agreement defaults.
Where letters of credit are used to minimise this risk, the Group uses a confirming bank with a similar or higher credit rating to mitigate country and or credit risk of the issuing bank.
Country risk is the potential volatility of foreign assets, whether receivables or investments, that is due to political and or financial events in a given country.
Group Treasury monitors the concentration of all outstanding risks associated with any entity or country, and reports to the Group CFO on a timely basis.
Investment securities Outside Ukraine the Group limits its cash exposure to credit, counterparty and country risk by only investing in liquid securities and with counterparties that are incorporated in an A or better S&P rated OECD country.
A ratings approach is used to determine maximum exposure to each counterparty.
Cash not required within three months for production, distribution and capital expenditures is invested with counterparties rated by S&P or Moodys at a level of long-term BBB S&P or short-term A3 S&P or better.
Recognising that the principal activities of the Group are predominantly in Ukraine, special consideration is given to Ukrainian transactional banking counterparties where the sector is small and constrained by the sovereign credit rating.
Exceptions may be made under the following conditions: the counterparty is resident in Ukraine: and the counterparty is included in the top 15 financial institutions in Ukraine based on the Groups assessment of the financial institution.
Subsequent to the declaration of insolvency of the Groups former transactional bank in Ukraine see Note 29 Commitments, contingencies and legal disputes, the Group changed its transactional banking arrangements and is currently working with four banks in Ukraine, all of them being subsidiaries of Western banks, and is still exposed to Ukraine country and banking sector risk in this respect.
Guarantees The Groups policy is to provide financial guarantees under limited circumstances only for the benefit of wholly owned or substantially wholly owned subsidiaries.
At 31 December 2018, Ferrexpo AG, Ferrexpo Finance plc and Ferrexpo Middle East FZE were jointly and severally liable under a US$400 million revolving pre-export finance facility, of which US$195,000 thousand was drawn as of 31 December 2018 2017: nil and US$205,000 thousand was available 2017: US$195,000 thousand.
At 31 December 2018, Ferrexpo plc, Ferrexpo AG and Ferrexpo Middle East FZE were guarantors to the Eurobond Notes issued by Ferrexpo Finance plc totalling US$173,181 thousand and fully repaid on 7 April 2019.
Additionally, the Notes benefited from a surety agreement provided by FPM.
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 149 Note 26: Financial instruments continued Certain Group companies act as guarantors for several finance facilities provided to Ukrainian subsidiaries: Ferrexpo AG amounting to US$15,767 thousand 2017: US$38,902 thousand, Ferrexpo Middle East FZE amounting to US$6,595 thousand 2017: US$15,852 thousand and Ferrexpo plc amounting to US$2,661 thousand 2017: US$7,984 thousand.
The total remaining contractual maturities of the guarantees provided under the facilities listed above is US$403,268 thousand 2017: US$497,800 thousand.
Exposure to credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets at 31 December 2018 was US$149,147 thousand 2017: US$186,689 thousand and represents the maximum credit exposure.
See page 146 for further information.
Of the total maximum exposure to credit risk, US$26,068 thousand 2017: US$13,170 thousand related to Ukraine.
The total receivables balance relating to the Groups top three customers was US$40,670 thousand 2017: US$49,918 thousand, making up 47.5% of the total amounts receivable 2017: 63.4%.
The top three customers are considered to be crisis-resistant top-class steel mills and sales are made under long-term contracts.
Impairment profile The Groups exposure to credit risk relating to trade and other receivables is disclosed in Note 17 Trade and other receivables.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach is to ensure that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation by holding surplus cash or undrawn committed credit facilities.
The Group prepares detailed rolling cash flow forecasts, which assist it in monitoring cash flow requirements and optimising its cash return on investments.
Typically, the Group intends to ensure that it has sufficient cash on demand and or lines of credit to meet expected operational expenses, including the servicing of financial obligations.
For further information see the Groups Viability Statement on page 48.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities: As at 31.12.18 Less than Between Between More than US$000 1 year 1 to 2 years 2 to 5 years 5 years Total Interest-bearing Fixed rate loans and borrowings 181,182 181,182 Floating rate loans and borrowings 24,785 66,534 130,767 222,086 Total interest-bearing 205,967 66,534 130,767 403,268 Non-interest-bearing Trade and other payables 34,292 34,292 Accrued liabilities 26,458 26,458 Future interest payable 23,321 12,380 10,511 46,212 Total non-interest-bearing 84,071 12,380 10,511 106,962 Total financial liabilities 290,038 78,914 141,278 510,230 Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 150 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Note 26: Financial instruments continued The difference of the total of fixed and floating interest-bearing loans and borrowings compared to the balances disclosed in Note 25 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings mainly relates to arrangement fees paid for specific facilities, which are netted for the presentation in the statement of financial position.
As at 31.12.17 Less than Between Between More than US$000 1 year 1 to 2 years 2 to 5 years 5 years Total Interest-bearing Fixed rate loans and borrowings 189,004 181,180 370,184 Floating rate loans and borrowings 119,847 5,468 2,301 127,616 Total interest-bearing 308,851 186,648 2,301 497,800 Non-interest-bearing Trade and other payables 48,428 48,428 Accrued liabilities 25,314 25,314 Future interest payable 30,251 9,218 70 39,539 Total non-interest-bearing 103,993 9,218 70 113,281 Total financial liabilities 412,844 195,866 2,371 611,081 Currency risk The Group is exposed to currency risk on financial assets and financial liabilities resulting from sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currencies of the Groups subsidiaries.
The functional currencies of the Groups subsidiaries are primarily the Ukrainian Hryvnia, US Dollars, Euro and Swiss Francs.
The Groups functional currency and reporting currency is US Dollar.
The Groups major lines of borrowings and the majority of its sales are denominated in US Dollars, with costs of local Ukrainian production mainly in Hryvnia.
The value of the Hryvnia is published by the NBU.
An appreciation of the Ukrainian Hryvnia increases, the operating costs of the production unit in US Dollar terms and the value of Hryvnia payables recorded in the statement of financial position at the year-end in US Dollars, with the opposite effect in case of a depreciation of the Ukrainian Hryvnia.
As the majority of sales and receivables are denominated in US Dollars, a change in the local currency will result in operating exchange difference recorded in the income statement.
In case of a change of the local currency compared to the US Dollar, US Dollar-denominated loans held by the Ukrainian subsidiaries result in non-operating exchange differences to the extent these are not matched by US Dollar-denominated assets.
Fixed assets are held in local currency amounts and a change in the functional currencies different to the US Dollar results in a change of the Groups net assets as recorded in the translation reserve.
The NBU manages and determines the official exchange rates.
An interbank market for exchange of currencies exists in Ukraine and is monitored by the NBU.
The Group, through financial institutions, exchanges currencies at bank offered market rates.
Trade receivables are predominately in US Dollars and are not hedged.
Trade payables denominated in US Dollars are also not hedged on the market, but are matched against US Dollar currency receipts.
This includes the interest expense, which is principally payable in US Dollars.
Trade receivables and trade payables in Ukrainian Hryvnia are not hedged as a forward market for the currency is generally not available.
Other Group monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are considered immaterial as the exposure to currency risk mainly relates to corporate costs within Switzerland and the UK.
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 151 Note 26: Financial instruments continued The Groups exposure to foreign currency risk was as follows as of 31 December 2018: As at As at US$000 31.12.18 31.12.17 Total financial assets 149,147 186,689 Thereof exposed to Ukrainian Hryvnia Thereof exposed to US Dollar 6,837 6,906 Thereof exposed to Euro 49 145 Thereof exposed to Swiss Franc 674 673 Thereof exposed to other currencies 1,898 1,446 Total exposures to currencies other than local functional currencies 9,458 9,170 Total financial liabilities 462,608 549,440 Thereof exposed to Ukrainian Hryvnia Thereof exposed to US Dollar 12,369 22,061 Thereof exposed to Euro 1,587 1,731 Thereof exposed to Swiss Franc 4,617 216 Thereof exposed to other currencies 1,086 6,569 Total exposures to currencies other than local functional currencies 19,659 30,577 No other subsidiaries of the Group have financial assets and liabilities denominated in the Ukrainian Hryvnia.
The functional currency of the Ukrainian subsidiaries is the Ukrainian Hryvnia and the translation of financial assets and financial liabilities does not therefore pose a foreign currency risk exposure in the consolidated income statement of the Group as translation differences are reflected in the translation reserve see Note 30 Share capital and reserves.
Interest rate risk The Group predominantly borrows bank funds that are at floating interest rates and is exposed to interest rate movements.
No interest rate swaps have been entered into in this or prior periods.
Commodity risk Revenues related to provisionally priced sales are initially recognised at the estimated fair value of the consideration receivable based on the forward price at each reporting date for the relevant period outlined in the different contracts.
As a consequence, the receivable balance may change in a future period when final invoices can be issued based on final iron ore prices to be applied according to the specific underlying contract terms.
There was no provisionally priced iron ore exposure at 31 December 2018 2017: 176,000 tonnes, which would give rise to a fair value adjustment relating to the embedded provisional pricing mechanism as at 31 December 2018 2017: gain of US$846 thousand.
Final iron ore prices based on the relevant index are normally known within 60 days after the reporting period.
There were no provisionally priced receivable balances as at 31 December 2018.
The difference between the provisionally priced receivable balance recognised as at the end of the comparative period ended 31 December 2017 and the receivable balance taking into account the known final prices was US$863 thousand and would have increased the consolidated result and the shareholders equity by this amount.
Where pricing terms deviate from the index-based pricing model, derivative commodity contracts may be used to swap the pricing terms to the iron ore index price.
Finished goods are held at cost without revaluation to a spot price for iron ore pellets at the end of the reporting period, as long as the recoverable amount exceeds the cost basis.
Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 152 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Note 26: Financial instruments continued Sensitivity analysis A 20% strengthening of the US Dollar against the following currencies at 31 December would have increased decreased income statement and equity by the amounts shown below.
The percentage applied to the sensitivity analysis of the Groups foreign currency exposure is based on the average change of the Ukrainian Hryvnia, the Groups most relevant foreign currency, compared to the US Dollar in past years, which might repeat again in the near future.
This percentage was also applied for the Groups less relevant foreign currencies and does not have a significant effect on the total effect of this sensitivity analysis.
This assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.
Year ended Year ended 31.12.18 31.12.17 Income Income statement statement US$000 equity equity Ukrainian Hryvnia 922 2,526 Euro 256 264 Swiss Franc 657 76 Total 1,835 2,714 A 20% weakening of the US Dollar against the above currencies would have an equal but opposite effect to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all the other variables remain constant.
Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate instruments The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, and the Group does not hold any derivatives e. g. interest rate swaps.
Therefore, a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect the income statement.
Cash flow sensitivity for variable rate instruments An increase of 100 basis points bps in interest rates would have decreased equity and the consolidated result by the amounts shown below.
The possible change applied to the cash flow sensitivity represents a plausible scenario taking into account the movement of variable interest rates in the last year and possible changes in the near future.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.
Year ended Year ended US$000 31.12.18 31.12.17 Net finance charge 1,591 299 A decrease of 100bps would increase equity and profit by US$1,126 thousand for the year ended 31 December 2018 2017: increase of US$1,288 thousand.
This is on the basis that all the other variables remain constant.
Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base.
The Board of Directors monitors both the demographic spread of shareholders, as well as the return on capital, which the Group defines as total shareholders equity, excluding non-controlling interests, and the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.
Please refer to the statement of changes in equity for details of the capital position of the Group.
A key measure in respect of the Groups capital management is the level of net debt and the net debt to EBITDA ratio.
Both key figures improved during the financial year 2018 as a result of the strong financial performance.
The net debt has decreased from US$393,964 thousand at the beginning of the year to US$338,862 thousand as at 31 December 2018.
The capital base of the Group can be adversely affected by falls in the price of iron ore reducing reported revenues and profitability.
The price that the industry earns for iron ore products is cyclical in nature and the Board of Directors continues to review its capital base in line with industry trends.
In prior years the Board approved investments in growth projects as part of its policy to support a strong capital base.
During the financial years 2015 and 2016, in recognition of the industry trend and to further support the Groups capital base, the Board slowed down investments in major growth projects.
Under consideration of increased iron ore prices and more positive industry trends, investments in major growth projects continued in 2018 and are expected to be continued in 2019.
The Board seeks to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.
The Board continues to support maintaining a sound capital base balanced against these market constraints.
The Board maintains a dividend policy consistent with the Groups profile, reflecting the investment activities the Group has made supporting current and future production growth and the cash generated by existing operations, while maintaining a prudent level of dividend cover supported by an appropriate level of liquidity.
Neither Ferrexpo plc the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is subject to externally imposed capital requirements otherthan a bank covenant requirement to maintain consolidated equity of the Group of US$500,000 thousand including non-controlling interests and excluding the translation reserve.
Compliance is ensured by balancing dividend payments against the earnings of the Group.
The Company is the Groups holding company, with no direct operating business, so its ability to make distributions to its shareholders is dependent on its ability to access profits held in the subsidiaries.
See Note 12 Earnings per share and dividends paid and proposed for further information.

STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 153 Note 27: Share-based payments Accounting policy Equity-settled transactions The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value of the award at the grant date using modelling techniques consistent with the mathematics underlying the Black-Scholes option pricing model extended to allow for the performance conditions.
The fair value is determined by reference to the quoted closing share price on the grant date.
The cost is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, except for market conditions, such as the relative Total Shareholder Return TSR.
Where the vesting of awards is subject to the satisfaction of certain market conditions, a vesting charge is recognised irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Where awards terminate before the performance period is complete, any unamortised expense is recognised immediately.
At each reporting date, the cumulative expense of outstanding awards is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and managements best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions and of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous reporting date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in employee benefit trust reserve in equity.
Long-term incentive plan LTIP The LTIP is a share-based scheme whereby certain senior management and executives receive rewards based on the relative TSR.
The LTIP is subject to a performance condition based on the TSR compared to a comparator group, which operate in a similar environment, measured over the vesting period.
Further description is provided in the Remuneration Report.
The cost of equity-settled awards is measured as described above together with an estimate of future social security contributions payable in respect of this value.
The following number of share awards were granted under the LTIP in the previous financial years.
The LTIP vesting period is three years.

They are disclosed unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote.
A contingent asset is not recognised in the consolidated financial statements but disclosed when an inflow of economic benefits is probable.
Leases The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at inception date, i. e. whether fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset, even if that right is not specified in an arrangement.
Group as a lessee Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance costs and the amortisation of the lease liability in order to achieve a constant interest rate on the remaining outstanding lease liability.
Finance costs are recognised in the income statement.
Leased assets are generally depreciated over the useful life of the asset.
If there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 155 Note 29: Commitments, contingencies and legal disputes continued Operating lease commitments Group as lessee Future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases as at 31 December 2018 are as follows: Year ended Year ended US$000 31.12.18 31.12.17 Less than one year 2,807 2,569 Between one and five years 4,587 4,542 More than five years 1,433 2,271 Total operating lease commitments 8,827 9,382 In addition, the Group has future commitments for contingent lease payments of US$36,428 thousand 2017: US$33,088 thousand, which are dependent on non-fixed rates.
During the year ended 31 December 2018, US$2,903 thousand was recognised as an expense in the income statement in respect of operating leases 2017: US$2,291 thousand.
The Group leases land and buildings under operating leases.
The leases on land run up to 49 years and with a lease period of five to ten years on buildings.
On transition date, lease liabilities of US$7,645 thousand will be recognised within net debt along with corresponding right-of-use assets.

For the year ended 31 December 2018, the Group made charitable contributions of US$9,500 thousand to the Charity 2017: US$24,000 thousand.
Donations were ceased in May 2018.
The Group has made donations to the Charity over the last 6 years totalling US$110,000 thousand.
Further details on the Groups relationship with the Charity, including the Independent Review currently being conducted, are provided in the Independent Review Committee Report page 69 and see also Principal Risks page 45, Responsible Business page 59, Corporate Governance Report page 63, Audit Committee Report page 71, and Note 7 Operating expenses, Note 33 Related party disclosures and Note 34 Events after the reporting period to the consolidated financial statements.
A number of critical judgements have been made in relation to the Groups relationship with the Charity.
These are disclosed in: Note 7 Operating expenses nature of Groups community support donations: and Note 33 Related party disclosures completeness.
Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 156 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Note 29: Commitments, contingencies and legal disputes continued As noted in the Independent Review Committee Report on page 69, the Independent Review is ongoing.
The Group may be exposed to the risk of civil, criminal or regulatory actions and liabilities including fines and penalties may accrue to the Group arising from the Groups relationship with the Charity, including without limitation in the following scenarios: if any of the critical judgements outlined in Note 7 Operating expenses and or Note 33 Related party disclosures are incorrect, in whole or in part: if funds donated to the Charity have been misapplied, including through misappropriation, with or without the knowledge or involvement of Ferrexpo personnel and or in circumstances where the Charity is considered to be performing services for or on behalf of the Group: if the Group or any of its personnel have derived any direct or indirect benefit from the Charity: and if the financial statements for the current or prior periods omit related party or other disclosures that ought to have been made or the financial statements need to be restated.
At the current time, the existence, timing and quantum of potential future liability, if any, including fines, penalties or damages, which could be material or other consequences arising from the Independent Review cannot be determined and measured reliably and, as a consequence, no associated liabilities have been recognised in relation to these matters in the consolidated statement of financial position as of 31 December 2018.
Legal In the ordinary course of business, the Group is subject to legal actions and complaints.
Management believes that the ultimate liability, if any, arising from such actions or complaints will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or the results of future operations of the Group.
Deposit Guarantee Fund and liquidator of Bank F&C The Groups former transactional bank in Ukraine, Bank F&C BFC, is still going through the liquidation process after having been declared insolvent by the National Bank of Ukraine and put under temporary administration on 18 September 2015.
The Group, through its major subsidiaries in Ukraine, is engaged in various court proceedings with the aim to maximise its recovery in the liquidation process of BFC as disclosed below.
Following the commencement of the liquidation process of BFC and in accordance with the applicable local legislation, PJSC Ferrexpo Poltava Mining FPM, LLC Ferrexpo Yeristovo Mining FYM and LLC Ferrexpo Belanovo Mining FBM, collectively referred to as Ukrainian subsidiaries, submitted on 21 January 2016 their claims for cash and deposit balances held with BFC on the date of introduction of temporary administration totalling UAH4,262 million US$153,929 thousand as of 31 December 2018.
On 22 April 2016, the liquidator of BFC issued certificates recognising UAH540 million US$19,503 thousand as of 31 December 2018 of these claims and recognised these claims in the ninth rank.
The aforementioned Ukrainian subsidiaries are currently involved in legal proceedings in respect of the under-recognition of the claims amounting to UAH3,722 million US$134,426 thousand as of 31 December 2018 and the ranking of the claims in the liquidation process.
The court proceedings commenced in October 2016 and, following various hearings during the financial year 2017, the relevant court instance dismissed on 25 October 2017 FPMs claim in full.
FPM filed an appeal on 13 November 2017 and several hearings took place following the filing of FPMs appeal without a ruling on the parties motions by the Kyiv Commercial Court of Appeal.
During the hearing on 18 July 2018, the court ruled in favour of FPM and the counterparty subsequently filed its cassation appeal against this decision.
On 11 December 2018, the Supreme Court of Ukraine upheld the cassation appeal and the case was directed for new consideration to the Northern Commercial Court of Appeal.
The case was heard by the Northern Commercial Court of Appeal on 27 March 2019 without a decision taken during this first hearing.
The next hearing is scheduled for 22 April 2019.
FYMs claim on the same matter was dismissed by the Kyiv Commercial Court on 6 February 2019 and FYM filed its appeal against this decision on 28 February 2019.
The first hearing at the Northern Commercial Court of Appeal took place on 15 April 2019 without a decision taken.
The next hearing is scheduled for 20 May 2019.
In relation to the claims of FBM, the Northern Commercial Court of Appeal dismissed FBMs appeal on 11 March 2019 and FBM filed its cassation appeal on 2 April 2019.
Note 30: Share capital and reserves Accounting policy Ordinary Shares Ordinary Shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of Ordinary Shares and share options are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.
Employee benefit trust reserve Ferrexpo plc shares held by the Group are recognised at cost and classified in reserves.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from the sale and the original cost to be recorded in reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on the purchase, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Treasury shares Own equity instruments, which are reacquired treasury shares, are recognised at cost and deducted from equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Groups own equity instruments.
Any difference between the carrying amount and the consideration is recognised in reserves.
Translation reserve The translation reserve represents exchange differences arising on the translation of non-US Dollar functional currency operations, mainly those in Ukrainian Hryvnia, within the Group into US Dollars.
Information on the Groups share capital and reserves is provided on the following page.
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 157 Note 30: Share capital and reserves continued Share capital Share capital represents the nominal value on issue of the Companys equity share capital, comprising 0.10 Ordinary Shares.
The fully paid share capital of Ferrexpo plc at 31 December 2018 was 613,967,956 Ordinary Shares 2017: 613,967,956 at a par value of 0.10 paid for in cash, resulting in share capital of US$121,628 thousand 2017: US$121,628 thousand per the statement of financial position.

Treasury share reserve In September 2008, Ferrexpo plc completed a buyback of 25,343,814 shares for a total cost of US$77,260 thousand.
These shares are currently held as treasury shares by the Group.
The Companies Act 2006 forbids the exercise of any rights including voting rights and the payment of dividends in respect of treasury shares.
Employee benefit trust reserve This reserve represents the treasury shares held by Ferrexpo AG setting up an employee benefit trust reserve.
The reserve is used to satisfy future grants for senior management incentive schemes.
Information on the Groups share-based payments is provided in Note 27 Share-based payments.
As at 31 December 2018, the employee benefit trust reserve includes 2,326,256 shares 2017: 2,916,419 shares.
Translation reserve During the financial year 2018, the Ukrainian Hryvnia appreciated from 28.067 as at the beginning of the year to 27.688 as at 31 December 2018 and the exchange differences arising on translation of the Groups foreign operations are initially recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income.
Note 31: Consolidated subsidiaries Accounting policy Entities are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of obtaining control and the inclusion in the consolidated financial statements is consequently ceased when the control over an entity is lost.
Control is obtained when the Group is exposed, or has the rights, to variable returns from its involvement with an entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity that gives the current ability to direct the relevant activities.
Control can be obtained through voting rights, but also through agreements, statutes, contracts, trust deeds or other schemes.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are shown separately in the Groups consolidated statement of financial position and consolidated statement of changes in equity.
The share of the profit attributable to non-controlling interests is shown in the consolidated income statement and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The Group comprises Ferrexpo plc and its consolidated subsidiaries.
The Groups interests in the entities are held indirectly by the Company, with the exception of Ferrexpo AG, which is directly held.
The Groups equity interests are 100% for all its major consolidated subsidiaries, except for FPM.
The interest that non-controlling interests have in the Groups operations are not material and are predominantly related to FPM.
No significant judgements and assumptions were required to determine that the Group has control over these entities.
The Groups consolidated subsidiaries are listed on page 168.
The Group does not have any other interests of 20% or more in undertakings that are not disclosed on page 168, except for the investment in the associate mentioned in Note 32 Investments in associates.
Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 158 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Note 32: Investments in associates Accounting policy The Groups investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
An associate is an entity, in which the Group has significant influence and which is neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture.
Under the equity method, the investment in the associate is carried in the statement of financial position at cost plus any post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of net assets of the associate.
Goodwill relating to an associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is not amortised nor individually tested for impairment.
After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise any additional impairment loss with respect to the Groups investment in the associate.
The share of profit from an associate is shown on the face of the income statement.
This is the profit attributable to the Group and is therefore the profit after tax and non-controlling interests in the subsidiaries of the associate.
The reporting dates of the associates and the Group are identical and the associates accounting policies are generally in conformity with those applied by the Group.
The Group also holds an interest of 49.5% 2017: 49.5% in TIS Ruda LLC, operating a port on the Black Sea, which the Group uses as part of its distribution channel.

The figures in the table above represent 100% of the associates revenue and net profit and not the Groups share based on its ownership.
As at 31 December 2018, the associates total assets were US$15,531 thousand 2017: US$13,481 thousand and the total liabilities were US$1,428 thousand 2017: US$1,563 thousand based on preliminary and unaudited statutory accounts.
Any deviations from the Groups share in the associates equity based on the audited financial statements is adjusted subsequent to the year-end once the audited financial statements are available.
Note 33: Related party disclosures During the periods presented, the Group entered into arms length transactions with entities under the common control of the majority owner of the Group, Kostyantin Zhevago, with associated companies and with other related parties.
Management considers that the Group has appropriate procedures in place to identify, control, properly disclose and obtain independent confirmation, when relevant, for transactions with the related parties.
Entities under common control are those under the control of Kostyantin Zhevago.
Associated companies refer to TIS Ruda LLC, in which the Group holds an interest of 49.5% 2017: 49.5%.
This is the only associated company of the Group.
Other related parties are principally those entities controlled partially by Anatoly Trefilov who resigned as a member of the Supervisory Board of PJSC Ferrexpo Poltava Mining as of 19 April 2017.
In accordance with the Listing Rules, all transactions with the entities controlled by Anatoly Trefilov within one year of his resignation from the Supervisory Board have been still considered as related party transactions and disclosed as such.
Effective 20 April 2018, the companies controlled by Anatoly Trefilov are no longer considered as related parties.
The payments made to the Non-executive Directors and Executive Directors are disclosed in the Remuneration Report on pages 85 and 86.
Critical judgements Completeness The Board concluded that neither the Chief Executive Officer nor the Groups executive management control or exercise significant influence over Blooming Land or its sub-funds the Charity pursuant to relevant accounting standards IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements and IAS 28 Investments in joint ventures and associates or under Chapter 11 of the UK Listing Rules.

Khimreaktiv LLC, controlled by Kostyantin Zhevago, the CEO and ultimate majority shareholder of Ferrexpo, also independently donated funds to the Charity.
In July 2018, the Board received notification from Deloitte that, as part of their interim review relating to donations made by the Group to Blooming Land in 2018, Deloitte had discovered that, according to copy bank statements, in 2017 temporary funding contributions totalling approximately US$16,300 thousand were advanced by Khimreaktiv LLC into one of the Charitys sub-funds.
The Charity subsequently repaid Khimreaktiv LLC using monies received from the Group as part of its regular donations.
These transactions between Khimreaktiv LLC and the sub-fund were considered related party transactions under IAS 24 Related party disclosures that ought previously to have been disclosed.
The transactions between the sub-funds and Khimreaktiv LLC were not considered to be related party transactions of the Group under the UK Listing Rules.
These copy bank statements and all related transactions shown are being further considered as part of the ongoing Independent Review.
The Charity is considered by the Group to operate independently of its Chief Executive Officer and its executive management, and its Chief Executive Officer and its executive management are not considered to control or exercise significant influence over the Charity.
Accordingly, the Charity is not consolidated by the Group.
There is no agreement or arrangement between the Group and Khimreaktiv LLC in relation to their contributions to the Charity.

An Independent Review Committee IRC was established and the work of the IRC and its advisers in the UK and Ukraine remains ongoing.
As of the date of this report, the IRC has made progress in receiving explanations regarding the differences contained in the copy bank statements, provided by the Charity as well as the receipt of third party evidence, including governmental confirmations that could explain some but not all of the possible discrepancies in the application of funds by the Charity.
The IRC is undertaking further work to corroborate these explanations and evidence, however, there are indications that some could have been misappropriated.
