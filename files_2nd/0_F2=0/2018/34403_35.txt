Taxation Current and deferred income tax What critical judgements and estimates do we make in accounting for taxation?
We seek to pay tax in accordance with the laws of the countries where we do business.
However, in some areas these laws are unclear, and it can take many years to agree an outcome with a tax authority or through litigation.
We estimate our tax on country-by-country and issue-by-issue bases.
Our key uncertainties are whether EEs tax losses will be available to us, whether our intra-group trading model will be accepted by a particular tax authority and whether intra-group payments are subject to withholding taxes.
We provide for the most likely outcome where an outflow is probable, but the agreed amount can differ materially from our estimates.
Approximately 80% by value of the provisions are under active tax authority examination and are therefore likely to be re-estimated or resolved in the coming 12 months.
240m 2016 17: 281m is included in current tax liabilities in relation to these uncertainties.
Under a downside case an additional amount of 471m could be required, of which 382m would relate to EE losses.
This amount is not provided as we dont consider this outcome to be probable.
Deciding whether to recognise deferred tax assets is judgemental.
We only recognise them when we consider it is probable that they can be recovered.
In making this judgement we consider evidence such as historical financial performance, future financial plans and trends, the duration of existing customer contracts and whether our intra-group pricing model has been agreed by the relevant tax authority.
The value of the groups income tax assets and liabilities is disclosed on the Group balance sheet on page 108.
The value of the groups deferred tax assets and liabilities, including the deferred tax asset recognised in respect of EE Limiteds historical tax losses, is disclosed below.
