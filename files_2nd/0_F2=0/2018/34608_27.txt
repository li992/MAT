Strategic Report Governance Financials Notes to the Financial Statements 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES General information Card Factory plc the Company is a public limited company incorporated in the United Kingdom.
The Company is domiciled in the United Kingdom and its registered office is Century House, Brunel Road, 41 Industrial Estate, Wakefield WF2 0XG.
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
Basis of preparation The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU EU IFRS and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under EU IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, as modified for the subsequent measurement of derivative financial instruments.
Significant judgements and estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with EU IFRS requires the use of judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the Groups accounting policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to estimates are recognised prospectively.
Areas subject to significant judgement, assumption or estimation are detailed below: Inventories The Group holds significant volumes, and a broad range of inventory.
Certain of the Groups inventory procedures are manual in nature.
The Group provides against the carrying value of inventories where it is anticipated the amount realised may be below the cost recognised.
The provision estimate is calculated based on historical experience.
Foreign currency hedge accounting Where appropriate, hedge accounting is adopted by the Group.
Due to the degree of judgement in determining forecast cash flows there is a risk that the assumptions made in the effectiveness testing are inappropriate.
Going concern Taking into account current and anticipated trading performance, current and anticipated levels of borrowings and the availability of borrowing facilities and exposures to and management of the financial risks detailed in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 33, the Board is of the opinion that, at the time of approval of these financial statements, there is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the period outlined in the Viability Statement on pages 70 to 71.
Accordingly, the financial statements continue to be prepared on a going concern basis.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Chief Financial Officers Review on pages 20 to 23.
In addition, notes 23 and 24 to the financial statements include the Companys objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Chief Financial Officers Review on pages 20 to 23 provides further detail on the Boards current view on capital policy.
Principal accounting policies The principal accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
EU Endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards effective in the year The following new and amended standards, adopted in the current financial year, had no significant impact on the financialstatements.
Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses Amendments to IAS 12 : Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2014 2016 cycle: and Disclosure Initiative Amendments to IAS 7.
EU Endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards in issue but not yet effective The Directors considered the impact on the Group of EU endorsed, new and revised accounting standards, interpretations or amendments.
The following new and revised accounting standards are currently endorsed but effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 unless otherwise stated.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: IFRS 9 Financial instruments: IFRS 16 Leases effective 1 January 2019 : and IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-Based Payment Transactions.
Card Factory plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 83 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED IFRS 15 IFRS 15 revenue from contracts with customers introduces principles to recognise revenue by allocation of the transaction price to performance obligations and is effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2018.
Adoption of the standard will not materially impact the measurement or recognition of items in the financial statements, however additional disclosures will be required.
IFRS 9 IFRS 9 financial instruments sets out requirements for recognising and measuring financial assets and financial liabilities and replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Classification of financial assets IFRS 9 contains a new classification and measurement approach for financial assets that reflects the business model in which assets are managed and the cash flow characteristics of the assets.
IFRS 9 contains three principal classification categories for financial assets: measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income and fair value through profit or loss.
The standard eliminates the existing IAS 39 categories of held to maturity, loans and receivables and available for sale.
Based on its assessment, the Group believes that the new classification requirements will not impact the accounting for its financial assets.
Impairment of financial assets IFRS 9 replaces the incurred loss model in IAS 39 with a forward-looking expected credit loss model.
The new impairment model will apply to financial assets measured at amortised cost.
Revenue from retail customers represents over 99% of Group revenues and consequently trade and other receivables measured at amortised cost are not material to the financial statements.
Based on its assessment, the Group believes that there is no material impact on the financial statements from adopting IFRS 9 in respect of expected credit losses.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents at 31 January 2018 were held with banks rated a3 to baa3 per Moodys baseline credit assessment and are not subject to any period of notice.
The Group typically maintains a net overdrawn cash position as part of its RCF funding arrangement.
Cash and cash equivalents held outside the RCF are of low value and based on its assessment, the Group believes that there is no material impact on the financial statements from adopting IFRS 9 in respect of expected credit losses.
Classification of financial liabilities IFRS 9 largely retains the existing requirements in IAS 39 for the classification of financial liabilities.
The Group believes that the classification requirements of IFRS 9 will not impact the financial statements.
Hedge accounting On initial adoption of IFRS9, the Group may choose as its accounting policy to continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 instead of the requirements in IFRS 9.
The Group has chosen to apply the new requirements of IFRS 9.
IFRS 9 requires the Group to ensure that hedge accounting relationships are aligned with the Groups risk management objectives and strategy and to apply a more qualitative and forward-looking approach to assessing hedge effectiveness.
IFRS 9 also introduces new requirements on rebalancing hedge relationships and prohibiting voluntary discontinuation of hedge accounting.
Under the new model, it is possible that more risk management strategies may qualify for hedge accounting, though eligibility for hedge accounting of the Groups existing hedging activities have been assessed as unchanged.
Foreign exchange hedge accounting The Group utilises foreign currency derivative contracts and US Dollar denominated cash balances to manage the foreign exchange risk on US Dollar denominated inventory purchases.
The Group designates only the change in the fair value of the spot element of forward currency contracts as the hedging instrument in cash flow hedging relationships.
Under IAS 39, the change in fair value of the forward element of the forward currency contract forward points is recognised immediately in profit or loss presented as a non-underlying item, see notes 1 and 3 to the financial statements.
On adoption of IFRS 9, the Group has elected to separately account for the forward points as a cost of hedging.
Consequently, the changes in forward points will be recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a cost of hedging reserve as a separate component within equity and subsequently recognised into the hedged inventory purchase value.
The Group does not intend to apply the transitional option to retrospectively apply this treatment.
The Group will also require an amendment to the accounting policy in respect of cash flow hedge accounting.
Gains or losses recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of a cash flow hedge of a forecast transaction that results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability would be required to be included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
The current accounting policy recognises such gains or losses in profit or loss in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction, or a resulting asset or liability, affects profit or loss, but does not recognise the gain or loss in the initial measurement of a resulting asset or liability.
84 Card Factory plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic Report Governance Financials Interest rate hedge accounting The Group utilises interest rate derivative contracts to manage the risk on floating rate bank borrowings.
The Group designates only the change in the fair value of the intrinsic element of interest rate caps as the hedging instrument in cash flow hedging relationships.
Under IAS 39, the change in fair value of the time value element of the interest rate cap is recognised immediately in profit or loss presented as a non-underlying item until the date of the hedged cash flow, see notes 1 and 3 to the financialstatements.
On adoption of IFRS 9, the Group has elected to separately account for the time value as a cost of hedging.
Consequently, the changes in time value will be recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a cost of hedging reserve as a separate component within equity and reclassified to profit or loss on the date of the hedged cash flow.
IFRS 9 mandates retrospective application of this treatment.
Transition Changes in accounting policies resulting from adoption of IFRS 9 will generally be applied retrospectively, except as described below: The Group intends to take advantage of the exemption allowing it not to restate comparative information for prior periods with respect to classification and measurement changes including impairment.
Differences in carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 would be recognised as an adjustment to opening reserves.
The new hedge accounting requirements are applied prospectively except for the retrospective application of the time value element of interest rate caps.
The comparative period will therefore be restated in respect of hedge accounting for the time value element of interest rate caps.
Impact on the financial statements The impact on the financial statements is shown below.
2018 2017 m m Net Assets Inventories 0.4 Equity Hedging reserve 0.4 Cost of hedging reserve 0.3 0.3 Retained earnings 0.3 0.3 0.4 The impact on finance expense in the FY18 income statement is less than 0.1m.
IFRS 16 IFRS 16 leases will replace IAS 17 leases and related interpretations and requires entities to apply a single lessee accounting model, with lessees recognising right of use assets and lease liabilities on balance sheet for all applicable leases.
Adoption of the standard will have a material impact on the reported assets and liabilities in the financial statements.
The operating lease commitments disclosed in note 22 of the financial statements principally relate to property leases and some vehicle leases, all of which will meet the definition of a lease under IFRS 16.
The Group does not believe there are any contracts not included in the operating lease note that would qualify as a lease under IFRS 16.
Under IAS 17 operating lease costs were expensed to the income statement.
Under IFRS 16 a depreciation charge will be made against the right of use assets and an interest charge incurred against the lease liability.
Any timing differences between operating lease costs previously expensed under IAS 17 and depreciation and interest charges under IFRS 16 will impact profit reported in the income statement.
The EBITDA profit measure defined in note 5 to the financial statements will increase by approximately the operating lease costs identified in note 4 to the financial statements, subject to a non-material element qualifying as low value or short-term leases under IFRS 16 and continuing to be expensed to the income statement as operating lease costs.
The Group continues to assess the impact of adopting the standard under the different transitional options available.
Full retrospective application would provide both a restated comparative period and a more consistent year on year charge to the income statement than the alternative modified transitional options.
The assessment of a full retrospective application including all leases and lease events back to the date of lease commencement is not yet complete.
Card Factory plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 85 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED IFRS 2 Amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based payments have been issued in relation to the classification and measurement of particular share-based payment transactions.
The amendments relate to accounting for the effects of vesting conditions on the measurement of a cash-settled share-based payment, classification of share-based payment transactions with a net settlement feature for withholding tax obligations and accounting for a modification to the terms and conditions of a share-based payment that changes the classification of the transaction from cash-settled to equity-settled.
Adoption of the standard will not have a material impact on the financial statements.
International Financial Reporting Standards in issue but not yet effective and not EU endorsed The future impact on the financial statements of new standards and amendments awaiting EU endorsement is currently being assessed but is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to direct the activities that affect those returns through its power over the entity.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases.
Intercompany transactions and balances between Group companies are eliminated upon consolidation.
Business combinations Subject to the transitional relief in IFRS 1, all business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
The Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as the fair value of the consideration transferred less the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
Costs related to the acquisition are expensed to the income statement as incurred.
Acquisitions prior to 1 February 2011 date of transition to IFRS IFRS 1 grants certain exemptions from the full requirements of IFRS in the transition period.
The Group and Company elected not to restate business combinations that took place prior to 1 February 2011.
In respect of acquisitions prior to the transition date, goodwill is included at 1 February 2011 on the basis of its deemed cost at that date, which represents the amount recorded under UK GAAP.
Revenue Revenue represents the fair value of amounts receivable for goods sold to customers and is stated net of value added tax and returns.
Revenue is recognised at the point goods are sold or delivered and the risks and rewards are deemed to have been transferred to the customer.
Revenue is attributable to the retail sale of cards, dressings and gifts.
Finance income and expense Finance expense comprises interest charges and losses on interest rate derivative financial instruments.
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that takes a substantial time to be prepared for use, are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset.
Finance income comprises interest income and gains on interest rate derivative financial instruments.
Interest income and interest expense are recognised in profit or loss as it accrues, using the effective interest method.
The effective interest method takes into account fees, commissions or other incremental transaction costs integral to the yield.
Foreign currencies Functional and presentation currency The consolidated financial statements are presented in pound Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company.
Foreign operations The Group has one foreign subsidiary with a Euro functional currency.
The activities of foreign operations are not material to the Group.
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Sterling at year-end exchange rates.
The results of foreign operations are translated into Sterling at average rates of exchange for the year.
Transactions and balances Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate on the transaction date.
All currency transactions that are not in the functional currency of the trading entity relate to inventory purchases.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement within cost of sales, except when deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges.
Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis.
86 Card Factory plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic Report Governance Financials Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or through other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised in equity or other comprehensive income respectively.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
Underlying profit and earnings The Group has chosen to present an underlying profit and earnings measure.
The Group believes that underlying profit and earnings information enables shareholders to make more meaningful comparisons of performance year-on-year.
Underlying earnings is not a recognised profit measure under EU IFRS and may not be directly comparable with adjusted profit measures reported by other companies.
The reported non-underlying adjustments are as follows: Net fair value remeasurement gains and losses on derivative financial instruments The Group utilises foreign currency derivative contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk on US Dollar denominated purchases and interest rate derivative contracts to manage the risk on floating interest rate bank borrowings.
Fair value gains and losses on such instruments are recognised in the income statement to the extent they are not hedge accounted under IAS 39.
Such gains and losses relate to future cash flows.
In accordance with the commercial reasoning for entering into the agreements, these gains losses are deemed not representative of the underlying financial performance in the year and presented as non-underlying items.
Any gains or losses on maturity of such instruments are presented within underlying profit to the extent the gain or loss is not recognised in the hedging reserve.
EPOS asset disposals and accelerated depreciation Electronic point of sale EPOS software implemented over recent years was upgraded with a replacement system offering enhanced capabilities.
The resulting loss on disposal of redundant assets and accelerated depreciation arising on assets to be replaced in advance of their original estimated useful economic life were considered a one-off event and not representative of underlying performance for the prior year.
As such they were presented as a non-underlying item in the prior period.
Other non-underlying operating expenses In January 2016, Card Factory plc announced the retirement and succession of the CEO and in January 2017 announced the retirement and succession of the CFO.
Costs attributable to recruitment and dual remuneration costs during the handover periods are presented as non-underlying items.
Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved.
Financial instruments Financial assets The Group classifies all its non-derivative financial assets as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
The Group has no intention of trading these loans and receivables.
Subsequent to initial recognition at fair value less transaction costs, these assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method, subject to impairment.
Derivative financial assets are categorised as fair value through profit or loss FVTPL and classified as held for trading, unless accounted for as an effective hedging instrument.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Non derivative financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value, less any transaction costs and subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method except for derivatives and contingent consideration.
Derivatives are categorised as FVTPL and classified as held for trading, unless accounted for as an effective hedging instrument.
Card Factory plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 87 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Non-derivative financial instruments Non-derivative financial instruments comprise trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, borrowings and trade and other payables.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, at bank and on short-term deposit for less than three months.
Bank overdrafts, within borrowings, that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the cash flow statement.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Impairment of financial assets Financial assets are assessed for objective evidence of impairment at the balance sheet date.
Where there is objective evidence that an impairment loss exists, impairment provisions are made to reduce the carrying value of financial assets to the present value of estimated future cash flows.
Derivative financial instruments The Group utilises foreign currency derivative contracts and US Dollar denominated cash balances to manage the foreign exchange risk on US Dollar denominated purchases and interest rate derivative contracts to manage the risk on floating interest rate bank borrowings.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately within profit or loss except to the extent the instrument has been designated an effective hedging arrangement.
Derivative financial instruments not designated as effective hedging relationships principally relate to structured foreign exchange options that form part of the foreign exchange risk management policy detailed in note 23 of the financial statements.
The Group designates only the intrinsic value of interest rate caps as a hedging relationship.
Gains and losses in respect of foreign currency derivative contracts are recognised within cost of sales.
Gains and losses in respect of interest rate derivative contracts are recognised within finance income or expense.
Cash flow hedges In accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, derivative financial instruments are eligible for cash flow hedge accounting where the following conditions are met: at the inception of the hedge there is formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship and the entitys risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge: the hedge is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, consistent with the originally documented risk management strategy: the forecast transaction that is the subject of the hedge is highly probable and presents an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect profit or loss: the effectiveness of the hedge can be reliably measured: and the hedge is assessed on an ongoing basis and determined actually to have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which the hedge was designated.
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in the hedging reserve.
Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Foreign currency cash held in the short period between derivative maturity and payment of the hedged cash flow is designated as part of the hedging relationship whereby gains and losses on retranslation of the foreign currency cash are recognised in the hedging reserve.
The cumulative gain or loss is removed from other comprehensive income OCI and recognised in profit or loss in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction, or a resulting asset or liability affects profit or loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in OCI and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in OCI is recognised in profit or loss immediately.
88 Card Factory plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic Report Governance Financials Fair value estimation The techniques applied in determining the fair values of financial assets and liabilities are disclosed in note 24.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives as follows: buildings 25 50 years leasehold improvements shorter of 5 years and lease term plant and equipment 3 10 years fixtures and fittings 5 years motor vehicles 4 years Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date.
Intangible assets and goodwill Goodwill Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
Software Computer software is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any provision for impairment.
Costs relating to development of computer software are capitalised if the recognition criteria of IAS38 Intangible Assets are met or expensed as incurred otherwise.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and less accumulated impairment losses.
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite.
Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill are systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date.
Other intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use.
The estimated useful life of software is 35 years.
Impairment of non-financial assets The carrying values of non-financial assets are reviewed for impairment where there is an indication of impairment.
If an impairment loss arises, the asset value is adjusted to its estimated recoverable amount and the impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the balance sheet date and whenever an indication of impairment is identified.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is based on the first-in first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories, production costs and other costs in bringing them to their existing location and condition.
In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity.
Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds.
Merger reserve On 30 April 2014 Card Factory plc acquired 100% of the share capital of CF Topco Limited in a share for share exchange, thereby inserting Card Factory plc as the Parent Company of the Group.
The shareholders of CF Topco Limited became 100% owners of the enlarged share capital of Card Factory plc.
The premium arising on the issue of shares is recognised in the merger reserve.
Share-based payments The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to employees through the Card Factory Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and the Card Factory SAYE Scheme SAYE, see note 25 for further details.
The cost of equity-settled share awards is measured as the fair value of the award at the grant date using the Black-Scholes model.
The cost of the awards is expensed to the income statement, together with a corresponding adjustment to equity, on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award.
The total income statement charge is based on the Groups estimate of the number of share awards that will eventually vest in accordance with the vesting conditions.
The awards do not include marketbased vesting conditions.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of awards that are expected to vest.
Any revision to estimates is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Card Factory plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 89 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Operating leases Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives are recognised in the income statement over the term of the lease as an integral part of the total leaseexpense.
2 SEGMENTAL REPORTING The Group has two operating segments trading under the names Card Factory and Getting Personal.
Card Factory retails greeting cards, dressing and gifts principally through an extensive UK store network.
Getting Personal is an online retailer of personalised cards and gifts.
Getting Personal does not meet the quantitative thresholds of a reportable segment as defined in IFRS 8.
Consequently the results of the Group are presented as a single reportable segment.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker is the Board of Directors.
Internal management reports are reviewed by the Board of Directors on a monthly basis.
Performance of segments is assessed based on a number of financial and non-financial KPIs including EBITDA as defined in note 5 of the financial statements and profit before tax.
Major customers Group revenue is derived from high volume, low value retail sales and is therefore not dependent on any major customer.

10 EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the period attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.
Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares in issue for the period, adjusted for the dilutive effect of potential ordinary shares.
Potential ordinary shares represent employee share incentive awards and save as you earn share options.

Value-in-use calculations are based on 5 year management forecasts and operating cash flows with a 2% 2017: 2% terminal growth rate applied thereafter, representing managements estimate of the long-term growth rate of the sector.
The key assumptions used to forecast operating cash flows include: sales growth, based on historic performance and latest forecasts: product mix: foreign exchange rates, based on hedges in place and market forecasts for unhedged items: and the Groups current expectations in relation to efficiency initiatives.
The values assigned to each of these assumptions were determined based on historical performance of the Group and expected future trends.
The forecast cash flows are discounted at a pre-tax discount rate of 10% 2017: 10%.
No impairment loss was identified in the current year 2017: nil.
The valuations indicate sufficient headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions would not result in an impairment of the related goodwill.

23 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The principal financial risks faced by the Group are liquidity, foreign currency, interest rate and counterparty credit risk.
The Board have overall responsibility for managing risks and uncertainties across the Group.
The principal financial risks and uncertainties and the actions taken to mitigate them are reviewed on an on-going basis.
Further details of the Groups approach to managing risk are included in the Principal Risks and Uncertainties section of the Strategic Report on pages 24 to 27 and in the Corporate Governance Report on page 45.
Liquidity risk The Group generates significant operational cash inflows and can draw down on immediate request against a 200 million revolving credit facility.
At the balance sheet date the Group had undrawn RCF facilities of 35.0 million 2017: 59.7 million.
Cash flow forecasts are prepared to assist management in identifying future liquidity requirements.
Long-term bank funding is subject to certain agreed financial covenants.
The risk of a breach of these covenants is mitigated by regular financial forecasting, detailed covenant modelling and monitoring of covenant compliance.
As at 31 January 2018, the Group had adequate headroom against all of its financial covenants.
Further details on Group borrowings are set out in note 17 of the financial statements.

Bank borrowings are denominated in Sterling and are borrowed at floating interest rates.
The Group utilises interest rate derivative financial instruments to mitigate the interest rate risk on an element of these borrowing costs.
Current Group policy requires between 25% and 75% of forecast floating interest rate borrowings to be hedged for the next 24 months using interest rate derivative contracts and up to 50% for the period 24 to 36 months.

To mitigate the risk, counterparties are limited to high credit-quality financial institutions and exposures are monitored on a monthly basis.
Under the revised borrowing facility, Sterling cash balances are maintained at near zero to minimise interest expense on the RCF, thereby reducing counterparty credit risk on cash balances.
The Group is also exposed to counterparty credit risk in relation to payments in advance of goods to overseas suppliers.
At 31 January 2018 this exposure amounted to 0.4 million 2017: 0.9 million.
The Group utilises letters of credit for certain overseas suppliers, thereby reducing the total exposure to advance payments.
As a retail business the Group has minimal exposure to credit risk on trade receivables.
Capital management The Groups capital risk management policy is to maintain a capital structure that is conservative yet efficient in terms of providing long-term returns to shareholders.
The Group defines capital as equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent plus net debt.
The Group has a continued focus on free cash flow generation.
The Board monitors a range of financial metrics together withbanking covenant ratios, maintaining suitable headroom to ensure that the Groups financing requirements continue to beserviceable.
