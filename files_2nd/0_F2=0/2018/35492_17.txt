Tax on Ordinary Activities As an investment trust the Company pays no tax on capital gains.
As the Company invests principally in UK equities, it has little overseas tax and the overseas tax charge is the result of withholding tax deducted at source.
This note also clarifies the basis for the Company having no deferred tax asset or liability.

d Factors that may affect future tax changes The Company has surplus management expenses and losses on loan relationships of 447,424,000 2017: 436,223,000 that are available to offset future taxable revenue.
A deferred tax asset of 76,062,000 2017: 74,158,000, measured at the prospective rate of corporation tax of 17% 2017: 17%, has not been recognised in respect of these expenses since the Directors believe that there will be no taxable profits in the future against which the deferred tax assets can be offset.
Return per Ordinary Share Return per share is the amount of gain generated for the financial year divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue.
The basic, capital and total returns per ordinary share are based on each return on ordinary shares after tax and on 195,666,734 2017: 195,666,734 ordinary shares, being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.

Dividends on Ordinary Shares Dividends represent the distribution of income to shareholders.
The Company pays four dividends a year three interims and one final dividend.
Investments The portfolio comprises investments which are principally listed on a regulated stock exchange or traded on AIM.
A very small proportion of investments are valued by the Directors as they are unlisted or not regularly traded.
Gains or losses are either: realised, usually arising when investments are sold: or unrealised, being the difference from cost on those investments still held at the year end.

The Directors Report on page 36 sets out the Companys share capital structure, restrictions and voting rights.
Reserves This note explains the different reserves attributable to shareholders.
The aggregate of the reserves and share capital see previous note make up total shareholders funds.
The share premium comprises the net proceeds received by the Company following the issue of shares, after deduction of the nominal amount of 25 pence and any applicable issue costs.
The capital redemption reserve maintains the equity share capital of the Company and arose from the nominal value of any shares bought back and cancelled: both are non-distributable.
The capital reserve includes the investment holding gains losses, being the difference between cost and market value at the balance sheet date.
It also includes cumulative realised gains losses.
Capital investment gains and losses are shown in note 9 b and form part of the capital reserve.
The revenue reserve shows the net revenue retained after payment of any dividends.
The capital and revenue reserves are distributable by way of dividend.

Net Asset Value per Ordinary Share The Companys total net assets total assets less total liabilities are often termed shareholders funds and are converted into NAV per ordinary share by dividing by the number of shares in issue.
The NAV - debt at par is the NAV with the value of the 100 million debenture the debt at its nominal equivalent to the par value of 100 million.
The NAV - debt at market value reflects the debenture stock at the value that a third party would be prepared to pay for the debt, and this amount fluctuates owing to various factors including changes in interest rates and the remaining life of the debt.
The number of ordinary shares in issue at the year end was 195,666,734 2017: 195,666,734. a NAV debt at par The shareholders funds in the balance sheet are accounted for in accordance with accounting standards: however, this does not reflect the rights of shareholders on a return of assets under the Articles of Association.
These rights are reflected in the net assets with debt at par and the corresponding NAV per share.

Risk Management and Financial Instruments Financial instruments comprise the Companys investment portfolio, derivative instruments if any as well as cash, and any borrowings, debtors and creditors.
This note sets out the Companys financial instruments and the risks related to them.
Financial instruments The Companys financial instruments mainly comprise its investment portfolio as shown on pages 18 and 19, a debenture, a bank loan as well as its cash, debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations such as sales and purchases awaiting settlement and accrued income.
For the purpose of this note cash should be taken to comprise cash and cash equivalents as defined in note 1d.
The accounting policies in note 1 include criteria for the recognition and the basis of measurement applied for financial instruments.
Note 1 also includes the basis on which income and expenses arising from financial assets and liabilities are recognised and measured.
The main financial risks that the Company faces from its financial instruments are market risk, liquidity risk, and credit risk.
These are set out below: Market risk arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument because of changes in market prices.
Market risk comprises three types of risk: currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk: Currency risk arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument because of changes in foreign exchange rates: Interest rate risk arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument because of changes in market interest rates: and 61 pp44-67 Financials 01 06 2018 12:02 Page 62 Financial Notes to the Financial Statements Other price risk arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument for reasons other than changes in foreign exchange rates or market interest rates.
Liquidity risk arising from any difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Credit risk arising from financial loss for a company where the other party to a financial instrument fails to discharge an obligation.
Risk Management Policies and Procedures The Directors have delegated to the Manager the responsibility for the day-to-day investment activities and management of gearing of the Company as more fully described in the Directors Report.
As an investment trust the Company invests in equities and other investments for the long-term so as to fulfil its investment policy incorporating the Companys investment objective.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction of the profits available for dividends.
These policies are summarised below and have remained substantially unchanged for the two years under review.
16.1 Market Risk The Companys Manager assesses the Companys exposure when making each investment decision, and monitors the overall level of market risk for the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
The Board has meetings in each calendar quarter to assess risk and review investment performance, as disclosed in the Board Responsibilities on page 30.
Any borrowing to gear the investment portfolio is used to enhance returns but also increases the Companys exposure to market risk and volatility.
The Company has the ability to gear by using its 100 million debenture stock 2022 and its bank facility of 150 million.
1 Currency risk The majority of the Companys assets and all of its liabilities are denominated in sterling.
There is some exposure to US dollar, Swiss franc and the Euro.
Management of the currency risk The Manager monitors the Companys direct exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the board on a regular basis.
Forward currency contracts can be used to reduce the Companys exposure to foreign currencies arising naturally from the Managers choice of securities.
All contracts are limited to currencies and amounts commensurate with the assets denominated in currencies.
No forward currency contracts were used during the year 2017: none.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
The Company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.
The Company may invest up to 20% of the portfolio in securities listed on non-UK stock exchanges.
At the year end holdings of non-UK securities total 122.4 million 2017: 270.2 million representing 8.0% 2017: 15.6% of the portfolio.
Currency exposure The fair values of the Companys monetary items that have currency exposure at 31 March are shown below.
Where the Companys equity investments which are not monetary items are priced in a foreign currency, they have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.
2018 2017 USD CHF EUR USD CHF EUR 000 000 000 000 000 000 Foreign currency exposure on net monetary items 507 1,603 97 1,312 1,169 Investments at fair value through profit or loss that are equities 53,489 68,894 184,163 86,075 Total net foreign currency exposure 53,996 70,497 97 185,475 87,244 The above may not be representative of the exposure to risk during the year, because the levels of foreign currency exposure may change significantly throughout the year.
Currency sensitivity In respect of the Companys direct foreign currency exposure to investments denominated in currencies, if sterling had weakened by 3.4% for the US dollar, 2.6% for the Swiss franc and 2.0% for the Euro during the year, the income statement capital return and net assets of the Company would have increased by 3.6 million 2017: 15.9 million.
Conversely, if sterling had strengthened by the same percentage for the currencies mentioned above, the capital return and net assets of the Company would have decreased by the same amount.
The exchange rate variances noted above have been based on the market volatility in the year, using the standard deviation of sterlings fluctuation to the applicable currency.
This sensitivity takes no account of any impact on the market values of the Companys investments arising from the foreign currency mix of their respective revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities.
62 pp44-67 Financials 01 06 2018 12:02 Page 63 The Edinburgh Investment Trust plc 16.1.
2 Interest rate risk Interest rate movements will affect the level of income receivable on cash deposits and money market funds, and the interest payable on variable rate borrowings.
When the Company has cash balances, they are held on variable rate bank accounts yielding rates of interest dependent on the base rate determined by the custodian, The Bank of New York Mellon.
The Company has in place a revolving credit facility the facility, details of which are shown in note 11.
The Company uses the facility when required at levels monitored by the Board.
At the maximum possible facility gearing of 150 million, the effect of a 1% increase decrease in the interest rate would result in a decrease increase to the Companys income of 1,500,000 p. a.
The Company also has an uncommitted bank overdraft facility which it uses for settlement purposes and interest is dependent on the base rate determined by the custodian.
At the year end, no amounts were overdrawn 2017: none.
The Companys debt of 100 million 2017: 100 million of debenture stock is fixed which exposes the Company to changes in market value in the event that the debt is repaid before maturity.
Details of the debenture stock interest is shown in note 12, with details of its market value and the affect on net asset value in note 15 b.
The Company can invest in fixed income securities although at the year end none were held 2017: nil.
Interest rate exposure At 31 March the exposure of financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to: floating interest rates giving cash flow interest rate risk when the interest rate is due to be re-set: and fixed interest rates giving fair value interest rate risk when the financial instrument is due for repayment.
2018 2017 Within Between Within More one one and one than year five years Total year five years Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates: Cash and cash equivalents 4,320 4,320 3,230 3,230 Bank facility 43,900 43,900 109,700 109,700 Exposure to fixed interest rates: Debenture, excluding unamortised discount and issue expenses 100,000 100,000 100,000 100,000 Total exposure to interest rates 39,580 100,000 139,580 106,470 100,000 206,470 16.1.
3 Other price risk Other price risks i. e. changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may affect the value of the equity investments, but it is the business of the portfolio manager to manage the portfolio to achieve the best return that he can.
Management of the other price risk The Directors manage the market price risks inherent in the investment portfolio by meeting regularly to monitor on a formal basis the Managers compliance with the Companys stated objectives and policies, and to review investment performance.
The Companys portfolio is the result of the Managers investment process and need not be highly correlated with the Companys benchmark or the market in which the Company invests.
The value of the portfolio will not move in line with the market but will move as a result of the performance of the company shares within the portfolio.
If the value of the portfolio fell by 10% at the balance sheet date, the profit after tax for the year and the net assets of the Company would decrease by 154 million 2017: 173 million.
Conversely, if the value of the portfolio rose by 10%, the profit after tax and the net assets of the Company would increase by the same amounts.

In addition, the Company has an overdraft facility which it can use to provide short-term funding flexibility.
Liquidity risk exposure The contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at the year end, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required, are as follows: More than three months three months but less than More than or less one year one year Total 2018 000 000 000 000 Debenture stock 100,000 100,000 Bank facility 43,900 43,900 Interest on debenture stock 7,750 27,125 34,875 Amounts due to brokers 3,131 3,131 Accruals 851 851 47,882 7,750 127,125 182,757 More than three months three months but less than More than or less one year one year Total 2017 000 000 000 000 Debenture stock 100,000 100,000 Bank facility 109,700 109,700 Interest on debenture stock 7,750 34,875 42,625 Amounts due to brokers 3,004 3,004 Accruals 888 888 113,592 7,750 134,875 256,217 16.3 Credit risk Credit risk encompasses the failure by counterparties to deliver securities which the Company has paid for, or to pay for securities which the Company has delivered, and cash balances.
Counterparty risk is minimised by using only approved counterparties.
The Companys ability to operate in the short-term may be adversely affected if the Companys custodian suffers insolvency or other financial difficulties.
However, with the support of the depositarys restitution obligation the risk of outright credit loss on the investment portfolio is remote.
The Board reviews the custodians annual controls report and the Managers management of the relationship with the custodian.
Cash balances are limited to a maximum of 1% of net assets with any one deposit taker, with only approved deposit takers being used, and a maximum deposit of 5% of net assets with Short-Term Investments Company Global Series plc, a triple-A rated money market fund.
These limits are at the discretion of the Board and are reviewed on a regular basis.

Fair Value The values of the financial assets and financial liabilities are carried either at their fair value investments, or at a reasonable approximation of fair value amounts due from brokers, dividends receivable, accrued income, amounts due to brokers, accruals, cash and any drawings on the bank facility or at amortised cost debenture.
Fair Value Hierarchy Disclosures All except two of the Companys portfolio of investments are in the Level 1 category as defined in FRS 102 as amended for fair value hierarchy disclosures March 16.
The three levels set out in this follow.
Level 1 the unadjusted quoted price in an active market for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable ie developed using market data for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 Inputs are unobservable ie for which market data is unavailable for the asset or liability.
Categorisation within the hierarchy is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of each relevant asset liability.
The valuation techniques used by the Company are explained in the accounting policies note.
One investment is shown in level 2 as a result of market inactivity: Barclays Bank Nuclear Power Notes 28 February 2019.
The investment in Level 3 is the result of a past corporate event on a listed security previously held: Eurovestech delisted from AIM.
The holdings of Barclays Bank - Nuclear Power Notes 28 February 2019 and Eurovestech did not change during the year.
The holding of Proximagen CVRs was written off in full because the rights expired on 31 August 2017 2017: Level 3 and valued at 173,000.

Capital Management The Company's total capital employed at 31 March 2018 was 1,542,639,000 2017: 1,743,501,000 comprising borrowings of 142,770,000 2017: 208,319,000 and equity share capital and other reserves of 1,399,869,000 2017: 1,535,181,000 The Companys total capital employed is managed to achieve the Companys objective and investment policy as set out on page 12, including that borrowings may be used to provide gearing of the equity portfolio up to the maximum authorised by shareholders, currently 25% of net assets.
Net gearing was 11.8% 2017: 15.7% at the balance sheet date.
The Companys policies and processes for managing capital were unchanged throughout the year and the preceding year.
The main risks to the Companys investments are shown in the Strategic Report under the Principal Risks and Uncertainties section on pages 14 to 16.
These also explain that the Company is able to use borrowings to gear and that gearing will amplify the effect on equity of changes in the value of the portfolio.
The board can also manage the capital structure directly since it has taken the powers, which it is seeking to renew, to issue and buy-back shares and it also determines dividend payments.
The Company is subject to externally imposed capital requirements with respect to the obligation and ability to pay dividends by section 1159 Corporation Tax Act 2010 and by the Companies Act 2006, respectively, and with respect to the availability of the facility by the terms imposed by the lender.
The Board regularly monitors, and has complied with, the externally imposed capital requirements.
This is unchanged from the prior year.
Borrowings comprise the debenture stock, details of which are contained in note 12, a bank facility and an overdraft facility which may be used for short-term funding requirements.
