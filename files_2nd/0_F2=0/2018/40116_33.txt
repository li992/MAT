NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2018 1.
General information and basis of preparation 1.1 General information SSE plc the Company is a company domiciled in Scotland.
The address of the registered office is given on the back cover.
The Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic Report.
The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2018 comprise those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about the Group, these can be seen on pages 228 to 239.
1.2 Basis of preparation Statement of compliance The financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 24 May 2018.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs and its interpretations as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and adopted by the European Union adopted IFRS.
Going concern The Directors consider that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The financial statements are therefore prepared on a going concern basis.
Further details of the Groups liquidity position and going concern review are provided in A6 Accompanying Information to the Financial Statements on page 220.
Basis of measurement The financial statements of the Group are prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments, available-for-sale financial assets and assets of the Group pension schemes which are stated at their fair value, and liabilities of the Group pension schemes which are measured using the projected unit credit method.
The directors believe the financial statements present a true and fair view.
The financial statements of the Group are presented in pounds sterling.
The basis for including operations and transactions conducted in currencies other than pounds sterling is provided in A1 Accompanying Information to the Financial Statements on page 200.
Use of estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements conforming with adopted IFRS requires the use of certain accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise judgement in the process of applying the accounting policies.
The areas involving a higher level of judgement or estimation are summarised at pages 155 to 157.
Changes to presentation During the year, the Group reviewed the presentation of its operating segments following the announcement of its intention to dispose of its GB domestic energy supply and energy related service activities through a demerger with npower.
The change to operating segments is a result of changes to management structure and internal reporting to the Board following the announcement.
Further information on the change to presentation of the operating segments is provided in Note 5.
New accounting policies and reporting changes The basis of consolidation and principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below and in the A1 Accompanying Information to the Financial Statements on pages 200 to 207.
All issued standards, amendments and interpretations of adopted IFRS, mandatory for the year ended 31 March 2018 and not early adopted, have been applied by the Group in the current year and have not had a material impact on the financial statements.
A number of standards have been issued but not yet adopted by the Group within these financial statements, because application is not yet mandatory or because adoption by the EU remains outstanding at this point in time: 2.1 IFRS 9 Financial instruments which has been endorsed by the European Union EU and will be effective from 1 January 2018 and thus 1 April 2018 for the Group This standard replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and sets out the requirements for recognising and measuring financial assets, financial liabilities and some contracts to buy or sell non-financial items.
The impact of adopting this standard can be summarised with reference to the three project phases: i Classification and measurement The standard adopts a principles based approach to classify financial assets on the basis of the business model within which they are held and their contractual cash flow characteristics.
Following this approach, financial assets will be classified as measured at amortised cost, fair value through profit and loss or fair value through other comprehensive income.
For financial liabilities, the classification and measurement requirements under IAS 39 have been carried forward essentially unchanged, with the majority of financial liabilities being classified as measured at amortised cost.
Whilst financial assets and liabilities will be classified into the categories required by IFRS 9, there is not expected to be any resulting measurement impact.
The Group will continue to measure equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income, as an election on an  basis on initial recognition.
SSE plc Annual Report 2018 151 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2018 2.
New accounting policies and reporting changes continued 2.1 IFRS 9 Financial instruments which has been endorsed by the European Union EU and will be effective from 1 January 2018 and thus 1 April 2018 for the Group continued ii Impairment The standard includes the requirement that impairment models also consider the expected credit losses on an entitys financial assets held at amortised cost and commitments to extend credit.
As a result of this forward looking model which removes the requirement for a trigger event to have occurred earlier recognition of credit losses may occur.
The Group has reviewed existing impairment models principally counterparty specific provision models applied to Wholesale Trade Receivables and provision matrix models applied to Retail Trade Receivables including the credit risk management processes described in accompanying information Note A6.1.
Given the short term nature of the majority of affected financial assets, and the Groups focus on mitigating significant credit risk through regular monitoring and securitisation, the inclusion of forward looking information within these models is expected to reduce Group Reported Profit by less than 1%.
iii Hedge accounting The standard does not materially change the amounts recognised in relation to existing hedging arrangements but does simplify the requirements for measuring hedge effectiveness, and thus the eligibility conditions for hedge accounting.
The new hedge accounting model is intended to enable companies to reflect better their risk management activities in the financial statements.
The Groups review of the IFRS 9 hedge accounting model concluded that whilst adoption would not change the treatment of existing hedging arrangements, the changes made would not result in any additional hedge designations either.
As such, the existing hedge accounting model under IAS 39 appropriately reflects our risk management activities in the financial statements.
Therefore, as permitted by IFRS 9, the Group has elected to continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39.
This policy choice will be periodically reviewed to consider any changes in our risk management activities.
Upon adoption of IFRS 9, the Group intends to apply the exemption from the requirement to restate comparative information about classification and measurement, including impairment.
The opening retained earnings will be adjusted for any difference between financial instrument carrying amounts before and after adoption of IFRS 9, which is expected to be less than 1% of Group Reported Profit.
2.2 IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers which has been endorsed by the EU and will be effective from 1 January 2018 and thus 1 April 2018 to the Group This standard replaces IAS 11 Construction contracts, IAS 18 Revenue, IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers and a number of other revenue related interpretations previously adopted by the Group.
The core principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity recognises revenue that reflects the expected consideration for goods or services provided to a customer under contract, over the performance obligations they are being provided.
The standard has introduced a five-step model as the framework for applying that core principle.
The Groups assessment of changes to the current revenue recognition policy, as described in accompanying information Note A1.2, can be summarised for each Business Area as follows: Networks Revenue relating to Distribution Connections will be recognised over time with reference to the ongoing obligation to provide connection access to the Distribution Network, rather than at the point of time the connection was completed under IFRIC 18.
This will reduce revenue and operating profit from this revenue stream.
Retail The clarifications on assessing principal versus agent relationships will result in revenue and costs relating to Third Party Intermediary companies used by Business customers to support and advise them in changing Supplier, as well as customer support schemes such as the Warm Home Discount, being offset within the Income Statement, rather than recognised gross as currently applied.
This will reduce revenue but have no impact on operating profit.
A review of the percentage of completion methodology currently applied by the Enterprise Segment concluded that certain process changes are required, specifically to ensure contract costs are expensed as they occur thereby removing Work in Progress from the Balance Sheet and calculating revenue recognised on a costs incurred input basis rather than the margin mark-up basis currently applied.
This may either increase or reduce revenue and operating profit from this segment, depending on the underlying contractual terms.
For certain equipment provided to customers on inception of a contract for example, internet routers delivered to a customer on inception of a Broadband contract IFRS 15 requires recognition of revenue when the equipment is delivered rather than over the contract period as currently applied.
This will increase revenue and operating profit from this revenue stream.
Wholesale The majority of revenue within this Business Area relates to sales through optimisation trades in physical and financial energy and commodity contracts commodity trades within the scope of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and therefore outwith the scope of IFRS 15.
No changes to revenue recognition under IFRS 15 have been noted in this area.
New accounting policies and reporting changes continued 2.2 IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers which has been endorsed by the EU and will be effective from 1 January 2018 and thus 1 April 2018 to the Group continued Adoption Applying the IFRS 15 revenue recognition policy changes noted above to the Group for the year ended 31 March 2018 either separately or in combination would have resulted in a less than 1% change in Group Revenue, less than 1% change in Group Reported Profit and less than 1% change in Group Net Assets.
Adoption of IFRS 15 will not affect the cashflows generated by the Group.
The full impact of adopting IFRS 15 on the Groups consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2019 will depend on the contractual arrangements entered into by the Group during the forthcoming financial year, however, it is the Groups expectation that the impact will be broadly equivalent.
The Group will apply the Modified Retrospective approach, with the cumulative effect of initially applying IFRS 15 recognised at the date of initial application as allowed by the standard.
The Group has also elected to take advantage of the practical expedient whereby contracts that have been completed under the current accounting policies at the beginning of the earliest period are not restated.
Whilst not within the scope of IFRS 15 and with no changes to revenue recognition under IFRS 15 being identified for revenue in the Energy Portfolio Management EPM business, the Group has noted that presentation of sales and purchases of commodity optimisation trades on a gross or net basis varies across its industry peer group.
Therefore, in connection with the future adoption of IFRS 15, the Group will undertake a review in the forthcoming financial year of whether a gross or net presentation of commodity trades, provides a more relevant reflection of their underlying economic reality of the activities in the EPM business to users of the financial statements.
Therefore, the Group currently presents sales and purchases on a gross basis, a net presentation could have reduced revenue and cost of sales for the year ended 31 March 2018 by up to 22bn with no impact on reported profit, net assets or cashflows.
2.3 IFRS 16 Leases which has been endorsed by the EU and will be effective from 1 January 2019 and thus 1 April 2019 to the Group This standard replaces IAS 17 Leases and sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases.
The principal change from the previous standard is the introduction of a single lessee accounting model which requires a lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value.
The Group commenced its project on adoption of this standard during the year, with current activity still focused on data collection and analysis of contracts for lease features.
The Group continues to anticipate that the impact from adopting the standard can be summarised in two areas: i Identification of a lease The standard introduces a distinction between a lease and a service contract on the basis of whether a customer is able to control an identifiable asset.
The Group anticipates some existing operating and finance leases may fail to meet this definition, and therefore would be treated as service contracts.
Likewise, some existing service contracts may now meet this definition, and therefore would be treated as leases.
However, the Group does not believe this will have a material impact on the Groups results, given the low number of affected contracts identified to date.
ii Recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for existing operating leases The standard removes the previous distinction between operating leases and finance leases and requires that, where a lease is identified in a contract, a right-of-use asset and lease liability are recognised.
The Group anticipates that adoption is likely to result in the majority of arrangements currently accounted for as operating leases as set out in Note 25.2, 174.6m of operating lease commitments at 31 March 2018 being recognised on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.
The project will be completed during the forthcoming financial year and, given the number of leases in place, the data capture requirements and the variety of transition approaches available on adoption, the full implementation effect of the standard will only be determined once the project has completed.
However, the Group has concluded that the arrangements for Smart Meter contracts as described in Accounting Judgement Note 4.2 iv do not contain a lease under IFRS 16, given the Suppliers inability to direct the use of the asset.
2.4 IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts is effective from 1 January 2021 and thus 1 April 2021 to the Group, and is subject to EUendorsement IFRS 17 Insurance contracts was issued in May 2017, replaces IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts and sets out the requirements that a company should apply in reporting information about insurance contracts it issues and reinsurance contracts it holds.
Whilst the Group operates a captive insurance company SSE Insurance Limited its primary purpose is to provide greater control over SSEs management of specific risks, with minor annual premium payments made.
It is therefore not expected that adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements.
2.5 Other interpretations and amendments In addition to these issued standards, there are a number of other interpretations, amendments and annual improvement project recommendations that have been issued but not yet adopted by the Group because application is not yet mandatory or because adoption by the EU remains outstanding at this point in time.
These are not anticipated to have a material impact on the Groups consolidated financialstatements.
SSE plc Annual Report 2018 153 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2018 2.
New accounting policies and reporting changes continued 2.6 Other aspects of IFRS: clarifications by the IASB The accounting treatment under IAS 12 Income Taxes of interest and penalties related to income taxes was clarified by the IFRS Interpretations Committee during the year.
In such situations, the Committee observed that entities do not have an accounting policy choice between applying IAS 12 and applying IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets to interest and penalties.
If an entity considers a particular amount payable or receivable for interest and penalties to be an income tax, then the entity applies IAS 12 to that amount.
Instead, if an entity does not apply IAS 12 to a particular amount payable or receivable for interest and penalties, it applies IAS 37 to that amount.
The Group had previously reported interest and penalties related to income taxes as part of the tax charge within the Income Statement.
With effect from 1 April 2017, the Group has updated its treatment of these charges in accordance with the guidance issued.
The impact of this change on the opening Balance Sheet and prior year Income Statement is not material, therefore restatement for this voluntary change in accounting policy has not been made.
Instead, interest and penalties previously charged of 8m included within Current Tax Liabilities has been reclassified to Other Creditors.
Adjusted accounting measures The Group applies the use of adjusted accounting measures throughout the Annual Report and Financial Statements.
These measures enable the Directors to present the underlying performance of the Group and its segments to the users of the statements in a consistent and meaningful manner.
The adjustments applied and certain terms such as adjusted operating profit, adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net debt and Hybrid equity are not defined under IFRS and are explained in more detail below.
3.1 Adjusted measur es The Directors assess the performance of the Group and its reportable segments based on adjusted measures.
These measures are used for internal performance management and are believed to be appropriate for explaining underlying performance to users of the accounts.
These measures are also deemed the most useful for the ordinary shareholders of the Company and for other stakeholders.
The performance of the reportable segments is reported based on adjusted profit before interest and tax adjusted operating profit.
This is reconciled to reported profit before interest and tax by adding back exceptional items and certain re-measurements see Note 3.2 below and after the removal of interest and taxation on profits from equity-accounted joint ventures and associates.
The performance of the Group is reported based on adjusted profit before tax which excludes exceptional items and certain re-measurements see below, the net interest costs associated with defined benefit schemes and taxation on profits from equity-accounted joint ventures and associates.
The interest costs removed are non-cash and are subject to variation based on actuarial valuations of scheme liabilities.
The Group also uses adjusted earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation adjusted EBITDA as an alternative operating performance measure which acts as a management proxy for cash generated from operating activities.
This does not take into account the rights and obligations that SSE has in relation its equity-accounted joint ventures and associates.
This measure excludes exceptional items and certain re-measurements see below, the net interest costs associated with defined benefit schemes, depreciation and amortisation from equity-accounted joint ventures and associates and interest and taxation on profits from equity-accounted joint ventures and associates.
The Groups key performance measure is adjusted earnings per share EPS, which is based on basic earnings per share before exceptional items and certain re-measurements see below, the net interest costs associated with defined benefit schemes and after the removal of deferred taxation and other taxation items.
Deferred taxation is excluded from the Groups adjusted EPS because of the Groups significant ongoing capital investment programme, which means that the deferred tax is unlikely to reverse.
Adjusted profit after tax is presented on a basis consistent with adjusted EPS except for the exclusion of payments to holders of hybrid equity.
The financial statements also include an adjusted net debt and Hybrid equity measure.
This presents financing information on the basis used for internal liquidity risk management.
This measure excludes obligations due under finance leases and includes cash held as collateral on commodity trading exchanges and other short term loans.
The measure represents the capital owed to investors, lenders and equity holders other than the ordinary shareholders.
As with adjusted earnings per share, this measure is considered to be of particular relevance to the ordinary shareholders of the Group as well as other stakeholders and interested parties.
Finally, the financial statements include an investment and capital expenditure measure.
This metric represents the capital invested by the Group in projects that are anticipated to provide a return on investment over future years and is consistent with internally applied metrics.
This therefore includes capital additions to Property, Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets and also the Groups direct funding of joint venture and associates capital projects.
The Group has considered it appropriate to report these values both internally and externally in this manner due to its use of equity-accounted investment vehicles to grow the Groups asset base, where the Group is providing the source of funding to the vehicle through either loans or equity.
The Group does not include project funded ventures in this metric or other capital invested in joint ventures and associates.
In addition, the Group excludes from this metric or other capital invested in joint ventures or associates.
In addition the Group excludes from this metric additions to its Property, Plant and Equipment funded by Customer Contributions and additions to Intangible Assets associated with Allowances and Certificates.
Reconciliations from reported measures to adjusted measures along with further description of the rationale for those adjustments are included in the Adjusted Performance Measures section at pages 143 and 144.
#APM Where the Group have referred to an adjusted performance measure in the financial statements the following sign is presented todenote this.
Adjusted accounting measures continued 3.2 Exceptional items and certain re-measurements Exceptional items are those charges or credits that are considered unusual by nature and or scale and of such significance that separate disclosure is required for the financial statements to be properly understood.
The trigger points for exceptional items will tend to be nonrecurring although exceptional charges may impact the same asset class or segment over time.
Market conditions that have deteriorated significantly over time will only be captured to the extent observable at the balance sheet date.
Examples of items that may be considered exceptional include material asset or business impairment charges, business restructuring costs and reorganisation costs, significant gains or losses on disposal and provisions in relation to contractual settlements associated with significant disputes and claims.
The Directors consider that any individual gain or loss on disposal of greater than 30.0m would be disclosed as being exceptional by nature of its scale.
Other gains or losses on disposal below this level may be considered to be exceptional by reference to specific circumstances which will be explained on a case-by-case basis.
Impairments of intangible development projects as part of the normal course of business are considered exceptional.
Certain re-measurements are re-measurements arising on certain commodity, interest rate and currency contracts which are accounted for as held for trading or as fair value hedges in accordance with the Groups policy for such financial instruments.
The amount shown in the before exceptional items and certain re-measurements results for these contracts is the amount settled in the year as disclosed in Note 24.1.
This excludes commodity contracts not treated as financial instruments under IAS 39 where held for the Groups own use requirements which are not recorded until the underlying commodity is delivered.
3.3 Other additional disclosures As permitted by IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements, the Groups income statement discloses additional information in respect of joint ventures and associates, exceptional items and certain re-measurements to aid understanding of the Groups financial performance and to present results clearly and consistently.
Accounting judgements and estimation uncertainty In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, management necessarily makes judgements and estimates that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Changes in the assumptions underlying the estimates could result in a significant impact to the financial statements.
The Groups key accounting judgement and estimation areas are noted with the most significant financial judgement areas as specifically discussed by the Audit Committee being highlighted separately.
4.1 Significant financial judgements estimation uncertainties The preparation of these financial statements has specifically considered the following significant financial judgements, all of which are areas of estimation uncertainty.
i Impairment testing and valuation of certain non-current assets estimation uncertainty The Group reviews the carrying amounts of its goodwill, other intangible assets and specific property, plant and equipment assets to determine whether any impairment of the carrying value of those assets requires to be recorded.
The specific assets under review in the year ended 31 March 2018 are intangible development assets and specific property, plant and equipment assets related to gas production, thermal power generation and hydro power generation.
In conducting its reviews, the Group makes judgements and estimates in considering both the level of cash generating unit CGU at which common assets such as goodwill are assessed against, as well as the estimates and assumptions behind the calculation of recoverable amount of the respective assets or CGUs.
At 31 March 2018, the Group has assessed that its Gas Production assets, Glendoe hydroelectric generation plant and its Great Island CCGT plant displayed indicators of impairment and were accordingly tested for impairment.
Changes to the estimates and assumptions on factors such as regulation and legislation changes, power, gas, carbon and other commodity prices, volatility of gas prices, plant running regimes and load factors, expected proven and probable reserves, discount rates and other inputs could impact the assessed recoverable value of assets and CGUs and consequently impact the Groups income statement and balance sheet.
Further detail of the calculation basis and key assumptions used in the impairment review, the resulting impairment charges and the sensitivity of this assessment to key assumptions is disclosed at Note 15.
Detail on the accounting policies applied is included in the Accompanying Information section A1.
ii Revenue recognition unbilled energy consumption estimation uncertainty Revenue from Retail energy supply activities includes an estimate of the value of electricity or gas supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading and the year end.
This estimation will comprise of values for i billed revenue in relation to consumption from unread meters based on estimated consumption taking account of various factors including usage patterns and weather trends disclosed as trade receivables and ii unbilled revenue calculated by assessing a number of factors such as externally notified aggregated volumes supplied to customers from national settlements bodies, amounts billed to customers and other adjustments disclosed as accrued income.
Given the non-routine process, number of differing inputs and the extent of management judgement as noted below, the unbilled revenue estimate is considered a significant estimate made by management in preparing the financial statements.
Unbilled revenue is calculated by applying the tariffs applicable to customers to the calculated estimated volume of electricity or gas consumed.
This estimation methodology is subject to an internal corroboration process that provides support for the judgements made by management.
This corroboration process requires the comparison of calculated unbilled volumes to a benchmark measure of unbilled volumes in GWh and millions of therms which is derived from historical weather-adjusted consumption patterns and aggregated, independently validated but unreconciled, metering data that is used in industry reconciliation processes for total consumption by supplier.
SSE plc Annual Report 2018 155 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2018 4.
Accounting judgements and estimation uncertainty continued 4.1 Significant financial judgements estimation uncertainties continued This comparison of the estimated supplied quantity of electricity or gas that is deemed to have been delivered to customers against the aggregate supplied quantity of electricity or gas applicable to the Groups customers that is measured by industry system operators, is a key judgement.
The estimation of electricity unbilled revenue is further influenced by the impact on estimated electricity or gas supplied of national settlements data or, for electricity only, feed-in-tariff supported volumes and spill from solar PV generation.
The Groups policy is to recognise unbilled revenue only where the economic benefits are expected to flow to the Group.
As a result, the judgements applied, and the assumptions underpinning the judgements, are considered to be appropriate.
Change in these assumptions would have an impact on the amount of revenue recognised in any given period.
In the year, judgements applied for domestic and business electricity, the Groups confidence in the quality of grid supply point metering and national settlements data it uses as part of its estimation process has improved which has enabled an additional revenue amount of c. 42m 2017: 60m to be recognised in the year.
The unbilled gas revenue estimation process has required the Group to take account of industry estimated supplied quantities of gas consumed have historically been higher than actual metered supply.
To address this, the Group has applied a further judgement, being a percentage reduction to unbilled consumption volume, to the measurement of its unbilled revenue in the financial statements.
While it is expected that this judgement will become less critical as the industry transitions to smart meter technology, the percentage reduction applied has been increased in the year following the entering into operation of the new national settlements system, Nexus, and data issues associated with that: the impact of this change in estimation is c. 12m reduction in revenue.
The sensitivity associated with this judgement factor is disclosed at Note 18. iii Retirement benefit obligations estimation uncertainty The assumptions in relation to the cost of providing post-retirement benefits during the period are based on the Groups best estimates and are set after consultation with qualified actuaries.
While these assumptions are believed to be appropriate, a change in these assumptions would impact the level of the retirement benefit obligation recorded and the cost to the Group of administering the schemes.
Further detail of the calculation basis and key assumptions used, the resulting movements in obligations and the sensitivity of key assumptions to the obligation is disclosed at Note 23.
Changes from prior year In addition to the three significant financial judgements noted above, the Group disclosed the valuation of trade receivables as a significant financial judgement at 31 March 2017.
The Group has assessed that the judgements applied in arriving at the provisions for bad and doubtful debt do not have a material impact on these financial statements at 31 March 2018.
4.2 Other key accounting judgements Other key accounting judgements applied in the preparation of these Financial Statements include the following: i Accounting for capacity market payments accounting judgement The Groups UK Supply businesses are required to make payments to an independent Settlement Body to ensure sufficient reliable electricity capacity is available throughout the year.
This charge is based on the Suppliers forecast energy demands between November and February, and is charged over the course of the delivery year.
In accordance with IFRIC 21 Levies, a liability for the full year charge is recognised progressively between November and February.
The Group has assessed that this represents a regulatory operating cost to the business for its operations throughout the settlement year and therefore recognises the cost over the course of that year.
Any difference between the liability and charge is recognised as a settlement prepaid asset.
ii Accounting for costs of the smart meter infrastructure programme accounting judgement Through its participation in the UK smart metering programme, the Group is required to make payments to the Data Communications Company DCC as it develops infrastructure to support the UK smart meter roll-out.
The Group has assessed that the DCC costs incurred are capital in nature as they will provide future economic benefit and the Group has the power to control certain assets through the terms of the Smart Meter Code.
These assets relate to the centralised infrastructure costs of the UKs smart meter programme.
At 31 March 2018, the costs capitalised to date total 86.6m 2017: 54.4m.
SSE is aware that other market participants have elected to expense these costs as incurred, however, given that it has been assessed that control exists over these assets, they have been capitalised.
iii Presentation of SSEs household energy and services business in Great Britain accounting judgement On 8 November 2017, the Group announced that it had entered into an agreement with innogy SE innogy in respect of a proposed demerger of SSEs household energy and services business in Great Britain and combination with innogys subsidiary, npower Group plc, to form a new independent UK incorporated company.
At 31 March 2018, it has been assessed that the business activity subject to the demerger does not meet the criteria to be disclosed as held for sale, because the transaction is subject to a UK Competition and Markets Authority investigation and the approval of SSEs shareholders, neither of which have been completed at 31 March 2018.
It has been assessed that because these approvals have not been granted it is not reasonably certain that the business activity will be disposed of in the next 12 months.
SSE therefore continues to present its household energy and services businesses as continuing operations within the Retail operating segment.
iv Lease classification for Smart Meter contracts accounting judgement Following the disposal of smart meter assets to Meter Fit 10 Limited in the prior period see Note 12, the Group entered into an agreement for the provision of meter asset provider MAP services with that company.
During the prior year, the Group also entered into a framework agreement with a joint venture company, Maple Topco Limited, to provide MAP services for further tranches of smart meter deployment.
Accounting judgements and estimation uncertainty continued 4.2 Other key accounting judgements continued iv Lease classification for Smart Meter contracts accounting judgement continued The Group has assessed that both arrangements, in common with all similar arrangements, do not contain leases of the smart meters owned by the MAP due to other parties taking a significant amount of the output from the meters and due to the Group being unable to control either the operation or the physical access to the meters.
The IFRS 16 Leases implementation project has concluded that this assessment will not change upon adoption of that standard see Note 2.3.
Changes from prior year At 31 March 2017, the Group also disclosed business combinations and acquisitions: treatment of disputes and claims: consolidation of interest in investments and trading arrangements: and pension scheme surplus restrictions as accounting judgements.
Following a review of transactions during the year, it has been assessed that the judgements applied no longer have a significant impact on the presentation of these financial statements.
Further information of the non-significant judgements applied can be found in the relevant notes to the financial statements.
4.3 Other areas of estimation uncertainty i Tax provisioning The Group has a number of open tax issues with the tax authorities in the UK and Republic of Ireland, the two jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
Where management makes a judgement that an outflow of funds is probable, and a reliable estimate of the dispute can be made, provision is made for the best estimate of the most likely liability.
In estimating any such liability, the Group applies a risk-based approach, taking into account the specific circumstances of each dispute based on managements interpretation of tax law and supported, where appropriate, by discussion and analysis by external tax advisors.
These estimates are inherently judgemental and could change substantially over time as each dispute progresses and new facts emerge.
Provisions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, however the resolution of tax issues can take a considerable period of time to conclude and it is possible that amounts ultimately paid will be different from the amounts provided.
Provisions for uncertain tax positions are included in current tax liabilities, and total 66.1m at 31 March 2018 2017 131.6m.
The Group estimates that a reasonably possible range of settlement outcomes for the uncertain tax provisions could be settled in a range between nil to the full value of the provision.
IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments, issued by the IASB with an effective date for the Group of 1 April 2019 but yet to be endorsed by the EU, clarifies the application of IAS 12 Income Taxes regarding recognition and measurement when there is uncertainty over the income tax treatment.
Analysis of the potential impact from adopting this interpretation is ongoing, however adoption may result in changes to the judgements or estimates made for tax provisions.
ii Decommissioning costs The estimated cost of decommissioning at the end of the useful lives of certain property, plant and equipment assets is reviewed periodically and has been reassessed in the year to 31 March 2018.
Decommissioning costs in relation to gas exploration and production assets are periodically agreed with the field operators and reflect the latest expected economic production lives of the fields.
Provision is made for the estimated discounted cost of decommissioning at the balance sheet date.
The dates for settlement of future decommissioning costs are uncertain, particularly for gas exploration and production assets where reassessment of gas and liquids reserves can lengthen or shorten the field life as well as the upward and downward movement in commodity prices and operating costs, but are currently expected to be incurred beginning in 2019 and increasing into the subsequent decade and out to 2040.
Further detail on the assumptions made and movement in decommissioning costs during the year are disclosed at Note 20. iii Gas and liquids reserves The volume and production profile of proven and probable 2P gas and liquids reserves is an estimate that affects the unit of production depreciation of producing gas and liquids property, plant and equipment.
This is also a significant input estimate to the associated impairment and decommissioning calculations.
The estimation of gas and liquid reserves is subject to change between reporting periods, following the review and updating of inputs such as regional activity, geological data, reservoir performance data, well drilling activity, commodity prices and production costs.
Proven and probable 2P reserves, and other reserve classifications out-with 2P, can both increase and decrease following assessment of the inputs.
The estimates of gas and liquid reserves are formally reviewed on an annual basis using an independent reservoir auditor, and the impact of a change in estimated proven and probable reserves is dealt with prospectively by depreciating the remaining book value of producing assets over the expected future production.
If proven and probable reserves estimates are revised downwards, earnings could be affected by an immediate write-down impairment of the assets book value or a higher future depreciation expense.
Further detail on the assumptions made are disclosed at Note 15.
Segmental information The Groups operating segments are those used internally by the Board to run the business and make strategic decisions.
On 8 November 2017, SSE announced its intention to dispose of its GB domestic supply and energy related services business in a demerger with npower.
Following this announcement, the presentation of financial information to the Board changed resulting in a change of the operating segments with the activities subject to the proposed demerger being presented as SSE Energy services.
During the review of operating segments triggered by the Retail transaction, it was also assessed that the Energy Portfolio Management activity should also be presented as a standalone segment to reflect its contribution to the Group.

Revenue within Energy Portfolio Management EPM represents the gross value of all wholesale commodity sales including settled physical and financial trades entered into to optimise the performance of the generation plants and to manage the Groups commodity risk exposure.
The gross value of purchase trades are included in cost of sales.
In connection with the future adoption of IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers, as highlighted in Note 2.2, the Group will undertake a review in the financial year ended 31 March 2019 of whether a gross or net presentation of commodity trades provides a more relevant reflection of their underlying economic reality to users of the financial statements.
Whilst the Group currently presents sales and purchases on a gross basis, a net presentation could have reduced revenue and cost of sales for the year ended 31 March 2018 by up to 22bn with no impact on reported profit, net assets or cashflows.
Revenue from the Groups investment in Scotia Gas Networks Limited SSE share being 391.5m 2017: 486.7m is not recorded in the revenue line in the income statement.

This consisted of asset and investment impairment charges totalling 208.1m and net exceptional charges for provisions of 5.4m.
The net exceptional charges excluding gains on disposal recognised can be summarised as follows: Property, Plant & Goodwill & Equipment Other Intangibles Provisions & Total Note 14 Note 13 other charges Investments charges m m m m m Gas Production i 104.7 104.7 Retail and technology development ii 53.3 9.7 63.0 Other iii 20.9 4.4 5.4 23.7 45.6 178.9 5.3 5.4 23.7 213.3 i Gas Production In the year, the Group recognised net impairment charges of 104.7m related to its North Sea Gas Production assets following an increase in projected costs at certain fields and revised assessments of hydrocarbon reserves.
The impairment charges were recognised on the Greater Laggan fields 104.2m and Bacton fields 19.3m due to lower than previously forecast independently assessed proved and probable 2P hydrocarbon reserves and, at Greater Laggan, increased projected costs to extract those reserves as a result of enhanced clarity over the interconnectivity of the field resources.
These charges were offset by a 18.8m reversal of previous exceptional impairments on the ECA field following an increase to estimated hydrocarbon reserves.
Following these charges and credit, the residual value in the Groups gas production assets is 517.8m.
ii Retail and other technology developments The Group has undertaken an internal restructuring exercise following the announcement on 8 November 2017 that SSE plans to dispose of its UK domestic supply business in a demerger and combination with npower.
That restructuring, which was concluded on 1 April 2018, resulted in the transfer of assets and contracts between wholly owned subsidiaries of the Group, and necessitated a detailed impairment review.
This impairment review was performed to ensure that a new demerged Retail business would contain assets that would be utilised in its post-demerger operations.
This review resulted in 29.3m of software development cost impairment charges, related to the Groups previous Retail strategic investment in transformation and a further 33.7m of charges in relation to Retail related software developments and programmes within the Groups central service company and other subsidiaries that it was identified would no longer be utilised by the demerged or continuing energy supply businesses.
SSE plc Annual Report 2018 165 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2018 7.
Exceptional items and certain re-measurements continued 7.1 Exceptional items continued iii Other In the year SSE disposed of its 1.8% shareholding in Faroe Petroleum Limited for cash consideration of 4.0m, crystallising 7.2m of losses on disposal and disposed of its 15% shareholding in BIFAB Ltd for consideration of 1.
The sale of shareholding in Burntisland Fabrication Limited BIFAB resulted in an exceptional charge of 16.5m, including 10.0m of losses previously recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income.
These losses represent costs of exit from non-controlling financial interests in investments totalling 23.7m.
These investments are not-related to SSEs core operating activities and are considered exceptional in nature.
The Group also recognised an impairment charge of 15.6m on its Barkip anaerobic digestion plant following experience of operational issues and assessment of future economic prospects.
The plant represented an investment in emergent and economically unproven technology and its impairment is considered exceptional due to the nature of that historic investment.
Finally, the Group recognised combined charges of 11.8m in its Enterprise Utilities business following detailed review and assessment of the assets and contracts in its Heat Network portfolio.
These charges are considered exceptional as part of the restructure and realignment of that business under new management.
As part of its preparation for the proposed demerger, the Group has also incurred 11.8m of transactionrelated costs in the year to 31 March 2018.
Offsetting these exceptional charges, the Group recognised a reversal in impairment in its Doggerbank offshore windfarm prospect of 7.9m following a renewed commitment to the project by the joint venture partners.
The Group also released 9.3m of provisions related to historic regulatory investigations and legal disputes following satisfaction of remedies and reassessment of liability in relation to the Glendoe dispute.
These reversal credits are related to provisions and impairments previously disclosed as exceptional.
31 March 2017 In the previous financial year, the Group recognised a net exceptional charge of 8.2m.
This consisted of asset impairment and related charges totalling 374.6m, net exceptional credits for provisions of 1.8m, net exceptional gains on disposal of 307.3m and net fair value uplift following loss of control of 59.1m.
The 307.3m gain was related to the part disposal of the Groups stake in Scotia Gas Networks.
The exceptional impairment and related charges can be summarised as follows: Property, Plant & Goodwill & Equipment Other Intangibles Inventories Other charges Total Note 14 Note 13 Note 17 credits charges m m m m m Gas Production 244.3 20.0 3.2 227.5 Retail and technology development 42.2 78.1 120.3 Gas Storage 23.8 23.8 Thermal Generation 30.7 62.3 31.6 Other 12.0 36.4 13.8 34.6 353.0 94.5 62.3 10.6 374.6 In 2016 17 the Group recognised an impairment charge of 180.5m in relation to the Greater Laggan field following a reduction in the independently assessed quantity of available proved and probable 2P hydrocarbon resources.
In addition an impairment charge of 63.8m was recognised in relation to the Bacton field predominantly as a result of higher forecast decommissioning costs, which were deemed to be irrecoverable through the remaining economic life.
These gas production impairment charges were offset by an exceptional credit of 20.0m which was the partial reversal of a 2015 16 impairment of Greater Laggan Area intangible assets following the identification of additional prospective resources.
The Group also decided to cease the development of its replacement customer service and billing system which resulted in an exceptional charge of 83.1m, and following a detailed review of related technology development projects a further 37.2m of discontinued IT project development costs were identified.
In 2016 17 management revised their assessment of the anticipated decommissioning costs associated with the Aldbrough and Atwick Gas Storage sites, resulting in an additional decommissioning provision of 23.8m that was subsequently impaired.
The Group also assessed that changes to the Integrated Single Electricity Market I-SEM on the island of Ireland resulted in impairment of the Groups oil burning stations at Rhode and Tawnaghmor, due to their age and future competitive prospects.
The impairment for these assets amounted to 30.7m.
As a result of unexpected running of the Fiddlers Ferry power station, due to the award of a one year contract to provide ancillary services, the Group reversed a previous impairment of coal stock inventory of 62.3m.
However due to ongoing uncertainty surrounding the plant, no reversals of previous impairment of the generating asset were recognised.
The Group also reassessed the deployment of The Energy Services Group ESG within SSE, which resulted in a 36.4m impairment of the goodwill recognised on acquisition of ESG.
Exceptional items and certain re-measurements continued 7.1 Exceptional items continued Property, Goodwill & Total Plant & Other Other Impairment Total Equipment Intangibles Inventories charges related Provisions charges At 31 March 2016 m m m m m m m Coal Generation 67.6 87.9 83.2 238.7 48.3 287.0 Gas Generation 302.5 2.2 3.7 18.0 326.4 326.4 Gas Production 125.0 27.2 9.6 161.8 161.8 Gas Storage 150.9 150.9 150.9 Other 11.2 3.5 14.7 6.6 21.3 646.0 40.6 91.6 114.3 892.5 54.9 947.4 In 2015 16, the Group announced the closure of Ferrybridge and highlighted significant uncertainty in relation to ongoing operations at Fiddlers Ferry.
These consequently gave rise to impairment and other charges totalling 287.0m.
The subsequent 2016 17 operational performance at Fiddlers Ferry outturn was more positive than previously anticipated and gave rise to certain impairment reversals.
The Groups gas-fired generation plants at Peterhead, Medway and Marchwood were impaired in 2015 16 due to difficult economic conditions and factors such as the withdrawal of support for the proposed carbon capture and storage project at Peterhead.
More broadly, no observable recovery in spark spread margins were forecast.
In total, impairment and other charges of 326.4m were recognised in relation to gas generation.
No further deterioration in the values of GB gas plants was observed in the financial year to 31 March 2017.
In 2015 16, impairment charges totalling 161.8m were recognised in relation to the Groups Gas Exploration and Production assets in the North Sea, predominately due to declining wholesale gas prices.
The exceptional charges recognised included an element 121.2m relating to the impairment of Greater Laggan field assets acquired at 28 October 2016 which reflected the impact of the decline in expected long term gas prices between the acquisition date and the financial year end.
The Groups gas storage assets at Hornsea Atwick and Aldbrough saw reduced short term price volatility and seasonal spreads in the wholesale gas market, which created exceptional charges relating to plant value.
7.2 Certain re-measurements The Group enters into forward commodity purchase and sales contracts to meet the future demand requirements of its Energy Supply business and to optimise the value of its Generation and other Wholesale assets.
Certain of these contracts are determined to be derivative financial instruments under IAS 39 and as such are required to be recorded at their fair value.
Changes in the fair value of those commodity contracts designated as IAS 39 financial instruments are reflected in the income statement as part of certain re-measurements.
The Group shows the change in the fair value of these forward contracts separately as this mark-to-market movement is not relevant to the underlying performance of its operating segments.
The Group will recognise the underlying value of these contracts as the relevant commodity is delivered, which will predominately be within the subsequent 12 to 24 months.
Conversely, commodity contracts that are not financial instruments under IAS 39 are accounted for as own use contracts.
The re-measurements arising from IAS 39 are disclosed separately to aid understanding of the underlying performance of the Group.
This category also includes the income statement movement on financing derivatives and hedged items as described in Note 24.
7.3 Change in UK corporation tax rates Finance No.
2 Act 2015 which received royal assent on 18 November 2015 enacted a corporation tax rate of 19% from 1 April 2017, and a rate of 18% from 1 April 2020.
A further change to reduce the rate of corporation tax to 17% from 1 April 2020 was announced in Finance Act 2016, as this change was enacted on 15 September 2016 it had the effect of reducing the Groups deferred tax liabilities by 34.6m in the year ended 31 March 2017, including the impact of changes recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income.
In the year to 31 March 2018, the rate change enacted on 15 September 2016 which is effective from 1 April 2020, has the effect of increasing the Groups deferred tax liabilities by 12.8m.
This impact results from items arising in the year to 31 March 2018, which were therefore not rebased to 17% at the previous balance sheet date.

In October 2015, SSE became the first FTSE 100 group to be accredited with the Fair Tax Mark.
As a consequence, these financial statements include a number of areas of enhanced disclosure which have been provided in order to develop stakeholder understanding of the tax the Group pays and the reported total taxation charge along with additional commentary on the main reconciling items.
These can be seen at section A2.
Taxation continued Analysis of charge recognised in the income statement continued The majority of the Groups profits are earned in the UK, with the standard rate of UK corporation tax being 19% for the year to 31 March 2018 2017: 20%.
The Groups Gas Production business is taxed at a UK corporation tax rate of 30% plus a supplementary charge of 10% combined 40%.
In addition, profits from the Sean gas field were subject to petroleum revenue tax PRT at 0% from 1 January 2016 which is deductible against corporation tax, giving an overall effective rate for the field of 40%.
Profits earned by the Group in the Republic of Ireland are taxable at either 12.5% or 25%, depending upon the nature of the income.
Deferred tax has been recognised at 35% in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme surplus, as there is insufficient certainty over how the surplus will reverse.
If a special repayment is made to the company, withholding tax of 35% applies.
Deferred tax on pension scheme deficits has previously been booked at the standard UK Corporation Tax rate.
The adjusted current tax charge and the adjusted effective rate of tax, which are presented in order to best represent underlying performance by making similar adjustments to the adjusted profit before tax measure, are arrived at after the following adjustments: 2018 2018 2017 2017 m % m % Group tax charge and effective rate 166.1 17.7 57.8 3.6 Add: reported deferred tax credit and effective rate 207.8 22.1 58.6 3.7 Reported current tax charge and effective rate 41.7 4.4 116.4 7.3 Effect of adjusting items 5.0 0.2 Reported current tax charge on adjusted basis 41.7 9.4 116.4 7.5 add: Share of current tax from joint ventures and associates 32.9 3.5 30.8 2.0 Effect of reassessment of capital allowances for previous years 101.3 10.8 less: Current tax credit on exceptional items 38.2 4.1 10.5 0.7 #APM Adjusted current tax charge and effective rate 130.7 9.0 157.7 10.2 Tax charge credit recognised in other comprehensive income loss : 2018 2017 m m Relating to: Pension scheme actuarial movements 43.2 168.8 Cash flow and net investment hedge movements 9.5 0.8 33.7 168.0 All tax recognised through other comprehensive income is deferred tax.
10.2 Current tax liabilities 2018 2017 m m Corporation tax 117.9 294.8 Uncertain tax positions The Group invests heavily in infrastructure, on which significant amounts of capital allowances are potentially available.
The extent to which capital allowances are available on any single asset is, however, very much dependent upon the fact pattern for the asset involved, and there will often be an element of uncertainty as to how capital allowances legislation applies in those circumstances.
Reaching agreement with tax authorities as to the amount of capital allowances available can take a number of years, and sometimes can only be resolved through a formal legal process.
The calculation of the Groups total tax charge therefore necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement in relation to certain items for which the tax treatment cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached with the tax authorities or, if required, through a formal legal process.
At 31 March 2018, the Group has recognised provisions totalling 66.0m in respect of uncertain tax positions, primarily in relation to the availability of capital allowances 2017: 131.6m.
The Group estimates that a reasonably possible range of settlement outcomes for the uncertain tax positions could be in the range from nil to the full value of the provision.
Due to the uncertainty associated with such tax positions, it is possible that at a future date, and on conclusion of these open tax positions, the final outcomes may vary significantly.
While a range of outcomes is reasonably possible, the Group continues to believe that it has made appropriate provision for periods which are open and not yet agreed with the tax authorities.
In May 2017, the Groups case concerning the availability of capital allowances on Glendoe Hydro Electric Station was heard at the First Tier Tribunal.
It is likely that a decision will be issued during the year to 31 March 2019, potentially resulting in the provision carried in relation to that case being released or utilised.
The Group does not currently anticipate any material changes to the amounts carried for other uncertain tax positions during the next twelve months.

Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset, including the asset balances analysed in the tables above.
The following is an analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: 2018 2017 m m Deferred tax liabilities 1,002.8 788.9 Deferred tax assets 294.7 322.3 Net deferred tax liabilities assets 708.1 466.6 The deferred tax assets disclosed include the deferred tax relating to the Groups pension scheme liabilities.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures are recorded as part of the Groups share of investment in those entities.
The aggregate amount of these is a charge, excluding exceptional items and re-measurement, of 3.1m 2017: 6.5m charge.
In total there are 103.5m of unrecognised deferred tax assets.
The Group has not recognised an asset of 41.2m 2017: 64.8m on losses of 137.4m 2017: 216.0m in respect of ring fence corporation tax, an asset of 8.9m 2017: 21.6m on losses of 89.2m 2017: 216.0m in respect of ring fence supplementary profits, an asset of 32.7m 2017: nil on activated investment allowances of 327.1m 2017: nil primarily in respect of the Greater Laggan Area fields and an asset of 20.6m 2017: 25.8m on trading losses of 165.1m 2017: 206.4m in the Republic of Ireland.
These assets have not been recognised as the Group is uncertain that there will be sufficient future profits against which to utilise the assets.
There is no time limit for expiry of the losses or allowances to which they relate.

Shareholders were able to elect to receive ordinary shares credited as fully paid instead of the cash dividend under the terms of the Companys scrip dividend scheme.
An interim dividend of 28.4p per ordinary share 2017: 27.4p was declared and paid on 16 March 2018 to those shareholders on the SSE plc share register on 19 January 2018.
Shareholders were able to elect to receive ordinary shares credited as fully paid instead of the interim cash dividend under the terms of the Companys scrip dividend scheme.
The proposed final dividend of 66.3p per ordinary share-based on the number of issued ordinary shares at 31 March 2018 is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.
Based on shares in issue at 31 March 2018, this would equate to a final dividend of 678.3m.
Dividends and earnings per share continued 11.2 Basic and adjusted earnings per share The calculation of basic earnings per ordinary share at 31 March 2018 is based on the net profit attributable to Ordinary shareholders and a weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year ended 31 March 2018.
All earnings are from continuing operations.
Adjusted earnings per share has been calculated by excluding the charge for deferred tax, interest on net pension liabilities under IAS 19R and the impact of exceptional items and certain re-measurements Note 7.

Acquisitions, disposals and held-for-sale assets 12.1 Acquisitions There have been no significant acquisitions in the year.
12.2 Disposals i Significant disposals Clyde windfarm On 28 August 2017 the Clyde Extension windfarm, comprising 54 turbines generating an additional 172.8MW, reached its Commercial Operation Date.
In March 2016, SSE announced the initial sale of 49.9% of Clyde Windfarm Scotland Limited Clyde equating to 349.6MW of the existing operational wind farm.
It was agreed between the partners that when Commercial Operation began, the equity stake in Clyde jointly owned by Greencoat UK Wind Plc UKW and GLIL Infrastructure LLP GLIL would be diluted from 49.9% to 30%, with the Group retaining 70%.
Due to the contractual agreement between the parties, the Group assessed that dilution did not give rise to a change in control, therefore Clyde remains an equity accounted joint venture.
On 4 September 2017 the Group completed the disposal of a further 5.0% equity stake in Clyde to the existing joint venture partners for consideration of 67.8m, recognising a gain on sale of 24.0m.
At 31 March 2018, the Groups shareholding in Clyde was therefore 65% with UKW and GLIL jointly owning 35%.
In the period prior to disposal, the 5% equity stake in the windfarm contributed 0.2m to profit before tax of the Group.

Acquisitions, disposals and held-for-sale assets continued 12.2 Disposals continued As part of that disposal agreement, UKW and GLIL also have the option to buy a further 14.9% of Clyde, equating to 77.8MW, for a cash consideration of 202.2m, before costs.
This option can be exercised between 1 April 2018 and 30 June 2018 and would result in SSEs equity share in Clyde reducing to 50.1% with UKW and GLIL owning the remaining 49.9%.
As a result, 14.9% of the Groups investment in Clyde has been presented as held for sale at 31 March 2018.
On 8 May 2018, subsequent to the financial year end, UKW and GLIL announced that they will exercise their option to purchase 14.9% of on 30 May 2018 for consideration of 202.0m.
Following the sale of this stake, the Group will retain 50.1% in the equity accounted joint venture.
The gain on sale will be calculated following completion of the sale.
Ferrybridge MFE2 On 7 September 2017, the Group disposed of a 50% equity stake in its subsidiary Ferrybridge MFE2 Limited to Wheelabrator Technologies Inc. for consideration of 62.5m, recognising nil gain loss on disposal of the subsidiary.
The Group disposed of a subsidiary on the date it lost control and acquired a joint venture which it then recognised at fair value under the principles of both IFRS 3 Business Combinations and IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements.
A gain of 6.7m was recognised on acquisition of the joint venture following the fair value assessment.
The Groups 50% interest in Ferrybridge MFE2 was classified as held for sale at 31 March 2017. ii Disposal reconciliation The following table summarises all businesses and assets disposed of during the financial year, including those not previously held for sale and including other assets and investments disposed of as part of the normal course of business and which are noted in the relevant respective notes to the financial statements.

14.3m of operating wind farm assets were held for sale at 31 March 2017.
The other held for sale items in prior year related to 50% of the assets and liabilities of Ferrybridge MFE 2 Limited which was disposed on 7 September 2017 Note 12.2.
12.4 Acquisitions and disposals in the previous year i Acquisitions in the previous year In the prior year, the Group increased its share in the Doggerbank Offshore Wind development to 37.5% following an acquisition of an additional 12.5% stake from former consortium partner Statkraft for consideration of 15.8m.
In addition, the Group reversed a previous impairment of 10.7m in respect of the project within other intangible assets.
ii Disposals in the previous year On 26 October 2016, the Group completed the disposal of a 16.7% equity stake in Scotia Gas Networks SGN to wholly owned subsidiaries of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority ADIA.
After transaction costs and adjustments, cash consideration received was 615.1m and an exceptional gain on sale of 307.3m was recognised on disposal.
Following the divestment, the Group continues to retain a 33.3% equity stake in SGN.
These assets were not held for sale at 31 March 2016.
The disposed 16.7% stake of SGN sold contributed 34.2m to the Groups reported profits in the prior financial year.
On 21 January 2016, the company sold a 10% share in Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Limited to CI Beatrice I Limited and CI Beatrice II Limited split equally between the two entities for total consideration of 31.7m, of which 21.2m was deferred.
The deferred element of the consideration was contingent on certain events occurring after the balance sheet date.
Following confirmation of those events in May 2016, the Group received net cash proceeds of 31.7m which also included an element of deferred consideration associated with a prior divestment 10.5m.
The Group consequently recognised a 20.3m gain on disposal in the prior year.
On 26 May 2016, the Group disposed of 43.5m of smart meter assets to Meter Fit 10 Limited for cash consideration equal to book value resulting in nil gain loss on disposal and, at the same time, entered into a contract with the purchaser for meter asset services.
On 30 March 2017, the Group completed the disposal of its stake in three Tay Valley Streetlighting joint ventures in Leeds, Stoke and Newcastle to DIF Infra 4 UK Limited for net consideration of 40.4m, resulting in a gain on sale of 2.2m.

Commentary on the impairment testing of the related CGUs, with the exception of two historic balances totalling 18.5m, is included in Note 15.
A summary of the goodwill allocated to CGUs and the Groups operating segments is presented below: 2018 2017 Cash-generating unit Operating Segment m m Windfarms Electricity Generation 328.5 324.6 GB Energy Supply SSE Energy Services Energy Supply and SSE Energy Services 187.0 187.0 Energy Related Services 1 Energy Solutions Business Energy & Enterprise 47.9 47.9 2 Ireland Supply Airtricity 8.2 8.2 571.6 567.7 1 Enterprise Energy Solutions includes goodwill balances arising from historic acquisitions of Telecoms and Contracting businesses of 10.3m and a further 37.6m in relation to the acquisition of Energy Solutions Group ESG.
The amount of goodwill associated with the historic businesses is not significant in context of the aggregate carrying value of the business units or the aggregate value of goodwill held by the Group.
2 The value associated with the Ireland supply goodwill represents the difference between the fair value attributed to the Northern Ireland based Phoenix Energy business acquired in 2012 and the book value of those assets.
No impairment has been recognised during the year on this balance.
ii Allowances and certificates Allowances and Certificates consist of purchased carbon emissions allowances and generated or purchased renewable obligations certificates ROCs.
These allowances and certificates will be utilised in settlement of environmental obligations incurred by the Groups Generation and business and domestic energy supply businesses.
iii Development assets Development costs relate to the design, construction and testing of thermal and renewable generation sites and devices, including wind farms, which the Group believes will generate probable future economic benefits.
Costs capitalised as development intangibles include options over land rights, planning application costs, environmental impact studies and other costs incurred in bringing wind farm and other generation and network development projects to the consented stage.
These may be costs incurred directly or at a cost as part of the fair value attribution on acquisition.
Development assets also include the Groups exploration and evaluation expenditure in relation to North Sea gas production wells.
At the point the development reaches the consent stage and is approved for construction, the carrying value is transferred to Property, Plant and Equipment Note 14.
At the point a project is no longer expected to reach the consented stage, the carrying amount of the project is impaired.
In the prior year, an exceptional credit of 20.0m was recognised in relation to prospect assets at Greater Laggan based on reassessed additional prospective resources.
This was a partial reversal of a prior year impairment.
iv Other intangible assets Included within other intangible assets are brands, customer lists, contracts, application software license fees, software development work, software upgrades and purchased PC software packages.
Amortisation is over the shorter of the contract term or five years with the exception of certain application software assets, which are amortised over 10 years.
Exceptional impairment charges have been recognised in relation to Retail and other technology developments of 12.4m 2017: 78.1m see Note 7.

Impairment testing Goodwill and intangibles that are not amortised are reviewed at least annually for impairment and PPE and other intangibles are assessed annually for impairment triggers.
The Groups accounting policies and methodologies for impairment testing are described at Accompanying Information sections A1.2.
The key operating and valuation assumptions, specific considerations and outcome of tests for all impairment reviews are noted in the following sections.
The discount rates used are pre-tax real, except where noted, and reflect specific risks attributable to the relevant operating segments.
The discount rates used have been benchmarked against externally published rates used by comparable quoted companies operating in the respective market sectors.
The discount rates applied in both 2018 and 2017 remain consistent across all CGUs, except where noted, reflecting the Groups view of cost of capital and risk.
The recoverable amounts derived from the VIU or FVLCS calculations are compared to the carrying amount of each asset or CGU to determine whether an impairment charge requires to be recognised.
The reviews carried out for the 2018 accounts were carried out in the fourth quarter of the year, which is consistent with previous reviews.
Note that the actual outcomes may differ from the assumptions included in the assessments at the balance sheet date.

This ruling occurred after the reporting date, and as such, management has considered that it is a non-adjusting post-balance sheet event, however the highly likely receipt of the damages award has been considered in the impairment assessment.
After accounting for the receipt of damages, there is significant headroom on the asset.
A 1% increase in the discount rate, or a 10% decrease in forecast future cashflows would not result in an impairment to the asset.

ii On 13 May 2016, the Group agreed to waive certain contractual rights that gave rise to the accounting judgement that the Group had power to control the relevant activities of Clyde.
As a consequence, during the year to 31 March 2017 the Group changed its accounting for Clyde to that of an investment in an equity-accounted joint venture.
In the above, an equity investment of 144.2m and loans of 264.9m were recognised on deconsolidation.
16.2 Acquisitions and disposals of equity in the current year In September 2017, the Group disposed of a 5% equity stake in Clyde Windfarm Scotland Limited Clyde to the existing joint venture partners see Note 12.2.
In addition, the Group disposed of a wholly owned subsidiary, Ferrybridge MFE2 Limited, and acquired a 50% stake in a joint venture under the principles of IFRS 3.

The Group estimates the value of residual electricity consumption uncertainty at the year end is plus or minus 25.0m 2017: plus or minus 25.0m.
The Group also applies a percentage reduction to consumption estimates in relation to gas to take account of inaccuracies in the industry settlement process which have historically allocated more volume to the Group than has been recovered through subsequent billings.

It is expected that the costs associated with decommissioning of the Groups Gas Production assets will be incurred between 2019 and 2040.
During the year, the Group increased the decommissioning liabilities held in respect of its Ferrybridge Power plant by 18.4m based on estimates of costs to be incurred from 2019.
Further increases of 23.2m were recognised relating to reassessments of provisions for windfarm and thermal generation assets.
ii The Group holds provisions in relation to certain long-term construction contracts.
This includes the Groups retained sub-contracts with the various street-lighting PFI companies that have been disposed during the current and prior year.
During the year, an exceptional provision of 6.3m was recognised relating to heat network provisions.

iv Other provisions relate to costs associated with claims and disputes and the employer financed retirement benefit provision for certain directors and former directors and employees, which is valued in accordance with IAS 19.
Sources of finance 21.1 Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong balance sheet and credit rating to support investor, counterparty and market confidence in the Group and to underpin future development of the business.
The Groups credit ratings are also important in maintaining an efficient cost of capital and in determining collateral requirements throughout the Group.
As at 31 March 2018, the Groups long term credit rating was A stable outlook for Standard & Poors and A3 stable outlook for Moodys.
The maintenance of a medium-term corporate model is a key control in monitoring the development of the Groups capital structure and allows for detailed scenarios and sensitivity testing.
Key ratios drawn from this analysis underpin regular updates to the Board and include the ratios used by the rating agencies in assessing the Groups credit ratings.
During the year, the Group completed its discretionary share buyback programme announced on 11 November 2016 to reduce the share capital of the Company.
In total 34.8m shares were purchased for consideration of 499.7m excluding stamp duty and commission, of which 9.2m 125.0m were retained as treasury shares to settle some of the Groups obligations under the Sharesave scheme in the UK and 25.6m shares were cancelled.
See further detail within Note 22.
The Groups debt requirements are principally met through issuing bonds denominated in Sterling and Euros as well as private placements and medium term bank loans including those with the European Investment Bank.
In the financial, year SSE successfully issued its inaugural Green Bond, an eight year 600m bond with a coupon of 0.875% and an all-in cost of 0.98%, which represented the lowest coupon ever achieved by SSE.
In March 2018, SSE drew the 200m EIB facility, signed in March 2017, as two 100m, 10 year floating rate loans and rolled the maturing 105m term loan for a further two years.
SSE also exercised the second, and last, one year extension option on its 1.3bn revolving credit facility and 200m bilateral facility meaning these facilities now mature in July 2022 and November 2022 respectively.
The 1.5bn of committed bank facilities can be accessed at short notice for use in managing the Groups short term funding requirements, however these committed facilities remain undrawn for the majority of the time.

The following definitions apply in the calculation of these financial covenants: Operating Profit means, in relation to a relevant period, the profit on ordinary activities before taxation after adding back Net Interest Payable of the Group for that relevant period but after adjusting this amount to exclude any exceptional profits or losses and, for the avoidance of doubt, before taking account of any extraordinary profits or losses and excluding the effect of IAS 39.
Net Interest Payable means, in respect of any relevant period, interest payable during that relevant period less interest receivable during that relevant period.
In summary, the Groups intent is to balance returns to shareholders between current returns through dividends and long-term capital investment for growth.
In doing so, the Group will maintain its capital discipline and will continue to operate within the current economic environment prudently.
There were no changes to the Groups capital management approach during the year.

The cash and cash equivalents are lower year on year due to the repayment of 1.0bn Hybrids maturing in October 17, which were refinanced in March 17.
21.3 Borrowing facilities The Group has an established 1.5bn Euro commercial paper programme paper can be issued in a range of currencies and swapped into sterling and as at 31 March 2018 no commercial paper was outstanding 2017: nil.
During the year, the Group extended its existing 1.5bn revolving credit and bilateral facilities by invoking the second of the two, one year extension options with the facilities now maturing in July 2022 1.3bn and November 2022 0.2bn.
These facilities continue to provide back up to the commercial paper programme and, as at 31 March 2018, they were undrawn.
ii The fair value adjustment relates to the change in the carrying amount of the borrowings as a result of fair value hedges that are in place.
The movement in the fair value adjustment is recognised in the income statement with a corresponding movement on the hedging instrument also being recognised in the income statement.
iii The weighted average interest rates including the effect of interest rate swaps for the year ended 31 March 2018 was 3.56% 2017: 3.66%.

The lease is for use of Marchwood Powers main asset, an 890MW Gas powered CCGT Electricity Generating Plant.
The term of the lease is 15 years with the Group having the option for a further 5 years extension at the end of this period.
25.8m 2017: 23.6m of contingent rents paid under the lease were included within cost of sales for the period.
Contingent rent consists of MWh charges for availability of the plant for energy production and a MWh charge for actual nominated energy produced.
Of the remaining finance leases held by the Group, the average remaining term of the telecom leases is 1 year.
No arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments for these leases.
The fair value of the Groups lease obligations approximates their carrying amount.
The Groups obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors rights over the leased assets.
The Company does not have any obligations under finance leases.
ii Hybrid Debt On 16 March 2017, the Group issued 1.0bn of new hybrid debt securities.
The securities have an issuer first call date on 16 September 2022 and are able to be redeemed at the Groups discretion.
This dual tranche issue comprises 300m with a coupon of 3.625% and $900m with a coupon of 4.75%.
The $900m tranche has been swapped back to both Euros and Sterling, bringing the all-in rate down to 2.72% and resulting in an all-in funding cost for both tranches to SSE of 3.02% per annum.
This compares favourably to the all-in funding cost of 4.02% achieved on SSEs most recent Hybrid equity securities issued in 2015.
The proceeds were used to repay SSEs hybrid issued in 2012 at an all-in rate of 5.6% on 1 October 2017.
Due to the hybrid instruments issued in March 2017 having a fixed redemption date, they have been accounted for as a debt item and are included within Loans and Other Borrowings in Note 21.2.
This is in contrast to the previous Hybrid instruments which have no fixed redemption date and are accounted for as Equity, see Note 22.5.

The coupon payments in the year to 31 March 2018 consequently totalled 98.5m 2017: 119.3m.
The Company has the option to defer coupon payments on the bonds on any relevant payment date, as long as a dividend on the ordinary shares has not been declared.
Deferred coupons shall be satisfied only in the following circumstances, all of which occur at the sole option of the Company: redemption: or dividend payment on ordinary shares.
Interest will accrue on any deferred coupon.
Retirement benefit obligations Defined benefit schemes The Group has two funded final salary pension schemes which provide defined benefits based on final pensionable pay.
The schemes are subject to independent valuations at least every three years.
The future benefit obligations are valued by actuarial methods on the basis of an appropriate assessment of the relevant parameters.
The Company operates one of these schemes, being the Scottish Hydro-Electric scheme.
The Group also has an Employer Financed Retirement Benefit scheme and a Group Personal Pension Plan.
The Group Personal Pension Plan operates on a Money purchase basis and has been arranged with Friends Provident.
The Group matches employee contributions up to a specified limit, in most circumstances this is set at 6%.
The Group may also provide additional contributions of 3% after five years and a further 3% after ten years continuous Group service.
The Group presents its pension scheme valuations under two different measurement bases, an actuarial valuation and an IAS 19 valuation as required by accounting standards.
The IAS 19 valuation is used to determine the assets and obligations recognised in the Groups consolidated balance sheet and is calculated annually by scheme actuaries, whereas the formal actuarial valuation is used to determine the contributions the Group make to the scheme.
The actuarial valuation is recalculated for each scheme every three years.
Actuarial valuations The individual pension scheme details based on the latest formal actuarial valuations are as follows: Scottish Hydro Electric Southern Electric Latest formal actuarial valuation 31 March 2015 31 March 2016 Valuation carried out by Hymans Robertson Aon Hewitt Value of assets based on valuation 1,916.0m 1,828.4m Value of liabilities based on valuation 1,964.7m 2,245.5m Valuation method adopted Projected Unit Projected Unit Average salary increase Inflation curve plus 1.0% pa RPI 1% Average pension increase RPI RPI Value of fund assets accrued benefits 97.5% 81.4% Future contributions Scottish Hydro Electric Scheme The last actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out at 31 March 2015 and showed a deficit of 48.7m.
In line with this funding valuation the Group has agreed a schedule of contributions until September 2019 which is expected to adequately fund the scheme and reduce any shortfall.
The Group has also set out an agreed schedule of contributions in respect of current accrual.
Based on this schedule of contributions, total contributions of approximately 27.0m are expected to be paid by the Company during the year ending on 31 March 2019, including deficit repair contributions of 14m.
The Company has agreed to pay this amount annually until March 2019.
The next funding valuation will be carried out as at 31 March 2018 and is expected to be finalised by 30 September 2018.
As part of that valuation process the trustee and Company will agree a long term funding strategy, which may include a revision to the schedule of contributions.
Southern Electric Pension Scheme The last actuarial valuation of the Scheme as at 31 March 2016 and showed a deficit of 417.1m.
The Group is paying deficit contributions which, along with investment returns from return-seeking assets, is expected to make good this shortfall by 31 March 2028.
The next funding valuation will be carried out as at 31 March 2019.
The Company also pays contributions in respect of current accrual, with some active members also paying contributions.
Total contributions of approximately 67.8m are expected to be paid by the Company during the year ending on 31 March 2019 including deficit repair contributions of 43.2m.
These payments will be made annually until March 2020.

IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction clarifies that future refunds may be recognised if the sponsoring entity has an unconditional right to a refund in certain circumstances.
During the prior financial year, the Group agreed with the trustees to the Scottish Hydro Electric pensions scheme an amendment to the scheme rules to clarify that the Company has a clear right to any surplus upon final winding up of the scheme.
This amendment removes the previous restriction on recognition of any surplus and as such the previously applied restriction is no longer recognised.
The net pension asset of the Scottish Hydro Electric Scheme at 31 March 2018 was equal to 572.1m 2017: 525.4m.
At 31 March 2018, the Southern Electric Pension Scheme has a net deficit of 237.6m, and unrecognised future contributions of 341.1m, which when paid, will result in a notional surplus of 103.5m.
The Group has assessed that it has the right to recognise any future surpluses on the scheme, therefore has not recognised a liability for future unrecoverable contributions.
23.1 Pension scheme assumptions Both schemes have been updated to 31 March 2018 by qualified independent actuaries.
The valuations have been prepared for the purposes of meeting the requirements of IAS 19.
The major assumptions used by the actuaries in both schemes were: At 31 March At 31 March 2018 2017 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.2% 4.3% Rate of increase in pension payments 3.2% 3.3% Discount rate 2.65% 2.65% Inflation rate 3.2% 3.3% 23.2 Sensitivity analysis The assumptions relating to longevity underlying the pension liabilities at 31 March 2018 are based on standard actuarial mortality tables, and include an allowance for future improvements in longevity.

The most financially significant risks are likely to be: i Asset volatility The liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit.
The schemes hold a significant proportion of growth assets equities, diversified growth fund and global absolute return fund which, though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term, create volatility and risk in the short-term.
The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the Schemes long term objectives.
ii Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the schemes liabilities for accounting purposes.
However, this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the schemes bond holdings.
iii Inflation Risk The majority of the schemes benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation.
The majority of the assets are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
iv Life Expectancy The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the members, so an increase in the life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.
The sensitivity analysis disclosed is intended to provide an indication of the impact on the value of the schemes liabilities of the risks highlighted.
v Liability vs asset risk The risk that movement in the value of the schemes liabilities are not met by corresponding movements in the value of the schemes assets.
Retirement benefit obligations continued 23.5 Pension scheme risk assessment and mitigation continued Risk mitigation i fide-risking The trustees have taken a number of steps to control the level of investment risk including reducing the schemes exposures to higher risk assets and increasing the level of protection against adverse movements in interest rates and inflation.
The trustees of both schemes continue to review the risk exposures in light of the longer term objectives of the respective schemes.
ii Longevity swap During the year the Scottish Hydro Electric scheme entered into a longevity swap covering c800m of the schemes liabilities related to 1,800 pensioners and 567 dependents.
The scheme has agreed an average life expectancy for the Group of pensioners with an external counterparty meaning that if the pensioners live longer than the agreed average life expectancy, the counterparty will make payments to the scheme to compensate the additional cost of paying the pensioners.
However, if the pensioners do not live as long as agreed, the scheme will benefit from reduced payments to pensioners but will be required to compensate the counterparty to the swap.
The longevity swap is valued under the accounting principles of IFRS 13 and is considered a Level 3 instrument in the fair value hierarchy.
iii Asset buy-in During the year the Scottish Hydro Electric scheme agreed an asset buy-in with a third party to transfer c250m of the schemes assets and liabilities related to 617 pensioners and 190 dependents to a third party.
The asset swap has the effect of reducing the schemes assets by 256.9m and reducing the schemes liabilities by 228.7m.
The difference between the transfer value of assets and liabilities from the scheme of 28.2m has been recognised as an experience loss and is due to the effect of unwinding the discount on the scheme liabilities to their present value.
iv Asset-liability matching strategies used by the scheme The Company and trustees of the schemes have agreed a long term investment strategy that seeks to reduce investment risk as and when appropriate.
The asset-liability matching strategy is part of this approach which aims to reduce the volatility of the funding level of the pension schemes by investing in assets which perform in line with the liabilities of the schemes so as to protect against inflation being higher than expected.
This has been adopted for a proportion of the schemes assets, which is designed to provide partial protection against adverse movements in interest rates and inflation.
The trustees of the respective schemes review the schemes asset allocation on an ongoing basis in light of changes in the funding position and market opportunities.
Risk assessment i Maturity profile of the defined benefit obligations The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 21.2 years 2017: 22 years for the Scottish Hydro Electric Pension Scheme and 18 years 2017: 18 years for the Southern Electric Pension Scheme.
ii Information about the defined benefit obligations Status of members is weighted by the liabilities of each scheme Scottish Hydro Southern Electric Electric Scheme % % Active members 41 39 Deferred members 11 9 Pensioners 48 52 100.0 100.0 23.6 Pension scheme policies i Recognition of gains and losses The Group recognises actuarial gains and losses in the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income following the re-measurement of the net defined benefit liabilities of the schemes.
ii Methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analyses The sensitivities disclosed are calculated using approximate methods taking into account the duration of the schemes liabilities.
While these have been calculated consistently with the previous financial year, the method applied may change over time with financial conditions and assumptions.
iii Asset recognition The Group has recognised net pension assets in relation to the Scottish Hydro Electric pension scheme due to a surplus existing under IAS 19 accounting.
The Group will only recognise a surplus should it have rights to that surplus under the rules of the pension scheme.
The company has no longer applies the asset ceiling restriction mandated by IFRIC 14 in respect of the Scottish Hydro Pension scheme following the modification of the scheme rules in the prior year.
Details on this key accounting consideration are provided above.
SSE plc Annual Report 2018 197 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2018 23.
Retirement benefit obligations continued 23.6 Pension scheme policies continued iv Fair value assessment of scheme assets The Group seeks to assess whether there is a quotable market value referenced as quotable above in relation to pension scheme assets held.
This assessment is based on regular reviews conducted in conjunction with the trustees of the schemes.
For assets where no quotable market value exists, these assets will be valued based on a set methodology agreed by trustees and scheme advisors and then regularly assessed.
Currently only one unquotable value exists within the two pension schemes of the Group, this being insurance contracts held by the Scottish Hydro Electric Scheme which were entered into during the current financial year.
These assets are currently valued consistently with the schemes liabilities with the expected return on these assets being set equal to the discount rate.
Financial instruments For financial reporting purposes, the Group has classified derivative financial instruments into two categories, operating derivatives and financing derivatives.
Operating derivatives include all qualifying commodity contracts including those for electricity, gas, oil, coal and carbon.
Financing derivatives include all fair value and cash flow interest rate hedges, non-hedge accounted mark-to-market interest rate derivatives, cash flow foreign exchange hedges and non-hedge accounted foreign exchange contracts.
Non-hedge accounted contracts are treated as held for trading.

Certain obligations under power purchase agreements with various power generating companies are not deemed to qualify as finance leases, as the lease term is not judged to be substantially all of the economic life of the power station and the present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception of the agreements did not amount to substantially all of the fair value of the power stations at that time.
ii Leases as lessor: The Group have no operating lease commitments as a lessor.
Post balance sheet events i Disposal of 14.9% equity stake in Clyde Windfarm Scotland Limited On 8 May 2018, the Groups joint venture partners Greencoat UK Wind Plc UKW and GLIL Infrastructure LLP GLIL announced they would exercise their option to purchase a 14.9% equity stake in Clyde Windfarm Scotland Limited for consideration of 202.0m on 30 May 2018 Note 12.
ii Ruling on the Groups claim for damages following a tunnel collapse on the Glendoe hydro power station On 10 April 2018, a ruling was passed in the Court of Session in Edinburgh to award SSE damages of 108.6m plus interest in its case against the main building contractor of the Glendoe hydro power station, following the collapse of a tunnel in 2009.
As this award remains subject to appeal by the contractor, receipt of the award is not yet virtually certain and these financial statements have not been adjusted to recognise receipt of the award.
However, SSE considers that receipt of the award is highly likely and has considered the award of damages when testing the power station for impairment on 31 March 2018 Note 15.
