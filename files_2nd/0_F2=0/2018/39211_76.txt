Impairment of financial assets Under IFRS 9, an expected credit loss ECL model replaces the incurred loss model, meaning there no longer needs to be a triggering event in order to recognise impairment losses.
A credit loss provision must be made for the amount of any loss expected to arise, whereas under IAS 39, credit losses are recognised when they are incurred.
See note 1.12 for more detail on the ECL model.
Impact of the new impairment model The initial application of IFRS 9s impairment requirements at 1 January 2018 resulted in an additional impairment provision as follows: '000 Loss provision at 31 December 2017 under IAS 39 66 Additional impairment recognised at 1 January 2018 on: treasury book: cash and balances with central banks 92 loans and advances to banks 3 debt securities 31 loans and advances to customers: investment management loan book 1 21 trust and financial planning debtors 148 Loss provision at 1 January 2018 under IFRS 9 214 Additional impairment recognised at 1 January 2018 relate to financial assets classified and measured at amortised cost.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 changes how and when revenue is recognised from contracts with customers and the treatment of the costs of obtaining a contract with a customer.
The standard requires that the recognition of revenue is linked to the fulfilment of identified performance obligations that are enshrined in the customer contract.
It also requires that the incremental cost of obtaining a customer contract should be capitalised if that cost is expected to be recovered.
The standard replaces existing revenue recognition guidance, in particular under IAS 18.

Impact on financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018 The group has considered the impact of adopting the standard, on its existing revenue streams, as well as on its policy of capitalising Impairment of financial assets the cost of obtaining customer contracts.
Under IFRS 9, an expected credit loss ECL model replaces the incurred loss model, meaning there no longer needs to be a triggering event in order to recognise impairment losses.
A credit loss provision must be made for the amount of any loss expected to arise, Net fee and commission income whereas under IAS 39, credit losses are recognised when they are incurred.
Included within net fee and commission income are initial fees, charged by a number of group companies in relation to certain business activities.
Under IFRS 15, the group has made an assessment as to whether the work performed to earn such fees constitutes Impact of the new impairment model the transfer of services and, therefore, fulfils any performance obligation s. If so, then these fees can be recognised when the relevant The initial application of IFRS 9s impairment requirements at 1 January 2018 resulted in an additional impairment provision as follows: performance obligation has been satisfied: if not, then the fees can only be recognised in the period in which the services are provided.

The goodwill has been allocated to the investment management CGU see note 35.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs to which goodwill is allocated are assessed using value-in-use calculations.
The group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by the board, covering the forthcoming and future years.
The key assumptions underlying the budgets are that organic growth rates, revenue margins and profit margins are in line with recent historical rates and equity markets will not change significantly in the forthcoming year.
Budgets are extrapolated for up to 10 years based on annual revenue growth for each CGU see table below : as well as the group's expectation of future industry growth rates.
A 10 year extrapolation period is chosen based on the group's assessment of the likely associated duration of client relationships.
The group estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for each CGU is shown in the table below: these are based on a risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital.
The group judges that these discount rates appropriately reflect the markets in which the CGUs operate and, in particular, the relatively small size of the trust and tax CGU.

An impairment was recognised, as the recoverable amount of the CGU at 30 June 2018 was 595,000, which was lower than the carrying value of 864,000 at 31 December 2017.
The recoverable amount was calculated based on forecast earnings for 2018, extrapolated over 10 years based on a decrease in revenues of 1.0% per annum.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows was 15.0%.
The impairment was recognised in the Investment Management segment in the segmental analysis.
No further impairment was recognised at 31 December 2018.
Based on the assumptions in the table above, the calculated recoverable amount of the trust and tax CGU at 31 December 2018 was 1,729,000: this was higher than its carrying value of 595,000.
Reducing the assumed growth rate for income in the trust and tax CGU by one percentage point would reduce the calculated recoverable amount of the CGU to 828,000.
No reasonably foreseeable changes to the assumptions used in the value-in-use calculation for the investment management CGU, including managements assessment of the impact of Brexit, would result in an impairment of the goodwill allocated to it.

28 Long-term employee benefits Defined contribution pension scheme The group operates a defined contribution group personal pension scheme and contributes to various other personal pension arrangements for certain directors and employees.
The total of contributions made to these schemes during the year was 7,959,000 2017: 6,213,000.
The group also operates a defined contribution scheme for overseas employees, for which the total contributions were 36,000 2017: 47,000.
Defined benefit pension schemes The group operates two defined benefit pension schemes that operate within the UK legal and regulatory framework: the Rathbone 1987 Scheme and the Laurence Keen Retirement Benefit Scheme.
The schemes are currently both clients of Rathbone Investment Management, with investments managed on a discretionary basis, in accordance with the statements of investment principles agreed by the trustees.
Scheme assets are held separately from those of the group.
The trustees of the schemes are required to act in the best interest of the schemes' beneficiaries.
The appointment of trustees is determined by the schemes trust documentation and legislation.
The group has a policy that one third of all trustees should be nominated by members of the schemes.
Following a recent high court ruling, the cost of equalising pension benefits for the impact of unequal Guaranteed Minimum Pensions GMP has been recognised.
Only the Laurence Keen Scheme is impacted.
The Rathbone 1987 Scheme was never contracted out, meaning there are no GMP benefits in this scheme.
Ahead of a specific method for equalisation being agreed with the scheme trustees, the cost has been estimated using a method consistent with that deemed by the high court to be the minimum necessary requirements to achieve equality.
This has resulted in a plan amendment loss of 125,000 being recognised in staff costs.
The Laurence Keen Scheme was closed to new entrants and future accrual with effect from 30 September 1999.
Past service benefits continue to be calculated by reference to final pensionable salaries.
From 1 October 1999, all the active members of the Laurence Keen Scheme were included under the Rathbone 1987 Scheme for accrual of retirement benefits for further service.
The Rathbone 1987 Scheme was closed to new entrants with effect from 31 March 2002 and to future accrual from 30 June 2017.
This resulted in a plan amendment gain of 5,523,000 being recognised in operating income on that date.
The group provides death in service benefits to all employees through the Rathbone 1987 Scheme.
Third party insurance is purchased for the benefits where possible and 913,000 of related insurance premiums were expensed to profit or loss in the year 2017: 1,167,000.
The estimated present value of the uninsured death in service benefits is included in long term employee benefits liabilities.
The schemes are valued by independent actuaries at least every three years using the projected unit credit method, which looks at the value of benefits accruing over the years following the valuation date based on projected salary to the date of termination of services, discounted to a present value using a rate that reflects the characteristics of the liability.
The valuations are updated at each balance sheet date in between full valuations.
The latest full actuarial valuations were carried out as at the following dates: Rathbone 1987 Scheme 31 December 2016 Laurence Keen Scheme 31 December 2016 The next triennial valuations of the two schemes will be carried out as at 31 December 2019, and are likely to result in changes to the funding commitments.
The assumptions used by the actuaries, to estimate the schemes' liabilities, are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions.
Due to the timescale covered by the liability, these assumptions may not necessarily be borne out in practice.

The funds are selected so that their average duration is intended to broadly align with the duration of the scheme's liabilities.
All equity and debt instruments have quoted prices in active markets.

Other scheme assets comprise commodities and property funds, both of which also have quoted prices in active markets.
The key assumptions affecting the results of the valuation are the discount rate, future inflation, mortality, the rate of members transferring out and the average age at the time of transferring out.
In order to demonstrate the sensitivity of the results to these assumptions, the actuary has recalculated the defined benefit obligations for each scheme by varying each of these assumptions in isolation whilst leaving the other assumptions unchanged.
For example, in order to demonstrate the sensitivity of the results to the discount rate, the actuary has recalculated the defined benefit obligations for each scheme using a discount rate that is 0.5% higher than used for calculating the disclosed figures.
A similar approach has been taken to demonstrate the sensitivity of the results to the other key assumptions.

The group categorises its financial risks into the following primary areas: i credit risk which includes counterparty default risk : ii liquidity risk: iii market risk which includes fair value interest rate risk, cash flow interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and price risk : and iv pension risk.
The group's exposures to pension risk are set out in note 28.
The groups financial risk management policies are designed to identify and analyse the financial risks that the group faces, to set appropriate risk tolerances, limits and controls and to monitor the financial risks and adherence to limits by means of reliable and up-to-date information systems.
The group regularly reviews its financial risk management policies and systems to reflect changes in the business, counterparties, markets and the range of financial instruments that it utilises.
The treasury department, reporting through the banking committee, has principal responsibility for monitoring exposure to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk.
Procedures and delegated authorities are documented in a group treasury manual and policy documents prescribe the management and monitoring of each type of risk.
The primary objective of the groups treasury policy is to manage short term liquidity requirements whilst maintaining an appropriate level of exposure to other financial risks in accordance with the groups risk appetite.
i Credit risk The group takes on exposure to credit risk, which is the risk that a counterparty will be unable to pay amounts in full when due, through its banking, treasury, trust and financial planning activities.
The principal source of credit risk arises from placing funds in the money market and holding interest-bearing securities.
The group also has exposure to credit risk through its client loan book and guarantees given on clients behalf.
It is the groups policy to place funds generated internally and from deposits by clients with a range of high-quality financial institutions and the Bank of England.
Investments with financial institutions are spread to avoid excessive exposure to any individual counterparty.
Loans made to clients are secured against clients assets that are held and managed by group companies.
Exposure to credit risk is managed through setting appropriate ratings requirements and lending limits.
Limits are reviewed regularly, taking into account the ability of borrowers and potential borrowers to meet repayment obligations.
The group categorises its exposures based on the long term ratings awarded to counterparties by Fitch or Moodys.
Each exposure is assessed individually, both at inception and in ongoing monitoring.
In addition to formal external ratings, the banking committee also utilises market intelligence information to assist its ongoing monitoring.
The group's financial assets are categorised as follows: Balances with central banks note 15 The group has exposure to central banks through its deposits held with the Bank of England.
Loans and advances to banks note 16 and debt and other securities note 18 The group has exposures to a wide range of financial institutions through its treasury portfolio, which includes bank deposits, certificates of deposit, money market funds and treasury bills.
These exposures principally arise from the placement of clients' cash, where it is held under a banking relationship, and the groups own reserves.

IM loan book assessment Due to the lack of historical defaults within the IM loan book, the model see note 1.12 uses publicly available default data for UK secured lending as a starting point in order to obtain an initial estimate for PD.
The 12-month PD is estimated as the historical long term default rate on lending in the UK as sourced from the Council of Mortgage Lending CML.
In order to estimate the PDs occurring over the lifetime of an underlying exposure, the group develops its expectations of future progression in PiT default probabilities, which inherently revolves around expectations of future development of macroeconomic factors relevant to the Banks Lending portfolio, namely UK GDP GDP and UK unemployment rates UR.

The primary objective of the groups treasury policy is to manage short to medium term liquidity requirements.
In addition to setting the treasury policy, Rathbone Investment Management 'the Bank' performs an annual assessment of liquidity adequacy in accordance with the regulatory requirements of the Prudential Regulation Authority PRA our Individual Liquidity Adequacy Assessment.
The Bank faces two principal risks, namely that a significant proportion of client funds are withdrawn over a short period of time retail funding risk and the risk that marketable assets may not be capable of being realised in the time and at the value required marketable assets risk.
Retail funding risks are monitored by daily cash mismatch analyses and Basel Committee ratios using expected cash and asset maturity profiles and regular forecasting work.
This is supported by stress tests which cover firm-specific idiosyncratic scenarios and or the effects of unforeseen market wide stresses.
Marketable assets risk is primarily managed by holding cash and marketable instruments which are realisable at short notice.
The group operates strict criteria to ensure that investments are liquid and placed with high-quality counterparties.
A minimum liquid assets buffer to be held in eligible liquid assets is set by the board at least annually in conjunction with an amount prescribed by the PRA.

com 165 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 37 Interest in unconsolidated structured entities As described in note 36, at 31 December 2018, the group owned units in collectives managed by Rathbone Unit Trust Management with a value of 3,205,000 2017: 2,565,000, representing 0.06% 2017: 0.05% of the total value of the collectives managed by the group.
These assets are held to hedge the group's exposure to deferred remuneration schemes for employees of Unit Trusts.
The group's primary risk associated with its interest in the unit trusts is from changes in fair value of its holdings in the funds.
The group is not judged to control, and therefore does not consolidate, the collectives.
Although the fund trustees have limited rights to remove Rathbone Unit Trust Management as manager, the group is exposed to very low variability of returns from its management and share of ownership of the funds and is therefore judged to act as an agent rather than having control under IFRS 10.

The legislation requires Rathbone Brothers Plc together with its subsidiaries, the group to publish certain additional information, on a consolidated basis, for the year ended 31 December 2018.
Basis of preparation: In most cases, we have determined the country by reference to the country of tax residence.
Where Country an entity is not subject to tax e. g. a partnership we have considered the location of management or the jurisdiction in which the revenues are generated.
In these cases it is possible that tax is paid in a different country to the one in which profits are reported.
The nature of activities within the United Kingdom are described within our services on Nature of activities pages 4 to 5.
Discretionary investment management is the sole activity which occurs in Jersey.
Turnover is defined as operating income.
As the consolidated results are split by country, there Turnover is an element of double counting when inter-jurisdictional transactions for example, the payment of dividends occur.
The entries to eliminate this double counting are included at the bottom of the table to enable the disclosed figures to agree to the published consolidated accounts of the group.
As with turnover some double counting may arise and again this Profit loss before has been eliminated at the bottom of the table.
The majority of the total relates to the elimination taxation of inter-jurisdictional dividends which are reflected as profits in the United Kingdom.
This column reflects corporation tax actually paid in the year.
Note that it is rare that tax paid Tax paid in any given year relates directly to the profits earned in the same period.
