122 ON THE BEACH GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2018 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS b Financial Risk Management In the course of its business the Group is exposed to market risk including foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and technology risk.
The Groups overall risk management strategy is to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance and net assets of the Group.
These policies are set and reviewed by senior finance management and all significant financing transactions are authorised by the Board of Directors.
c Market Risk The Groups key financial market risks are in relation to foreign currency rates.
Foreign currency risk results from the substantial crossborder element of the Groups trading and arises on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the business.
Group cash resources are matched with the net funding requirements sourced from three sources namely internally generated funds, loan facilities and bank funding arrangements.
The foreign currency risk is managed at Group level by the purchase of foreign currency contracts for use as a commercial hedge.
During the course of the period there has been no change to the market risk or manner in which the Group manages its exposure.
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk that arises principally through the Groups revolving credit facility.
Liquidity risk, credit risk and capital risk is considered below.
The executive team is responsible for implementing the risk management strategy to ensure that appropriate risk management framework is operating effectively, embedding a risk mitigation culture throughout the Group.
The Board is provided with a consolidated view of the risk profile of the Group.
All major exposures are identified and mitigating controls identified and implemented.
Regular management reporting and assessment of the effectiveness of controls provide a balanced assessment of the key risks and the effectiveness of controls.
The Group does not speculate with derivatives or other financial instruments.
