Employee Benefit Obligations The Group sponsors defined benefit arrangements in certain countries, the most material being a defined benefit pension plan in the Netherlands.
This is a funded career average pay arrangement, where pensionable salary is subject to a cap.
The arrangement is financed through an insurance contract.
The other defined benefit pension arrangements operated by the Company are unfunded: Jubilee awards of 0.1 million 2017: 0.2 million for employees in the Netherlands are recognised within other payables in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as at 30 June 2018.
The pension cost relating to the defined benefit pension arrangement in the Netherlands is assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The major actuarial assumptions used by the actuary were: 2018 2017 Discount rate 1.90% 2.10% Inflation assumption 1.90% 1.80% Salary growth 2.40% 2.30% Rate of increase in accrued pensions of active members 0.34% 0.80% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 0.00% 0.00% Rate of increase in pensions in deferment 0.00% 0.00% In valuing the liabilities of the pension scheme at 30 June 2018 and 30 June 2017, mortality assumptions have been made as indicated below.
The mortality assumption follows the Prognosetafel AG2016 2017: Prognosetafel AG2016 mortality tables with an experience adjustment in line with the ES-P2 tables as published by the Dutch Alliance of Insurers.

Employee Benefit Obligations continued Scheme Assets The Groups defined benefit pension scheme in the Netherlands is financed through an insurance contract.
Under this contract, a market price for the assets in respect of this insurance contract is not available.
In accordance with IAS 19 for such insurance policies, an asset value has been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows.
The discount rate used for this calculation reflects the risk associated with the scheme assets and the maturity or expected disposal date of those assets.
The fair value of the schemes assets is as follows: 2018 2017 m m Total fair value of assets 17.3 14.9 Actual return on scheme assets 1.5 0.2 Discount rate used to value assets 1.90% 2.10% The long term rate of return on pension plan assets is determined by aggregating the expected return for each asset class over the strategic asset allocation as at the year end.
This rate of return is then adjusted for any expected profit sharing based on market related returns on notional loans.
The schemes assets do not include any of the Groups own financial instruments or any property occupied by or other assets used by the Group.
The employer has a contract with the insurance company  to cover the committed pension benefits.
The employer contributions expected to be paid into the scheme for the next financial period amount to 0.7 million 2017: 0.7 million.

In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the statement of financial position.
