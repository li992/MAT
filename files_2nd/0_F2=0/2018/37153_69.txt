The group's UK automotive battery systems business was sold in January 2018 note 5.
The net assets disposed of included goodwill of 9 million.
The group and parent company test goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined using value in use calculations which use cash flow projections based on financial budgets and plans covering a three-year period approved by management.
The budgets and plans are based on a number of key assumptions.
Assumptions on the likelihood and timing of new product launches are based on managements best estimate of what may happen.
Foreign exchange rates are based on actual forward rates at the time the budgets were prepared and are held constant over the budget and plan years.
Other assumptions, such as market share, expected changes to selling prices, product profitability, precious metal prices and other direct input costs, are based on past experience and managements expectations of future changes in the markets using external sources of information where appropriate.
These cash flows are then extrapolated using the long term average growth rates for the relevant products, industries and countries in which the CGUs operate.
The cash flows are discounted at the groups estimated pre-tax weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the estimated tax cash flows and risk applicable to each CGU.
