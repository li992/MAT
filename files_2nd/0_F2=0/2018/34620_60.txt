Company AtNovember 30,2018, the Company had $3.0billion $2.0 billion in 2017 of contracted capital commitments relating to ship construction contracts.
NOTE 22 Contingencies In the normal course of our business, various claims and lawsuits have been filed or are pending against us.
Most of these claims and lawsuits, or any settlement of claims and lawsuits, are covered byinsurance and the maximum amount of our liability, net of any insurance recoverables, is typically limited to our self-insurance retention levels.
We believe the ultimate outcome of these claims, lawsuits, and settlements, as applicable, each and in the aggregate, will not have a material impact onthe Carnival plc Groupand Company financial statements.
Some of the debt contracts weenter into include indemnification provisions obligating us to make payments to the counterparty if certain events occur.
These contingencies generally relate to changes in taxes or changes in laws which increase our lenders costs.
There are nostated or notional amounts included in the indemnification clauses, and weare not able to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments, if any, under these indemnification clauses.
TheGrouphas not been required to make any material payments under similar indemnification clauses in the past and wedonot believe a request for material future indemnification payments is probable.
NOTE 23 Fair Value Measurements, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and Financial Risk Fair Value Measurements Fair value is defined as the amount that wouldbe received for selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and is measured using inputs in one of the following three categories: Level 1measurements are based onunadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that wehave the ability to access.
Valuation of these items does not entail a significant amount of judgement.
93 Carnival plc Financial Statements Level 2measurements are based onquoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or market data other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities.
Level 3measurements are based onunobservable data that are supported bylittle or nomarket activity and are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
Considerable judgement may be required in interpreting market data used to develop the estimates of fair value.
Accordingly, certain estimates of fair value presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current or future market exchange.

Financial Risks Carnival Corporation & plc manages its financial risks ona consolidated basis.
TheGroups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks such as fuel price risks, foreign currency exchange rate risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Theannual financial statements donot include all financial risk management information and disclosures: as such, they should be read in conjunction with the DLCFinancial Statements, which is included in Annex1, but donot form part of these Carnival plc financial statements.
FuelPriceRisk We manage our exposure to fuel price risk bymanaging our consumption of fuel.
Substantially all of our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates to the consumption of fuel onour ships.
We manage fuel consumption through ship maintenance practices, modifying our itineraries and implementing innovative technologies.
We are also adding new, more fuel efficient ships to our fleet and are strategically disposing of smaller, less fuel efficient ships.
 Overall Strategy We manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates through our normal operating and financing activities, including netting certain exposures to take advantage of any natural offsets and, when considered appropriate, through the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments.
Ourprimary focus is to monitor our exposure to, and manage, the economic foreign currency exchange risks faced byour operations and realised if weexchange one currency for another.
We currently only hedge certain of our ship commitments and net investments in foreign operations.
Thefinancial impacts of the hedging instruments wedoemploy generally offset the changes in the underlying exposures being hedged.
 Ouroperations primarily utilize the U. S. dollar, Australian dollar, euro or sterling as their functional currencies.
Ouroperations also have revenue and expenses denominated in non-functional currencies.
Movements in foreign currency exchange rates will affect our financial statements.
96 Based ona 10% change in all currency exchange rates that were used in Carnival Corporation & plcs December 20,2018guidance, Carnival Corporation & plc estimate its adjusted diluted earnings per share would change by$0.27per share onan annualized basis for 2019.
 Carnival Corporation & plc considers its investments in foreign operations to be denominated in stable currencies.
Carnival Corporation & plcs investments in foreign operations are of a long-term nature.
Carnival Corporation & plc has $5.9billion and $848million of euroand sterling-denominated debt, respectively, including the effect of cross currency swaps, which provides an economic offset for its operations with euro and sterling functional currency.
Carnival Corporation & plc also partially mitigates its net investment currency exposures bydenominating a portion of its foreign currency intercompany payables in its foreign operations functional currencies.
S. dollar functional currency operations assets and liabilities instead of the November 30,2018U.
S. dollar exchange rates, our total assets wouldhave been higher by$589million and our total liabilities wouldhave been higher by$313million.
In addition, based ona 10% change in the U. S. dollar to euro, sterling and Australian dollar exchange rates at November 30,2018, which are the functional currencies wetranslate into our U. S. dollar reporting currency, we estimate our 2018cumulative translation adjustment wouldhave changed by$371million.
NewbuildCurrencyRisk Ourshipbuilding contracts are typically denominated in euros.
Ourdecision to hedge a non-functional currency ship commitment for our cruise brands is made ona case-by-case basis, considering the amount and duration of the exposure, market volatility, economic trends, our overall expected net cash flows bycurrency and other offsetting risks.
We use foreign currency derivative contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk for some of our ship construction payments.
AtNovember 30,2018, Carnival Corporation & plcs remaining newbuild currency exchange rate risk primarily relates to euro-denominated newbuild contract payments to non-euro functional currency brands, which represent a total unhedged commitment of $10.1billion for newbuilds scheduled to be delivered from 2019through 2025.
Thecost of shipbuilding orders that wemay place in the future that is denominated in a different currency than our cruise brands will be affected byforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
These foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may affect our decision to order newcruise ships.
97 Carnival plc Financial Statements InterestRateRisk We manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through our debt portfolio management and investment strategies.
We evaluate our debt portfolio to determine whether to make periodic adjustments to the mix of fixed and floating rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps, issuance of newdebt, amendment of existing debt or early retirement of existing debt.
Based upona 10% change in the November 30,2018market interest rates, its annual interest expense onfloating rate debt wouldchange by an insignificant amount.
Substantially all of Carnival Corporation & plcs fixed rate debt can only be called or prepaid byincurring costs.
 Aspart of our ongoing control procedures, wemonitor concentrations of credit risk associated with financial and other institutions with which weconduct significant business.
We seek to minimise these credit risk exposures, including counterparty nonperformance primarily associated with our cash equivalents, investments, committed financing facilities, contingent obligations, derivative instruments, insurance contracts and newship progress payment guarantees, by: Conducting business with large, well-established financial institutions, insurance companies and export credit agencies 99 Carnival plc Financial Statements Diversifying our counterparties Having guidelines regarding credit ratings and investment maturities that wefollow to help safeguard liquidity and minimise risk Generally requiring collateral and or guarantees to support notes receivable onsignificant asset sales, long-term ship charters and newship progress payments to shipyards We believe the risk of nonperformance byany of our significant counterparties is remote.
AtNovember 30, 2018, our exposures under foreign currency derivative contracts and interest rate swapagreements were not material.
We also monitor the creditworthiness of travel agencies and tour operators in Asia, Australia and Europe, which includes charter-hire agreements in Asia and credit and debit card providers to which weextend credit in the normal course of our business.
Ourcredit exposure also includes contingent obligations related to cash payments received directly bytravel agents and tour operators for cash collected bythem oncruise sales in Australia and most of Europe where weare obligated to honour our guests cruise payments made bythem to their travel agents and tour operators regardless of whether wehave received these payments.
Concentrations of credit risk associated with these trade receivables, charter-hire agreements and contingent obligations are not considered to be material, principally due to the large number of unrelated accounts, the nature of these contingent obligations and their short maturities.
We have not experienced significant credit losses onour trade receivables, charter-hire agreements and contingent obligations.
We donot normally require collateral or other security to support normal credit sales.
