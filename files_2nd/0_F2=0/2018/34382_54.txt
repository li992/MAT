Capital risk management The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt and equity attributable to the equity holders of The British Land Company PLC, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings.
Risks relating to capital structure are addressed within Managing risk in delivering our strategy on pages 48 to 51.
The Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing debt are set out in the Financial policies and principles on pages 45 to 47.
136 British Land Annual Report and Accounts 2018 17 Net debt continued Interest rate risk management The Group uses interest rate swaps and caps to hedge exposure to the variability in cash flows on floating rate debt, such as revolving bank facilities, caused by movements in market rates of interest.
At 31 March 2018, the fair value of these derivatives is a net liability of 118m.
Interest rate swaps with a fair value of 5m have been designated as cash flow hedges under IAS 39.
The ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement on cash flow hedges in the year ended 31 March 2018 was nil 2016 17: nil.
The cash flows occur and are charged to profit and loss until the maturity of the hedged debt.
The table below summarises variable rate debt hedged at 31 March 2018.
Variable rate debt hedged 2018 2017 m m Outstanding: at one year 775 775 at two years 600 775 at five years 250 250 at ten years 250 250 Fair value hedged debt The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge exposure on fixed rate financial liabilities caused by movements in market rates of interest.
At 31 March 2018, the fair value of these derivatives is a net asset of 95m.
Interest rate swaps with a fair value of 110m have been designated as fair value hedges under IAS 39 2016 17: asset of 215m.
The cross currency swaps of the 2018 2021 2023 2026 US Private Placements fully hedge the foreign exchange exposure at an average floating rate of 146 basis points above LIBOR.
These have been designated as fair value hedges of the US Private Placements.
Interest rate profile including effect of derivatives 2018 2017 m m Fixed or capped rate 2,107 1,604 Variable rate net of cash 939 1,490 3,046 3,094 All the debt is effectively Sterling denominated except for 3m 2016 17: 11m of Euro debt of which 3m is at a variable rate 2016 17: 11m.
At 31 March 2018 the weighted average interest rate of the Sterling fixed rate debt is 3.2% 2016 17: 3.3%.
The weighted average period for which the rate is fixed is 9.1 years 2016 17: 8.3 years.
The floating rate debt is set for periods of the Companys choosing at the relevant LIBOR or similar rate.
The proportion of net debt at fixed or capped rates of interest was 80% at 31 March 2018 on a spot basis.
The proportion of net debt at fixed or capped rates of interest as an average over the next five-year forecast period, on a proportionally consolidated basis, was 60% at 31 March 2018.
Based on the Groups interest rate profile, at the balance sheet date, a576bps increase in interest rates would decrease annual profits by 59m 2016 17: 87m decrease.
Similarly, a 72 bps reduction would increase profits by 10m 2016 17: 5m increase based on a 34 bps reduction.
The change in interest rates used for this sensitivity analysis is based on the largest annual change in three-month Sterling LIBOR over the last 10 years.
The impact assumes LIBOR does not fall below 0%.
Upward movements in medium and long term interest rates, associated with higher interest rate expectations, increase the value of the Groups interest rate swaps and caps that provide protection against such moves.
The converse is true for downward movements in the yield curve.
A 204 bps shift represents the largest annual change in the seven-year Sterling swap rate over the last 10 years.
At 31 March 2018 a 204 bps parallel upward shift in swap rates would increase the value of cash flow hedges and derivatives that are not hedge accounted by 68m 2016 17: 82m.
A 204 bps downward shift in swap rates would reduce the value ofthese derivatives by 81m 2016 17: 131m.
British Land Annual Report and Accounts 2018 137 Financial statements NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 17 Net debt continued Interest rate profile including effect of derivatives continued The 0% 2015 Convertible Bond is designated as fair value through profit or loss.
Principal components of the market value of this bond include British Lands share price and its volatility, and market interest rates.
The fair value of the 0% 2015 Convertible Bond at 31 March 2018 was a 337m liability.
At 31 March 2018 a 204 bps parallel upward shift ininterest rates would reduce the fair value liability by 15m, and a 204 bps downward shift in interest rates would increase the fair value liability by 15m.
Foreign currency risk management The Groups policy is to have no material unhedged net assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.
The currency risk on overseas investments is hedged via foreign currency denominated borrowings and derivatives.
The Group has adopted net investment hedging in accordance with IAS 39 and therefore the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity.
The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The table below shows the carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
Provided contingent tax on overseas investments is not expected to occur it will be ignored for hedging purposes.
Based on the 31March 2018 position a 26% appreciation largest annual change over the last ten years in the Euro relative to Sterling would result in a nil change 2016 17: nil in reported profits.

The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of any collateral obtained.
Cash and short term deposits at 31 March 2018 amounted to 105m 2016 17: 114m.
Deposits and interest rate deposits were placed with financial institutions with BBB or better credit ratings.
At 31 March 2018, the fair value of all interest rate derivative assets was 115m 2016 17: 217m.
At 31 March 2018, prior to taking into account any offset arrangements, the largest combined credit exposure to a single counterparty arising from money market deposits, liquid investments and derivatives was 49m 2016 17: 120m.
This represents 0.4% 2016 17: 0.9% of gross assets.
The deposit exposures are with UK banks and UK branches of international banks.
The Groups exposure to credit risk in respect of its trade receivables is analysed in note 13.
Provisions are made taking into account historic credit losses and the creditworthiness of debtors.
Liquidity risk management The Groups approach to liquidity risk management is discussed in the Financial policies and principles on pages 45 to 47, and the risks addressed within Managing risk in delivering our strategy on pages 48 to 51.
The following table presents a maturity profile of the contracted undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date onwhich the Group can be required to pay.
The table includes both interest and principal flows.
Where the interest payable is not fixed, theamount disclosed has been determined by reference to the projected interest rates implied by yield curves at the reporting date.
Forderivative financial instruments that settle on a net basis e. g. interest rate swaps the undiscounted net cash flows are shown and for derivatives that require gross settlement e. g. cross currency swaps the undiscounted gross cash flows are presented.
Where payment obligations are in foreign currencies, the spot exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date is used.
Trade creditors and amounts owed tojoint ventures, which are repayable within one year, have been excluded from the analysis.
The Group expects to meet its financial liabilities through the various available liquidity sources, including a secure rental income profile, asset sales, undrawn committed borrowing facilities and, in the longer term, debt refinancings.
138 British Land Annual Report and Accounts 2018 17 Net debt continued Liquidity risk management continued The Group leases out all its investment properties under operating leases with a weighted average lease length of eight years.
This secure income profile is generated from upward only rent reviews, long leases and high occupancy rates.
The future aggregate minimum rentals receivable under non-cancellable operating leases are also shown in the table below.
Income from joint ventures and funds is not included below.
Additional liquidity will arise from letting space in properties under construction as well as from distributions received from joint ventures and funds.
Any short term liquidity gap between the net payments required and the rentals receivable can be met through other liquidity sources available to the Group, such as committed undrawn borrowing facilities.
The Group currently holds cash and short term deposits of 105m of which 91m is not subject to a security interest see footnote 5 to net debt table on page 131.
Further liquidity can be achieved through sales of property assets or investments and debt refinancings.
The Groups property portfolio is valued externally at 9,997m and the share of joint ventures and funds property is valued at 4,102m.
Thecommitted undrawn borrowing facilities available to the Group are a further source of liquidity.
The maturity profile of committed undrawn borrowing facilities is shown below.
