Basis of preparation Accounting policies The audited consolidated financial information has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs and interpretations IFRICs as adopted by the EU and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
Mans principal accounting policies have been consistently applied across the Group in the preparation of the financial statements.
Accounting policies are included in the relevant sections, and significant policies are outlined on page 106.
The impact, if any, of new accounting standards and amendments applicable to the year ended 31 December 2018 and accounting standards that are not yet effective are detailed on pages 106 to 107.
Consolidated group and presentation currency The consolidated group is Man Group plc the Company and its subsidiaries together the Group or Man.
The stand-alone Parent Company financial statements of Man Group plc have been included as separate financial statements on pages 138 to 140.
Mans presentation currency is United States Dollars USD.
The consolidated financial information contained within these financial statements incorporates the results, cash flows and financial position of the Company and its subsidiaries Note 29 for the year to 31 December 2018.
Subsidiaries are entities including structured entities controlled by Man and are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to Man until the date that control ceases.
Control exists when Man has the power to direct the relevant activities, exposure to significant variable returns and the ability to utilise power to affect those returns.
All intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses between Group entities are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The acquisition date is the date on which Man effectively obtains control of the acquiree.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value at the acquisition date of assets transferred, liabilities incurred and equity instruments issued by the Group.
The fair value of an acquisition is calculated at the acquisition date by recognising the acquirees identifiable assets and liabilities at their fair values at that date, and costs relating to acquisitions are recognised in the Group income statement as incurred.
Any contingent consideration will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date, with any subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration recognised in the Group income statement.
Mans relationship with independent fund entities Man acts as the investment manager advisor to fund entities.
Man assesses such relationships on an ongoing basis to determine whether each fund entity is controlled by the Group and therefore consolidated into the Groups results.
Having considered all significant aspects of Mans relationships with fund entities, the directors are of the opinion that, although Man manages the assets of certain fund entities, where Man does not hold an investment in the fund entity the characteristics of control are not met, and that for most fund entities: the existence of independent boards of directors at the fund entities: rights which allow for the removal of the investment manager advisor: the influence of investors: limited exposure to variable returns: and the arms length nature of Mans contracts with the fund entities, indicate that Man does not control the fund entities and their associated assets, liabilities and results should not be consolidated into the Group financial statements.
Assessment of the control characteristics for all relationships with fund entities led to the consolidation of 13 funds for the year ended 31 December 2018 2017: nine, as detailed in Note 13.
An understanding of the aggregate funds under management FUM and the fees earned from fund entities is relevant to an understanding of Mans results and earnings sustainability, and this information is provided in the Chief Financial Officers review on pages 20 to 23.
Judgemental areas and accounting estimates The most significant area of judgement is whether the Group controls certain funds through its investments in fund products and is required to consolidate them Note 13.2.
Our key judgements on this are outlined above within Mans relationship with independent fund entities.
Furthermore, the key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date that may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, include the determination of fair values for contingent consideration in relation to the Numeric and Aalto acquisitions Note 25, the valuation of goodwill and acquired intangibles for CGUs with lower levels of headroom Note 10 and recognition of deferred tax assets in relation to US tax assets Note 7.
The key assumptions and range of possible outcomes are discussed in the relevant notes.
These judgements and estimates have been an area of focus for the Group Board, and in particular the Audit and Risk Committee, during the year.
The report of the Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee discusses the involvement of the Committee in this evaluation on page 60.
Going concern Mans business activity is discussed on pages 1 to 43, together with the significant risk factors pages 31 to 33.
Mans liquidity and capital positions are set out in Note 12 and 20 respectively.
The directors monitor Mans capital and liquidity positions and forecasts throughout the year, and in addition they have approved a budget, medium-term financial plan, and a capital and liquidity plan, which cover the foreseeable future and include rigorous analysis of stressed capital and liquidity scenarios.
Mans business typically has a good conversion of profits into cash flows which helps protect the business in stressed scenarios.
The directors have concluded that there is a reasonable expectation that Man has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, the Group and Parent Company financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis using the historical cost convention, except for the measurement at fair value of certain financial instruments that are held at fair value through profit or loss.
The directors have also made a longer-term viability statement, as set out on page 28.

The following accounting standards relevant to the Groups operations were effective for the first time in the year to 31 December 2018: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
IFRS 9 replaces the classification and measurement models for financial instruments in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: recognition and measurement with three classification categories: amortised cost, fair value through profit or loss and fair value through other comprehensive income.
Under IFRS 9, the Groups business model and the contractual cash flows arising from its investments in financial instruments determine the appropriate classification.
The Group has assessed its balance sheet assets in accordance with the new classification requirements.
The Group has elected not to restate comparatives on initial application of IFRS 9, and accordingly the $3 million of investments held as available-for-sale AFS at 31 December 2017 have been classified on transition at 1 January 2018 as fair value through profit or loss as the AFS category no longer exists Note 13.
The accumulated gain in the AFS reserve of $2 million at 31 December 2017 has also been reclassified to retained earnings on transition, and any future revaluations will be recognised directly in the income statement previously recorded in the AFS reserve in equity.
There have been no other changes in the classification and measurement of any of the Groups financial assets or liabilities.
In addition, IFRS 9 introduces an expected loss model for the assessment of impairment of financial assets.
The incurred loss model under IAS 39 required the Group to recognise impairment losses when there was objective evidence that an asset was impaired.
Under the expected loss model, impairment losses are recorded if there is an expectation of credit losses, even in the absence of a default event.
This model is not applicable for investments held at fair value through profit or loss.
Therefore the assets on the Groups balance sheet to which the expected loss model applies are loans to funds Note 13.3 and fee receivables Note 14, which do not have a history of credit risk or expected future recoverability issues.
We have assessed the lifetime expected credit losses for impairment of these assets, which are short-term in nature, by applying the Groups internal risk modelling weightings for both likelihood of loss and exposure to loss.
Under the expected loss model there is no change to the carrying values of the Groups assets.
We have elected to apply the new hedging requirements under IFRS 9 prospectively from 1 January 2018.
These new requirements are designed to provide some increased flexibility in relation to hedge effectiveness in order to better align hedge accounting with a companys risk management policies.
IFRS 9 also requires increased disclosures in relation to the Groups risk management strategy and the impact of hedge accounting on the financial statements, as provided in Note 12.
The Groups IAS 39 hedge relationships in place at 31 December 2017 qualify as continuing hedging relationships under IFRS 9, and there is no material change to existing hedge effectiveness assessments as a result Note 12.
No additional hedge relationships have been designated due to the adoption of IFRS 9.
The adoption of IFRS 9 from 1 January 2018 does not have a material impact on the Groups reported results.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: IFRS 15 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and replaces IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 Construction Contracts and related interpretations.
IFRS 15 establishes a single, principles-based revenue recognition model to be applied to all contracts with customers.
The core principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity should recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
Specifically, IFRS 15 introduces a five-step approach to revenue recognition: 1 identify the contract with the customer: 2 identify the performance obligations in the contract: 3 determine the transaction price: 4 allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract: and 5 recognise revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
IFRS 15 is more prescriptive in terms of its recognition criteria, with certain specific requirements in respect of variable fee income such that it is only recognised where the amount of revenue would not be subject to significant future reversals.
Enhanced disclosure requirements are also introduced, as provided in Note 2.
The Group has considered these changes in light of the terms of our existing investment management agreements, and assessed the timing of management and performance fee recognition.
The Group has not identified any material changes to current revenue recognition principles, and therefore no adjustments have been made on transition.
The adoption of IFRS 15 from 1 January 2018 does not have a material impact on the Groups reported results.

Basis of preparation continued The Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2014-2016 Cycle and Amendments to IFRS 2: Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions were adopted by Man in the current year, which have not had a significant impact.
The following standard is relevant to the Groups operations and has been issued by the IASB but is not yet mandatory: IFRS 16 Leases: IFRS 16 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and replaces IAS 17 Leases and related interpretations.
This introduces a comprehensive model for the identification of lease arrangements and accounting treatment for both lessors and lessees, which distinguishes leases and service contracts on the basis of whether an identified asset is controlled by a customer.
There is substantially no change to the accounting requirements for lessors.
IFRS 16 requires operating leases, where the Group is the lessee, to be included on the Groups balance sheet, recognising a right-of-use ROU asset and a related lease liability representing the present value obligation to make lease payments.
Certain optional exemptions are available under IFRS 16 for shortterm less than 12 months and low-value leases.
The ROU asset will be assessed for impairment annually incorporating any onerous lease assessments and depreciated on a straight-line basis, adjusted for any remeasurements of the lease liability.
The lease liability will subsequently be adjusted for lease payments and interest, as well as the impact of any lease modifications.
IFRS 16 also requires extensive disclosures detailing the impact of leases on the Groups financial position and results.
The adoption of IFRS 16 will result in a significant gross-up of the Groups reported assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, primarily due to our property lease at Riverbank House and in particular as our sub-lease arrangements Note 27.3 are not eligible for offset against the ROU asset and related lease liability.
The rental expense which is currently recognised within occupancy costs in the Groups income statement Note 5 will no longer be incurred and instead depreciation expense of the ROU asset and interest expense unwind of the discounted lease liability will be recognised.
This will also result in a different total annual expense profile under the new standard with the expense being front-loaded in the earlier years of the lease term as the discount unwind on the lease liability reduces over time.
The Group has considered the available transition options, and has decided to apply the modified retrospective approach where the ROU asset is measured as if IFRS 16 had been applied from lease commencement, applying a discount rate assessed at the date of transition, and currently estimates that the impact will be a gross-up of around $250 million for ROU lease assets and associated deferred tax balances and around $315 million around 250 million in relation to lease liabilities, with around $65 million therefore deducted from brought-forward reserves.
The majority of the Groups lease liabilities relate to Sterling denominated long-term lease arrangements, which creates an ongoing exposure to fluctuations in the USD to Sterling exchange rate for amounts which are not payable for many years in the future.
The Group has elected not to hedge these long-term foreign exchange accounting exposures and therefore there may be large unrealised FX gains or losses in future years as a result of the revaluation of these liabilities.
The Group also expects to elect to apply the practical expedient on transition to reclassify onerous lease balances at 31 December 2018 of around $20 million Note 16 against the ROU asset as an alternative to performing an impairment review, and to exclude short-term leases and leases with a remaining term of less than one year at transition date.
Furthermore, we expect that the derecognition of deferred rent and lease incentive balances at 31 December 2018 under the current IAS 17 requirements will partially offset the reduction in brought-forward reserves by around $40 million.
The total brought forward reserves impact on transition date at 1 January 2019 is therefore expected to be around $25 million.
This reduction in reserves will be offset in future years by a lower Group income statement charge over the remaining life of the leases the total charge over the life of each lease is the same as under the current IAS 17 requirements, although in the five years following initial application of IFRS16 we expect there to be an increased Group income statement charge of up to $5 million each year which will subsequently shift to a decrease in the comparable charge over time.
No other standards or interpretations issued and not yet effective are expected to have an impact on the Groups financial statements.
Revenue Fee income is Mans primary source of revenue, which is derived from the investment management agreements that are in place with the fund entities.
Fees are generally based on an agreed percentage of net asset value NAV or FUM and are typically charged in arrears and receivable within one month.
Management fees net of rebates, which include all non-performance related fees, are recognised in the year in which the services are provided and do not include any other performance obligations.
Performance fees net of rebates relate to the performance of the funds managed during the year and are recognised when the fee can be reliably estimated and has crystallised.
This is generally at the end of the performance period or upon early redemption by a fund investor.
Until the performance period ends, market movements could significantly move the NAV of the fund products.
For AHL, GLG, FRM and GPM strategies, Man will typically only earn performance fee income on any positive investment returns in excess of the high water mark, meaning we will not be able to earn performance fee income with respect to positive investment performance in any year following negative performance until that loss is recouped, at which point a fund investors investment surpasses the high water mark.
Numeric performance fees are earned only when performance is in excess of a predetermined strategy benchmark positive alpha, with performance fees being generated for each strategy either based on achieving positive alpha which resets at a predetermined interval, i. e. every one to three years or, in the case of alternatives strategies, exceeding high water mark.
Once crystallised, performance fees typically cannot be clawed-back.
There are no other performance obligations or services provided which suggest these have been earned either before or after crystallisation date.
Rebates relate to repayments of management and performance fees charged, typically to institutional investors, and are presented net within gross management and other fees and performance fees in the Group income statement.
At 31 December 2018, Man has contractual performance obligations that are not yet satisfied due to the notice periods required to terminate investment management agreements.
Fee income for the performance of these obligations after the year end can fluctuate due to factors outside of the Groups control, and therefore management cannot estimate the future fees allocated to these.
Fees relating to these investment management agreements will be recognised as the performance obligations are satisfied.
Analysis of FUM, margins and performance is provided in the Chief Financial Officers review on pages 20 to 22.

Distribution costs and asset servicing Distribution costs are paid to external intermediaries for marketing and investor servicing, largely in relation to retail investors.
Distribution costs are variable with FUM and the associated management fee revenue.
Distribution costs are expensed over the period in which the service is provided.
Distribution costs have decreased despite growth in average FUM largely as a result of the continued mix shift towards institutional assets.
Asset servicing includes custodial, valuation, fund accounting, registrar, research and administration functions performed by third-parties under contract to Man, on behalf of the funds, and is recognised in the period in which the service is provided.
The costs of these services vary based on transaction volumes, the number of funds, and fund NAVs.
The increase in asset servicing costs compared to 2017 is due to the inclusion of MiFID II related research and administration costs in 2018.

In the short term, the variable component of compensation adjusts with revenues and profitability.
Total compensation costs, excluding restructuring, have decreased by 8% compared to 2017, largely due to the decrease in performance fee revenues year on year, as reflected in decreased variable cash compensation and associated social security costs.
The compensation ratio, as outlined on page 145, has increased to 48% from 44% in 2017 primarily as a result of the lower level of performance fee revenue.
Salaries have increased from prior year largely as a result of the 5% increase in average headcount due to investment in our investment management and client services capabilities, partially offset by a more favourable hedged Sterling to USD rate in 2018 1.29 compared to the hedged rate in 2017 1.36, which had a $6 million impact compared to prior year.
Salaries, variable cash compensation and social security costs are charged to the Group income statement in the period in which the service is provided, and include partner drawings.
The accounting for share-based and fund product based compensation arrangements is detailed in Note 19.
Pension costs relate to Mans defined contribution and defined benefit plans Note 21.
The $1 million of restructuring costs in 2018 relate to our Swiss pension obligation Note 21 as a result of the restructuring plan implemented in late 2016, for which the Group also incurred $4 million of termination expenses in 2017.
Compensation costs incurred as part of restructuring are accounted for in full at the time the obligation arises, and include payments in lieu of notice, enhanced termination costs, and accelerated share-based and fund product based charges.

Other restructuring costs of $5 million in 2018 largely relate to $3 million of professional fees incurred in relation to the Groups proposed 2019 corporate reorganisation, as well as $2 million in respect of reassessment of our onerous property lease provision.
Other restructuring costs of $7 million in 2017 largely related to onerous property leases arising as a result of finalisation of the 2016 restructuring plan following the centralisation of our London offices.
Depreciation and amortisation have increased by $6 million in 2018 compared to 2017 largely as a result of higher levels of capital expenditure on software development projects across our operating platforms in both 2017 and 2018.
Auditors remuneration, including advisory and professional services, is disclosed in the Corporate Governance section on page 62.

Income and expenses are allocated to these different jurisdictions based on transfer pricing methodologies set in accordance with the laws of the jurisdictions in which Man operates and international guidelines as laid out by the OECD.
The effective tax rate results from the combination of taxes paid on earnings attributable to the tax jurisdictions in which they arise.
The majority of the Groups income in the period was earned in the UK, Switzerland and the US.
The Groups US tax rate is effectively nil as a result of accumulated US tax assets, as detailed on page 111.
The current effective tax rate of 2% 2017: 6% differs from the applicable underlying statutory tax rates principally as a result of the gain on disposal of the Groups equity investment in Nephila Note 17 of $113 million, which is not subject to tax under UK tax legislation, and the incremental recognition of the US deferred tax assets of $20 million 2017: $17 million.
The effective tax rate is otherwise consistent with this earnings profile.
Accounting for tax involves a level of estimation uncertainty given the application of tax law requires a degree of judgement, which tax authorities may dispute.
Tax liabilities are recognised based on the best estimates of probable outcomes, with regard to external advice where appropriate.
The principal factors which may influence our future tax rate are changes in tax regulation in the territories in which we operate, the mix of income and expenses earned and incurred by jurisdiction and the timing of the recognition of available deferred tax assets.
The current tax liabilities of $10 million 2017: $21 million on the Group balance sheet, comprise a gross current tax liability of $15 million 2017: $24 million net of a current tax asset of $5 million 2017: $3 million.
The tax on Mans profit before tax is lower than the amount that would arise using the theoretical effective tax rate applicable to the profits losses of the consolidated companies as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December $m 2018 2017 Profit before tax 278 272 Theoretical tax expense at UK rate: 19% 2017: 19.25% 53 52 Effect of: Overseas tax rates compared to UK 8 10 Adjustments to tax charge in respect of previous periods 1 9 Disposal of investment in Nephila Note 17 22 Recognition of US deferred tax asset 20 17 Other 1 1 Tax expense 5 17 The effect of overseas tax rates compared to the UK includes the impact of the 0% effective tax rate of our US business.

The debit to other comprehensive income and equity of $3 million 2017: $2 million relates to movements in the pension accrual, unrealised cash flow hedge balances and employee share scheme balances.
The Group has accumulated deferred tax assets in the US of $108 million 2017: $124 million.
These deferred tax assets principally comprise accumulated operating losses from existing operations of $53 million 2017: $61 million and future amortisation of goodwill and intangibles assets generated from acquisitions of $45 million 2017: $48 million that will be available to offset future taxable profits in the US.
From the maximum available deferred tax assets of $108 million 2017: $124 million, a deferred tax asset of $62 million has been recognised on the Group balance sheet 2017: $42 million, representing amounts which can be offset against probable future taxable profits.
Probable future taxable profits are considered to be forecast profits for the next three years only, consistent with the Groups business planning horizon.
The increase of $20 million from that recognised at 31 December 2017 represents projected year on year growth in our US business.
As a result of the recognised US deferred tax assets and the remaining unrecognised available US deferred tax assets of $46 million 2017: $82 million, Man does not expect to pay federal tax on any profits it may earn in the US for several years.
The gross amount of losses for which a deferred tax asset has not been recognised is nil 2017: $48 million.
For US tax purposes, the losses will expire over a period of 13 to 18 years.

The 2017 purchases acquisitions relates to the acquisition of the Aalto business in 2017.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of consideration transferred over the fair value of identifiable net assets of the acquired business at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is carried on the Group balance sheet at cost less accumulated impairment, has an indefinite useful life, is not subject to amortisation and is tested for impairment annually, or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Investment management agreements IMAs, distribution channels and brand names IMAs, distribution channels and brand names are recognised at the present value of the expected future cash flows and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives, which are between three and 13 years IMAs and brands, and eight and 12 years distribution channels.
Amortisation of acquired intangible assets of $83 million 2017: $84 million primarily relates to the investment management agreements recognised on the acquisition of GLG and Numeric.
Allocation of goodwill to cash generating units For impairment review purposes, the Group has identified five cash generating units CGUs : AHL, GLG, FRM, Numeric and GPM.
Calculation of recoverable amounts for cash generating units An impairment expense is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows CGUs.
The recoverable amounts of the Groups CGUs are assessed each year using a value in use calculation.
The value in use calculation gives a higher valuation compared to the fair value less cost to sell approach, as this would exclude some of the revenue synergies available to Man through its ability to distribute products using its well established distribution channels, which may not be fully available to other market participants.
The value in use calculations at 31 December 2018 use cash flow projections based on the Board approved financial plan for the year to 31 December 2019 and a further two years of projections 2020 and 2021, plus a terminal value.
The valuation analysis is based on best practice guidance whereby a terminal value is calculated at the end of a short discrete budget period and assumes, after this three year budget period, no growth in asset flows above the long-term growth rate.
In order to determine the value in use of each CGU, it is necessary to notionally allocate the majority of the Groups cost base relating to operations, product structuring, distribution and support functions, which are managed on a centralised basis.
The value in use calculations for AHL, GLG, FRM, Numeric and GPM are presented on a post-tax basis, consistent with the prior year, given most comparable market data is available on a post-tax basis.
The value in use calculations presented on a post-tax basis are not significantly different to their pre-tax equivalent.

Goodwill and acquired intangibles continued The assumptions applied in the value in use calculation are derived from past experience and assessment of current market inputs.
A bifurcated discount rate has been applied to the modelled cash flows to reflect the different risk profile of net management fee income and net performance fee income.
The discount rates are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital using a risk free interest rate, together with an equity risk premium and an appropriate market beta derived from consideration of Mans beta, similar alternative asset managers, and the asset management sector as a whole.
The terminal value is calculated based on the projected closing FUM at 31 December 2021 and applying a mid-point of a range of historical multiples to the forecast cash flows associated with management and performance fees.
The recoverable amount of each CGU has been assessed at 31 December 2018.
The key assumptions applied to the value in use calculations for each of the CGUs are provided below.
Key assumptions: AHL GLG FRM Numeric GPM Compound average annualised growth in FUM over three years 11% 4% 7% 8% 34% Discount rate 1 Management fees 11% 11% 11% 11% 15% 2 Performance fees 17% 17% 17% 17% 21% 3 Terminal value mid-point of range of historical multiples Management fees 13.0x 13.0x 5.9x 13.0x 13.0x Performance fees 5.5x 5.5x 3.9x 5.5x 5.5x Notes: 1 The pre-tax equivalent of the net management fees discount rate is 13%, 13%, 13%, 14% and 18% for each of the AHL, GLG, FRM, Numeric and GPM CGUs, respectively.
2 The pre-tax equivalent of the net performance fees discount rate is 20%, 20%, 20%, 22% and 26% for each of the AHL, GLG, FRM, Numeric and GPM CGUs, respectively.
3 The implied terminal growth rates are 2%, 3%, -10%, 3% and 7% for each of the AHL, GLG, FRM, Numeric and GPM CGUs, respectively.
The Group has considered the impact of the potential exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union, including various reasonably possible Brexit scenarios, and currently does not expect this to have a material impact on the value in use calculations of the Group at 31 December 2018.
Further discussion on Brexit is provided in the Market environment page 10 and Risk management page 27 sections of the Strategic report.
The results of the valuations are further explained in the following sections, including sensitivity tables which show scenarios whereby the key assumptions are changed to stressed assumptions, indicating the modelled headroom or impairment that would result.
Each assumption, or set of assumptions, is stressed in isolation.
The results of these sensitivities make no allowance for actions that management would take if such market conditions persisted.
AHL cash generating unit The AHL value in use calculation at 31 December 2018 indicates a value of $2.7 billion, with around $2.2 billion of headroom over the carrying value of the AHL business.
Therefore, no impairment charge is deemed necessary at 31 December 2018 2017: nil.
The valuation at 31 December 2018 is around $0.3 billion lower than the value in use calculation at 31 December 2017, primarily due to lower than forecast performance in 2018.

3 An increase decrease in the value in use calculation of $257 million.
GLG cash generating unit The GLG value in use calculation at 31 December 2018 indicates a value of $320 million, with around $130 million of headroom over the carrying value of the GLG business.
Therefore, no impairment charge is deemed necessary at 31 December 2018.
The valuation at 31 December 2018 is around $70 million lower than the value in use calculation at 31 December 2017 largely due to lower than forecast performance in 2018.
Amortisation of acquired intangibles lowered the carrying value by $56 million during the year.

Liquidity resources support ongoing operations and potential liquidity requirements under stressed scenarios.
The amount of potential liquidity requirements is modelled based on scenarios that assume stressed market and economic conditions.
The funding requirements for Man relating to the investment management process are discretionary.
The liquidity profile of Man is monitored on a daily basis and the stressed scenarios are updated regularly.
The Board reviews Mans funding resources at each Board meeting and on an annual basis as part of the strategic planning process.
Mans available liquidity is considered sufficient to cover current requirements and potential requirements under stressed scenarios.
In September 2014, Man issued $150 million ten-year fixed rate reset callable guaranteed subordinated notes Tier 2 notes, with associated issuance costs of $1 million.
The Tier 2 notes were issued with a fixed coupon of 5.875% until 15 September 2019.
The notes may be redeemed in whole at Mans option on 16 September 2019 at their principal amount, subject to FCA approval.
If the notes are not redeemed at this time then the coupon will reset to the five-year mid-swap rate plus 4.076% and the notes will be redeemed on 16 September 2024 at their principal amount.
Borrowings are initially recorded at fair value net of transaction costs incurred, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
The difference between the amount repayable at maturity on the borrowings and the carrying value is amortised over the period up to the expected maturity of the associated debt in accordance with the effective interest rate method.
Cash and cash equivalents at year end comprises cash at bank on hand of $175 million 2017: $175 million, short-term deposits of $169 million 2017: $181 million and nil US Treasury bills 2017: nil.
Cash ring-fenced for regulated entities totalled $36 million 2017: $37 million.
Cash is invested in accordance with strict limits consistent with the Boards risk appetite, which consider both the security and availability of liquidity.
Accordingly, cash is held in on-demand deposit bank accounts and short-term bank deposits, and at times invested in short-term US Treasury bills.
At 31 December 2018, the $344 million cash balance excluding US Treasury bills and cash held by consolidated fund entities is held with 19 banks 2017: $356 million with 20 banks.
The single largest counterparty bank exposure of $91 million is held with an A rated bank 2017: $84 million with an A rated bank.
At 31 December 2018, balances with banks in the AA ratings band aggregate to $85 million 2017: $97 million and balances with banks in the A ratings band aggregate to $259 million 2017: $239 million.
The $500 million syndicated revolving loan facility was undrawn at 31 December 2018 undrawn at 31 December 2017.
The facility was put in place as a five-year facility and included the option for Man to request the banks to extend the maturity date by one year on each of the first and second anniversaries.
The participant banks have the option to accept or decline Mans request.
On the first and second anniversaries in 2016 and 2017, the banks were asked to extend the maturity date of the facility by one year and banks with participations totalling 98% of the facility accepted the request on both anniversaries.
As a result of the maturity extension, $10 million is scheduled to mature in June 2020 and the remaining $490 million matures in June 2022.
To maintain maximum flexibility, the facility does not include financial covenants.
Disclosures in relation to financial guarantees and commitments are included in Note 27.

Cash, liquidity and borrowings continued Foreign exchange and interest rate risk Man is subject to risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities.
In respect of Mans monetary assets and liabilities which earn incur interest indexed to floating rates, as at 31 December 2018 a 50bp increase decrease in these rates, with all other variables held constant, would have resulted in a $1 million increase decrease 2017: $1 million increase decrease in net interest income.
A 10% strengthening weakening of the USD against all other currencies, with all other variables held constant, would have resulted in a foreign exchange loss gain of $1 million 2017: $1 million loss gain, with a corresponding impact on equity.
This exposure is based on USD balances held by non-USD functional currency entities and non-USD balances held by USD functional currency entities within the Group.
In certain circumstances, the Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its risk associated with foreign exchange movements.
Where fixed foreign currency denominated costs are hedged, the associated derivatives may be designated as cash flow hedges.
The Groups current risk management objective is to determine a foreign exchange rate at which future foreign currency costs are ultimately realised, thereby providing increased certainty around the future USD costs recognised in the Group Income Statement.
Effective unrealised gains or losses on these instruments are recognised within the cash flow hedge reserve in equity and, when realised, these are reclassified to the Group income statement in the same line as the hedged item, within compensation and other costs as outlined in Note 4 and Note 5.
The realisation of foreign currency operating cash flows and the associated forward foreign currency derivative contracts generally arise on a monthly basis.
The fair value of derivatives held in relation to the Groups cash flow hedges at 31 December 2018 is a liability of $13 million 2017: asset of $9 million.

In summary, the total seeding investments portfolio is made up as follows: 31 December 31 December $m Note 2018 2017 Investments in fund products 13.1 401 249 Less fund investments for deferred compensation arrangements 13.1 87 76 Consolidated net investments in funds held for sale 13.2 39 79 Consolidated net investments in funds line-by-line consolidation 13.2 300 203 Loans to funds 13.3 9 25 Seeding investments portfolio 662 480 13.1.
Investments in fund products Man uses capital to invest in our fund products as part of our ongoing business to build our product breadth and to trial investment research developments before we market the products broadly to investors.
These seeding investments are generally held for less than one year.
Where Man is deemed not to control the fund, these are classified as investments in fund products.
Investments in fund products are classified at fair value through profit or loss, with net losses due to movements in fair value of $11 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 2017: $58 million gain recognised through income or losses gains on investments and other financial instruments.
Purchases and sales of investments are recognised on trade date.
The fair values of investments in fund products are derived from the reported NAVs of each of the fund products, which in turn are based upon the value of the underlying assets held within each of the fund products and the anticipated redemption horizon of the fund product.
The valuation of the underlying assets within each fund product is determined by external valuation service providers based on an agreed valuation policy and methodology.
Whilst these valuations are performed independently of Man, Man has established oversight procedures and due diligence processes to ensure that the NAVs reported by the external valuation service providers are reliable and appropriate.
Man makes adjustments to these NAVs if the anticipated redemption horizon, events or circumstances indicate that the NAVs are not reflective of fair value.
The fair value hierarchy of financial assets is disclosed in Note 25.
Investments in fund products expose Man to market risk and therefore this process is subject to limits consistent with the Boards risk appetite.
The largest single investment in fund products is $105 million 2017: $79 million.
The market risk from seeding investments is modelled using a value at risk methodology using a 95% confidence interval and one-year time horizon.
The value at risk is estimated to be $25 million at 31 December 2018 2017: $29 million.
Fund investments for deferred compensation arrangements At 31 December 2018, investments in fund products included $87 million 2017: $76 million of fund products related to deferred compensation arrangements as detailed in Note 19.
The associated fund product investments are held to offset any change in deferred compensation over the vesting period, and at vesting the value of the fund investment is delivered to the employee.
The fund product investments are recorded at fair value with any gains or losses during the vesting period recognised as income or losses gains on investments and other financial instruments in the Group income statement.

Investments in fund products and other investments continued 13.2.
Consolidation of investments in funds Seed capital invested into funds may be deemed to be controlled by the Group Note 1.
The fund is consolidated into the Groups results from the date control commences until it ceases.
In 2018, 13 2017: nine investments in funds have met the control criteria and have therefore been consolidated Note 29, either classified as held for sale or consolidated on a line-by-line basis as detailed below.
Held for sale Where the Group acquires the controlling stake and actively markets the products to third-party investors, allowing the Group to redeem their share, and it is considered highly probable that it will relinquish control within one year from the date of initial investment, the investment in the controlled fund is classified as held for sale.
The seeded fund is recognised on the Group balance sheet as non-current assets and liabilities held for sale, with the interests of any other parties included within non-current liabilities held for sale.
Amounts recognised are measured at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
The non-current assets and liabilities held for sale are as follows: 31 December 31 December $m 2018 2017 Non-current assets held for sale 39 145 Non-current liabilities held for sale 66 Investments in fund products held for sale 39 79 All seed investments held at 31 December 2018 are 100% owned and therefore there is no third-party interest included within non-current liabilities held for sale.
Investments cease to be classified as held for sale when the fund is no longer controlled by the Group, at which time they are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Note 13.1.
Loss of control may eventuate through sale of the investment or a dilution in the Groups holding.
If a held for sale fund remains under the control of the Group for more than one year, and it is unlikely that the Group will reduce or no longer control its investment in the short-term, it will cease to be classified as held for sale and will be consolidated on a line-by-line basis.
Three investments in funds which were classified as held for sale at 31 December 2017 have been consolidated on a line-by-line basis for the year ended 31 December 2018 2017: three held for sale funds at 31 December 2016.

The management fees elimination includes $1 million 2017: $3 million in relation to the third-party share of these investments and therefore represents externally generated management fees.
The performance fee elimination includes $1 million 2017: $2 million in relation to third-party share which represents performance fees generated externally.

Investments in fund products and other investments continued 13.3.
Loans to fund products Loans to fund products are short-term advances primarily to Man guaranteed products, which are made to assist with the financing of the leverage associated with the structured products.
The loans are repayable on demand and are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
The average balance during the year is $13 million 2017: $28 million.
The liquidity requirements of guaranteed products together with commitments to provide financial support Note 27 which give rise to loans to funds are subject to our routine liquidity stress testing and any liquidity requirements are met by available cash resources, or the syndicated revolving credit facility.
Loans to fund products expose Man to credit risk and therefore the credit decision making process is subject to limits consistent with the Boards risk appetite.
The carrying value represents Mans maximum exposure to this credit risk.
Loans are closely monitored against the assets held in the funds.
The largest single loan to a fund product at 31 December 2018 is $4 million 2017: $12 million.
Fund entities are not externally rated, however our internal modelling suggests that fund products have a probability of default that is equivalent to a credit rating of A.
Structured entities Man has evaluated all exposures and concluded that where Man holds an investment, loan, fees receivable and accrued income, guarantee or commitment with an investment fund or a collateralised loan obligation, this represents an interest in a structured entity as defined by IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities.
As with structured entities, investment funds are designed so that their activities are not governed by way of voting rights and contractual arrangements are the dominant factor in affecting an investors returns.
The activities of these entities are governed by investment management agreements or, in the case of a collateralised loan obligation, the indenture.
The key considerations in assessing whether the Group controls a structured entity, and therefore should be consolidated into the Groups financial statements, are outlined in Note 1.
Consolidated structured entities are detailed in Note 13.2.
Mans maximum exposure to loss from unconsolidated structured entities is the sum total of any investment held, fee receivables, accrued income, and loans to the fund entities, and is $574 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 2017: $578 million.

2 Net management fee margins are the category weighted average see page 22.
Performance fees can only be earned after a high water mark is achieved.
For performance fee eligible funds, performance fees are within the range of 10% to 20%.
Support by way of loans provided to unconsolidated structured entities is detailed in Note 13.3, and is included within the maximum exposure to loss above.
Furthermore, on occasion Man agrees to purchase illiquid investments from the funds at market rates in order to facilitate investor withdrawals.
Man has not provided any other non-contractual support to unconsolidated structured entities.

Fee receivables and accrued income represent management and performance fees from fund products and are received in cash when the funds net asset values are determined.
The majority of fees are deducted from the NAV of the respective funds by the independent administrators and therefore the credit risk of fee receivables is minimal.
No balances are overdue, and under the expected loss model of IFRS 9 Note 1 there is no impairment at 31 December 2018 2017: nil.
The decrease in accrued income in 2018 primarily relates to the decrease in performance fee income which crystallised at 31 December 2018.
Performance fees receivable at year end are $43 million 2017: $196 million.
Details of derivatives used to cash flow hedge foreign exchange risk are included in Note 12.
Derivative financial instruments, which consist primarily of market risk hedges on some of our seeding positions and foreign exchange contracts, are measured at fair value through profit or loss.
All derivatives are held with external banks with ratings of BBB 2017: BBB or higher and mature within one year.
During the year, there were $3 million net realised and unrealised gains arising from foreign exchange hedges 2017: $1 million losses, and the notional value of foreign exchange derivative financial assets held at 31 December 2018 is $84 million 2017: $262 million.
During the year, there were $22 million net realised and unrealised gains arising from our market risk hedges 2017: $25 million losses, and the notional value of market risk derivative financial assets held at 31 December 2018 is $220 million 2017: $15 million.
Other receivables principally include balances relating to the Open Ended Investment Collective OEIC funds business and other deposits.
For the OEIC funds businesses, Man acts as the intermediary for the collection of subscriptions due from customers and payable to the funds, and for redemptions receivable from funds and payable to customers.
At 31 December 2018, the amount included in other receivables is $37 million 2017: $38 million.
The unsettled fund payable is recorded in trade and other payables Note 15.
At 31 December 2018, $7 million 2017: $8 million of other receivables are expected to be settled after 12 months.

Contingent consideration relates to the amounts payable in respect of acquisitions Note 25.
Other payables include the remaining October 2018 announced share repurchase liability of $63 million 2017: $74 million, as detailed in Note 20, payables relating to the OEIC funds business of $35 million 2017: $35 million and servicing fees payable to distributors.
The notional value of foreign exchange derivative financial liabilities at 31 December 2018 is $508 million 2017: $388 million, and the notional value of market risk derivative financial assets is $82 million 2017: $160 million.
All derivative contracts mature within one year.
The other payables balance in 2017 includes $52 million relating to the third-party share of payables for line-by-line consolidated funds, largely as a result of a December 2017 compulsory redemption of a large seeding position for all investors Note 13.2.
Trade and other payables are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Included in trade and other payables at 31 December 2018 are balances of $40 million 2017: $213 million which are expected to be settled after more than 12 months, which largely relate to contingent consideration.
Mans policy is to meet its contractual commitments and pay suppliers according to agreed terms.

All provisions are current, other than onerous property lease contracts as outlined below, given the Group does not have the unconditional right to defer settlement.
Provisions for restructuring are recognised when the obligation arises, following communication of the formal plan.
Provisions for onerous property lease contracts represent the present value of the future lease payments that the Group is presently obliged to make under non-cancellable onerous operating lease contracts, less the future benefit expected to be generated from these, including sub-lease revenue where applicable.
The unexpired terms of the onerous leases range from three to 17 years, with all onerous property lease contracts therefore non-current.
Investments in associates Associates are entities in which Man holds an interest and over which it has significant influence but not control, and are accounted for using the equity method.
In assessing significant influence Man considers the investment held and its power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee through its voting or other rights.
Further details of Mans equity investment holdings are included in Note 29.
Mans investments in associates are as follows: Year ended 31 December 2018 Year ended 31 December 2017 Nephila Holdings $m Ltd Nephila Holdings Ltd Other Total At beginning of the year 29 30 1 31 Share of post-tax profit loss 7 7 1 8 Dividends received 8 8 8 Sale of investment in associate 28 2 2 At year end 29 29 In November 2018 the Group sold its investment in Nephila, recognising a gain on sale of $113 million.
Man has not provided any financial support to associates during the year to 31 December 2018 2017: nil.
Commission income relating to sales of Nephila Holdings Limited products totalled $4 million for the year ended 31 December 2017, an arrangement which ceased during 2017.

Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the assets estimated useful life, which for leasehold improvements is over the shorter of the life of the lease and the improvement up to 24 years and for equipment is between three and ten years.
Deferred compensation arrangements Man operates equity-settled share-based payment schemes as well as fund product based compensation arrangements.
For compensation plans whereby deferred compensation is invested in fund products managed by Man, the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the fund units is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, with a corresponding liability.
The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the awards, which is remeasured at each reporting date, and equates to the fair value of the underlying fund products at settlement date.
During the year, $66 million 2017: $59 million relating to share-based payment and deferred fund product plans is included within compensation costs Note 4, consisting of share-based payments of $25 million 2017: $19 million and deferred fund product plans of $41 million 2017: $40 million.
The unamortised deferred compensation at year end is $64 million 2017: $51 million and has a weighted average remaining vesting period of 2.0 years 2017: 2.2 years.
19.1 Employee Trust The Employee Trust has the obligation to deliver shares, options and fund product based payments which have been granted to employees.
Man contributed funds of $42 million in 2018 2017: $22 million in order for the Trust to meet its current period obligations.
The Employee Trust is fully consolidated into Man and shares held are treated as treasury shares for EPS purposes Note 8.
The Employee Trust is controlled by independent trustees and their assets are held separately from those of Man.
At 31 December 2018, the net assets of the Employee Trust amounted to $99 million 2017: $73 million.
These assets include 25,154,953 2017: 20,272,423 ordinary shares in the Company, $10 million notional value options over Man shares 2017: $10 million, and $36 million of fund units 2017: $25 million to deliver against the future obligations.
The shares are recorded at cost and shown as a deduction from shareholders funds.
During the year the trustees of the Employee Trust waived all of the interim dividend for the year ended 31 December 2018 on each of the 24,431,128 ordinary shares registered in its name at the relevant date for eligibility for the interim dividend 2017 interim dividend: waived on all 19,455,899 shares and all of the final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2017 on each of 23,224,517 of the ordinary shares registered in its name at the relevant date for eligibility for the final dividend 2016 final dividend: waived on all 19,278,617 shares.
19.2 Share-based payments Share-based payments are remuneration payments to selected employees that take the form of an award of shares in Man Group plc.
Awards typically vest over three years, although conditions vary between different types of award.
In respect of equity-settled share-based payment schemes, the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the share awards and options granted is recognised as an expense, with the corresponding credit being recognised in equity.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the share awards and options at grant date.
The fair value of the share awards and options granted in exchange for employee services is calculated using the Black-Scholes valuation model that takes into account the effect of both financial and demographic assumptions.
Forfeiture and early vesting assumptions are based on historical observable data.
Changes to the original estimates, if any, are included in the Group income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.

Capital management Details of the Groups capital management and dividend policy are provided within the Chief Financial Officers review on page 26.
Share capital and capital reserves Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds, net of tax.
Own shares held through the Employee Trust Note 19 and Treasury Shares are recorded at cost, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of tax, and are deducted from equity attributable to the Companys equity holders until the shares are transferred to employees or sold.
Where such shares are subsequently sold, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Companys equity holders.
Ordinary shares 3 3 Ordinary shares have a par value of 3 7 US cents per share 2017: 3 7 US cents per share and represent 99.9% of issued share capital.
All issued shares are fully paid.
The shares have attached to them full voting, dividend and capital distribution including on wind up rights.
They do not confer any rights of redemption.
Ordinary shareholders have the right to receive notice of, attend, vote and speak at general meetings.
A holder of ordinary shares is entitled to one vote per ordinary share held when a vote is taken on a poll and one vote only when a vote is taken on a show of hands.
During the year ended 31 December 2018 $211 million 2017: $92 million of shares were repurchased at an average price of 169.5 pence 2017: 154.6 pence, buying back 93.5 million shares 2017: 46.4 million shares, which had an accretive impact on EPS Note 8 of 2.8% 2017: 1.7%.
This relates to the completion of the remaining $74 million of the share repurchase announced in October 2017, the $100 million announced in April 2018, and the partial completion of $37 million of the anticipated $100 million share repurchase announced in October 2018.
As at 28 February 2019, Man Group had an unexpired authority to repurchase up to 93,699,317 of its ordinary shares.
A special resolution will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting AGM, pursuant to which the Company will seek authority to repurchase up to 154,747,655 of its ordinary shares, representing 10% of the issued ordinary share capital, excluding treasury shares, at 28 February 2019.
Deferred sterling shares 50,000 unlisted deferred sterling shares, representing 0.1% of the Companys issued share capital with a par value of 1 per share, were issued due to the redenomination of the ordinary share capital into USD.
These shares are necessary for the Company to continue to comply with Section 763 of the Companies Act 2006.
The deferred sterling shares are freely transferable and have no rights to participate in the profits of the Company, to attend, speak or vote at any general meeting and no right to participate in any distribution in a winding up except for a return of the nominal value in certain limited circumstances.

Pension Man operates 12 2017: 12 defined contribution plans and two 2017: two funded defined benefit plans.
Defined contribution plans Man pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis.
Man has no further payment obligation once the contributions have been paid.
Defined contribution pension costs totalled $9 million for the year to 31 December 2018 2017: $8 million and are recognised as pension costs within compensation in the Group income statement when they are due.
Defined benefit plans A defined benefit plan creates a financial obligation to provide funding to the pension plan to provide a retired employee with pension benefits usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
As with the vast majority of similar arrangements, Man ultimately underwrites the risks related to the defined benefit plans.
The risks that this exposes Man to include: Uncertainty in benefit payments: The value of Mans liabilities for post-retirement benefits will ultimately depend on the amount of benefits paid out.
This in turn will depend on the level of inflation for those benefits that are subject to some form of inflation protection and how long individuals live.
Volatility in asset values: Man is exposed to future movements in the values of assets held in the plans to meet future benefit payments.
Uncertainty in cash funding: Movements in the values of the obligations or assets may result in Man being required to provide higher levels of cash.
The two defined benefit plans operated are the Man Group plc Pension Fund in the UK the UK Plan and the Man Group Pension Plan in Switzerland the Swiss Plan.
At 31 December 2018, the UK Plan comprised 94% 31 December 2017: 93% of the Groups total defined benefit pension obligations.
The UK Plan is operated separately from Man and managed by independent trustees.
The trustees are responsible for payment of the benefits and management of the UK Plans assets.
Under UK regulations, Man and the trustees of the UK Plan are required to agree a funding strategy and contribution schedule for the UK Plan.
In order to maintain flexibility with regards to the funding of the UK Plan, Man set up the Man Group Reservoir Trust the Reservoir Trust in 2010.
Man contributed $76 million 50 million of assets to the Reservoir Trust on 31 March 2010 and committed to ensure the Reservoir Trust value remains at least 69 million from 1 April 2013 or at the level of the funding deficit in the UK Plan, if lower.
The Reservoir Trust gave the Pension Trustees comfort that Man could fund a deficit at 31 December 2017 and in the event that the UK Plan was fully funded, allowed Man to recover the assets so that the UK Plan was not over funded.
The Reservoir Trust was treated as an asset of the UK Plan, until its wind-up in 2018, as: 1 the Reservoir Trust was legally separate from Man and existed solely to fund employee benefits: 2 the assets of the Reservoir Trust were passed to the UK Plan in the event of any default or insolvency situation, such that they were not available to Mans creditors: and 3 the funding position of the UK Plan was in deficit.
As part of the latest funding valuation process, a 52.5 million payment from the Reservoir Trust was paid into the UK Plan in March 2018.
A smaller 3.6 million balancing payment was also paid into the UK Plan in early July 2018.
The Reservoir Trust has now been wound up with $19 million of remaining assets refunded to the Group during 2018.
No other cash contributions were made to the UK Plan in the year to 31 December 2018.
The next actuarial valuation has an effective date of 31 December 2020.
As part of this valuation, a new recovery plan may be agreed.
For the UK Plan, the Group has concluded that it has no requirement to adjust the balance sheet to recognise either a current surplus or a minimum funding requirement on the basis that the Group has an unconditional right to a refund of a current or projected future surplus at some point in the future.

Pension continued For the Swiss Plan, the Swiss Plan holds some of its assets in an employer contribution reserve, which can be used to reduce the Groups future contributions into the Plan.
Since the employer contribution reserve is greater than the measured surplus in the Swiss Plan as at 31 December 2018, the surplus has not been restricted.
As the employer contribution reserve at 31 December 2017 was less than the measured surplus, the surplus was restricted to the value of the employer contribution reserve.
The UK Plan was closed to new members in May 1999 and to future accrual in May 2011.
Employed members of the UK Plan retain enhanced benefits, including a link to salary, on their accrued benefits in the Plan.
Future benefits are provided via a defined contribution plan.
In Switzerland, the Group operates a retirement foundation with assets which are held separately from the Group.
This foundation covers the majority of employees in Switzerland and provides benefits on a cash balance basis.
Each employee has a retirement account to which the employee and the Group make contributions at rates set out in the plan rules based on a percentage of salary.
Every year the pension fund commission composed of employer and employee representatives decides the level of interest, if any, to apply to retirement accounts based on their agreed policy.
At retirement an employee can take their retirement account as a lump sum or have this paid as a pension.
The amounts recognised in the Group balance sheet are determined as follows: 31 December 31 December $m 2018 2017 Present value of funded obligations 376 464 Fair value of plan assets 400 499 Surplus 24 35 Amount not recognised due to asset ceiling 3 Net pension asset 24 32 The decrease in the net pension asset from 31 December 2017 to 31 December 2018 is driven by the UK Plan, largely as a result of asset returns being lower than the discount rate assumption, and the net repayment due to the remaining Reservoir Trust assets being returned to the Group.
Our economic capital model includes capital in respect of a possible deficit in the pension plans.

Pension continued The assets held by the two plans as at 31 December 2018 are as follows: UK Plan Swiss Plan $m % $m % Swiss equities 3 12% Non-Swiss equities 4 17% Index-linked government bonds 42 11% Absolute return bonds 97 26% Swiss bonds 4 17% Non-Swiss bonds 6 25% Property 3 13% Hedge funds 1 4% LDI 104 28% Diversified growth funds 50 13% Man alternative risk premia fund 48 13% Cash 35 9% 2 8% Other 1 4% Total assets 376 100% 24 100% The investment strategy is set by the trustees of the Fund.
The current strategy is broadly split into growth and matching portfolios.
The growth portfolio is invested in diversified growth funds and Man alternative risk premia.
The matching portfolio is invested primarily in government and corporate bonds the latter through the Absolute return bonds holdings, and liability driven investment LDI funds.
The government bond assets and diversified growth funds have prices quoted in active markets and the absolute return bonds, LDI and Man alternative risk premia are primarily unquoted.
At 31 December 2018, around 25% of the Fund assets relate to those with quoted prices and 75% with unquoted prices 2017: around 65% quoted and 35% unquoted.
The Fund does not invest directly in property occupied by Man or in Mans own transferable financial securities.
Part of the investment objective of the Fund is to minimise fluctuations in the Funds funding levels due to changes in the value of the liabilities.
This is primarily achieved using the LDI funds, whose main goal is to hedge movements in the liabilities due to changes in interest rate and inflation expectations.
The current investment strategy aims to hedge around 100% of the movement in the technical provisions funding measure, as opposed to the IAS 19 accounting measure, due to both interest rate and inflation expectation changes.
LDI primarily involves the use of government bonds including re-purchase agreements and derivatives such as interest rate and inflation swaps.
There are no annuities or longevity swaps.
These instruments are typically priced and collateralised daily by the Funds LDI manager and or central clearing houses.
Given that the purpose of LDI is to hedge corresponding liability exposures, the main risk is that the investments held move differently to the liability exposures.
This risk is managed by the Trustees, their advisers and the Funds LDI manager, who regularly assess the position.
As the Swiss Plan is essentially a defined contribution plan with guarantees, the assets held aim to be at least as much as the total of the member account balances at any point in time.
Member account balances cannot reduce, but interest is only applied to the account balances when sufficient surplus assets are available.
As such there is no specific asset liability matching strategy in place, but if the liabilities the sum of the member account balances ever exceed the value of the assets, the Company will consider how to remove a deficit as quickly as possible.

Segmental analysis The criteria for identifying an operating segment is that it is a component of Man whose results are regularly reviewed by the Board and the Senior Management Executive Committee to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance.
Management information regarding revenues, gross management fee margins, investment performance and distribution costs relevant to the operation of the investment managers, products and the investor base are reviewed by the Board and the Senior Management Executive Committee.
A centralised shared infrastructure for operations, product structuring, distribution and support functions for each of the five investment managers which Man incorporates AHL, GLG, FRM, Numeric and GPM means that operating costs are not allocated to constituent parts of the investment management business.
As a result, performance is assessed, resources are allocated and other strategic and financial management decisions are determined by the Board and the Senior Management Executive Committee on the basis of the investment management business of Man as a whole.
Accordingly, we operate and report as a single segment investment management business, together with relevant information regarding FUM flows, gross margins and distribution costs, to allow for analysis of the direct contribution of products and the respective investor base.

Revenue from any single fund during the year did not exceed 10% of total revenues.
Non-current assets are allocated based on where the assets are located, and include goodwill and other acquired intangible assets, other intangibles, leasehold improvements and equipment, and investments in associates.
Foreign currencies The majority of revenues, assets, liabilities and financing are denominated in USD and therefore Mans presentation currency is USD.
For consolidated entities with a USD functional currency, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at each balance sheet date rate.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted at the spot rate at the date of the transaction or, if appropriate, the average rate for the month in which the transaction occurs.
Resulting exchange differences are recognised in the Group income statement.
For consolidated entities that have a functional currency other than USD, the assets and liabilities are translated into USD at the balance sheet date rate.
Income and expenses are translated at the average rate for the period in which the transactions occur.
Resulting exchange differences are recorded in other comprehensive income.
Fair value of financial assets liabilities Man discloses the fair value measurement of financial assets and liabilities using three levels, as follows: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities can be analysed as follows: 31 December 2018 31 December 2017 $m Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Financial assets held at fair value: Investments in fund products and other investments Note 13 3 246 155 404 3 137 112 252 Investments in line-by-line consolidated funds Note 13 316 41 357 452 452 Derivative financial instruments Note 14 16 16 9 9 3 578 196 777 3 598 112 713 Financial liabilities held at fair value: Derivative financial instruments Note 15 15 15 10 10 Contingent consideration Note 15 212 212 243 243 15 212 227 10 243 253 M MA AN N G GR ROUP PLC OUP PLC A AN NNUAL RE NUAL REPORT 2018 PORT 2018 131 131 F FIIN NA ANC NCI IA A LL ST STA AT TEME EMEN NTS TS Notes to the Group financial statements continued 25.
Fair value of financial assets liabilities continued During the year, there were no significant changes in the business or economic circumstances that affected the fair value of Mans financial assets and no significant transfers of financial assets or liabilities held at fair value between categories.
For investments in fund products, Level 2 investments comprise holdings primarily in unlisted, open-ended, active and liquid funds, such as seeding investments, which have daily or weekly pricing derived from third-party information.
A transfer into Level 3 would be deemed to occur where the level of prolonged activity, as evidenced by subscriptions and redemptions, is deemed insufficient to support a Level 2 classification.
This, as well as other factors such as a deterioration of liquidity in the underlying investments, would result in a Level 3 classification.
The material holdings within this category are priced on a recurring basis based on information supplied by third-parties, with a liquidity premium adjustment applied based on the expected timeframe for exit.
Reasonable changes in the liquidity premium assumptions would not have a significant impact on the fair value.
The fair values of non-current assets and liabilities held for sale Note 13.2 are equal to the carrying values of $39 million 2017: $145 million and nil respectively 2017: $66 million, and would be classified within Level 2.
The fair value of borrowings Note 12 is $150 million 2017: $156 million and would have been classified as Level 1.
The basis of measuring the fair value of Level 3 investments is outlined in Note 13.1.
The movements in Level 3 financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value are as follows: Year ended 31 December 2018 Year ended 31 December 2017 Financial Financial assets at fair liabilities at Financial Financial value fair value assets at fair liabilities at fair through through value through value through $m profit or loss profit or loss profit or loss profit or loss Level 3 financial assets liabilities held at fair value At beginning of the year 112 243 68 161 Transferred into Level 3 22 Purchases 88 1 47 52 Total losses gains in the Group statement of comprehensive income 9 3 5 41 Loss profit included in income statement 9 3 5 41 Included in other comprehensive income Sales or settlements 17 29 8 11 At year end 196 212 112 243 Total gains losses for the year included in the Group statement of comprehensive income for assets liabilities held at year end 9 3 5 41 The financial liabilities in Level 3 relate to the contingent consideration payable.

The $17 million decrease in the fair value of the Numeric contingent consideration is largely as a result of lower than expected Numeric performance during 2018.
The $15 million increase in the fair value of the Numeric contingent consideration in 2017 was driven by higher than expected Numeric performance during 2017.
The Numeric contingent consideration relates to an ongoing 18.3% equity interest of Numeric management in the business and profit interests of 16.5%, pursuant to a call and put option arrangement.
The call and put option structure means that it is virtually certain that Man will elect to, or be obliged to, purchase the interests held by Numeric management at five call option or five and a half put option years post-closing 5 September 2014.
The maximum aggregate amount payable by Man in respect of the option consideration is capped at $275 million.
The Aalto contingent consideration is dependent on levels of run rate management fees measured following one, four, six and eight years from completion on 1 January 2017.
The maximum aggregate amount payable by Man is capped at $207 million.
The fair values are based on discounted cash flow calculations, which represent the expected future profits of each business as per the earn-out arrangements.
The fair values are determined using a combination of inputs, such as weighted average cost of capital, net management fee margins, performance, operating margins and the growth in FUM, as applicable.
The post-tax discount rates applied are 11% for management fees and 17% for performance fees for Numeric and Other, and 15% for Aalto.

Mans participation in the profits of Nephila is governed by the share class rights and therefore does not relate proportionately to the ownership interest held.
Man considers that this equity interest, Mans ability to veto Nephilas annual business plan, and the presence of a Man member on the Nephila board of directors provides Man with the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions, and equates to significant influence.
Man sold its 18% investment in Nephila in November 2018 Note 17.
