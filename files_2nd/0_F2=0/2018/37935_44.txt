This valuation was used as the initial carrying value for Land and Plant and Office Fixtures and these assets.

These CGUs are Insurance, Money, Home Services, Travel, Shopping and Decision Technologies.

Due to the reorganisation of the structure, the Group has reallocated goodwill over the newly defined CGUs using a relative value approach.
This has resulted in the original goodwill being allocated across each vertical as follows: At 31 December 2017 1.6 28.2 1.0 1.8 32.6 Insurance 42.9m Depreciation for the year 0.5 0.3 0.1 0.5 1.4 Money 33.2m Impairment 0.8 0.8 Home Services 24.1m At 31 december 2018 2.9 28.5 1.1 2.3 34.8 Other 7.4m carrying amounts: The CGU's and respective goodwill allocation in the prior year were as follows: Insure 30.7m : Money 15.5m : Home 2.2m : Travel At 31 December 2017 8.3 0.9 0.2 9.4 6.6m : MSE 52.6m.

The allocation of this goodwill over the CGUs is yet to be determined as the acquisition accounting in respect of the acquisition of Decision Technologies Limited is not complete see note 25.

Third party costs incurred are allocated to investment projects and recognised at purchase cost.
This approach ensures that technology related intangible assets accurately reflect the cost of development.
The Group has therefore also performed a further impairment test for the Group as a whole, in a manner consistent with previous years.
As highlighted in Note 2, there is a degree of uncertainty regarding the recognition of costs incurred in developing technology related In these calculations the Group is treated as one group of CGUs, and the test compared the carrying amount, including goodwill and intangible assets.
This is due to the asset recognition criteria being predicated on future economic benefit flowing from that asset.

Management are confident however that any spend capitalised satisfies the criteria of IAS38 Intangible Assets and, where relevant, SIC-32 Intangible Assets Web Site Costs.
On an annual basis, or where an indication exists, the Group is required to assess its goodwill and intangible assets for impairment, see pages 103 and 104 for the assessment for goodwill and technology related assets.
