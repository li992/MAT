Telefnica UK Limited leases Weve provided guarantees relating to certain leases entered into by Telefnica UK Limited formerly O2 UK Limited prior to the demerger of mmO2 from BT on 19 November 2001. mmO2 plc now part of the Telefnica Group has given BT a counter indemnity for these guarantees.
There is no exposure in the event of credit default in respect of amounts used to defease future lease obligations.
The guarantee lasts until Telefnica UK Limited has discharged all its obligations.
Legal proceedings The group is involved in various legal proceedings, including actual or threatened litigation, government or regulatory investigations.
However, save as disclosed below, the group does not currently believe that there are any legal proceedings, or government or regulatory investigations that may have a material adverse impact on the operations or financial condition of the group.
In respect of each of the claims below, the nature and progression of such proceedings and investigations can make it difficult to predict the impact they will have on the group.
There are many reasons why we cannot make these assessments with certainty, including, among others, that they are in early stages, no damages or remedies have been specified, and or the often slow pace of litigation.
Italian business In the prior year, our parent company, BT Group plc, made an announcement with respect to the investigation into our Italian business.
The issues in Italy have also resulted in engagement with certain of our regulators and other authorities.
We are cooperating fully with these bodies.
Following this announcement, three purported securities class action complaints were filed against BT Group plc and certain current and former officers in United States courts.
The two actions brought in New York have since been voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiffs in those actions.
On 21 November 2017, the lead plaintiff in the District of New Jersey action filed an amended complaint brought on behalf of purchasers of BT Group ADRs between May 2013 and January 2017, regarding allegations that BT Group plc made materially false and or misleading statements during the class period.
On 22 January 2018 BT Group plc filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint and the plaintiffs filed their reply to that motion on 23 March 2018.
BT Group plc filed a response to their reply on 7 May 2018 and expect the court to schedule oral argument on the motion.
Phones 4U In December 2016, the administrators of Phones 4U Limited P4U started legal proceedings in the High Court in the United Kingdom against EE, claiming payments under a retail trading agreement for sums then due in respect of revenues net of costs from certain customers prior to P4U entering administration.
This sharing of revenue under the retail trading agreement was due to continue until September 2019, with related payments continuing until April 2021.
On 8 May 2018 we reached a confidential agreement with the administrators of P4U to settle this matter.
This settlement is in line with the accruals we held to cover potential payments required by EE.
Since 2015 the administrators have separately made allegations that EE and other mobile network operators colluded to procure P4Us insolvency.
We dispute these allegation vigorously and to date no proceedings have been issued.
Hutchinson 3G Limited In May 2016, Hutchinson 3G Limited H3G brought legal proceedings in the High Court in the United Kingdom against EE, alleging breach of contract relating to alleged delays in the roll out of certain free carrier coverage to H3G.
H3G is entitled to this free carrier coverage under arrangements agreed following the merger of Orange and T-Mobile, predecessors of EE.
H3G claimed damages relating to loss of business of 167m.
During the year the parties have resolved this matter to their mutual satisfaction and have discontinued the High Court proceedings.
Brazilian tax claims The Brazilian state tax authorities have made tax demands against certain Brazilian subsidiaries relating to the Tax on Distribution of Goods and Services ICMS, an indirect tax imposed on the provision of telecommunications services in Brazil.
The state tax authorities are seeking to impose ICMS on revenues earned on activities that the company does not consider as being part of the provision of telecommunications services, such as equipment rental and managed services.
We have disputed the basis on which ICMS is imposed and the rate which the tax authorities are seeking to apply.
We currently have 32 ICMS cases with a current potential value of 219m all covering assessments made for the period up to 2012, except for one case valued at 1.2m that covers the period 2013 to 2016.
The judicial process is likely to take many years.
There are eight cases, worth approximately 43m, that are pending appeal before the Sao Paulo Court of Appeal.
A hearing for these eight cases took place on 21 February 2018 and a further hearing will take place in the coming months.
