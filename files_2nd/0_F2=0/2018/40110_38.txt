The price risk relates to volatility in the market, and how other comprehensive income and equity would have been affected by changes in market risk that were reasonably possible at the reporting date.
If the quoted stock price for these securities increased or decreased, other comprehensive income and equity would have changed.
The listed securities are classified as available-for-sale so there would be no effect on profit or loss unless any decline in fair value below cost is determined to be an impairment.
The investments in listed equity securities are considered medium to long-term, strategic investments.
In accordance with the Groups policies, no specific hedging activities are undertaken in relation to these investments.
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT A description of the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing capital are included in note 29.
SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS Management have determined to present its segmental disclosures consistently with the presentation in the 2017 Annual Report with the exception that the USC fascia has been included within UK Sports Retail and our Asia based retail activities have been moved from European Retail formerly International Retail to Rest of World Retail.
This is due to management's assessment of the operating characteristics of USC and the Asia based retail activities.
Management consider operationally that the UK and EU Sports Retail divisions are run as one business unit in terms of allocating resources and assessing performance.
However, under IFRS 8 we have not at this reporting date met the required criteria with enough certainty to move back to an aggregated reporting segment.
We will continually keep this under review at subsequent reporting dates.
We continue to monitor the impacts of Brexit, and the continued uncertainties this has brought relating to the political and economic environments, and market and currency volatility in the countries we operate in.
European countries have been identified as operating segments and have been aggregated into a single operating segment as permitted under IFRS 8.
The decision to aggregate these segments was based on the fact that they each have similar economic characteristics, similar long term financial performance expectations, and are similar in each of the following respects: The nature of the products The type or class of customer for the products: and The methods used to distribute the products In accordance with paragraph 12 of IFRS 8 the Groups operating segments have been aggregated into the following reportable segments: 1.
UK Sports Retail includes the results of the UK retail network of sports stores and USC stores and concessions, along with related websites: 2.
European Retail formerly International Retail - includes the results of the European retail network of sports stores: 3.
Rest of World Retail includes the results of the US and Asia based retail activities: 4.
Premium Lifestyle includes the results of the premium and lifestyle retail businesses and related websites such as Flannels, Cruise and van mildert: and 5.
Wholesale & Licensing formerly Brands includes the results of the Groups portfolio of internationally recognised brands such as Everlast, Lonsdale and Slazenger.
The comparative information for the period ended 30 April 2017 has been restated to include the results of USC in UK Sports Retail and Malaysia in Rest of World Retail.
Accordingly, the prior period has been restated to adjust 88.6m of sales, 36.1m of margin and 40.8m of overheads to UK Sports Retail, and 27.7m of sales, 11.2m of margin and 8.3m of costs to Rest of World Retail.
Information regarding the Groups reportable segments for the 52 weeks ended 29 April 2018, as well as a reconciliation of reported profit for the period to underlying EBITDA, is presented on pages 162 to 165.
