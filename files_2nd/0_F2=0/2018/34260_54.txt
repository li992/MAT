Reconciliation of the effective tax rate The following table provides a reconciliation of the group weighted average statutory corporate income tax rate to the effective tax rate of the group on profit or loss before taxation.
For 2016, the items presented in the reconciliation are affected as a result of the overall tax credit for the year and the loss before taxation.
In order to provide a more meaningful analysis of the effective tax rate, the table also presents separate reconciliations for the group excluding the impacts of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and impairment losses and reversals, and for the impacts of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and impairment losses and reversals in isolation.

The recognition of deferred tax assets of $2,758 million 2017 $3,503 million, in entities which have suffered a loss in either the current or preceding period, is supported by forecasts which indicate that sufficient future taxable profits will be available to utilize such assets.
For 2018, $1,563 million relates to the US 2017 $2,067 million and $1,108 million relates to India 2017 $1,336 million.
A summary of temporary differences, unused tax credits and unused tax losses for which deferred tax has not been recognized is shown in the table below.

b The majority of the unused tax losses have no fixed expiry date.
c The UK unused tax credits arise predominantly in overseas branches of UK entities based in jurisdictions with higher statutory corporate income tax rates than the UK.
No deferred tax asset has been recognized on these tax credits as they are unlikely to have value in the future: UK taxes on these overseas branches are largely mitigated by double tax relief in respect of overseas tax.
These tax credits have no fixed expiry date.
d For 2018 the US unused tax credits expire in the period 2019-2028. e The majority comprises fixed asset temporary differences in the UK.
Substantially all of the temporary differences have no expiry date.
