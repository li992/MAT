On 22 December 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act US Tax Reforms.
This legislation reduced the 34 Tate & Lyle PLC Annual Report 2018 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Useful Information Assets Gross assets of 2,571 million at 31 March 2018 were 200 million lower than at 31 March 2017, mainly reflecting the adverse impact of the weakening US dollar.
Net assets increased by 35 million to 1,367 million as the profit for the year was partially offset by net exchange losses of 83 million and the dividend payment of 131 million.
Retirement benefits The Group maintains pension plans for its employees in a number of countries.
Some of these arrangements are defined benefit pension schemes and, although we have closed the main UK scheme and the US salaried and hourly paid schemes to future accrual, certain obligations remain.
In the US, we also provide medical benefits as part of retirement packages.
The net surplus on the Groups retirement benefits plans was 18 million, an improvement of 157 million from a net deficit at 31 March 2017 of 139 million.
The improvement was led by a reduction in the deficit of the US schemes largely as a result of foreign exchange movements from the weakening of the US dollar and by cash contributions.
In addition to total regular cash contributions of 44 million in the year, the Group made an accelerated gross cash contribution to the US schemes of 56 million, in light of an opportunity to fund the schemes while taking advantage of a higher US tax deduction.
Under funding arrangements in connection with the 2016 triennial actuarial valuation, the Group has committed to make core funding contributions for the main UK scheme of 12 million per year and supplementary contributions of 6 million per year until 31 March 2023 into a secured funding account, payable to the Trustee on certain triggering events.
During the year ending 31 March 2019, the Group expects to contribute approximately 30 million to retirement benefit schemes, comprising 26 million to its defined benefit plans and 4 million in relation to retirement medical plans.

Capital expenditure of 131 million, which included a 20 million investment in intangible assets, was 0.9 times the depreciation and adjusted amortisation charge of 142 million and reflects continued investment in capacity as well as efficiency and sustaining investments.
We expect capital expenditure for the 2019 financial year to be between 130 million and 150 million.
Other significant cash flows in arriving at net debt included: 26 million of dividends received from joint ventures: external dividend payments of 131 million: 27 million payments for the purchase of shares to satisfy share option commitments and a net 36 million accelerated funding payment to the US pension schemes a gross payment of 56 million, less 20 million tax deduction.
Overall net debt at 31 March 2018 of 392 million was 60 million lower than at 31 March 2017.
Net debt decreased by 25 million in the year 2017 decrease of 39 million before the favourable impact of exchange rates.
