In March 2018, the USD 250m foreign exchange forward, put in place in July 2017 with respect to the proposed Sparton acquisition, was closed out when the acquisition was terminated.
This resulted in a 11.1m non-underlying cash outflow and a net debit to the 2018 income statement of 3.9m when the impact to the fair value movements on derivatives is also taken into consideration.
In 2017, the fair value movements on derivatives included 7.2m of loss incurred with respect to the mark-to-market revaluation of this derivative as at 31 December 2017.

In addition, a deferred tax asset was notrecognised for certain expenses in our US business in both 2018 and 2017 and this will continue to be assessed annually.
The differences attributable to the UK CFC exemption, Patent Box and higher overseas tax rates are expected to recur in the future the level of profits in overseas jurisdictions and changes to the UK and overseas tax rates will affect the size of this difference in the future.
The benefit of the CFC exemption is subject to an ongoing EU State Aid investigation into the UKs Controlled Foreign Company regime.
In October 2017 the European Commission issued a preliminary finding that the Group financing partial exemption is illegal State Aid.
In common with other UK-based international companies whose arrangements are in line with current UK CFC legislation we may be affected by the eventual outcome ofthe investigation and are monitoring developments.
There have been no further announcements by the EU Commission since October 2017, noprovision for this potential liability continues to be made in these financial statements as it is not clear what, if any, the eventual financial result willbe.

These represent the lowest level at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
Subsequent adjustments are made to this allocation to the extent that operations, to which goodwill relates, are transferred between CGU groups.
The size of a CGU group varies but is never larger than a reportable operating segment.
There have been no changes in the year.
The recoverable amounts of CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations.
In determining the value-in-use for each CGU, the Group prepares cash flows derived from the most recent financial budgets and strategic plans, representing the best estimate of future performance.
These plans, which have been approved by the Board, include detailed financial forecasts and market analysis covering the expected development of each CGU over the next five years.
The cash flows for the following ten years are also included and assume a growth rate of 2.5% 2017: 2.5% per annum.
Cash flows beyond that period are not included in the value-in-use calculation.
Ultra Electronics Annual Report & Accounts 2018 Holdings plc Strategic report Governance report 104 Financial statements Notes to accounts Group continued FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018 14 Goodwill continued The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are those regarding the discount rate, future revenues, growth rates, forecast gross margins, underlying operating profit and underlying operating cash conversion.
Management estimates the discount rate using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the Group, being the Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC.
The WACC is then risk-adjusted to reflect risks specific to each business.
The pre-tax discount rate used during 2018 was 9.7% for UK and Australia, 10.7% for Canada and 11.4% for USA 2017: 10.1% for all regions.
Future revenues are based on orders already received, opportunities that are known and expected at the time of setting the budget and strategic plans and future growth rates.
Budget and strategic plan growth rates are based on a combination of historical experience, available government spending data, and management and industry expectations of the growth rates that are expected to apply in the major markets in which each CGU operates.
Longer-term growth rates, applied for the ten-year period after the end of the strategic planning period, are set at 2.5%.
Ultra considers the long-term growth rate to be appropriate for the sectors in which it operates.
Forecast gross margins reflect past experience, factor in expected efficiencies to counter inflationary pressures, and also reflect likely margins achievable in the shorter-term period of greater defence spending uncertainty.
Within each of the strategic plans, a number of assumptions are made about business growth opportunities, contract wins, product development and available markets.
A key assumption is that there will be continued demand for Ultras products and expertise from a number of US government agencies and prime contractors during the strategic plan period.
Sensitivity analysis, which included consideration of the potential impacts of Brexit, has been performed on the value-in-use calculations to: i reduce the post-2023 growth assumption from 2.5% to nil: ii apply a 20% reduction to forecast operating profits in each year of the modelled cash inflows: and iii consider specific market factors as noted above.
Certain of these sensitivity scenarios give rise to a potential impairment in C2ISR, the CGU grouping which includes Herley, ATS and Forensic Technology.
Profitability in Herley in 2017 and 2018 has missed expectations due to difficulties encountered with certain development contracts, however an improvement in profitability is envisaged in future years as contracts enter the production phase.
Despite these profitability challenges at Herley, headroom in C2ISR which represents the value derived from the key growth assumptions in the value-in-use calculations, is 46.5m 2017: 79.4m.
Sensitivity ii results in a 2.3m impairment to the goodwill allocated to the C2ISR CGU group.
This CGU grouping is also sensitive to the ability of the operations to retain existing customers, win new business and profitably execute contracts over the medium term, particularly given the recent profitability challenges at Herley.
On 2 November 2018 Ultra announced the sale of its Airport Systems business for a total consideration of 22m.
The Infrastructure CGU is comprised entirely of the Airport Systems business.
The disposal proceeds are below the carrying value of the net assets being sold and consequently a goodwill impairment charge of 6.6m has been recorded in the year.
Following the impairment charge, the carrying value of the goodwill for the Infrastructure CGU was 21.8m, which has been reclassified as held for sale.
As set out in note 2, the 6.6m impairment charge has been included as part of the non-underlying operating results of the Group.
Airport Systems is within the Aerospace & Infrastructure operating segment.
The disposal completed on 1 February 2019.
For all other CGUs, the value-in-use calculations exceed the CGU carrying values after applying sensitivity analysis.
The amortisation of intangible assets charge is included within administrative expenses.
Intangible assets, other than goodwill, are amortised over their estimated useful lives, typically as follows: Customer relationships 5 to 21 years Intellectual property 5 to 10 years Profit in acquired order book 1 to 3 years Other acquired 1 to 5 years Development costs 2 to 10 years Other intangibles: Software 3 to 5 years Patents and trademarks 10 to 20 years Ultra Electronics Annual Report & Accounts 2018 Holdings plc Strategic report Governance report 106 Financial statements Notes to accounts Group continued 31 DECEMBER 2018 16 Property, plant and equipment Land and buildings Short Plant and Freehold leasehold machinery Total 000 000 000 000 Cost At 1 January 2017 41,561 25,909 114,840 182,310 Foreign exchange differences 1,640 1,076 5,073 7,789 Additions 1,697 230 5,171 7,098 Disposals 11 2,911 19,786 22,708 Reclassified to software see note 15 418 418 At 1 January 2018 41,607 22,152 94,734 158,493 Foreign exchange differences 753 573 2,590 3,916 Additions 837 409 11,707 12,953 Disposals 11 603 11,666 12,280 Reclassified to held for sale 4,057 4,057 At 31 December 2018 43,186 22,531 93,308 159,025 Accumulated depreciation At 1 January 2017 8,389 16,010 91,716 116,115 Foreign exchange differences 359 794 3,744 4,897 Charge 1,148 2,040 6,978 10,166 Disposals 8 2,899 19,134 22,041 At 1 January 2018 9,170 14,357 75,816 99,343 Foreign exchange differences 111 460 1,837 2,408 Charge 1,018 1,819 6,096 8,933 Disposals 11 603 11,099 11,713 Reclassification 771 438 333 Reclassified to held for sale 2,543 2,543 At 31 December 2018 9,517 16,471 70,440 96,428 Carrying amount At 31 December 2018 33,669 6,060 22,868 62,597 At 31 December 2017 32,437 7,795 18,918 59,150 Freehold land amounting to 6,944,000 2017: 6,748,000 has not been depreciated.

Ultra Electronics Annual Report & Accounts 2018 Holdings plc Strategic report Governance report 108 Financial statements Notes to accounts Group continued FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018 19 Trade and other receivables continued The ageing profile of unprovided overdue trade receivables was as follows: Related Related 2018 provision Total 2017 provision Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 1 to 3 months 18,038 218 17,820 16,361 112 16,249 4 to 6 months 1,382 7 1,375 4,374 480 3,894 7 to 9 months 808 73 735 871 71 800 Over 9 months 4,839 3,612 1,227 1,214 842 372 Total overdue 25,067 3,910 21,157 22,820 1,505 21,315 The Group makes provisions against its trade receivables based on expected credit losses where there are serious doubts as to future recoverability based on prior experience, on assessment of the current economic climate and on the length of time that the receivable has been overdue.
All trade receivables that have been overdue for more than a year are provided for in full.
Movement in the provision for trade receivables was as follows: 2018 2017 000 000 Current Balance at beginning of year 1,505 1,307 Foreign exchange differences 1 23 Increase in provision for trade receivables regarded as potentially uncollectable 2,611 617 Decrease in provision for trade receivables recovered during the year 139 396 Reclassified to held for sale 66 Balance at end of year 3,910 1,505 Credit risk Credit risk is defined as the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group mitigates this risk of financial loss by only dealing with creditworthy counterparties.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
Whilst the Group has elements of concentration of credit risk, with exposure to a number of large counterparties and customers, the customers are mainly government agencies or multi-national organisations with whom the Group has long-term business relationships.
The Group has a small number of customers with individually significant amounts outstanding.
These customers are considered to have low credit risk.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and, when appropriate, action is taken to minimise the Groups credit risk.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements see note 22, net of any allowances for losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.

22 Financial instruments and financial risk management Derivative financial instruments Exposure to currency and interest rate risks arises in the normal course of the Groups business.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure to all significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
Fair value measurements recognised in the balance sheet The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted unadjusted active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All of Ultras financial instruments have been assessed as Level 2 or Level 3.

Ultra Electronics Annual Report & Accounts 2018 Holdings plc Strategic report Governance report 112 Financial statements Notes to accounts Group continued FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018 22 Financial instruments and financial risk management continued Currency risk The Group uses currency derivatives in the form of forward currency contracts to hedge its foreign currency transaction risk.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US Dollars and Canadian Dollars.
At 31 December 2018, the net fair value of the Groups currency derivatives is estimated to be a liability of approximately 6,387,000 2017: liability 11,863,000, comprising 147,000 assets 2017: 2,462,000 and 6,534,000 liabilities 2017: 13,891,000.
The gain on derivative financial instruments included in the Groups consolidated income statement for the period was 5,476,000 2017: gain 11,983,000.

The 2017 table above includes these forwards.
Net investment hedges At the year end, the Group had net investments in US companies where the associated foreign currency translation risk was hedged by external borrowings in US Dollars.
The value of the borrowings does not exceed the net investments and meets the conditions required to qualify as effective hedges.
The value of the net investment hedge was US$84m 2017: US$265m.
Interest rate risk The Group holds interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its bank borrowings.
The interest rate swaps, denominated in US Dollars, have been entered into to achieve an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate exposure reflecting the Groups policy.
The swaps mature in July 2019 and have a fixed swap rate, including the bank margin, of 1.23%.
The floating rates are US Dollar LIBOR.
At the year end, the nominal amounts of the interest rate swaps were US$45m 2017: US$60m.
The hedging contracts fix US$45m of borrowings to 31 December 2018 reducing to nil by July 2019.
The interest rate swaps were designated effective cash flow hedges and the change in fair value is charged to equity.
At 31 December 2018, the net fair value of interest rate swaps was 265,000 2017: 434,000.
The amount recycled from the income statement during the year was 435,000 and has been credited to interest cost in the year 2017: 27,000 charged.
The fair value will be realised in the income statement on a quarterly basis over the next 0.5 years.
The Group also has US$60m of fixed rate debt with Pricoa at an interest rate of 3.60%, which is due for repayment in January 2019, and 50m of fixed rate debt with Pricoa at an interest rate of 2.87%, which is due for repayment in October 2025.
The interest rate swaps and fixed rate Pricoa debt were entered into to achieve an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate exposure reflecting the Groups policy.
The effective interest rates and repricing dates of the Groups financial assets and liabilities were as follows: Effective Total Within 1 year 1 to 2 years 2 to 5 years 5 years interest rate 000 000 000 000 000 2018 Cash and cash equivalents 0.57% 96,319 96,319 Loan notes 3.11% 97,037 47,037 50,000 Unsecured bank loans 2.46% 146,304 128,722 17,582 Government loans 4.43% 10,382 10,382 2017 Cash and cash equivalents 0.55% 149,522 149,522 Loan notes 3.60% 51,752 7,393 44,359 Unsecured bank loans 2.56% 164,734 44,359 120,375 Government loans 4.43% 7,493 7,493 Annual Report & Accounts 2018 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Strategic report Governance report Financial statements 113 22 Financial instruments and financial risk management continued Market risk sensitivity analysis Interest rate risk During 2018 the Groups net borrowings were predominantly at floating interest rates.
The Group has estimated the impact on the income statement of a 1% increase in market interest rates, from the average rates applicable during 2018.
There is no significant difference between the amount recharged to the income statement and equity in the year.
Profit before tax 000 2018 1% change Interest rate sensitivity 1,977 2017 Interest rate sensitivity 1,700 Currency risks The Group has estimated the impact on the income statement and equity of a 10% and 25% strengthening or weakening of average actual and transactional currency rates applicable during the year and a 10% and 25% change in the foreign exchange rates applicable for valuing foreign exchange derivative instruments.
23 Government grants and loans The Group, through its Canadian subsidiaries Ultra Electronics Tactical Communication Systems TCS and Ultra Electronics Maritime Systems UEMS, participates in three Canadian programmes that provide government support in relation to the development of certain of its products.
Under the Strategic Aerospace and Defence Initiative SADI, the Canadian Federal Government provides a long-term funding arrangement in respect of certain eligible research and development project costs.
Under this arrangement, C$31.8m was provided to TCS and will be reimbursed at favourable rates of interest over the period to 2032.
Up to C$8m will be provided to UEMS and reimbursed at favourable rates of interest over the period 2020 to 2033.
The benefit of the below-market rate of interest has been calculated as the difference between the proceeds received and the fair value of the loans and has been credited to profit in the year.
The fair value of the loans has been calculated using a market interest rate for a similar instrument.
The valuation used the discounted cash flow method and considered the value of expected payments using a risk-adjusted discount rate: the discount rate used was 18% for TCS and 15% for UEMS.
For TCS, the amount repayable depends on future revenue growth of the TCS business to 2032 and will be between zero and x1.5 of the amounts received up to a maximum of C$47.7m.
For UEMS, the amount repayable depends on future revenue growth of the UEMS business from 2020 to 2033 and will be between x1.0 and x1.5 of the amounts received up until the end of the funding period in 2019.
As at 31 December 2018 C$2.8m had been received by UEMS.
The significant unobservable inputs for this Level 3 financial instrument are i whether, and by how much, TCS UEMS revenues will grow during the periods to 2032 2033, and ii the specific years in which revenue will grow.
There are significant inherent uncertainties in managements ability to forecast revenue over the following 15 years, particularly in later years.
For TCS, if the compound annual revenue growth rate over the period from 2018 to 2032 was 2.5% higher than assumed in the valuation model, then the net present value of the liability as at 31 December 2018 would increase by C$2.3m 1.3m.
If the forecast revenue growth occurs in earlier years than envisaged, then the net present value of the liability will increase: if the revenue growth increases were to occur one year earlier than assumed in the valuation model, then the net present value of the liability as at 31 December 2018 would increase by C$0.6m 0.4m.
Ultra Electronics Annual Report & Accounts 2018 Holdings plc Strategic report Governance report 114 Financial statements Notes to accounts Group continued FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018 23 Government grants and loans continued TCS has also benefited from an Investissement Quebec IQ research and development programme, whereby IQ shared in the cost of research anddevelopment of certain specified new products.
Under this arrangement, from 2010 to 2014 IQ financed C$8.8M of eligible costs associated with these specified projects.
The funding is repayable under a royalty arrangement over the period of 2014 to 2021, based on sales of specified products.
As there is no minimum repayment, funding received in respect of the IQ programme has been included in the income statement.
Royalties repaid have also been included as costs in the income statement in the period where they have been incurred.

UK deferred tax assets of 1.2m 2017: 1.2m and a US deferred tax asset of 3.1m 2017: 0.7m have not been recognised as their recovery is uncertain.
Such costs are generally incurred within two years after delivery.
Contract related provisions, for example including provisions for agent fees, are utilised over the period as stated in the contract to which the specific provision relates.
Other provisions include re-organisation costs, deferred consideration and dilapidation costs.
Dilapidations will be payable at the end of the contracted life, which is up to fifteen years.
Contingent consideration is payable when earnings targets are met.

If the options remain unexercised after a period of six months from the date of maturity, the options expire.
A Savings-Related Share Option Scheme is open to all UK employees and provides for a purchase price equal to the average of the daily average market price on the day before the grant less 10%.
The vesting periods are three and five years.
Company Share Option Plan The Company Share Option Plan provides share options for nominated employees in the UK.
The purchase price is set at a mid-market price on the date of the grant.
This is an approved scheme and vesting is unconditional.
Options vest after three years and lapse after ten years from the date of the grant.
Executive Share Option Scheme The Executive Share Option Scheme provides share options for nominated employees in the UK, the US and Canada.
This is an unapproved scheme and vesting is unconditional.
Options vest after three years and lapse after seven years from the date of the grant.
Long-Term Incentive Plan Details in relation to the Ultra Electronics Long-Term Incentive Plan 2007 awards to Executive Directors are included in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 6277.
In April 2018, LTIPs were awarded to nominated employees.
The awards will vest in March 2021 upon achievement of certain performance targets and are conditional upon continued employment.
All Share-Based Payment Arrangements The number and weighted average exercise price of share options for all share-based payment arrangements including LTIP are as follows: Weighted Weighted average average exercise price Number exercise price Number of options of options 2018 2018 2017 2017 Beginning of year 10.65 1,453,170 11.64 1,450,545 Granted during the year 7.34 614,785 10.40 468,851 Forfeited during the year 15.78 31,762 15.91 83,566 Expired during the year 6.28 283,609 7.79 176,792 Exercised during the year 4.68 22,919 17.39 205,868 Outstanding at the end of the year 10.17 1,729,665 10.65 1,453,170 Exercisable at the end of the year 17.20 309,029 17.10 214,392 The Group recognised total expenses of 1,493,000 2017: 682,000 in relation to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price.
Share options were exercised on a regular basis throughout the year.
The weighted average share price during the year was 15.00.
The fair value of options granted during the year that are expected to vest was 4,402,058 2017: 4,283,912.
The Groups equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of the grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The fair value for all schemes other than the 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 March LTIP schemes are measured by use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following assumptions: Ultra Electronics Annual Report & Accounts 2018 Holdings plc Strategic report Governance report 118 Financial statements Notes to accounts Group continued FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018 26 Share capital and share options continued Share save CSOP ESOS LTIP 2018 Weighted average share price 17.30 17.37 17.14 17.18 Weighted average exercise price 15.53 17.42 17.13 n a Expected volatility % 22.8 23.5 24.4 5.2 Expected option life years 3.6 6.0 5.0 3.0 Risk-free interest rate % 0.7 1.4 1.5 0.2 Expected dividends % 2.7 2.5 2.4 0.0 Share save CSOP ESOS LTIP 2017 Weighted average share price 17.49 17.61 17.47 18.86 Weighted average exercise price 15.71 17.66 17.46 n a Expected volatility % 20.4 23.2 23.9 19.0 Expected option life years 3.8 6.0 5.0 3.0 Risk-free interest rate % 0.6 1.4 1.5 0.5 Expected dividends % 2.6 2.4 2.3 0.0 Figures in the above table show an average across the invested schemes at year end.
For the 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 March LTIP awards, the stochastic model has been used to calculate the fair value of the awards at the grant date as this is the most accurate way of modelling the TSR performance condition.

The scheme was closed to new members in 2003.
The scheme is a final salary scheme with the majority of members accruing 1 60th of their final pensionable earnings for each year of pensionable service, however the scheme was closed to future benefit accrual from 5 April 2016.
A defined contribution plan was introduced for other employees and new joiners in the UK.
The latest full actuarial valuation of the defined benefit scheme was carried out as at 6 April 2016.
The Group also operates two defined contribution schemes for overseas employees.
In addition to these schemes, the Groups Tactical Communication Systems business based in Montreal, Canada, has three defined benefit schemes and the Swiss business of the Forensic Technology group has a defined benefit scheme.
Defined contribution schemes The total cost charged to income in respect of the defined contribution schemes was 9,749,000 2017: 9,848,000.
Defined benefit schemes All the defined benefit schemes were actuarially assessed at 31 December 2018 using the projected unit method.
In the UK, Ultra Electronics Limited sponsors the Ultra Electronics Pension Scheme, a funded defined benefit pension scheme.
The scheme is administered within a trust which is legally separate from the Company.
Trustees are appointed by both the Company and the schemes membership and act in the interests of the scheme and all relevant stakeholders, including the members and the Company.
The Trustees are also responsible for the investment of the schemes assets.
This scheme provides pensions and lump sums to members on retirement and to their dependants on death.
The Trustees are required to use prudent assumptions to value the liabilities and costs of the scheme whereas the accounting assumptions must be best estimates.
Responsibility for making good any deficit within the scheme lies with the Company and this introduces a number of risks for the Company.
The major risks are: interest rate risk, inflation risk, investment risk and longevity risk.
The Company and Trustees are aware of these risks and manage them through appropriate investment and funding strategies.
The Trustees manage governance and operational risks through a number of internal controls policies, including a risk register.
Investment Strategy The investment strategy is set by the Trustee of the Scheme.
The current strategy is broadly split into growth and matching portfolios.
The growth portfolio is primarily invested in equities, property, diversified growth funds, private equity and private credit.
The matching portfolio is invested primarily in bonds, through the absolute return bonds holding, and liability driven investment LDI funds.
Part of the investment objective of the Scheme is to minimise fluctuations in the Schemes funding levels due to changes in the value of the liabilities.
This is primarily achieved through the use of the LDI funds that aim to hedge movements in the liabilities due to changes in interest rate and inflation expectations.
Currently, the Scheme targets hedging of around 65% on the technical provisions funding measure to both interest rate and inflation expectation changes.
LDI primarily involves the use of government bonds and derivatives such as interest rate and inflation swaps.
The main risk is that the investments held move differently to the liability exposures: this risk is managed by the Trustee, its advisers and the Schemes LDI manager, who regularly assess the position.
The assets held are also well diversified, across asset classes and investment managers.
This reduces the risk of drops in the value of individual asset classes, or a particular manager underperforming its investment objectives, having a negative impact on the funding position of the Scheme.
The investment performance and liability experience are regularly reviewed by the Trustee, and the Trustee will consult with the Company over any changes to the investment strategy.
Annual Report & Accounts 2018 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Strategic report Governance report Financial statements 121 30 Retirement benefit schemes continued Rather than holding the underlying assets directly, the Scheme invests in pooled investment vehicles managed by professional external investment managers, whom the Trustee has appointed with the help of its investment advisors.
The equity and diversified growth fund valuations are based on quoted market prices, while the property, private equity, private credit, absolute return bonds and LDI are primarily unquoted.
All valuations are provided by the respective investment manager.
GMP Equalisation Following a High Court judgment on 26 October 2018, it has become apparent across the UK pension industry that equalisation is required with respect to Guaranteed Minimum Pensions GMPs.
Scheme benefits earned in the period 17 May 1990 to 5 April 1997 may be affected by the requirement to equalise GMPs.
It will take a considerable time for trustees and employers to decide on the approach for GMP equalisation, gather data, calculate the new benefits and cost, and ultimately make payments to members.
The initial estimate for the Ultra Electronics Limited defined benefit scheme is that the impact is 3.2m: this has been recorded as a debit to the income statement in 2018 with a corresponding increase in scheme liabilities.
Valuation The scheme is subject to regular actuarial valuations, which are usually carried out every three years.
The last actuarial valuation of the scheme was on 6 April 2016.
The next actuarial valuation is due to be carried out with an effective date of 6 April 2019.
These actuarial valuations are carried out in accordance with the requirements of the Pensions Act 2004 and so include deliberate margins for prudence.
This contrasts with these accounting disclosures, which are determined using best estimate assumptions.
The results of the 6 April 2016 valuation have been projected to 31 December 2018 by a qualified, independent actuary.
The figures in the following disclosure were measured using the Projected Unit Method.
Key financial assumptions used in the valuation of these schemes were as follows: UK Canada Switzerland UK Canada Switzerland 2018 2018 2018 2017 2017 2017 Discount rate 2.80% 3.75% 0.90% 2.50% 3.50% 0.65% Inflation rate RPI 3.20% 3.20% 1.10% 3.20% 3.20% 1.00% Inflation rate CPI 2.20% 2.20% 1.10% 2.20% 2.20% 1.00% Expected rate of salary increases n a 3.45% 1.00% n a 3.45% 1.00% Future pension increases pre 6 4 08 2.95% n a n a 2.95% n a n a Future pension increases post 6 4 08 1.95% n a n a 1.95% n a n a For each of these assumptions there is a range of possible values.
Relatively small changes in some of these variables can have a significant impact on the level of the total obligation.
For the UK scheme, a 0.5% increase in the inflation assumption to 3.70% and a 0.5% decrease in the discount rate to 2.30% would increase the schemes liabilities by 6.5% and 9.6% respectively.
If the members life expectancy were to increase by 1 year, the scheme liabilities would increase by 4.2%.
The average duration of the scheme liabilities is 18 years 2017: 19 years.
The assumptions used are provided by Willis Towers Watson as Company advisors, and also by reference to the Bank of England Gilt curve at a duration appropriate to the schemes liabilities of 18 years.
The key demographic assumption used was in relation to the mortality rates of current and future pensioners.

31 Acquisitions and disposals On 7 July 2017, Ultra announced that it had entered into a conditional agreement to acquire Sparton Corporation Sparton, its 50 50 partner in the long-standing ERAPSCO joint venture, which supplies sonobuoys to the US Navy.
The transaction was subject to the approval of the United States Department of Justice DOJ under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 HSR.
Following discussions with the DOJ, and competition concerns raised by it, Ultra and Sparton mutually decided to terminate the merger agreement in March 2018.
Acquisitions In aggregate, cash consideration of 6.5m was paid in respect of retention payments in the prior period for the 3Phoenix acquisition.
No such payments have been made in the current year.
Disposals Fuel Cell business The Maritime & Land division disposed of its small Fuel Cell business in December 2018.
Cash proceeds of the sale totalled 0.6m, of which 0.2m was received in the year with an additional 0.4m to be received in 2019.
The net loss on disposal was 0.7m.

34 Contingent liabilities The Group has entered into a number of guarantee and performance bond arrangements in the normal course of business totalling 50.6m 2017:42.8m.
The nature of much of the contracting work performed by the Group means that there are occasional contractual issues, variations and renegotiations that arise.
In addition, the Group is, from time to time, party to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business.
In particular, the Oman Airport IT contract between the Sultanate of Oman, Ministry of Transport & Communications and Ithra Ultra Electronics in collaboration with Oman Investment Corporation LLC, the legal entity established with the sole purpose of delivering that contract and which was placed into voluntary liquidation in March 2015 was terminated in February 2015 and there are various proceedings in relation to that contract and its termination.
There remains significant uncertainty regarding the likely outcome of these proceedings and it is not possible to reliably estimate the financial effect that may result from the ultimate outcome.
Further, as previously announced, the SFO is continuing to investigate the conduct of business in Algeria by Ultra Electronics Holdings plc, its subsidiaries, employees and associated persons.
The investigation commenced in April 2018 following a voluntary self-report made by Ultra to the SFO.
Ultra continues to cooperate with the SFO and will make a further statement once the investigation is complete.
It is not yet possible to estimate the timescale in which the investigation might be resolved, or to reliably predict its outcome.

Comparative statutory numbers are not restated.

If IFRS 15 had been applied in 2017 then 1.4m of profit would have been delayed from 2017 to 2018, when the control was transferred to the customer.
Separation of performance obligations The revenue for the substantial majority of contracts that were previously recognised using contract accounting continues to be accounted for over the life of the contract, however the method by which performance obligations are determined has changed on certain contracts.
Details on how the Group determines performance obligations is included in accounting policies on page 133.
For a performance obligation to be recognised over time, the Group recognises revenue using an input method.
As such, revenue and related margin are calculated based on reliable estimates of transaction price and total expected costs, with revenue recognised as costs are incurred.
The Group has determined that this method reflects the Groups performance in transferring control of the goods and services to the customer.
When applying IFRS 15 there was a separation of performance obligations on a number of contracts, primarily between development and production phases, which led to lower margins being recognised in the initial contract performance obligations.
As such, 0.6m of profit recognised in 2017 under prior revenue recognition accounting standards is recognised in 2018 under IFRS 15.
Additionally, revenue and profit recognised in prior periods would have been lower due to the lower margin on the initial performance obligations of these contracts.
The separation of performance obligations led to an adjustment of 10.3m to reduce opening reserves and amounts receivable from over time contract Ultra Electronics Annual Report & Accounts 2018 Holdings plc Strategic report Governance report 128 Financial statements Notes to accounts Group continued FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018 37 IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers continued customers: this was predominantly from two UK contracts within the Aerospace & Infrastructure division on electronics development and production programmes.
These contracts have been running for a number of years and the majority of the impact to the income statement would have impacted the years prior to 2017, if IFRS 15 had been adopted in those earlier periods.
Other Items included within the other category in the tables on the prior page predominantly relate to certain licences that are deemed to provide separately identifiable benefits to customers and to certain material rights in licensing arrangements.
The timing of revenue recognised on the substantial majority of sale-of-goods contracts was not significantly affected with revenue continuing to be recognised as control of goods is passed to the customer, which is normally when legal title has passed to the customer.

A project has been undertaken to determine the impact of IFRS 16.
The project has assessed lease contracts excluding short-term and immaterial leases from across all the Groups business units.
The Group has adopted the modified retrospective approach and will recognise the cumulative effect of applying IFRS 16 at the 1 January 2019 transitional date: the prior period will not be restated.
The table below sets out the current estimated impact to the 1 January 2019 balance sheet: Property Non-property 31 December leases leases 1 January 2018 adjustment adjustment 2019 m m m m Leased assets Right of use asset 31.1 1.5 32.6 Lease liability 34.9 1.5 36.4 Lease accruals 0.2 0.2 Onerous lease provisions 0.9 0.9 Expected net assets adjustment 420.8 2.7 418.1 Expected adjustment to retained earnings 161.7 2.7 159.0 Further work will be undertaken in early 2019 to finalise this opening balance sheet determination.
Annual Report & Accounts 2018 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Strategic report Governance report Financial statements 129 38 IFRS 16 Leases continued Under IFRS 16, operating leases that are longer than 12 months must be recognised on the balance sheet and amortised over the life of the lease.
The impact of IFRS 16 on the accounts will be as follows: i Balance sheet recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet for all leases 1yr or where the asset value is 3.5k.
Leases that do not meet this criteria will be expensed on a straight-line basis.
The asset and liability are initially measured at the present value of all future lease payments.
ii Income statement previous lease charges recognised in gross profit or indirect costs are replaced with depreciation on the right-of-use asset and interest on the lease liability in the consolidated income statement.
iii Cash flow statement the cash impact of the lease is split between the principal and interest, with net cash flow remaining unchanged to pre-IFRS 16 cash flow.
Onerous lease provisions are offset against the right-of-use asset and will be replaced by an annual assessment of impairment on the right-of-use assets in accordance with IAS 36.
Additionally, under IFRS 16, lease incentives e. g. rent free periods will be recognised as part of the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability rather than recognised as a separate liability as under IAS 17.
The Group will make use of the practical expedient available on transition to IFRS 16 not to reassess whether a contract is or contains a lease.
Therefore, the definition of a lease in accordance with IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 will continue to apply to those leases entered or modified before 1 January 2019.
For leases entered into or modified on or after 1 January 2019, a contract will be determined as a lease if the Group has control of the leased asset, as defined by IFRS 16.
The following practical expedients, permitted by IFRS 16, have also been utilised: The application of a single discount rate to a portfolio of similar characteristic leases: Reliance on prior IAS 37 assessments of onerous leases as an alternative to performing an impairment review on transition: The use of hindsight: for property leases with historic extension option exercise dates, hindsight was applied such that the initial lease period also includes the extension period.
Similarly, if the exercise date for a termination option had already passed by the transition date, it was assumed that the termination option was not exercised.
