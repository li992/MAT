Significant accounting policies continued Dividends received which appear to be unusual in size or circumstance are assessed on a case-by-case basis, based on interpretation of the investee companies relevant statements, in order to make a judgement to determine their allocation in accordance with the SORP to either the Revenue Account or Capital Reserves.
Dividends which have clearly arisen out of the investee companys reconstruction or reorganisation are usually considered to be capital in nature and allocated to Capital Reserves.
Investee company dividends which appear to be paid in excess of current year profits will still be considered as revenue in nature unless evidence suggests otherwise.
The value of dividends received in the year treated as capital in nature, as disclosed in note 19 on the accounts, was not material in relation to capital reserves or the revenue account.
The value of special dividends receivable in any period cannot be foreseen as such dividends are declared and paid by investee companies and funds without prior reference to the Company.
