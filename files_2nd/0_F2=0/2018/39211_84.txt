Notes to the company financial statements continued 43 Changes in significant accounting policies continued IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 changes how and when revenue is recognised from contracts with customers and the treatment of the costs of obtaining a contract with a customer.
The standard requires that the recognition of revenue is linked to the fulfilment of identified performance obligations that are enshrined in the customer contract.
It also requires that the incremental cost of obtaining a customer contract should be capitalised if that cost is expected to be recovered.
The standard replaces existing revenue recognition guidance, in particular under IAS 18.
Transition The company has adopted IFRS 15 using the cumulative effect method, with the effect of applying the standard recognised at the date of adoption, with no restatement of the comparative period.
The following table summarises the impact, net of tax, of transition to IFRS 15 on retained earnings at 1 January 2018.
Impact of adopting IFRS 15 on opening balance '000 Retained earnings Reduction in amounts owed to group undertakings 4,075 Recognition of provisions 4,075 Impact at 1 January 2018 The impact on transition is due to a change in the groups accounting policy for capitalising contract costs under IFRS 15 see note 2.
There is an increase in provisions for amounts payable as at 1 January 2018 in respect of additional contract costs capitalised for the acquisition of client relationship intangible assets recognised in a group undertaking to which the related costs of the earn out contracts are recharged.
Impact on financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018 The company has considered the impact of adopting the standard, in particular the groups policy of capitalising the cost of obtaining customer contracts, and expects provisions for costs to acquire client relationship intangible assets to increase as a result.
Otherwise, there is no impact of adopting IFRS 15.
