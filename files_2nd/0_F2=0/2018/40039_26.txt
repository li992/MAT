141 Notes to the Company Financial Statements For the year-ended 31 March 2018 1 Principal Accounting Policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Companys Financial Statements.
Basis of Preparation The Company and its trading subsidiaries have considerable financial resources and a large number of customer contracts across different geographic areas and industries.
As a consequence, the Directors believe the Company is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
The Company operates as an investment company for the Sophos Group, holding investments in subsidiaries financed by Group companies.
As the Company is an intrinsic part of the Groups structure, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that Group companies will continue to support the Company through trading and cash generated from trading for the foreseeable future.
Thus the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Financial Statements.
The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 FRS 102 and under the historical cost accounting rules.
Under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
The Company is considered to be a qualifying entity for the purposes of FRS 102 and has applied the exemptions available under FRS 102 in respect of the cash flow statement and key management personnel compensation.
As the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken the exemptions available under FRS 102 in respect of disclosures in respect of share-based payments, financial instruments and the requirements of Section 33 Related Party Disclosures paragraph 33.7.
Investments Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
Foreign Currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are stated at historical foreign exchange rates.
Interest-Bearing Loans and Borrowings Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the Company becomes party to the related contracts and are measured initially at fair value less directly attributable transactions costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance income and finance expense.
Going Concern Basis The Company operates as an investment company for the Sophos Group, holding investments in subsidiaries financed by Group companies.
As the Company is an intrinsic part of the Groups structure, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that Group companies will continue to support the Company through distribution or debt financing supported by trading and cash generated.
