180 Capita plc Annual Report 2018 Notes to the Company financial statements 1 Accounting policies a Basis of preparation The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
In determining the appropriate basis of preparation of the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2018, the Directors are required to consider whether the Company can continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Having taken decisive action to strengthen the balance sheet through the raising of new equity and the disposal of non-core businesses, the Board are satisfied that the Group will continue to have adequate financial resources to realise their assets and discharge its liabilities as they fall due.
Accordingly, the Directors have formed the judgement that it is appropriate to prepare these financial statements on the going concern basis.
Therefore, the financial statements do not include any adjustments which would be required if the going concern basis of preparation is inappropriate.
The Groups committed revolving credit facility, bank term loan facilities and private placement notes are subject to compliance with covenant requirements including maximum ratios of adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA.
The Groups covenanted maximum ratio is 3.0 times or to 3.5 times depending on the debt instrument in question.
Net debt is reported in note 29 of the consolidated financial statement additional cash flow information.
Adjustednetdebt is used to calculate the gearing ratio being adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA refer to the alternative performance measures on pages 197198.
The Groups calculation of adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA at 31 December 2018 is 1.2 times and is compliant with the relevant ratios.
A separate profit and loss account dealing with the results of the parent company undertaking only has not been presented as provided by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. b Compliance with accounting standards These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101.
In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRSs, but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of FRS 101 disclosure exemptions have been taken.
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU EU-IFRS and are on pages 100164 of this report.
In these Company financial statements, the following disclosure exemptions available under FRS 101 have been applied: A cash flow statement and related notes: Comparative period reconciliations for share capital, tangible fixed assets, and intangible assets: Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly-owned subsidiaries: The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs: An additional balance sheet for the beginning of the earliest comparative period following the retrospective change in accounting policy: and Disclosures in respect of the compensation of key management personnel.
As the consolidated financial statements include equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken the disclosure exemptions under FRS 101 available in respect of the following disclosures: Certain disclosures required by IFRS 2 Share Based Payments in respect of Group settled share based payments: Certain disclosures required by IAS 36 Impairments of assets in respect of the impairment of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets: Certain disclosures required by IFRS 3 Business Combinations in respect of business combinations undertaken by the Company in the prior periods: and Disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instrument Disclosures.
c Tangible fixed assets Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets at rates calculated to write-off the cost on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned, as follows: Computer equipment 3 to 10 years Furniture, fixtures and equipment 4 to 5 years Leasehold improvements over the period of the lease.
d Intangible assets Intangible assets are valued at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses.
Amortisation is calculated to write-off the cost in equal annual instalments over their estimated useful life of three to 15 years.
In the case of capitalised software development costs, research expenditure is written off to the statement of profit and loss in the period in which it is incurred.
Development expenditure is written off in the same way unless and until the Company is satisfied as to the technical, commercial and financial viability of individual projects.
Where this condition is satisfied, the development expenditure is capitalised and amortised over the period during which the Group is expected to benefit.
e Investments Fixed asset investments are shown at cost, less provisions for impairment.
Investments held as current assets are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The carrying values of fixed asset investments are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be recoverable.
Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements 181 1 Accounting policies continued f Pension schemes The Company participates in a number of defined contribution schemes and contributions are charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which they are due.
These schemes are funded and the payment of contributions is made to separately administered trust funds.
The assets of these schemes are held separately from the Company.
The Company remits monthly pension contributions to Capita Business Services Limited, a subsidiary undertaking, which pays the Group liability centrally.
Any unpaid contributions at the year-end have been accrued in the accounts of that company.
The Company also has employees who are members of a defined benefit scheme operated by the Group the Capita Pension & Life Assurance Scheme the Capita DB Scheme.
As there is no  or stated Group policy for charging the net defined benefit cost of the Capita DB Scheme is recognised fully by the principal employer which is Capita Business Services Limited, a subsidiary undertaking.
The Company then recognises a cost equal to its contribution payable for the period.
The contributions payable by the participating entities are determined on the following basis: The Capita DB Scheme provides benefits on a defined benefit basis funded from assets held in a separate trustee-administered fund.
The Capita DB Scheme is a non-segregated scheme but there are around 200 different sections in the Scheme where each section provides benefits on a particular basis some based on final salary, some based on career average earnings to particular groups of employees.
At each funding assessment of the Capita DB Scheme carried out triennially, the contribution rates for those sections containing active members are calculated.
These are then rationalised such that sections with similar employer contribution rates when expressed as a percentage of pensionable pay are grouped together and an average employer contribution rate for each of the rationalised groups calculated.
The Companys contribution is consequently calculated by applying the appropriate average employer contribution rates to the pensionable pay of its employees participating in the Capita DB Scheme.
A full actuarial valuation of the Capita DB Scheme is carried out every three years by an independent actuary for the Trustee, with the last full valuation carried out at 31 March 2017.
The purpose of that valuation is to design a funding plan to ensure that the pension scheme has sufficient assets available to meet future benefit payments, based on assumptions agreed between the Trustee and the Group.
The 31 March 2017 valuation showed a funding deficit of 185m 31 March 2014: 1.4m.
This equates to a funding level of 86.1% 31 March 2014: 99.8%.
The principal employer has agreed to make additional contributions to the Capita DB Scheme totalling 176m over the period from November 2018 to the end of 2021 to address the deficit.
The next full valuation is expected to be as at 31 March 2021.
Note 32 of the Annual Report sets out more detail.
g Leasing commitments Assets obtained under finance leases are capitalised in the balance sheet and depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful economic lives.
The finance charges under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are allocated to accounting periods over the period of the lease and represent a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals due under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
h Deferred taxation Deferred income tax is provided, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences: Except where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill.
Except where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary timing differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible differences and the carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised, except where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary differences arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
i Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction or at the contracted rate if the transaction is covered by a forward exchange contract.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date or if appropriate at the forward contract rate.
All differences are taken to the profit and loss account with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings, to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against foreign equity investments, which are taken directly to reserves together with the exchange difference on the carrying amount of the related investments.
j National Insurance on share option gains National Insurance on outstanding share options at the year-end has been grossed up and shown as a provision and a receivable on the balance sheet.
k Financial instruments: disclosure and presentation A separate note dealing with the disclosures of IFRS 7 has been included in the consolidated financial statements on pages 144152.
182 Capita plc Annual Report 2018 Notes to the Company financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued l Investments and other financial assets Classification Applicable from 1 January 2018, the Company classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories: those to be measured subsequently at fair value either through OCI or through profit or loss : and those to be measured at amortised cost.
The classification depends on the contractual terms of the cash flows.
For investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading, this will depend on whether the Company has made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity investment at fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI.
The Company reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes.
Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date that is, the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
Measurement At initial recognition, the Company measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss FVPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset.
Transaction costs of financial assets carried at FVPL are expensed in profit or loss.
Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest.
Debt instruments Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the cash flow characteristics of the asset.
There are three measurement categories into which the Company classifies its debt instruments: Amortised cost: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows, where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at amortised cost.
Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method.
Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in profit or loss and presented in other gains losses together with foreign exchange gains and losses.
Impairment losses are presented as a separate line item in the statement of profit or loss.
FVOCI: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at FVOCI.
Movements in the carrying amount are taken through OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses, which are recognised in profit or loss.
When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit or loss and recognised in other gains losses.
Foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in other gains losses, and impairment expenses are presented as a separate line item in the statement of profit or loss.
FVPL: Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at FVPL.
A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at FVPL is recognised in profit or loss and presented net within other gains losses in the period in which it arises.
Equity instruments The Company subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value.
Where the cCmpanys management has elected to present fair value gains and losses on equity investments in OCI, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and losses to profit or loss following the derecognition of the investment.
Dividends from such investments continue to be recognised in profit or loss as other income when the Companys right to receive payments is established.
Changes in the fair value of financial assets at FVPL are recognised in other gains losses in the statement of profit or loss as applicable.
Impairment losses and reversal of impairment losses on equity investments measured at FVOCI are not reported separately from other changes in fair value.
Impairment From 1 January 2018, the Company assesses, on a forward-looking basis, the expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments carried at amortised cost and FVOCI.
The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.
Accounting policies applied until 31 December 2017 The Company has applied IFRS 9 retrospectively, but has elected not to restate comparative information.
As a result, the comparative information provided continues to be accounted for in accordance with the Companys previous accounting policy, as shown below: All investments are initially recorded at their fair value.
Subsequently they are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Investment loans are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Available-for-sale financial assets are measured at their fair value with unrealised gains or losses being recognised directly in equity.
When the investment is disposed of, the cumulative gain or loss previously recorded in equity is recognised in the income statement.
Financial assets at fair value through the income statement disclosed in investment income include financial assets designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through the income statement.
Financial assets may be designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss if the assets are part of a companys financial assets which are managed and their performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented risk management strategy.
Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements 183 1 Accounting policies continued m Trade and other receivables The Company assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its receivables carried at amortised cost.
For trade receivables, the Company applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, resulting in trade receivables recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts based on expected credit losses.
n Cash and cash equivalents Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
0 Financial instruments Interest-bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at their fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption amount is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised, as well as through the amortisation process.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
The principal derivative instruments used by the Company are foreign currency swaps, interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts.
The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date that a derivative contract is entered into, and they are subsequently re-measured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period.
The accounting for subsequent changes in fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
The Company designates certain derivatives as either: hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commitment fair value hedges : or hedges of a particular risk associated with the cash flows of recognised assets and liabilities and highly probable forecast transactions cash flow hedges.
At inception of the hedge relationship, the Company documents the economic relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, including whether changes in the cash flows of the hedging instruments are expected to offset changes in the cash flows of hedged items.
The Company documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking its hedge transactions.
In relation to fair value hedges for example, receive fixed and pay floating interest rate swaps held as fair value hedges against fixed interest rate borrowings which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, any gain or loss from re-measuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item and recognised in the income statement.
In relation to cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve within equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement, within other gains losses.
When forward contracts are used to hedge forecast transactions, the Company generally designates only the change in fair value of the forward contract related to the spot component as the hedging instrument.
Gains or losses relating to the effective portion of the change in the spot component of the forward contracts are recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve within equity.
The change in the forward element of the contract that relates to the hedged item aligned forward element is recognised the income statement at the same time as the hedged transaction.
For some hedge relationships, the Company may designate the full change in fair value of the forward contract including forward points as the hedging instrument.
In such cases, the gains or losses relating to the effective portion of the change in fair value of the entire forward contract are recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve within equity.
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss, as follows: Where the hedged item subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset, both the deferred hedging gains and losses and the deferred forward points, if any, are included within the initial cost of the asset.
The deferred amounts are ultimately recognised in the income statement, since the hedged item affects the income statement.
If the forecast transaction or firm commitment is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in equity remain in equity until the forecast transaction or firm commitment occurs.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to the income statement and are presented as non-adjusting.
184 Capita plc Annual Report 2018 Notes to the Company financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued p Share-based payments The Company operates a number of executive and employee share schemes.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award.
Fair value is determined using an option pricing model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company market conditions.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and managements best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions, the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described above.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the profit and loss account, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Subsidiary undertakings of the Company reimburse the Company through the intercompany account for charges attributable to their employees participating in the Companys share schemes.
