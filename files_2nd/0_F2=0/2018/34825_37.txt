NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 6.
Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, after excluding the weighted average number of non-vested ordinary shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust.
Adjusted earnings per share is calculated in the same way except that the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders is adjusted by adding back the amortisation of intangible assets recognised as part of business combinations and other one-off income or expense and then adjusting for the tax impact on those items which is calculated at the effective tax rate for the current year.
The performance of adjusted earnings per share is used to determine awards to Executive Directors under the Group Performance Share Plan PSP and Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of any non-vested ordinary shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust and after adjusting for the effects of dilutive options.
