During the year we signed a 25m contract with the European Space Agency ESA to develop the International Berthing and Docking Mechanism IBDM which positions us to become the international standard for spacecraft berthing and docking globally.
This is a key illustration of how QinetiQ is at the forefront of some of the innovative technology that is critical to the rapidly growing space industry.
Under the three year contract, QinetiQ will qualify and produce the first flight model.
This marks the next step following the successful prototyping that was developed under a previous contract with ESA.
The model produced under this contract will be the first IBDM to fly to the International Space Station.
The QinetiQ IBDM system is lighter and more versatile than competing designs, can accommodate large or small spacecraft, and is compatible with the newly agreed International Docking Standard, which seeks to allow docking between multiple types of spacecraft such as Dream Chaser SNC, Orion Lockheed Martin and Cygnus Orbital ATK.
