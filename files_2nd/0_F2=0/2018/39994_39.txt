Earnings per share continued Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company by the weighted average number of shares for the year.
In order to provide a measure of underlying performance, management has chosen to present an adjusted profit for the year which excludes items that may distort comparability.
Such items arise from events or transactions that fall within the ordinary activities of the Group but which management believes should be separately identified to help explain underlying performance.
The adjusted results are also those used by management to monitor performance and run the business.
