Johnson Matthey Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Accounts Notes on the accounts for the year ended 31st March 2018 16 Share-based payments continued All employee share incentive plan SIP UK and Overseas Under the SIP, all employees with at least one year of service with the group and who are employed by a participating group company are entitled to contribute up to 2.5% of base pay each month, subject to a 125 per month limit.
The SIP trustees buy shares partnership shares at market value each month with the employees contributions.
For each partnership share purchased, the group purchases two shares matching shares which are awarded to the employee.
In the UK SIP, if the employee sells or transfers partnership shares within three years of the date of award, the linked matching shares are forfeited.
In the overseas SIP, partnership shares and matching shares are subject to a three-year holding period and cannot be sold or transferred during that time.
During the year, 201,476 2017: 196,276 matching shares under the SIP were awarded to employees.
These are nil cost awards on which performance conditions are substantially completed at the date of grant and, consequently, the fair value of these awards is based on the market value of the shares at that date.
401k approved savings investment plans 401k plans In the US, there are two 401k plans, one for salaried employees and one for hourly employees.
Salaried employees may contribute up to 50% of their base pay and hourly employees up to 20% of their base pay, both subject to a statutory limit.
Salaried employees choosing Johnson Matthey Plc share matching are matched 100% of the first 4% contributed and hourly employees are matched 50% of the first 6% contributed.
Employees may contribute after one month of service and are eligible for matching after one year of service.
During the year, 6,560 2017: 14,870 shares under the 401k plans were awarded to employees.
17 Post-employment benefits 17a Group Background Pension plans The group operates a number of post-employment retirement and medical benefit plans around the world, the forms of which vary with conditions and practices in the countries concerned.
The retirement plans in the UK, US and other countries include both defined contribution and defined benefit plans.
For defined contribution plans, retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee and the investment returns on those contributions prior to retirement.
The group also makes payments to employees personal pension plans.
For defined benefit plans, which include final salary, career average and other types of plans with committed pension payments, the retirement benefits are based on factors such as the employees pensionable salary and length of service.
The majority of the groups final salary and career average defined benefit retirement plans are closed to new entrants but remain open to ongoing accrual for current members.
Regulatory framework and governance The UK pension plan, the Johnson Matthey Employees Pension Scheme JMEPS, is a registered arrangement established under trust law and, as such, is subject to UK pension, tax and trust legislation.
It is managed by a corporate trustee, JMEPS Trustees Limited.
The trustee board includes representatives appointed by both the parent company and employees, and includes an independent chairman.
Although the parent company bears the financial cost of the plan, the trustee directors are responsible for the overall management and governance of JMEPS, including compliance with all applicable legislation and regulations.
The trustee directors are required by law to act in the interests of all relevant beneficiaries and: to set certain policies: to manage the day to day administration of the benefits: and to set the plans investment strategy following consultation with the parent company.
UK pensions are regulated by the Pensions Regulator whose statutory objectives and regulatory powers are described on its website: www.
The US pension plans are qualified pension arrangements and are subject to the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Pension Protection Act 2006 and the Department of Labor and Internal Revenue.
The plans are managed by a pension committee which acts as the fiduciary and, as such, is ultimately responsible for: the management of the plans investments: compliance with all applicable legislation and regulations: and overseeing the general management of the plans.
Other trustee or fiduciary arrangements that have similar responsibilities and obligations are in place for the groups other funded defined benefit pension plans outside of the UK and US.
160 Notes on the accounts for the year ended 31st March 2018 17 Post-employment benefits continued 17a Group continued Background continued Benefits The UK pension plan is segregated into two sections a legacy section which provides final salary and career average pension benefits and a cash balance section.
The final salary element of the legacy section was closed to future accrual of benefits from 1st April 2010 and the career average element of the legacy section was closed to new entrants on 1st October 2012 but remains open to future accrual for existing members.
All new entrants join the cash balance section of the plan.
The legacy section provides benefits to members in the form of a set level of pension payable for life based on the members length of service and final pensionable salary at retirement or averaged over their career with the company.
The benefits attract inflation-related increases both before and after retirement.
The cash balance section provides benefits to members at the point of retirement in the form of a cash lump sum.
The benefits attract inflation-related increases before retirement but, following the payment of the retirement lump sum benefit, the plan has no obligation to pay any further benefits to the member.
The group operates two defined benefit pension plans in the US.
The hourly pension plan is for unionised employees and provides a fixed retirement benefit for life based upon years of service.
The salaried pension plan provides retirement benefits for life based on the members length of service and final pensionable salary averaged over the last five years.
The salaried plan benefits attract inflation-related increases before leaving, but are non-increasing thereafter.
On retirement, members in either plan have the option to take the cash value of their benefit instead of a lifetime annuity in which case the plan has no obligation to pay any further benefits to the member.
The US salaried pension plan was closed to new entrants on 1st September 2013 but remains open to future accrual for existing members.
All new non-unionised US employees now join a defined contribution plan.
Other post-employment benefits The groups principal post-employment medical plans are in the UK and US, and are unfunded arrangements that have been closed to new entrants for over ten years.
Maturity profile The estimated weighted average durations of the defined benefit obligations of the main plans as at 31st March 2018 are: Weighted average duration years Pensions: UK 19 US 12 Post-retirement medical benefits: UK 12 US 14 Funding Introduction The groups principal defined benefit retirement plans are funded through separate fiduciary or trustee administered funds that are independent of the sponsoring company.
The contributions paid to these arrangements are jointly agreed by the sponsoring company and the relevant trustee or fiduciary body after each funding valuation and in consultation with independent qualified actuaries.
The plans assets, together with the agreed funding contributions, should be sufficient to meet the plans future pension obligations.
161 Other Information Accounts Governance Strategic Report Johnson Matthey Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Accounts Notes on the accounts for the year ended 31st March 2018 17 Post-employment benefits continued 17a Group continued Funding continued UK valuations UK legislation requires that pension plans are funded prudently and that, when undertaking a funding valuation every three years, assets are taken at their market value and liabilities are determined based on a set of prudent assumptions set by the trustee following consultation with their appointed actuary.
The assumptions used for funding valuations may, therefore, differ to the actuarial assumptions used for IAS 19 accounting purposes.
The last funding valuation of JMEPS was carried out as at 1st April 2015.
This valuation showed that there was a deficit of 69 million in the legacy section of the plan, or 28 million after taking account of the future additional deficit funding contributions from the special purpose vehicle SPV set up in January 2013 called Johnson Matthey Scotland Limited Partnership.
To address the deficit, the parent company agreed to continue to make deficit contributions of 23 million per year up to 31st December 2019.
The valuation also revealed a surplus of 2 million in the defined benefit cash balance section.
The SPV was set up to provide additional deficit reduction contributions and to provide greater security to the trustee.
The group invested 50 million in a bond portfolio which is beneficially held by the SPV.
The income generated by the SPV is used to make annual distributions of 3.5 million to JMEPS for a period of up to 25 years.
These annual distributions are only payable if the legacy section of JMEPS continues to be in deficit.
This bond portfolio is held as a non-current available-for-sale investment note 23 and the groups liability to pay the income to the plan is not a plan asset under IAS 19, although it is for actuarial funding valuation purposes.
The SPV is exempt from the requirement to prepare audited annual accounts as it is included on a consolidated basis in these accounts.
In accordance with the governing documentation of JMEPS, any future plan surplus would be returned to the parent company by way of a refund assuming gradual settlement of the liabilities over the lifetime of the plan.
As such, there are no adjustments required in respect of IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction.
US valuations The last annual review of the US defined benefit pension plans was carried out by a qualified actuary as at 1st July 2017 and showed a deficit of $16 million on the projected funding basis.
The assumptions used for funding valuations may differ to the actuarial assumptions used for IAS 19 accounting purposes.
Other valuations Similar funding valuations are undertaken on the groups other defined benefit pension plans outside of the UK and US in accordance with prevailing local legislation.
Risk management The group is exposed to a number of risks relating to its post-retirement pension plans, the most significant of which are: Risk Mitigation Market investment risk Asset returns may not move in line with the The groups various plans have highly diversified investment portfolios, investing in a liabilities and may be subject to volatility.
wide range of assets that provide reasonable assurance that no single security or type of security could have a material adverse impact on the plan.
A fide-risking strategy is in place to reduce volatility in the plans as a result of the mismatch between the assets and liabilities.
As the funding level of the plans improve and hit pre-agreed triggers, plan investments are switched from return-seeking assets to liability-matching assets.
The plans implement partial currency hedging on their overseas assets to mitigate currency risk.
Interest discount rate risk Liabilities are sensitive to movements in bond The groups defined benefit plans hold a high proportion of their assets in government or yields interest rates, with lower interest rates corporate bonds, which provide a natural hedge against falling interest rates.

increase in the valuation of liabilities.
In the UK, this inflation hedge is extended by the use of inflation swaps, such that approximately 70% of the plans inflation risk is currently hedged.
The swaps are held with several banks to reduce counterparty risk.
During the year ended 31st March 2018, 34% of eligible pensioners in the UK plan accepted the offer of a pension increase exchange, which reduced the amount of future inflationary pension payable in exchange for higher non-increasing pension.

Contributions During the year, total contributions to the groups post-employment defined benefit plans were 69 million 2017: 70 million, including deficit contributions of 23 million 2017: 23 million in respect of JMEPS.
It is estimated that the group will contribute about 65 million to the post-employment defined benefit plans during the year ending 31st March 2019.
IAS 19 accounting Principal actuarial assumptions Qualified independent actuaries have updated the IAS 19 valuations of the groups major defined benefit plans to 31st March 2018.
The assumptions used are chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the long term nature of the plans, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.

These infrastructure assets are valued using widely recognised valuation techniques which use market data and discounted cash flows.
The same valuation approach is used to determine the value of the swaps and insurance policies.
The UK plans property is a unitised fund where the underlying assets are taken at market value.
The valuation of the fund is periodically independently audited.
The defined benefit pension plans do not invest directly in Johnson Matthey Plc shares and no property or other assets owned by the pension plans are used by the group.
The assets for the cash balance section of the UK plan are held separately from the assets of the legacy section.
At 31st March 2018, the defined benefit obligation related to the contributory cash balance section was 43 million 2017: 33 million and the fair value of the plan assets was 44 million 2017: 32 million.

In the year ended 31st March 2017, a past service credit arose in the US post-retirement medical benefits plan due to plan amendments capping the groups contribution towards medical coverage by limiting the increase in medical inflation to a cost of living increase and giving retirees a choice between the current Platinum plan and a Gold plan.
The remeasurement gain due to changes in financial assumptions in the UK pension plan during the year ended 31st March 2018 mainly reflects a 20 basis-point increase in the real after inflation discount rate caused by rising corporate bond yields and falling market-implied inflation.
Reimbursement rights A government subsidy is receivable under the US Medicare legislation as the US post-retirement medical benefits plan is actuarially equivalent to the Medicare Prescription Drug Act and there is an insurance policy taken out to reinsure the pension commitments of one of the small pension plans which does not meet the definition of a qualifying insurance policy.
These are accounted for as reimbursement rights and are shown on the balance sheet in post-employment benefit net assets.

The following summarises the estimated impact on the groups main plans of a change in the assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
This sensitivity analysis may not be representative of the actual change as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another.
