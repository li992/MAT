Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements 197 Alternative performance measures The Group presents various alternative performance measures APMs as the Directors believe that these are useful for users of the financial statements in helping to provide a balanced view of, and relevant information on, the Groups financial performance, position and cash flows.
These APMs are mainly measures which disclose the adjusted performance of the Group excluding specific items which are regarded as adjustments.
Those items which relate to the ordinary course of the Groups operating activities remain within adjusted profit.
The following items are excluded from adjusted profit: intangible amortisation, impairment of goodwill and acquired intangibles, acquisition contingent consideration movements, the financial impact of business exits or businesses in the process of being exited, acquisition expenses if material, movements in the mark-to-market valuation of certain financial instruments, the impact of significant new contracts and restructuring see below, and specific non-recurring items in the income statement.
In the Directors judgement, these need to be disclosed separately see notes 3, 4, 5 and 9 by virtue of their nature, size and or incidence, in order for users of the financial statements to obtain a proper understanding of the financial information and the underlying performance of the business.
In addition, the Group presents other APMs including key performance indicators KPIs such as return on capital employed and interest cover by which we monitor our performance and others such as organic and acquisition revenue growth which provide useful information to users which is not otherwise readily available from the financial statements.

2 As noted in the Annual Report and Accounts 2017, on 20 April 2018, Capita agreed various amendments with the noteholders under its US private placement notes.
This included the carve-out of up to 100m worth of bonds and guarantees from the definition of indebtedness.
For covenant test purposes, this is effective from the 12-month period ended 30 June 2018, but for the Group's alternative performance measures, the comparatives have been restated to be presented on a consistent basis.
In addition, the comparatives have been restated to include results of business exits during 2018.
3 Restricted cash includes cash held by FCA regulated entities, cash held in foreign bank accounts in Malaysia and Nigeria and distributable reserves in joint ventures which does not belong to Capita and is excluded from adjusted net debt.
