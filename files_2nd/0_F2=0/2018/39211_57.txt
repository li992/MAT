The goodwill has been allocated to the investment management CGU see note 35.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs to which goodwill is allocated are assessed using value-in-use calculations.
The group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by the board, covering the forthcoming and future years.
The key assumptions underlying the budgets are that organic growth rates, revenue margins and profit margins are in line with recent historical rates and equity markets will not change significantly in the forthcoming year.
Budgets are extrapolated for up to 10 years based on annual revenue growth for each CGU see table below : as well as the group's expectation of future industry growth rates.
A 10 year extrapolation period is chosen based on the group's assessment of the likely associated duration of client relationships.
The group estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for each CGU is shown in the table below: these are based on a risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital.
The group judges that these discount rates appropriately reflect the markets in which the CGUs operate and, in particular, the relatively small size of the trust and tax CGU.
Investment management Trust and tax Rooper & Whately At 31 December 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 Discount rate 12.3% 11.1% 14.3% 13.1% 12.3% 11.1% Annual revenue growth rate 5.0% 5.0% 1.0 % 1.0 % 0.0% 0.0% At 30 June 2018, the group recognised an impairment charge of 269,000 in relation to goodwill allocated to the trust and tax CGU.
An impairment was recognised, as the recoverable amount of the CGU at 30 June 2018 was 595,000, which was lower than the carrying value of 864,000 at 31 December 2017.
The recoverable amount was calculated based on forecast earnings for 2018, extrapolated over 10 years based on a decrease in revenues of 1.0% per annum.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows was 15.0%.
The impairment was recognised in the Investment Management segment in the segmental analysis.
No further impairment was recognised at 31 December 2018.
Based on the assumptions in the table above, the calculated recoverable amount of the trust and tax CGU at 31 December 2018 was 1,729,000: this was higher than its carrying value of 595,000.
Reducing the assumed growth rate for income in the trust and tax CGU by one percentage point would reduce the calculated recoverable amount of the CGU to 828,000.
No reasonably foreseeable changes to the assumptions used in the value-in-use calculation for the investment management CGU, including managements assessment of the impact of Brexit, would result in an impairment of the goodwill allocated to it.
