SECTION 5: OTHER NOTES N OTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER 5.1 GENERAL INFORMATION Hargreaves Lansdown plc the Company and ultimate parent of the Group is a company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006 whose shares are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The address of the registered office is One College Square South, Anchor Road, Bristol BS1 5HL, United Kingdom.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Operating and Financial Review.
These financial statements are presented in millions of pounds sterling m which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of Hargreaves Lansdown plc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and IFRS Interpretation Committee IFRS IC interpretations as adopted by the European Union EU, and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis as discussed on page 101.
The financial statements have been streamlined and presented to allow users to better understand the primary statements and the related balances that make them up.
It is our aim to ensure that the information provided is pertinent and indicates the balances of most importance, whilst ensuring conformity with IFRS.
In order to do this, we have aligned the notes to the financial statements with the relevant primary statements: where there is an associated accounting policy, it is clearly denoted by a box presented at the beginning of the note.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Companys accounting policies.
The areas involving a higher degreeof judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in note 5.2.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and subsidiary undertakings controlled by theGroup made up to 30 June 2018.
The Group controls a subsidiary when it has power over an investee, is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the subsidiary and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
TheGroup reassesses whether it controls a subsidiary when facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more elements of control.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquired entity.
The acquired entitys identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 Business Combinations are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity at the non-controlling interests proportionate share of the recognised amounts of acquired entitys identifiable net assets.
132 Hargreaves LansdownReport and Financial Statements 2018 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Application of new standards In the current year, the following new and revised standards and interpretations have been adopted but do not materially affect the amounts reported or the accounting policies in these financial statements: Annual improvements to IFRS 2014-2016 cycle: Amendments to IFRS 12 'Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities', which clarifies that the only concession from the disclosure requirements of the standard are for interests in subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures that are classified or in a disposal group classified as held for sale: Amendment to IAS 7, Statement of Cash Flows: Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations which have not yet been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU : IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 Sale or Contribution of Assets IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers between and Investor IFRS 16 Leases Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2014-2016 Cycle IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2015-2017 Cycle Amendment to IAS 40 Investment Property IFRIC 22 'Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Consideration' Share-based Payment Transactions IFRIC 23 'Uncertainty of Income Tax Treatments' No early adoption of accounting standards has occurred for the years ended 30 June 2018 or 30 June 2017.
Management have assessed the new and impending standards, as outlined above, and have outlined the impacts as follows: IFRS 9 IFRS 9 requires re-assessment of classification and measurement in relation to financial instruments, this includes changes with respect to impairment, with IFRS 9 requiring the consideration to be made for expected loss when considering impairment, as well as enhanced disclosures.
IFRS 9 will be effective for, and adopted by, the Group on 1 July 2018.
Reclassification required by IFRS 9 has been assessed against the financial instruments of the Group as at 30 June 2018 and there are no assets or liabilities that are expected to require reclassification or re-measurement.
Accounting policies will also be updated in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 9.
The below table highlights the key financial instruments and their measurement and recognition classification: Financial instrument IAS 39 classification IFRS 9 classification Trade and other receivables Loans and receivables Amortised cost Equity investments Fair value through profit and loss Fair value through profit and loss Cash & cash equivalents Fair value through profit and loss Amortised cost Derivative financial instruments Fair value through profit and loss Fair value through profit and loss Trade and other payables Amortised cost Amortised cost Impairment measurement under IFRS 9 requires an assessment to be made of the expected lifetime credit losses on financial instruments.
This does not apply to equity instruments, but does apply to the trade and other receivables balances.
This will require the Group to assess the expected increases in credit risk in a given financial year.
Given the short-term nature of the Companys receivables, with the majority being settled within four days, losses are uncommon and low in value.
As a result, management do not expect any material lifetime expected credit losses to be recognised, assuming the makeup of the balances at 30 June 2019 is similar to the balances as at 30 June 2018.
Hargreaves LansdownReport and Financial Statements 2018 133 SECTION 5: OTHER NOTES N OTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER 5.1 GENERAL INFORMATION CONTINUED IFRS 15 The adoption of IFRS 15 is effective from periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and establishes a new principal based approach to be applied to revenue from contracts with customers, with the exception of insurance contracts, leases and financial instrument contracts.
IFRS 15 will be adopted on 1 July 2018.
A detailed assessment of all revenue streams as described in note 1.2, using the five step model outlined in the standard, has been undertaken.
The following steps have been considered: Identify the contract with a customer Identify the performance obligations in the contract Determine the transaction price Allocate the transaction price to separate performance obligations Recognise revenue as the entity satisfies a performance obligation It is the view of management that the revenue reporting and recording methods employed under IAS 18 satisfy the requirements of IFRS 15 and no material changes will be required to the current method of recognition and measurement upon adoption.
IFRS 16 IFRS 16 issued in January 2016, changes the way leases are treated and removes the concepts of finance leases and operating leases.
The adoption of IFRS 16 from 1 July 2019 will lead to the recognition of a right of use asset and corresponding liability for each of the agreements we have on our offices, due to the requirement under the standard to capitalise lease commitments.
This standard replaces the IAS 17 distinction between operating and finance leases for lessees.
The Group has four leases, all over property, at the end of the period, with remaining commitments of 28.6 million, at 30 June 2018.
On adoption of the standard, liabilities and assets expected to be material to the Group will be recognised, this will lead to a negative impact on the statement of comprehensive income due to the change in timings of expenses given the fact that operating lease accounting requires straight line recognition of expense, whereas the liability under IFRS 16 is accounted for using the effective interest method.
This negative impact is not expected to be material.
IFRS 16 will be effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
Management continue to assess the quantum of the adjustments and the subsequent impact on the Statement of Comprehensive Income and the Statement of Financial Position.
Accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of financial assets at fair value through profit and loss.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out at the start of each note to which they relate.
The accounting policies set out alongside the relevant notes have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out in the relevant notes to the financial statements.
Accounting policies as shown in these notes have been consistently applied throughout the current and prior financial year.
5.2 KEY SOURCES OF JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount ofrevenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities.
If in the future such estimates and assumptions, which are based on managements best judgement at the date of preparation of the financial statements, deviate from actual circumstances, the original estimates and assumptions will be modified as appropriate in the period in which the circumstances change.
There are no assumptions made about the future, or any other major sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period, that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.

136 Hargreaves LansdownReport and Financial Statements 2018 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 5.7 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Financial instruments include both assets and liabilities.
Financial assets principally comprise trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, current asset listed investments and derivative financial instruments.
Financial liabilities comprise certain provisions, trade and other payables, and derivative financial instruments.

The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period.
Instruments included in Level 1 comprise primarily equity investments and fund units entered into on a counter-party basis.
As such there is no recurring valuation of financial instruments between reporting periods.
The fair value of financial instruments not traded in an active market for example, over-the-counter derivatives is determined by using valuation techniques.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates.
If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2.
The valuation techniques employed in the valuation of over-the-counter derivatives rely on market forward rates as quoted at the end of the period used as inputs into an appropriate pricing model.
Hargreaves LansdownReport and Financial Statements 2018 137 SECTION 5: OTHER NOTES N OTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER 5.7 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments Financial risk management The main risks arising from financial instruments are market risk including interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
Each of these risks is discussed in detail below.
The Group monitors financial risks on a consolidated basis.
Hargreaves Lansdowns financial risk management is based upon sound economic objectives and good corporate practice.
No hedging transactions have taken place during the years presented.
The Group has designed a framework to manage the risks of its business and to ensure that the Directors have in place risk management practices appropriate to a listed company.
The management of risk within the Group is governed by the Board.
Market risk Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the Group will sustain losses from adverse movements in rates associated with interest-bearing assets.
There is an exposure to interest rates on banking deposits held in the ordinary course of business.
At 30 June 2018, the value of financial instruments on the Group Statement of Financial Position exposed to interest rate risk was 347.3 million 2017: 261.4 million comprising cash, cash equivalents and term deposits.
Impact of change in interest rates on finance income in the Consolidated Income Statement.
2018 2017 m m 50bps 0.5% 0.5 1.0 -50bps -0.5% 0.5 1.0 This assumes the interest income has been earned evenly over the period and that rates have remained constant over the period.
This exposure is continually monitored to ensure that the Group is maximising its interest earning potential within accepted liquidity and credit constraints.
The Group has no external borrowings and as such is not exposed to interest rate or refinancing risk on borrowings.
Cash at bank, including restricted cash, earns interest at floating rates based on daily bank deposit rates.
Term deposits are also made for varying periods of between one day and 13 months, depending on the immediate cash requirements of the Group, and earn interest at the respective fixed-term deposit rates.
Given that a source of revenue is based on the value of client cash under administration, the Group has an indirect exposure to interest rate risk on cash balances held for clients, the balance of which was 9,645 million at 30 June 2018 2017: 8,243 million.
These amounts are not included in the Group statement of financial position.
Foreign exchange translation and transaction risk Foreign currency risk is the risk that the Group will sustain losses through adverse movements in currency exchange rates.
With substantially all of the Groups businesses currently operating within the UK, and therefore with minimal net assets and transactions of the Group denominated in foreign currencies, the Group is not exposed to significant foreign exchange translation or transaction risk and as such does not hedge any foreign current assets or liabilities.
The Group deals in foreign currencies on a matched basis on behalf of clients, limiting foreign exchange exposure.
Price risk Price risk is the risk that a decline in the value of assets adversely impacts on the profitability of the Group as a result of an asset not meeting its expected value.
The Group is exposed to price risk on investments, in corporate entities, held on the Group statement of financial position.
At 30 June 2018, the fair value of investments recognised on the Group statement of financial position was 1.5 million 2017: 4.1 million.
A 20% move in equity prices, in isolation, would have an impact of 0.3 million 2017: 0.8 million.
As a main source of revenue is based on the value of client assets under administration, the Group has an indirect exposure to price risk on investments held on behalf of clients.
These assets are not on the Group statement of financial position.
The risk of lower revenues is partially mitigated by asset class diversification.
The Group does not hedge its revenue exposure to movements in the value of client assets arising from these risks, and so the interests of the Group are aligned to those of its clients.
In addition, the Group acts as a private client investment manager, unit trust manager and agency stockbroker on a matched basis so its exposure to market price movements in this capacity is limited to when there is a trade mismatch or error, or if one matched counterparty fails to fulfil its obligations.
The impact of these risks is minimised by limits and monitoring controls.
138 Hargreaves LansdownReport and Financial Statements 2018 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Liquidity risk The Group is exposed to liquidity risk, namely the risk that it may be unable to meet its payment obligations as they fall due.
The Group is highly cash generative and holds significant liquid assets.
The Group actively maintains a proportion of cash balances on short-term deposit to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for operations.
The table below analyses the maturities of the undiscounted cash flows relating to financial liabilities of the Group based on the remaining period to the contractual maturity date at the end of the reporting period.
At 30 June 2018 At 30 June 2017 0-3 months 3-12 months Over 1 year Total 0-3 months 3-12 months Over 1 year Total m m m m m m m m Trade and other payables: Trade payables 327.4 327.4 375.5 375.5 Other payables 21.7 1.1 22.8 20.4 0.7 21.1 Derivative liabilities at fair value through profit and loss 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.2 349.2 1.1 350.3 396.0 0.1 0.7 396.8 Credit risk The Groups credit risk is spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The Group is exposed to credit risk from counterparties to securities transactions during the period between the trade date and the ultimate settlement date if the counterparty fails either to deliver securities or to make payment.
Settlement risk is substantially mitigated as a result of the delivery versus payment mechanism whereby if a counterparty fails to make payment the securities would not be delivered to the counterparty.
Therefore the risk exposure is to an adverse movement in market prices between the time of trade and settlement.
Conversely, if a counterparty fails to deliver securities, no payment would be made.
The trade receivables presented in the statement of financial position are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
Also included within trade and other receivables in the statement of financial position are term deposits, these are deposits with UK licenced banks for a period of three months or greater, where the Group does not have immediate recall on the cash.
The maximum amount of time that these deposits are outstanding at year end is 13 months.
Cash is held with UK licensed banks.
The credit risk on liquid funds is minimised by only depositing with UK-regulated banks and the Group takes a conservative approach to treasury management, carrying out regular reviews of all its banks and custodians credit ratings.
As at the end of the reporting period, no financial assets were individually determined to be impaired.
The following table discloses the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk on financial assets.

Capital adequacy and the use of regulatory capital are monitored by the Groups management and Board.
Regulatory capital is determined in accordance with the requirements of the Capital Requirements Directive IV prescribed in the UK by the FCA.
The Directive requires continual assessment of the Groups risks in order to ensure that the higher of Pillar 1 Minimum Capital Requirements and Pillar 2 Supervisory Review requirements is met.
Pillar 1 imposes a minimum capital requirement on investment firms which is calculated as the higher of the sum of the credit and market risk capital requirements and the fixed overheads requirement FOR.
The FOR equates to 25% of the fixed overheads reported in the most recent audited financial statements.
Pillar 2 requires investment firms to assess firm-specific risks not covered by the formulaic requirements of Pillar 1 the objective of this being to ensure that investment firms have adequate capital to enable them to manage their risks.
The Group completes its assessment of regulatory capital requirements using its ICAAP under Pillar 2, which is a forward looking exercise that includes stress testing on major risks, such as a significant market downturn, and identifying mitigating action.
As required by the FCA, Hargreaves Lansdown holds capital based on a multiple of Pillar 1 and maintains a significant surplus over this requirement at all times.
The Group manages its retained earnings, share capital and share premium which total 401.3 million as at 30 June 2018 2017: 306.0 million.
Surplus regulatory capital was maintained throughout the year at both a consolidated Group level, as well as at an individual regulated entity level.
Under the requirements of Pillar 3 Disclosure, the Group is required to disclose regulatory capital information, and has done so by making the disclosures available in the Groups website at www.
Hargreaves LansdownReport and Financial Statements 2018 141 SECTION 5: OTHER NOTES N OTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER 5.8 INTEREST IN UNCONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIES The Group has determined that the investment funds it manages are structured entities.
Structured entities include entities that are designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when the relevant activities are directed by means of a contractual relationship.
As the Group directs the investing activities of the ten Hargreaves Lansdown MultiManager funds and the two Hargreaves Lansdown Select funds, through its investment management agreements with them, it considers them to be structured entities.
The Group holds interests in these funds through the receipt of management fees, together with direct investments in the entities.
Investments in the funds have been designated at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL.
The entities are entirely funded by the capital contributions associated with the purchase of units in the funds by unitholders and through return on investments.
None of the entities have issued debt or has borrowings and none are reliant on the Group for any funding.
