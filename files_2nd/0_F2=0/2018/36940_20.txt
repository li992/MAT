Operating costs and expenses Accounting policies Research and development Research expenditure on internal activities is charged to the consolidated income statement in the year in which it is incurred.
Development expenditure is written off in the year in which it is incurred, unless the following criteria are met: it must be technically feasible to complete the development project or intangible asset so that the related product will be available for use or sale: there is an intention to complete the intangible asset or development project and use or sell it: the Group has the ability to use the intangible asset or to sell it: the way in which the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits: the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset: and expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development is able to be reliably measured.
Amounts capitalized are amortized over the useful life of the developed product.
An internally generated intangible asset arising from the Groups development activities is recognized only if the following conditions are met: an asset is created that can be identified: it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits: and the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
The Group has determined that filing for regulatory approval is generally the earliest point at which internal development costs can be capitalized, however judgment is exercised when assessing the point at which it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits, which may not be until final regulatory approval for certain assets.
All internal development expenditure incurred prior to filing for regulatory approval is therefore expensed as incurred.
Internally generated intangibles recognized TM include software and technology and development costs in relation to PERSERIS.
The Group commenced capitalisation and TM TM amortisation of SUBLOCADE following receipt of regulatory approval in November 2017 and PERSERIS in July 2018.

Provision is made when an obligation exists for a future liability in respect of a past event and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated.
Marketing and promotional expenses are charged to the income statement as incurred.
Exceptional Items Where significant expenses or income that do not reflect the Groups ongoing operations are incurred during the year, these items are disclosed as exceptional items in the income statement.
Examples of such items could include restructuring and other expenses relating to the integration of an acquired business and related expenses for the reconfiguration of the Groups activities and or capital structure, impairment of current and non-current assets, certain costs arising as a result of material and nonrecurring regulatory and litigation matters, and certain tax related matters.

R&D expenses include $24m of impairment costs that have been classified as exceptional as outlined in the table below.
Distribution costs of $3m previously included in operating expenses have been classified as cost of sales to better reflect the nature of the SUBLOCADE costs.
The prior year has not been adjusted as the total amount, which was approximately $3m, is not material.
Administrative expenses include exceptional costs in the current and prior year as outlined in table below.
Prior year administrative expenses also included non-exceptional expenses of $36m related to prospective protection of the Groups intellectual property and revenues.
These costs were not considered exceptional in 2017 as they were not due to a litigation settlement provision, punitive or potential redress related expenses.

$37m of exceptional income in 2018 relates to the proceeds received from the out-licensing of nasal naloxone opioid overdose patents which are included within SG&A.
Restructuring costs relate to the cost-saving initiative announced and implemented during the year to offset the financial impact of recent adverse US market developments.
These consist primarily of redundancy and related costs that are expected to be utilised within one year.
$40m of legal expenses in the current year relate to potential redress for ongoing intellectual property related litigation with DRL and Rhodes Pharmaceuticals.
$210m of legal expenses in 2017 included $197m related to increased legal provision and legal expenses for the DOJ investigation, $25m for the conclusive legal settlement with Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC relating to anti-trust litigation, and a release of $12m for a legacy litigation reserve.
In 2018, R&D expenses include $24m of impairment charges related to the Arbaclofen Placarbil and lead ADDEX compounds for which development has ceased due to challenges in the Phase 1 and preclinical studies, respectively, thereby reducing their probability of success below hurdle rates for further investment.
In 2017, $14m of financing costs were written off due to the early debt refinancing.
This was accounted for as a significant modification in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement based on legal release of the debt, the change in currency profile of the overall debt, and the removal and relaxation of financial covenants.
In 2018, there was an exceptional tax credit of $34m in relation to development credits for SUBLOCADE claimed for prior years, finalization of the estimate of the US rate change on deferred tax assets in the US of $1m, along with tax on exceptional items of $8m.
Prior year tax exceptionals of $9m related to the release of a provision for unresolved tax matters partially offset by the impact of the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets as a result of the US Tax Reform along with the tax on exceptional income.

Income tax expense Accounting policy Income tax for the year comprises current and deferred tax expense.
Income tax is recognized in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
In this case, the tax is also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted, or substantively enacted, at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

The Group believes it has made adequate provision for the liabilities likely to arise from periods which are open and not yet agreed by tax authorities.
The ultimate liability for such matters may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of agreements with relevant tax authorities or litigation where appropriate.
In assessing these income tax uncertainties, management is required to determine the unit of account, the evaluation of the circumstances, facts and other relevant information in respect of the tax position taken together with estimates of amounts that may be required to be paid in ultimate settlement with the tax authorities.
As Indivior operates in a multi-national tax environment, the nature of the uncertain tax positions is often complex and subject to change.
Original estimates are always refined as additional information becomes known.
Indivior reviews and measures uncertain tax positions using internal expertise, experience and judgement, together with assistance and opinions from professional advisors.
Factors affecting future tax charges As a group with worldwide operations, Indivior is subject to several factors that may affect future tax charges, principally the levels and mix of profitability in different jurisdictions, transfer pricing regulations, tax rates imposed and tax regime reforms.
The enacted UK Statutory Corporation Tax rate is 19% for the year ended December 31, 2018 with a further reduction to 17% from April 1, 2020.
Other tax matters The European Commission has announced its intention to open a State Aid investigation into the UKs controlled foreign company CFC financing exemption.
At December 31, 2018, the Group has benefited from the UK controlled foreign company financing exemption by approximately $24 million: however, at present the Group believes no provision is required in respect of this matter.
The United Kingdom UK decision to withdraw from the European Union EU may have a material effect on our taxes.
The impact of the withdrawal will not be known until both the EU and the UK develop the exit plan and the related changes in tax laws are enacted.
We will adjust our current and deferred income taxes when tax law changes related to the UK withdrawal are substantively enacted and or when EU law ceases to apply in the UK.

A reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income is included in Note 5.
Intangible assets Accounting policy Intangible assets Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment.
Payments made in respect of acquired distribution rights are capitalized when it is probable that the expected future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Group.
The useful life of the acquired distribution rights is determined based on legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other relevant factors.
Acquired rights with finite lives are subsequently amortized using the straight-line method over their defined useful economic lives.
Amortization expense related to acquired distribution rights is included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
Payments related to the acquisition of rights to products in development or marketed products are capitalized if it is probable that future economic benefits from the asset will flow to the Group.
Probability is assumed for all externally acquired products in development, including subsequent milestone payments up to and including approval.
Amortization of the asset starts when it becomes available for use, at which point the asset is amortized over its useful economic life, which is generally estimated as the patent life within the products primary market.
Prior to that date, the intangible asset is tested for impairment annually, irrespective of whether any indication of impairment exists.
Amortization charges of marketed products are recognized within COGS.
Impairment of intangible assets The carrying values of intangible assets are reviewed for impairment either annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired depending on the intangible asset type.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of impairment loss.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which it belongs.
An assets recoverable amount is the higher of an assets or cash-generating units fair value less costs to sell or its value-in-use.
In assessing value-in-use, its estimated future cash flow is discounted to its present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
In carrying out impairment reviews of intangible assets, a number of significant assumptions have to be made.
These include the probability of success in obtaining regulatory approvals, future rate of market growth, discount rates, the market demand for the products acquired, the future profitability of acquired businesses or products, and levels of reimbursement for pharmaceutical products.
If actual results should differ, or changes in expectations arise, impairment charges may be required which would adversely impact reported results.
Products in development of $10m are subject to potential impairment in line with the probability of success.

During the year, impairment charges of $24m were recognised within R&D in relation to the Arbaclofen Placarbil and lead ADDEX compounds for which development has ceased due to challenges in the Phase 1 and preclinical studies, respectively, thereby reducing their probability of success below hurdle rates for further investment.
Once approved in their primary market, products in development are transferred to marketed products.
Marketed products Marketed products include approved product rights which are amortised over the patent exclusivity period in the major market to which the approval relates.
All products are assessed for impairment indicators at the end of each reporting period.
There were no impairments recognized in the year.
TM TM The Group received regulatory approval for SUBLOCADE in November 2017 and PERSERIS in July 2018, resulting in transfers from products in development to marketed products.
Amortisation expense of $3m 2017: $0.1m was recognised in COGS.
Software Acquired computer software licenses are capitalized at cost.
These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of up to five years.
Property, plant and equipment Accounting policies Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment, with the exception of freehold land, which is shown at cost less impairment.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be reliably measured.
Except for freehold land and assets under construction, the cost of property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the asset.
For this purpose, expected lives are determined within the following limits: freehold buildings: not more than 20 years: and plant and equipment: not more than 10 years: motor vehicles and computer equipment: not more than 4 years: leasehold improvements: up to the expected lease term.
Assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if necessary, at each balance sheet date.
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be appropriate.
Freehold land is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis.
Gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the assets carrying value with any sale proceeds, and are included in the income statement.

Additions in the year relate primarily to the redevelopment of the offices and laboratories in Fort Collins, Colorado and Richmond, Virginia offices.
Deferred tax Accounting policy Deferred tax is provided in full, using the balance sheet approach, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax is not recorded if it arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at that time.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and apply when the deferred tax asset or liability is settled.
They are revalued for changes in tax rates when new tax rates are substantively enacted.
Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized.
Deferred tax on unrealised profit in inventory arises due to elimination of inter-company sales that are taxed at different rates between jurisdictions.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except where the investor is able to control the timing of temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, the Group has not recorded any deferred tax on investments in subsidiaries.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities within the same tax jurisdiction are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and where there is an intention to settle these balances on a net basis.

These losses have unlimited carry-forward period.
To the extent that dividends remitted from overseas subsidiaries are expected to result in additional taxes, appropriate amounts have been provided for.
No deferred tax has been provided for unremitted earnings of Group companies overseas as these are considered permanently employed in the business of these companies.
A large proportion of the Group profits are realized in the US and we expect that we can rely on the UK-US treaty provisions to ensure that any future dividends paid will not suffer any withholding tax.
Post Brexit, on the assumption that the EU Parent Subsidiary exemption will cease to apply, the estimated total tax liability on unremitted earnings from EMEA is less than $0.5 million.
Inventories Accounting policy Raw materials, stores and consumables, work in progress and finished goods are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
Cost comprises materials, direct labour and an appropriate portion of overhead expenses based on normal operating capacity required to get the inventory to its present location and condition.
Inventory valuation is determined on a first in, first out basis.
Selling expenses, product amortization, and certain other overhead expenses are excluded.
Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less applicable selling expenses.
Write-down of inventory occurs in the general course of business.
Impairments are recognized in cost of sales.
2018 2017 $m $m Raw materials, stores and consumables 31 14 Work in progress 24 19 Finished goods and goods held for resale 23 19 Total inventories, net 78 52 The cost of inventories recognized as an expense and included as cost of sales amounted to $128m 2017: $104m.
This includes inventory write-offs and losses of $8m 2017: $2m.
The inventory provision reflected in the carrying amounts above at December 31, 2018 was $30m 2017: $14m.
The increase was primarily driven by provisions based on expiration dates associated with increased levels of inventory for SUBLOCADE and PERSERIS in line with the Group policy.
Trade and other receivables Accounting policy Trade receivables are initially recognized at their invoiced amounts less any adjustments for estimated deductions such as cash discounts.
From January 1, 2018, with the adoption of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, provisions for expected credit losses are established using an expected credit loss model ECL.
The provisions are based on a forward-looking ECL, which includes possible default events on the trade receivables over the entire holding period of the trade receivable.
These provisions represent the difference between the trade receivables carrying amount in the consolidated balance sheet and the estimated collectible amount.
Charges for doubtful trade receivables are recognized in the consolidated income statement within SG&A expenses.
The recognized amounts approximate fair value.
Trade receivables consist of amounts due from customers, primarily wholesalers and distributors, for whom there is no significant history of default.
The credit risk of customers is assessed, taking into account their financial positions, past experiences and other relevant factors.
Individual customer credit limits are imposed based on these factors.
The Group is not aware of any deterioration in the credit quality of these customers and considers that the amounts are still recoverable.

The amount of provision at December 31, 2018 was $2m 2017: $3m.
A portion of the receivables is expected to be recovered due to the nature and historical collection of trade receivables.
The movement in the provision for impaired receivables consists of increases for additional provisions offset by receivables written off and unused provision released back to the income statement.
The gross movements in the provision are considered to be insignificant.
The current other receivables balance does not contain impaired assets.
They consist of items including reclaimable turnover tax and are from a broad range of countries within the Group.
The carrying amounts of the Groups trade and other receivables are denominated in the following currencies: 2018 2017 $m $m Sterling 10 11 Euro 24 28 US dollar 240 222 Other currencies 13 17 287 278 Other non-current receivables Non-current other receivables of $33m at December 31, 2018 2017: $15m related primarily to long-term prepaid expenses for contract manufacturing capacity.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the year-end is the carrying value of each class of receivable mentioned above.
The Group does not hold any collateral as security.
Financial instruments and risk management The Groups financial assets and liabilities include cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, trade receivables and trade payables as set out in Notes 17, 18, 15 and 23 respectively.
The carrying value less impairment provision of current borrowings, cash at bank, trade receivables and trade payables are assumed to approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature.
The non-current borrowing, which is presented at amortized cost, is also assumed to approximate its fair value.
Financial risk management of the Group is mainly exercised and monitored at Group level.
The Groups financing and financial risk management activities are centralized to achieve benefits of scale and control with the ultimate goal of maximizing the Groups liquidity and mitigating its operational and financial risks.
Financial exposures of the Group are managed centrally in a manner consistent with underlying business risks.
Only those risks and flows generated by the underlying commercial operations are managed: speculative transactions are not undertaken.
Indivior Annual Report 2018 Indivior Annual Report 2018 113 113 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 16.
Financial instruments and risk management continued Foreign exchange risk management The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognized assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
The Groups policy is to align the foreign currency payables and receivables within its major subsidiaries in order to provide some protection against the remeasurement exposure on profits.
The Group may undertake borrowings and other hedging methods in the currencies of the countries where most of its assets are located.
Liquidity risk management Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is not able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price.
The Groups policy is to ensure there is sufficient funding and facilities in place to meet foreseeable liquidity requirements.
The Group manages and monitors liquidity risk through regular reporting of current cash and borrowing balances and periodic review of short-, medium-, and long-term cash forecasts, while considering the maturity of its borrowing facility.
At December 31, 2018, Indivior had $4m 2017: $5m of borrowings repayable within one year and $924m 2017: $863m of cash and cash equivalents.
Credit risk management The Groups exposure to credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, deposits with banks and financial institutions, and trade receivables.
Financial institution counterparties are subject to approval under the Groups counterparty risk policy and such approval is limited to financial institutions with a BBB rating or above.
Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited given that the balances consist of amounts due from customers, primarily wholesalers and distributors, for whom there is no significant history of default.
Outside the US, no customer accounts for more than 5% of the Groups trade receivables balance.
In the US, in line with other pharmaceutical companies, the Group sells its products through a small number of wholesalers in addition to hospitals, pharmacies, physicians and other groups.
Sales to the three largest wholesalers amounted to approximately 71% of the Group sales in 2018.
At December 31, 2018, the Group had trade receivables due from these three wholesalers totalling $212m 2017: $198m.
The Group is exposed to a concentration of credit risk in respect of these wholesalers such that, if one or more of them encounters financial difficulty, it could materially and adversely affect the Groups financial results.
The Groups credit risk monitoring activities relating to these wholesalers include a review of their financial information and Standard & Poors credit ratings, and establishment and periodic review of credit limits.
However, the Group believes there is no further credit risk provision required in relation to these customers see Note 15, Trade and other receivables.
Capital risk management The Group considers capital to be net debt plus total equity.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents, short-term available-for-sale financial assets and financing derivative financial instruments refer to Note 17.
Total equity includes share capital, reserves and retained earnings as shown in the consolidated balance sheet.
2018 2017 Note $m $m Net cash 18 681 376 Total equity 66 203 747 173 The objectives for managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern, in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an efficient capital structure to optimize the cost of capital.
The Group monitors net debt which at year-end amounted to net cash of $681m 2017: $376m.
The Group seeks to pay down net debt using cash generated by the business to maintain an appropriate level of financial flexibility.
Cash and cash equivalents Accounting policy Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, current balances with banks and similar institutions and highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than three months.
2018 2017 $m $m Cash and cash equivalents 924 863 924 863 There were no bank overdrafts in the current or prior year.
Financial liabilities borrowings Accounting policy Interest-bearing borrowings are recognized initially at fair value less attributable transaction cost: the cost of the loan approximates its fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortized cost, with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognized within finance expense in the income statement over the year of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Borrowings are classified as a current liability unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date.
Borrowings reflect the outstanding principal amount drawn, before debt issuance cost of $2m 2017: $5m.

Operating lease commitments Accounting policy Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases net of incentives received from the lessor are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

All charges related to the lease have been accurately recorded and hence the only adjustment required is to this note.
The impact of this change was to increase the total lease commitment in 2017 from $26m to $39m.
The Groups operating leases relate primarily to property, plant and equipment administrative offices.
Operating lease rentals charged to the income statement in 2018 were $5m 2017: $6m.
Provisions for liabilities and charges Accounting policy Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events: it is more likely than not that there will be an outflow of resources to settle that obligation: and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are measured at the present value of managements best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date.
Provisions are reviewed regularly and amounts updated where necessary to reflect the latest assumptions.
The assessment of provisions can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions.
Given the inherent uncertainties related to these estimates and assumptions, the actual outflows resulting from the realization of those risks could differ from the Groups estimates.

The Group is involved in legal and intellectual property disputes as described in Note 22, Legal Proceedings.
The Group carries a provision for investigative and antitrust litigation matters of $438m.
Substantially all of the provision relates to the U. S. Department of Justice investigation.
The Group is in advanced discussions with the Department of Justice about a possible resolution to its investigations, although it cannot predict with any certainty whether, when, or at what cost it will reach an ultimate resolution.
Although the total amount of the provision has not changed, the classification between current and non-current has changed due to a shift in managements best estimate of the timing of payments.
In the event the final settlement amount of the DOJ matter is materially higher than the provision or is required to be paid over a shorter period of time, and the Group is further adversely impacted by higher than expected loss of revenue following the at-risk launch of generic buprenorphine naloxone sublingual film products or the failure for new products to meet revenue growth expectations, the Group would not continue in business without taking further necessary measures to reduce its cost base and improve its cash flow.
The Directors have taken significant steps to reduce the cost base of the business and manage its capital structure.
However, a combination of the above risks may require additional measures such as further cost savings or a change to the litigation strategy.
The Group also carries provisions totalling $44m for intellectual property related matters, $40m of these relate to potential redress for ongoing intellectual property related litigation with DRL and Rhodes Pharmaceuticals and have been classified as exceptional costs see Note 4.
The restructuring provision relates to the cost-saving initiative announced and implemented during the year to offset the financial impact of recent adverse US market developments.
These consist primarily of redundancy and related costs, the majority of which is expected to be utilized within one year.
The final aggregate cost of these matters may be materially higher than the amount provided.
The Group believes that it has strong defences in the antitrust and other litigations and is actively litigating these matters.
Indivior cannot predict with any certainty whether, when, or at what cost it will reach ultimate resolution of the antitrust and other litigation matters.
Contingent liabilities Other than the disputes for which provisions have been taken as disclosed in Note 20, Provisions for liabilities and charges or as separately disclosed in Note 9, Income tax expense under Other tax matters, reliable estimates could not be made of the potential range of cost required to settle legal or intellectual property disputes where the possibility of losses is more than remote.
Descriptions of the significant tax, legal and other disputes to which the Group is a party are set out in Note 9, Income tax expense and Note 22, Legal Proceedings.

Legal proceedings Litigation Investigative matters Department of Justice Investigation A U. S. federal criminal grand jury investigation of Indivior initiated in December 2013 is continuing, and includes marketing and promotion practices, pediatric safety claims, and overprescribing of medication by certain physicians.
The U. S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Virginia has served a number of subpoenas relating to SUBOXONE Film, SUBOXONE Tablet, SUBUTEX Tablet, buprenorphine and our competitors, among other issues.
The Group has responded to the subpoenas and has otherwise cooperated fully with the Department and prosecutors and will continue to do so.
The Group is in advanced discussions with the Department of Justice about a possible resolution to its investigation.
However, it is not possible to predict with any certainty the potential impact of this investigation on the Group or to quantify the ultimate cost of a resolution.
State subpoenas On October 12, 2016, Indivior was served with a subpoena for records from the State of Connecticut Office of the Attorney General under its Connecticut civil false claims act authority.
The subpoena requests documents related to the Groups marketing and promotion of SUBOXONE products and its interactions with a non-profit third-party organization.
On November 16, 2016, Indivior was served with a subpoena for records from the State of California Department of Insurance under its civil California insurance code authority.
The subpoena requests documents related to SUBOXONE Film, SUBOXONE Tablet, and SUBUTEX Tablet.
The State has served additional deposition subpoenas on Indivior in 2017 and served a subpoena in 2018 requesting documents relating to the bioavailability bioequivalency of SUBOXONE Film, manufacturing records for the product and its components, and the potential to develop dependency on SUBOXONE Film.
The Group is fully cooperating in these civil investigations.
FTC investigation and antitrust litigation The U. S. Federal Trade Commission's investigation remains pending.
Litigation regarding privilege claims has now been resolved.
Indivior has produced certain documents that it had previously withheld as privileged: other such documents have not been produced.
Civil antitrust claims have been filed by a a putative class of direct purchasers, b a putative class of end payor purchasers, c Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC Amneal, a manufacturer of generic buprenorphine naloxone tablets, and d a group of states, now numbering 41, and the District of Columbia.
Each set of plaintiffs filed generally similar claims alleging, among other things, that Indivior violated U. S. federal and or state antitrust and consumer protection laws in attempting to delay generic entry of alternatives to SUBOXONE tablets.
Plaintiffs further allege that Indivior unlawfully acted to lower the market share of these products.
The Group has settled the dispute with Amneal, and Amneal has dismissed its claims against the Group with prejudice.
The other antitrust cases are pending in federal court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.
The fact discovery period has closed: expert discovery and briefing on class certification issues is ongoing.
Estate of John Bradley Allen On December 27, 2016, the Estate of John Bradley Allen filed a civil complaint against Indivior, among other parties, in the Northern District of New York seeking relief under Connecticuts products liability and unfair trade practices statutes for damages allegedly caused by SUBOXONE.
This lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice on August 9, 2018.
Opioid Class Action Litigation In February 2019, Indivior PLC, along with other manufacturers of opioid products, was named in the national civil opioid class action litigation brought by state and local governments, alleging misleading marketing messages.
This complaint was filed by several Kentucky public health agencies in the class action consolidated in the federal district court for the Northern District of Ohio on February 6, 2019.
On February 21, 2019, Indivior was voluntarily dismissed with prejudice from the lawsuit.
Intellectual property related matters ANDA litigation and inter parties review Actavis is currently enjoined from launching a generic buprenorphine naloxone film product until April 2024 based on a June 3, 2016 ruling by the United States District Court for the District of Delaware finding the asserted claims of the 514 Patent valid and infringed.
Actavis has appealed this ruling.
On October 24, 2017, Actavis received tentative approval from FDA for at least its 8mg 2mg generic product under its Abbreviated New Drug Application ANDA No.
204383 and on November 15, 2017, it received tentative approval for its 12mg 3mg generic product under ANDA No.
Litigation against Actavis is also pending in the District of Delaware on Indiviors more recently listed Orange Book Patents: U. S. Patent Nos.
On August 31, 2017, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware found that asserted claims of U. S. Patent No.
8,900,497 the 497 Patent, and the 514 Patent are valid but not infringed by DRL.
Indivior has appealed this ruling.
Litigation against DRL is currently pending in the District of New Jersey on the 454 and 305 patents.
DRL received final FDA approval for all four strengths of its generic buprenorphine naloxone film product on June 14, 2018, and immediately launched its generic buprenorphine naloxone film product at-risk.
On June 15, 2018, Indivior filed a motion with the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey seeking a Temporary Restraining Order TRO and Preliminary Injunction PI pending the outcome of a trial on the merits of the 305 Patent.
The court granted Indivior a two-week TRO, preventing DRL from continuing to sell or offer to sell its generic product.
Indivior was required to post an $18 million surety bond to cover DRLs damages in the event of an Indivior loss of its patent case against DRL.
On June 28, 2018, the court heard oral argument in support of Indiviors motion for a PI against DRL and, at the conclusion of this hearing, extended the TRO for an additional 14 days in order to rule on the PI motion and required Indivior to post another $18 million surety bond.
On July 13, 2018, the District Court issued its ruling granting Indivior a PI against DRL.
On July 18, 2018, the District Court ordered Indivior to post a surety bond for $72 million 118 118 www.
Legal proceedings continued that total figure being inclusive of the $36 million surety bond already posted in connection with the PI.
DRL appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit CAFC on the same day.
On November 20, 2018, the CAFC issued a decision vacating the PI against DRL.
Indivior filed a timely petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc on December 20, 2018.
The CAFC denied the petition on February 4, 2019.
On February 5, 2019, Indivior filed an emergency motion to stay the issuance of mandate pending the resolution of the appeal of the District of Delaware decision with respect to the 514 patent, and pending Indiviors forthcoming petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States in the PI matter.
The CAFC denied that motion on February 11, 2019, and Indivior filed a second emergency motion to stay the mandate pending resolution of its forthcoming application for an administrative stay to the Supreme Court of the United States.
The CAFC denied that motion and ordered issuance of the mandate on February 19, 2019.
Indivior filed an application to the Supreme Court of the United States requesting a stay of the mandate pending resolution of its forthcoming petition for certiorari seeking to overturn the CAFCs PI vacatur.
On February 19, the Supreme Court of the United States denied Indiviors motion to stay issuance of the CAFCs mandate vacating the PI granted against DRL.
The CAFC subsequently issued the mandate vacating the PI granted against DRL.
The U. S. District Court for the District of New Jersey then confirmed the PI against DRL had been vacated.
DRL is therefore are no longer prevented from selling, offering to sell, or importing their generic buprenorphine naloxone sublingual film products.
DRL has re-launched its generic product, and any sales in the U. S. are on an at-risk basis, subject to the outcome of the CAFC appeal of the judgments related to U. S. Patent No.
8,603,514, and U. S. 8,017,150 in the case of DRL, as well as ongoing litigation in the District of New Jersey asserting Orange Book-listed U. S. Patent Nos.
On February 12, 2019, the CAFC granted Indiviors request to expedite the appeal of the non-infringement judgment in the 514 patent case to the extent it will be placed on the next available oral argument calendar.
On November 13, 2018, DRL filed two separate petitions for inter partes review of the 454 Patent with the USPTO.
Indiviors preliminary responses are due March 6, 2019 and March 7, 2019.
Teva filed a 505 b 2 New Drug Application NDA for a 16mg 4mg strength of buprenorphine naloxone film CASSIPA.
Indivior, Aquestive Pharmaceuticals formerly known as MonoSol Rx and Teva agreed that infringement by Tevas 16mg 4mg dosage strength would be governed by the infringement ruling as to Dr. Reddys 8mg 2mg dosage strength that was the subject of the trial in November 2016.
Accordingly, the non-infringement ruling in the Dr. Reddys case means that the Teva 16mg 4mg dosage strength has been found not to infringe.
Indivior has appealed this November 2016 ruling.
Litigation is ongoing against Teva in the District of New Jersey on the 454 patent and 305 patent.
Teva received final approval from the FDA for CASSIPA on September 7, 2018 and has agreed to be bound by the decision in the DRL PI case.
Teva is therefore enjoined from launching CASSIPA unless and until the CAFC issues a mandate vacating the PI against DRL.
Any sales of CASSIPA in the U. S. would be on an at-risk basis, subject to the outcome of the appeal of the non-infringement judgment related to the 514 patent, as well as the ongoing litigation against Teva and DRL in the District of New Jersey.
Trial against Alvogen in the lawsuit involving the 514 and 497 Patents for SUBOXONE Film took place in September 2017.
The trial was limited to the issue of infringement because Alvogen did not challenge the validity of either patent.
On March 22, 2018, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware issued its ruling finding both patents not infringed by Alvogen.
Litigation against Alvogen is also pending in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey on the 454 Patent and the 305 Patent.
On January 22, 2019, Indivior filed a motion for a temporary restraining order TRO and preliminary injunction in the District of New Jersey, requesting that the Court restrain the launch of Alvogens generic buprenorphine naloxone film product until a trial on the merits of the 305 patent.
Alvogen received approval for its generic product on January 24, 2019.
The same day, the District of New Jersey granted a TRO until February 7, 2019, with a PI hearing scheduled for that day.
On January 31, 2019, Indivior and Alvogen entered in to an agreement whereby Alvogen is enjoined from the use, offer to sell, or sale within the United Sates, or importation into the United States, of its generic buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film product unless and until the CAFC issues a mandate vacating the PI against DRL.
Alvogen has launched its generic product, and any sales in the US are on an at-risk basis, subject to the outcome of the appeal of the non-infringement judgment related the 514 patent, as well as the ongoing litigation against Alvogen in the District of New Jersey.
By a Court order dated August 22, 2016, Indiviors SUBOXONE Film patent litigation against Sandoz was dismissed without prejudice because Sandoz is no longer pursuing Paragraph IV certifications for its proposed generic formulations of SUBOXONE Film.
On September 25, 2017, Indivior settled its SUBOXONE Film patent litigation against Mylan, the terms of which are confidential.
Mylan received final FDA approval for its generic version of the 8mg buprenorphine naloxone film product on June 14, 2018.
On May 11, 2018, Indivior settled its SUBOXONE Film patent litigation against Par.
Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Par can launch its generic buprenorphine naloxone film product on January 1, 2023, or earlier under certain circumstances.
Other terms of the settlement agreement are confidential.
So far as Indivior is aware, FDA to date has not granted tentative or final approval for Pars generic buprenorphine naloxone film product.
Rhodes pharmaceuticals On December 23, 2016, Rhodes Pharmaceuticals filed a complaint against Indivior in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging that Indiviors sale of SUBOXONE Film in the U. S. infringes one or more claims of U. S. Patent No.
The asserted patent, which was issued in June 2016, claims priority to an application filed in August 2007.
On March 16, 2018, Indivior filed a petition for inter partes review IPR with the United States Patent and Trademark Office USPTO asserting that all claims of the 512 Patent are invalid.
On October 4, 2018, the USPTO declined to institute an IPR on the challenged claims of the 512 patent.

Accruals are made at the time of sale but the actual amounts paid are based on claims made some time after the initial recognition of the sale.
As the amounts are estimated they may not fully reflect the final outcome and are subject to change dependent upon, amongst other things, the channel e. g. Medicaid, Medicare, Managed Care and product mix.
The level of accrual is reviewed and adjusted in light of historical experience of actual rebates, discounts or allowances given and returns made and any changes in arrangements.
Future events could cause the assumptions on which the accruals are based to change, which could affect the future results of the Group.

Other Equity Nature and purpose of reserves Foreign currency translation The foreign currency translation reserve contains the accumulated foreign exchange differences from the translation of the financial statements of the Groups foreign operations arising when the Groups entities are consolidated.
Other reserves The other reserves balance relates to the Group formation in 2014.
It represents the difference between the nominal value of the shares issued by the Company and the net investment in the Group by the former owner.
Share-based payments Accounting policy The Group operates three equity-settled executive and employee share plans.
For all grants of share options and awards, the fair value at the grant date is calculated using appropriate pricing models.
The grant date fair value is recognized over the vesting period as an expense, with a corresponding increase in retained earnings.
Employee Plans Legacy Award Indivior LTIP formerly Reckitt Benckiser LTIP Upon Indivior demerging from RB and listing on the UK Main Market, awards under the Reckitt Benckiser 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan granted in 2012 were exchanged on a value-neutral basis for new awards over Indivior ordinary shares under the Indivior LTIP for a number of executives.
The Remuneration Committee considered the vesting of these awards, taking into account the performance of RB and Indivior over the vesting period, weighted one-third on RBs performance and two-thirds on Indiviors performance.
The Committee concluded that 93.33% of the Award would vest in May 2016.
Further information can be found in the Directors Remuneration Report.
Indivior Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP In 2015, a share-based incentive plan was introduced for employees including Executive Directors of the Group.
An award under the LTIP can take the form of a zero-cost option, a market value option, or a conditional award.
The LTIP may comprise grants performance shares and or share options which vest subject to the achievement of stretching performance targets.
The LTIP has a performance period of at least three years and a minimum vesting period of three years.
From 2016 onwards, awards granted to the Executive Directors are subject to a further two-year post-vesting period.
The LTIP opportunity is reviewed annually with reference to market data and the associated cost to the Company, calculated using an expected-value methodology.
The performance condition is reviewed before each award cycle to ensure it remains appropriately stretching.
The fair values of awards granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plans are calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
The key assumptions in the simulation model are stock price of the Company, expected volatilities of the Company, risk-free rate, and dividend yield.
Other Employee Plans The Company operates an HMRC-approved SAYE plan for UK employees and US Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP for US employees.
The amounts recognized for these plans are not material for disclosure.
For all plans, the inputs to the option pricing models are reassessed for each grant.
The following assumptions were used in calculating the fair value of options granted.
Given the short trading history as of the valuation dates, we relied on a comparable set of guideline companies.
We calculated the expected volatility based on equal weighting of historical volatility and the implied volatility of guideline public companies.
This historical volatility was calculated based on a lookback period of three years.
The risk-free interest rate reflects the continuous risk-free yield based on the UK government interest rates as of the valuation date, based upon a maturity commensurate with the performance period.

Alvogen are no longer prevented from selling, offering to sell, or importing their generic buprenorphine naloxone sublingual film products.
On February 20, 2019, Indivior announced that it had launched an authorized generic version of SUBOXONE buprenorphine and naloxone Sublingual Film CIII in the U. S. It is possible that other generic manufacturers may also launch generic versions of SUBOXONE Film following Indiviors launch of this authorized generic.
Indivior reached a definitive agreement February 4, 2019 to divest rights related to SUBOXONE Sublingual Tablets Sai Bo Song in the Peoples Republic of China to Zhejiang Pukang Biotechnology Co. Ltd. Pukang for total potential consideration of up to $122.5m based on achieving certain milestones.
The agreement is subject to various closing conditions and is anticipated to close in Q4 2019.
During the year, the Group announced its intention to implement a program to streamline the Group and reduce certain costs.
This resulted in a further reduction in headcount of more than 120 employees in Q1 2019.
Incremental costs to effect the savings will be reflected as an exceptional cost in Q1 2019.
