Financial statements Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 30 September 2018 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation Shaftesbury PLC the Company is a public limited company which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
Theaddress of the registered office is given on page 109.
The Company is the ultimate parent company of the Shaftesbury PLC Group the Group.
The Company has not presented its own Statement of Comprehensive Income, as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
The Company made a profit of 73.5 million 2017: 57.7 million in the year.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRIC and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared in Pounds Sterling and under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of investment properties and derivative financial instruments.
Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors affecting performance, financial position and future development are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 61.
The financial position of the Group including cash flow, liquidity, borrowings, undrawn facilities and debt maturity analysis is set out on pages 54 to 56.
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least 12 months from the date these financial statements were approved.
Therefore, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Significant judgements, assumptions and key estimates The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the directors to make judgements and estimates about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, in applying the Group's accounting policies.
The judgements and estimates are based on historical experience and other relevant factors, including expectations of future events, and are reviewed on a continual basis.
Although the estimates are made using the directors' best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results may differ from the original estimates.
Significant area of estimation uncertainty The investment property portfolio is valued by independent third party valuers.
Cushman & Wakefield value the properties owned by the Group, and Knight Frank LLP value the properties owned by the Longmartin joint venture.
The valuation is inherently subjective due to, among other factors, the individual nature of each property, its location and the expected future rental income.
As a result, the valuations the Group places on its property portfolio are subject to a degree of uncertainty and are made on the basis of assumptions which may not prove to be accurate, particularly in periods of volatility or low transaction flow in the commercial property market.
Cushman & Wakefield and Knight Frank LLP make a number of assumptions in forming their opinion on the valuation of our investment properties, which are detailed in the Basis of Valuation on pages 142 to 143.
These assumptions are in accordance with the RICS Valuation - Global Standards.
However, if any assumptions made by the external valuers prove to be incorrect, this may mean that the value of the Group's properties differs from their valuation reported in the financial statements, which could have a material effect on the Group's financial position.
See note 8 for further information.
The directors did not make any significant judgements in the preparation of these financial statements.
New accounting standards and interpretations a The following amendment to an existing standard was relevant to the Group and mandatory for the first time for the financial year ended 30 September 2018.
It did not have an impact on the amounts reported in the financial statements, however it did require additional disclosures, as set out in note 15.
IAS 7 amendment - Statement of cash flows disclosure initiative b The following new standards and amendments to existing standards are relevant to the Group, are not yet effective in the year ended 30 September 2018 and are not expected to have a significant impact on the Groups financial statements: Annual Improvements 2014-2016 IFRS 2 amendment - Classification of share-based payment transactions IFRS 9 - Financial instruments IFRS 15 - Revenue from contracts with customers IFRS 16 - Leases IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments effective from 1 January 2018 This standard deals with, amongst other things, the classification and measurement of financial instruments.
Having carried out an assessment of the standard, the Group believes the main impact will be the measurement and presentation of trade receivables in the Group financial statements, and balances due from subsidiaries in the Company financial statements.
Having considered expected credit losses and sources of forward-looking data, we do not currently expect any impact will be material.
IFRS 15 - Revenue from contracts with customers effective from 1 January 2018 This standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognised when control passes to a customer.
In our case, the standard is most applicable to the recognition point for service charge income and disposals of investment properties.
As the standard excludes rental income, which falls within the scope of IFRS 16 - Leases, it is not expected that IFRS 15 will have a significant impact on the Groups financial statements.
There may be changes to presentation and disclosure.
Shaftesbury Annual Report 2018 122 4 4 4 Financial statements Financial statements Notes to the Notes to the financial financial statements statements continued continued 1 Accounting policies continued IFRS 16 Leases effective from 1 January 2019 For operating leases in excess of one year, this standard requires lessees to recognise a right-of-use asset and a related lease liability representing the obligation to make lease payments.
The right-of-use asset is assessed for impairment annually and is amortised on a straight-line basis.
The lease liability is amortised using the effective interest method.
Lessor accounting is substantially unchanged from current accounting.
Therefore, since the Group is primarily a lessor, this standard does not significantly impact the Groups financial statements.
However, for the Company, it will result in the recognition of a right-to-use asset and corresponding lease liability, which we estimate at approximately 3 million, in the year when the standard becomes effective.
c There are no other standards or interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company is exposed to variable returns and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.
The accounting policies of the subsidiaries are consistent with those adopted by the Group.
In the Companys Balance Sheet, investments in subsidiaries are included at cost less any provision in respect of impairment loss.
Net property income Revenue comprises rents receivable from tenants under operating leases, recognised on an accruals basis, and recoverable expenses incurred on behalf of tenants, where the Group acts as principal.
Rents are recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Value added tax is excluded from all amounts.
Income arising as a result of rent reviews is recognised when agreement of new terms is reasonably certain.
Premiums receivable from tenants to surrender their lease obligations are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The cost of any incentives given to lessees to enter into leases is spread on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable period of the lease, being the earlier of its expiry date or the date of the first break option.
Lease incentives are usually in the form of rent-free periods.
Irrecoverable property costs are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income when they arise.
Employee benefits Share option schemes The Company administers a long-term incentive plan LTIP and a sharesave scheme SAYE.
The cost of granting share options to employees under these schemes is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income based on the fair value at the date of grant.
The expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the number of options that are expected to vest.
The fair value of the long-term incentive plan is calculated using the modified binomial pricing model and the Monte Carlo simulation pricing model for the non-market based and market based conditions respectively.
At each reporting period, the non-market based condition is reassessed and the impact, if any, of a revision to original estimates is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The fair value of the sharesave scheme is calculated using a modified binomial pricing model.
Deferred share bonus scheme Under the Company's annual bonus scheme, employees have the option to take their annual bonus in either cash, or shares.
Where employees opt to take the bonus in cash, it is expensed to the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year in which it relates.
Where employees opt to take all, or part, of their bonus in shares, the Company offers a matching award of up to 50%, subject to continued employment throughout the performance period.
The cost of the matching award is recognised on a straight-line basis over the performance period.
The remaining expense is recognised in the year in which it relates.
Provisions for leavers during the performance period are set out on page 95.
Pension contributions Payments to defined contribution plans are charged as an expense to the Statement of Comprehensive Income as they fall due.
Investment properties Investment properties are initially recognised on acquisition at cost, including related acquisition costs, and are revalued annually to reflect fair value.
Fair value is determined either by external professional valuers or by the directors in the case of properties sold shortly after the period end.
The fair value, as determined by the valuers, is reduced for any unamortised lease incentive balances.
Gains or losses arising on the revaluation of investment properties are included in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Depreciation is not provided in respect of investment properties.
Shaftesbury Shaftesbury Annual Annual Report 2018 Report 2018 123 123 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued Additions to properties include costs of a capital nature only.
Expenditure is classified as capital when it results in future economic benefits which are expected to accrue to the Group.
All other property expenditure is written-off in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as incurred.
Premiums payable to tenants in connection with the surrender of their lease obligations are capitalised if they arise in connection with a value-enhancing project, otherwise they are recognised immediately in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Amounts received by way of compensation for dilapidations from tenants vacating properties are credited against the cost of reinstatement works.
Where the Group has no intention of carrying out such works, the amounts received are credited to the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Purchases and sales of investment properties are recognised in the financial statements when the significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred.
All of the Groups leases to its tenants are operating leases except where the Group grants long leasehold interests to tenants, in which case, as substantially allthe risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the tenant, the property is not recognised as an investment property.
Acquisitions Where properties are acquired through corporate acquisitions and there are no significant assets other than investment property and liabilities, and without a business being acquired, the acquisition is treated as an asset acquisition.
In all other cases, the acquisition is treated as a business combination.
Joint ventures Joint ventures are those entities over which the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
The Group has one joint venture, the investment in which is accounted for using the equity method.
On initial recognition the investment was recognised at cost.
Subsequently, the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the Groups share of the profit or loss of, and dividends from, the joint venture.
The Groups investment in the joint venture is presented separately on the Balance Sheet and the Groups share of the joint ventures post-tax profit or loss for the year is also presented separately in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Where there is an indication that the Groups investment in its joint venture may be impaired, the Group evaluates the recoverable amount of its investment, being the higher of the joint ventures fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
If the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
If the Groups share of losses in the joint venture equals or exceeds its investment in the joint venture, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has legal or constructive obligations to make payments on behalf of the joint venture.
In the Companys Balance Sheet, the investment in its joint venture is stated at cost less any provision for impairment loss.
Trade receivables and payables Trade receivables and trade payables are recognised at fair value and subsequently held at amortised cost, less any provision for impairment in respect of trade receivables.
Tenant lease incentives are included in current trade and other receivables when the amounts to be charged against rental income fall within one year of the Balance Sheet date.
Amounts which will be charged against rental income in more than one year are included in non-current assets.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and on-demand bank deposits.
Cash held on deposit which has certain conditions restricting its use and is not available on demand, liquid or readily convertible, is classified within other receivables.
Borrowings and costs of raising finance Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value net of transaction costs incurred and are subsequently held at amortised cost.
Issue costs and premiums are written-off to the Statement of Comprehensive Income using an effective interest rate method.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments, comprising interest rate swaps for hedging purposes, are measured at fair value.
Movements in fair value are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Segmental information IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be reported in a manner consistent with the internal financial reporting reviewed by the chief operating decision maker.
The chief operating decision maker of the Group is the Board.
The Board is responsible for reviewing the Groups internal reporting in order to assess performance.
The information reviewed by the Board is prepared on a basis consistent with these financial statements.
That is, the information is provided at a Group level and includes both the IFRS reported results and EPRA measures see page 140 for an explanation on the EPRA measures used in these financial statements.
The Groups properties are all located in Londons West End, and are all of a similar type.
The properties are typically mixed-use buildings with restaurants, leisure and retail on the lower floors and small offices and apartments on the upper floors.
As the properties share similar economic characteristics we consider them to be one operating segment.
As such, no further segmental information is presented.

The Group's wholly-owned portfolio is valued by Cushman & Wakefield, members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS.
All properties were valued on the basis of fair value and highest and best use, in accordance with IFRS 13 and the RICS Valuation - Global Standards, which incorporate the International Valuation Standards and the RICS UK Valuation Standards edition current at the valuation date.
When considering a propertys highest and best use, the valuer considers its actual and potential uses which are physically, legally and financially viable.
Where the highest and best use differs from the existing use, the valuer considers the use a market participant would have in mind when formulating the price it would bid and reflects the cost and likelihood of achieving that use.
The fair value of the Groups investment properties has primarily been determined using a market approach, which provides an indication of value by comparing the subject asset with similar assets for which price information is available.
The external valuer uses information provided by the Group, such as tenancy information and capital expenditure expectations.
In deriving fair value, the valuer also makes a series of assumptions, using professional judgement and market observations.
The key assumptions are the equivalent yields and estimated future rental income, ERVs, as set out in the Basis of Valuation on pages 142 to 143.
Equivalent yields are based on current market prices, depending on, inter alia, the location and use of the properties.
ERVs are calculated using a number of factors which include current rental income, market comparatives and occupancy levels.
Whilst there is market evidence for these inputs, and recent transaction prices for similar properties, there is still a significant element of estimation and judgement.
As a result of adjustments made to market observable data, these significant inputs are deemed unobservable.
Since the key inputs to the valuation are unobservable, the Group considers all its investment properties fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy in IFRS 13.
The Groups policy is to recognise transfers between hierarchy levels as at the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.
There have been no transfers during the year 2017: none.
The major inputs to the external valuation are reviewed by the senior management team.
In addition, the valuer meets with the external auditor and the Audit Committee.
Further details of the Audit Committees responsibilities in relation to valuations can be found in the Audit Committee Report on pages 82 to 85.
A summary of the Cushman & Wakefield report can be found on pages 144 to 145.
Fees were agreed at fixed amounts in advance of the valuations being carried out.
During the year, Cushman & Wakefield acted as letting agents for Shaftesbury Carnaby PLC and Shaftesbury Chinatown PLC, rent review surveyors for Shaftesbury CL Limited, and provided other advice to Shaftesbury PLC.
Non valuation fees represented 53% of total fees for the valuation of the Group's investment properties.
The fees payable by the Group to Cushman & Wakefield do not constitute a significant part of their fee income.
Sensitivity analysis As noted in the significant judgements, assumptions and key estimates section on page 122, the valuation of the Groups property portfolio is inherently subjective.
The Groups properties are all located in Londons West End and are virtually all multi-use buildings, usually configured with commercial uses on the lower floors and office and or residential uses on the upper floors.
Cushman & Wakefield value properties in their entirety and not by use.
Consequently, the sensitivity analysis below has been performed on the Groups portfolio as a whole.
Change in ERV Change in equivalent yields -5.0% -2.5% 2.5% 5.0% -0.50% -0.25% 0.25% 0.50% m m m m m m m m Increase decrease in the fair value of investment properties 172.5 88.7 83.1 170.4 682.8 308.9 270.8 501.1 These key unobservable inputs are inter-dependent.
All other factors being equal, a higher equivalent yield would lead to a decrease in the valuation of a property, and an increase in the ERV would increase the capital value, and vice versa.
At 30 September 2018, the Group had capital commitments of 58.7 million 2017 as restated: 52.6 million.
This included 39.0 million 2017 as restated: 39.0 million relating to the forward purchase of a long leasehold interest and 19.7 million 2017: 13.6 million relating to future capital expenditure for the enhancement of the Groups investment properties.
The 2017 figure has been restated to include amounts relating to the forward purchase of a long leasehold interest.

The Groups trade and other payables are all due within one year 2017: all due within one year.
Net financial instruments for the Company at 30 September 2017 have been restated to include cash and cash equivalents in the above table.
This has no impact on the net assets of the Company for that year.
Other financial instruments The Groups mortgage bonds and secured term loans are held at amortised cost in the Balance Sheet.
The fair value of these financial instruments is 955.2 million 2017: 975.9 million.
The difference between the fair value and the book value is not recognised in the reported results for the year.
The fair values have been calculated based on a discounted cash flow model using the relevant reference gilt and appropriate market spread.
The valuation technique falls within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy in IFRS 13.
The fair values of the Groups and Companys cash and cash equivalents, and those financial instruments included within trade and other receivables, interest bearing borrowings excluding the mortgage bonds and the secured term loans, and trade and other payables are not materially different from the values at which they are carried in the financial statements.

The disclosure below provides further detail regarding financial risk management.
Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on their contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group reviews the creditworthiness of potential tenants prior to entering into contractual arrangements.
The Group has a large and diverse tenant base so that tenant credit risk is widely spread.
Where appropriate, tenants are required to provide cash deposits to mitigate the potential loss in the event of default.
Tenant deposits are referred to in note 12.
Provision is made in full where recovery of financial assets is, in the opinion of the directors, uncertain.
The carrying amount of financial assets, net of provisions for impairment, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
Financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired are expected to be fully recoverable.
Where cash is deposited with banks or financial institutions, the Group considers the counterparty credit rating and places amounts with different banks or financial institutions to spread counterparty credit risk.
Deposits and liquidity requirements are reviewed on a weekly basis.
Shaftesbury Annual Report 2018 133 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 16 Financial instruments continued Liquidity risk The Board keeps under review the Groups funding requirements, available facilities and covenant compliance to ensure it has sufficient funds available to meet its existing commitments and to extend its portfolio through investment and acquisition of additional properties.
The Groups policies regarding finance and its current financial position are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 55 to 56.
Market risk Interest rate risk arises from the Groups use of interest bearing financial instruments, and is the risk that future cash flows from financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in interest rates and credit costs.
The Groups policy is to minimise interest rate risk through long-term fixed rate debt.
At 30 September 2018, the Groups drawn borrowings consisted entirely of fixed rate debt.
Given this, the Groups exposure to changes in long-term interest rates and the potential impact on the Groups results and financial position is considered to be insignificant.
The Board keeps under review the Groups interest rate risk, particularly in light of expectations of future interest rate movements.
Capital risk management The capital structure of the Group consists of equity and net borrowings, including cash held on deposit.
The type and maturity of the Groups borrowings is set out in note 15 and the Groups equity structure is set out in the Statement of Changes in Equity.
The Group regularly reviews its loan covenant compliance.
The Groups capital management objectives are to continue as a going concern and to provide enhanced shareholder returns whilst maintaining an appropriate risk reward balance to accommodate changing financial and operating market cycles.
The Groups capital structure such as levels of gearing and loan-to-value ratio are discussed in the Strategic Report on pages 55 to 56.
