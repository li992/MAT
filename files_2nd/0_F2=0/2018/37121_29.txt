John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2018 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2018 1 GENERAL INFORMATION The results of John Laing Group plc the Company or the Group are stated according to the basis of preparation described below.
The registered office of the Company is 1 Kingsway, London, WC2B 6AN.
The principal activity of the Company is the origination, investment in and management of international infrastructure projects.
2 ADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED STANDARDS New and amended IFRS that are effective for the current year In 2018, the Group adopted two new IFRS, together with a number of amendments to IFRS and Interpretations, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB that are effective for an annual period that begins on or after 1 January 2018 and have been endorsed for use within the EU.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRIC Interpretation 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Considerations Amendments to IAS 40 Transfers of Investment Property Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions Amendments to IFRS 4 Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts Amendments to IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures Clarification that measuring investees at fair value through profit or loss is an  choice Amendments arising from Annual Improvements to IFRS 2014 2016 Cycle Other than IFRS 9 and IFRS 15, the other amendments and interpretations do not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
The nature and effect of the changes as a result of the adoption of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 are described below.
Impact of initial application of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments The Group has applied IFRS 9 Financial Instruments in the current year in accordance with the transition provisions set out in the standard.
The transition provisions of IFRS 9 allow an entity not to restate comparative figures.
IFRS 9 primarily introduced new requirements for: 1 Classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, 2 Impairment of financial assets, and 3 Hedge accounting.
Details of these new requirements as well as their impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements are described below.
a Classification and measurement of financial assets All recognised financial assets that fall within the scope of IFRS 9 are required to be measured at fair value on initial recognition and subsequently at amortised cost or fair value on the basis of the entitys business model for managing such financial assets and their contractual cash flow characteristics.
The Groups principal financial asset is its investment in its directly-owned subsidiary, John Laing Holdco Limited, which is measured at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL.
The adoption of IFRS 9 has not impacted the classification and measurement of this investment.
Other financial assets other than cash and cash equivalents include trade receivables which were previously classified as loans and receivables under IAS 39 and held at amortised cost.
These continue to be measured at amortised cost under IFRS 9 as they are held within a business model to collect contractual cash flows which consist solely of payments of principal and any interest on the principal amount outstanding.
b Classification and measurement of financial liabilities A significant change introduced by IFRS 9 in the classification and measurement of financial liabilities relates to the accounting for changes in the fair value of a financial liability designated as held at FVTPL attributable to changes in the credit risk of the issuer.
The Group has no financial liabilities designated as at FVTPL and therefore the application of IFRS 9 has had no impact on the classification and measurement of the Groups financial liabilities.
105 Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Overview John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2018 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED for the year ended 31 December 2018 2 ADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED STANDARDS CONTINUED c Impairment of financial assets IFRS 9 requires an expected credit loss model as opposed to the incurred credit loss model under IAS 39.
The expected credit loss model requires the Group to account for expected credit losses and changes in those expected credit losses at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the financial assets.
In other words, it is no longer necessary for a credit event to have occurred before credit losses are recognised.
The Group does not have material financial assets other than its investment in John Laing Holdco Limited which is already held at FVTPL.
Trade and other receivables at 31 December 2018 were only 7.9 million, or 0.5% of the Groups net assets, and therefore any credit risk in relation to the impairment of trade and other receivables is considered to be immaterial.
Cash and cash equivalents in the Company and consolidated recourse subsidiaries at 31 December 2018 were only 5.7 million.
A further 133.9 million of cash balances at 31 December 2018 was held in recourse subsidiaries held at FVTPL and therefore included in investment at FVTPL in the Group Balance Sheet.
All bank balances are assessed to have low credit risk as they are held with reputable international banking institutions.
d Hedge accounting The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures but these instruments are held in recourse subsidiaries that are held at FVTPL rather than consolidated.
Regardless of this, hedge accounting is not applied to any of the derivatives.
e Impact of initial application of IFRS 9 The initial application of IFRS 9 has not resulted in any reclassification or change in the measurement of financial assets or financial liabilities.
Impact of initial application of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 supersedes IAS 11 Construction Contracts, IAS 18 Revenue and other related interpretations and applies, with limited exceptions, to all revenue arising from contracts with customers.
IFRS 15 establishes a five-step model to account for revenue arising from contracts with customers and requires that revenue be recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer.
IFRS 15 requires entities to exercise judgement when applying each step of the five-step model.
The standard also specifies the accounting treatment for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract and the costs directly related to fulfilling a contract.
In addition, the standard requires extensive disclosures.
The Groups accounting policies for its revenue streams are disclosed in note 3c below.
The Groups principal revenue stream is net gain on investments held at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL, which is accounted for under IFRS 9 Financial Instruments rather than IFRS 15.
Consequently the adoption of IFRS 15 has not impacted the accounting for this revenue stream.
The Groups other material revenue streams comprise fees from asset management services including fees for the management of Jura Infrastructure Limited Jura formerly JLIF and JLEN and fees for the management of projects in which the Group and other parties invest.
The Group also earns revenue from the recovery of bid costs, typically once the project for which the Group has bid reaches financial close.
These revenue streams have been assessed for a potential change in the recognition of revenue based on the five-step model under IFRS 15.
Fees for asset management services including fees for the management of Jura and JLEN include a single performance obligation, to deliver asset management services.
The transaction price for these services is fixed annually in advance.
Fees for the management of Jura and JLEN are based on a percentage of the value of each funds portfolio and consequently these fees constitute variable consideration.
The Group is able to ascertain with appropriate accuracy these fees such that it is highly probable that there will not be a material reversal in the amount of revenue recognised.
The fees for other asset management services are fixed annually in advance.
The Group recognises fees from asset management services over time as the services are delivered to the customer.
This is in line with the previous revenue recognition policy.
As regards recoveries of bid costs, these are recognised as revenue under IFRS 15 when there is a contract with the customer the project company, typically when the project reaches financial close.
This is the same as under the previous standard.
The adoption of IFRS 15 has therefore had no impact on the financial position and or financial performance of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2018 except that additional disclosures to comply with the standard have been made within these financial statements.
106 John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2018 2 ADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED STANDARDS CONTINUED New and amended IFRS standards in issue but not yet effective At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the Group has not applied the following new and revised standards that have been issued but are not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU: IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts Amendments to IFRS 9 Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation Amendments to IAS 28 Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures Annual Improvements to IFRS 2015 2017 Cycle: Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 23 Borrowing Costs Amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits: Plan Amendment, Curtailment and Settlement IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 amendments : Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the Standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group in future periods, except as noted below: IFRS 16 Leases Whilst IFRS 16 Leases is effective from periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, the Group has performed an early assessment of the impact of the changes in lease accounting as a result of adopting this new standard.
IFRS 16 will require the Group, as a lessee, to recognise all leases, apart from where exemptions may apply, as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities in its Group Balance Sheet.
This is in contrast to the previous accounting treatment of operating leases under IAS 17, where the cost of the operating leases was expensed in the Group Income Statement.
The Group is adopting the cumulative catch-up method for accounting for leases with effect from the date of transition, 1 January 2019.
This will involve measuring the right-of-use asset at an amount equal to the lease liability at the transition date.
Under this method, comparative amounts for the year ended 31 December 2018 will not be restated.
The Group will take advantage of the exemptions available under the new standards not to bring onto the balance sheet leases with a lease term of less than 12 months from the transition date and leases where the underlying asset is of low value.
An early assessment of all leases that the Group had at 31 December 2018 has shown that the net impact of recognising an asset and liability on the Group Balance Sheet is likely to be nil as at 31 December 2019.
It is estimated that an asset of 4.5 million and a liability of 4.5 million will be recognised as at 1 January 2019 transition date.
The impact on the Group Income Statement from recognising an interest expense on the lease liability and depreciation of the right-of-use asset for the year ending 31 December 2019 in contrast to the operating lease charge, which would have applied under IAS 17, is estimated at a net 0.1 million credit.
3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES a Basis of preparation The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and are presented in pounds sterling.
The Group financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the revaluation of the investment portfolio and other financial instruments that are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period.
The Company has concluded that it meets the definition of an investment entity as set out in IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, paragraph 27 on the following basis: i as an entity listed on the London Stock Exchange, the Company is owned by a number of investors: ii the Company holds a substantial portfolio of investments in project companies through its investment in John Laing Holdco Limited and intermediate holding companies.
The underlying projects have a finite life and the Company has an exit strategy for its investments which is either to hold them to maturity or, if appropriate, to divest them.
Investments in project companies take the form of equity and or subordinated debt: iii the Groups business model is to originate, invest in, and actively manage infrastructure assets.
It invests in PPP and renewable energy projects and aims to deliver predictable returns and consistent growth from its investment portfolio.
The underlying project companies have businesses and activities that the Group is not directly involved in.
The Groups returns from the provision of management services are small in comparison to the Groups overall investment-based returns: and iv the Group measures its investments in PPP and renewable energy projects on a fair value basis.
Information on the fair value of investments forms part of monthly management reports reviewed by the Groups Executive Committee, who are considered to be the Groups key management personnel, and by its Board of Directors.
107 Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Overview John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2018 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED for the year ended 31 December 2018 3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Although the Group has a net defined benefit pension liability, IFRS 10 does not exclude companies with non-investment related liabilities from qualifying as investment entities.
Investment entities are required to account for all investments in controlled entities, as well as investments in associates and joint ventures, at FVTPL, except for those directly-owned subsidiaries that provide investment related services or engage in permitted investment-related activities with investees Service Companies.
Service Companies are consolidated rather than recorded at FVTPL.
Project companies in which the Group invests are described as non-recourse, which means that providers of debt to such project companies do not have recourse to John Laing beyond its equity and or subordinated debt commitments in the underlying projects.
Subsidiaries through which the Company holds its investments in project companies, which are held at FVTPL, and subsidiaries that are Service Companies, which are consolidated, are described as recourse.
Unconsolidated project company subsidiaries are part of the non-recourse business.
Based on arrangements in place with those subsidiaries, the Group has concluded that there are no: a significant restrictions resulting from borrowing arrangements, regulatory requirements or contractual arrangements on the ability of an unconsolidated subsidiary to transfer funds to the Group in the form of cash dividends or to repay loans or advances made to the unconsolidated subsidiary by the Group: and b current commitments or intentions to provide financial or other support to an unconsolidated subsidiary, including commitments or intentions to assist the subsidiary in obtaining financial support, beyond the Groups original investment commitment.
Transactions and balances receivable or payable between recourse subsidiary entities held at fair value and those that are consolidated are eliminated in the Group financial statements.
Transactions and balances receivable or payable between non-recourse project companies held at fair value and recourse entities that are consolidated are not eliminated in the Group financial statements.
For details of the subsidiaries that are consolidated, see note 13 to the Company financial statements.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these Group financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been applied consistently to each of the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
b Going concern The Directors have reviewed the Groups financial projections and cash flow forecasts and believe, based on those projections and forecasts, that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements of the Group on the going concern basis.
In arriving at their conclusion, the Directors took into account the Groups approach to liquidity and cash flow management and the availability of its 500 million corporate banking facilities committed until July 2023, together with additional 150 million facilities committed until January 2021.
The Directors are of the opinion that, based on the Groups forecasts and projections and taking into account expected bidding activity and operational performance, the Group will be able to operate within its banking facilities and comply with the financial covenants therein for the foreseeable future.
In determining that the Group is a going concern, certain risks and uncertainties, some of which arise or increase as a result of the economic environment in some of the Groups markets, have been considered.
The Directors believe that the Group is adequately placed to manage these risks.
The most important risks and uncertainties identified and considered by the Directors are set out in the Principal Risks and Risk Management section.
In addition, the Groups policies for management of its exposure to financial risks, including foreign exchange, credit, price, liquidity, interest rate and capital risks are set out in note 18. c Revenue The key accounting policies for the Groups material revenue streams are as follows: i Dividend income Dividend income from investments at FVTPL is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established provided that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
ii Net gain on investments at FVTPL Net gain on investments at FVTPL excludes dividend income referred to above.
Please refer to accounting policy e i for further detail.
iii Revenue from contracts with customers Fees from asset management services Fees from asset management services comprise fees for the management of Jura and JLEN as well as certain projects in which the Group and other parties invest.
These fees are earned under contracts that have a single performance obligation which is to deliver asset management services to the customer.
Revenue is recognised in accordance with the contract to the extent the performance obligation is met which is considered to be over time as the asset management services are provided.
108 John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2018 3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Recovery of bid costs The recovery of costs incurred in respect of bidding for new primary investments is recognised when a contract to recover costs is entered into with either the entity procuring the project or the project company, typically at financial close.
This is the point at which the performance obligation has been met.
Revenue from contracts with customers excludes VAT and the value of intra-group transactions between recourse subsidiaries held at FVTPL and those that are consolidated.
d Dividend payments Dividends on the Companys ordinary shares are recognised when they have been appropriately authorised and are no longer at the Companys discretion.
Accordingly, interim dividends are recognised when they are paid and final dividends are recognised when they are declared following approval by shareholders at the Companys AGM.
Dividends are recognised as an appropriation of shareholders funds.
e Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value.
Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities other than financial assets and financial liabilities at FVTPL are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition.
Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at FVTPL are recognised immediately in profit or loss.
i Financial assets All recognised financial assets are measured subsequently in their entirety at either amortised cost or fair value, depending on the classification of the financial assets.
Classification of financial assets Financial assets that meet the following conditions are measured subsequently at amortised cost: the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows: and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
Financial assets that meet the following conditions are measured subsequently at fair value through other comprehensive income FVTOCI : the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets: and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
By default, all other financial assets are measured subsequently at FVTPL.
The financial assets that the Group holds are classified as follows: Investments at FVTPL are measured subsequently at FVTPL.
Investments at FVTPL comprise the Groups investment in John Laing Holdco Limited through which the Group indirectly holds its investments in projects which is valued based on the fair value of investments in project companies, the Groups investment in JLEN and other assets and liabilities of investment entity subsidiaries.
Investments in project companies and in JLEN are designated upon initial recognition as financial assets at FVTPL.
Subsequent to initial recognition, investments in project companies are measured on a combined basis at fair value principally using discounted cash flow methodology.
The investment in JLEN is valued at the quoted market price at the end of the period.
The Directors consider that the carrying value of other assets and liabilities held in investment entity subsidiaries approximates to their fair value, with the exception of derivatives which are measured in accordance with accounting policy e v. Changes in the fair value of the Groups investment in John Laing Holdco Limited are recognised within operating income in the Group Income Statement.
Trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents are measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
109 Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Overview John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2018 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED for the year ended 31 December 2018 3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a debt instrument and of allocating interest income over the relevant period.
The amortised cost of a financial asset is the amount at which the financial asset is measured at initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount, adjusted for any loss allowance.
The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is the amortised cost of a financial asset before adjusting for any loss allowance.
Interest income is recognised in profit or loss and is netted off within finance costs on corporate banking facilities in the finance costs line item see note 11.
Cash and cash equivalents in the Group Balance Sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with original maturities of three months or less.
For the purposes of the Group Cash Flow Statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short-term deposits as defined above, net of bank overdrafts, where there is a right to offset against corresponding cash balances.
Deposits held with original maturities of greater than three months are shown as other financial assets.
ii Impairment of financial assets The Group recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses on trade and other receivables.
The amount of expected credit losses is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the respective financial instrument.
The Groups trade and other receivables at 31 December 2018 were only 7.9 million, or 0.5% of the Groups net assets, and therefore any credit risk in relation to the impairment of trade and other receivables is considered to be immaterial.
iii Derecognition of financial assets The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity.
If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay.
If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
On derecognition of a financial asset measured at amortised cost, the difference between the assets carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable is recognised in profit or loss.
iv Financial liabilities and equity Classification as debt or equity Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.
Equity instruments An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Repurchase of the Companys own equity instruments is recognised and deducted directly in equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Companys own equity instruments.
Financial liabilities All financial liabilities are measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method or at FVTPL.
The Groups financial liabilities, which comprise interest-bearing loans and borrowings and trade and other payables, are all measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments including all fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts through the expected life of the financial liability, or where appropriate a shorter period, to the amortised cost of a financial liability.
Interest-bearing bank loans and borrowings are initially recorded at fair value, being the proceeds received net of direct issue costs, and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption, and direct issue costs are accounted for on an accruals basis in the Group Income Statement and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
110 John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2018 3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Groups obligations are discharged, cancelled or have expired.
The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised and the consideration paid and payable is recognised in profit or loss.
v Derivative financial instruments The Group treats forward foreign exchange contracts and currency swap deals it enters into as derivative financial instruments at FVTPL.
All the Groups derivative financial instruments are held by subsidiaries which are recorded at FVTPL and consequently the fair value of derivatives is incorporated into investments held at FVTPL.
The Group does not apply hedge accounting to its derivative financial instruments.
f Provisions Provisions are recognised when: the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events: it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation: and the amount has been reliably estimated.
Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required on settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole.
g Finance costs Finance costs relating to the corporate banking facilities, other than set-up costs, are recognised in the year in which they are incurred.
Set-up costs are recognised on a straight-line basis over the remaining facility term.
Finance costs also include the net interest cost on retirement benefit obligations and the unwinding of discounting of provisions.
h Taxation The tax charge or credit represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax Current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Group Income Statement because it excludes both items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible, which includes the fair value movement on the investment in John Laing Holdco Limited.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax Deferred tax liabilities are recognised in full for taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will arise to allow all or part of the assets to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the Group Income Statement except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
i Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group subsidiary that is consolidated i. e. a Service Company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
For the purposes of the financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group subsidiary that is consolidated are expressed in pounds sterling, the functional currency of the Company and the presentation currency of the financial statements.
Monetary assets and liabilities expressed in foreign currency including investments measured at fair value are reported at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date or, if appropriate, at the forward contract rate.
Any difference arising on the retranslation of these amounts is taken to the Group Income Statement with foreign exchange movements on investments measured at fair value recognised in operating income as part of net gain on investments at FVTPL.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
111 Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Overview John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2018 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED for the year ended 31 December 2018 3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED j Retirement benefit costs The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution pension arrangements.
Its two defined benefit pension schemes are the John Laing Pension Fund JLPF and the John Laing Pension Plan, which are both closed to future accrual.
The Group also provides post-retirement medical benefits to certain former employees.
Payments to defined contribution pension arrangements are charged as an expense as they fall due.
For the defined benefit pension schemes and the post-retirement medical benefit scheme, the cost of providing benefits is determined in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits revised using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at least every three years.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the year in which they occur and are presented in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Curtailment gains arising from changes to members benefits are recognised in full in the Group Income Statement.
The GMP equalisation charge for 2018 has been presented separately in the Group Income Statement as it was deemed to be a material amount in the context of total administrative expenses.
The retirement benefit obligations recognised in the Group Balance Sheet represent the present value of: i defined benefit scheme obligations as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets, where any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service costs plus the present value of available refunds: and ii unfunded post-retirement medical benefits.
Net interest expense or income is recognised within finance costs.
k Leasing All leases are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Effective from 1 January 2019, the Group is applying the new leasing standard, IFRS 16 Leases.
The effect of applying this new standard and adopting the new accounting policy is described in note 2 above.
l Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity instruments on the basis that they evidence a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all its liabilities.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares are recognised in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds in the period in which the shares are issued.
m Employee benefit trust In June 2015, the Group established the John Laing Group Employee Benefit Trust EBT as described further in note 7.
The Group is deemed to have control of the EBT and it is therefore treated as a subsidiary and consolidated for the purposes of the accounts.
Any investment by the EBT in the Companys shares is deducted from equity in the Group Balance Sheet as if such shares were treasury shares as defined by IFRS.
Other assets and liabilities of the EBT are recognised as assets and liabilities of the Group.
Any shares held by the EBT are excluded for the purposes of calculating earnings per share.
4 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY In the application of the Groups accounting policies, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying value of assets and liabilities.
The key areas of the financial statements where the Group is required to make critical judgements and material accounting estimates which are those estimates where there is a risk of material adjustment in the next reporting period are in respect of the fair value of investments and accounting for the Groups defined benefit pension liabilities.
Fair value of investments Critical accounting judgements in applying the Groups accounting policies The Company measures its investment in John Laing Holdco Limited at fair value.
Fair value is determined based on the fair value of investments in project companies and the Groups investment in JLEN together the Groups investment portfolio and other assets and liabilities of investment entity subsidiaries.
A full valuation of the Groups investment portfolio is prepared on a consistent, principally discounted cash flow basis, at 30 June and 31 December.
The key inputs, therefore, to the valuation of each investment are i the discount rate: and ii the cash flows forecast to be received from such investment.
Under the Groups valuation methodology, a base case discount rate for an operational project is derived from secondary market information and other available data points.
The base case discount rate is then adjusted to reflect additional project-specific risks.
In addition, a risk premium is added to reflect the additional risk during the construction phase.
The construction risk premium reduces over time as the project progresses through its construction programme, reflecting the significant reduction in risk once the project reaches the operational stage.
The valuation excluding the investment in JLEN assumes that forecast cash flows are received until maturity of the underlying assets.
The cash flows on which the discounted cash flow valuation is based are those forecast to be distributable to the Group at each balance sheet date, derived from detailed project financial models.
112 John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2018 4 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY CONTINUED These incorporate a number of assumptions with respect to individual assets, including: dates for construction completion: value enhancements: the terms of project debt refinancing where applicable : the outcome of any disputes: the level of volume-based revenue: future rates of inflation and, for renewable energy projects, energy yield and future energy prices.
Value enhancements are only incorporated when the Group has sufficient evidence that they can be realised.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty A key source of estimation uncertainty in valuing the investment portfolio is the discount rate applied to forecast project cash flows.
A base case discount rate for an operational project is derived from secondary market information and other available data points.
The base case discount rate is then adjusted to reflect project-specific risks.
In addition, a risk premium is added during the construction phase to reflect the additional risks throughout construction.
This premium reduces over time as the project progresses through its construction programme, reflecting the significant reduction in risk once the project reaches the operational stage.
The discount rates applied to investments at 31 December 2018 were in the range of 6.8% to 11.7% 31 December 2017 6.8% to 11.8%.
Note 18 provides details of the weighted average discount rate applied to the investment portfolio as a whole and sensitivities to the investment portfolio value from changes in discount rates.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty present in the forecast cash flows to be received from investments are the forecasts of future energy prices on renewable energy projects and forecasts for long-term inflation.
Note 18 provides details of the sensitivities to the investment portfolio value from changes in forecast energy prices and forecast long-term inflation.
The Group does not consider the other factors that affect cash flows, as described in the critical accounting judgements in applying the Groups accounting policies above, to be key sources of estimation uncertainty.
They are based either on reliable data or the Groups experience and individually not considered likely to deviate materially year on year.
Pension and other post-retirement liability accounting Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policies The combined accounting deficit in the Groups defined benefit pension and post-retirement medical schemes at 31 December 2018 was 40.1 million 31 December 2017 40.3 million.
In determining the Groups defined benefit pension liability, consideration is also given to whether there is a minimum funding requirement under IFRIC 14 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction which is in excess of the IAS 19 Employee Benefits liability.
If the minimum funding requirement was higher, an additional liability would need to be recognised.
Under the trust deed and rules of JLPF, the Group has an ultimate unconditional right to any surplus, accordingly the excess of the minimum funding requirement over the IAS 19 Employee Benefits liability has not been recognised as an additional liability.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty The value of the pension deficit is highly dependent on key assumptions including price inflation, discount rate and life expectancy.
The assumptions applied at 31 December 2018 and the sensitivity of the pension liabilities to certain changes in these assumptions are illustrated in note 20.
Brexit While the outcome is uncertain, the Group has considered the potential impact of Brexit on the Groups results.
The most likely impact would come from any resulting macroeconomic changes, including changes in interest rates, which could impact discount rates in relation to both the Groups investment portfolio and its retirement benefit obligations, inflation and sterling exchange rates.
The above sections on key sources of estimation uncertainty provide more details on these areas.

Since 1 January 2018, the Groups Asset Management segment has not charged an internal fee to the Primary Investment and Secondary Investment segments.
Therefore the segmental results for the year ended 31 December 2017 as originally reported in the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts have been restated above to exclude this internal fee in order to make the results in both years comparable.
The effect of the restatement is shown below: Year ended 31 December 2017 As previously reported Adjustment Restated million million million Primary Investment administrative expenses 37.9 13.5 24.4 Secondary Investment administrative expenses 8.2 3.8 4.4 Asset Management other income 42.4 17.3 25.1 For the year ended 31 December 2018, the Group had two investments 2017 three investments from which it received more than 10% of its operating income.
The operating income from the two investments was 184.1 million all of which was reported within the Primary Investment sector.
The Group treats each investment in a project company as a separate customer for the purpose of IFRS 8.
The Groups investment portfolio, comprising investments in project companies and a listed fund included within investments at FVTPL see note 13 is allocated between primary and secondary investments.
The Primary Investment portfolio includes investments in projects which are in the construction phase.

In January 2018, the Group initiated an internal reorganisation under which the Primary Investment and Asset Management teams in each of the three core geographical regions now report to a single regional head.
The principal objective behind this revised structure was to enable the Group to focus more effectively on value creation in each region.
Accordingly, certain regional performance targets for 2018 were set, principally in relation to the investment portfolio in each region and including movement in fair value.
Additional analysis, based on the regional reorganisation, is presented below showing net gain on investments at FVTPL and portfolio valuation by region.
In the light of this internal reorganisation and greater focus on regional value creation, from January 2019 the information reported internally, including to the Groups Board, is now based on the Groups core geographical regions.
Accordingly, the Groups reportable segments under IFRS 8 have changed and this will be reflected in the June 2019 interim report.

Level 1 and Level 3 investments are fair valued in accordance with the policy and assumptions set out in note 3e.
The investments at FVTPL include other assets and liabilities in investment entity subsidiaries as shown in note 13.
Such other assets and liabilities are recorded at amortised cost that the Directors believe approximates to their fair value.
The tables above provide an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to their initial recognition at fair value.
Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs to the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
There have been no transfers of financial instruments between levels of the fair value hierarchy.
There are no non-recurring fair value measurements.
Reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurement of financial assets and liabilities An analysis of the movement between opening and closing balances of assets at FVTPL is given in note 13.
Level 3 financial assets are those relating to investments in project companies.
All items in the above table are measured at amortised cost other than the investments at FVTPL.
The Directors believe that the amortised cost of these financial assets and liabilities approximates to their fair value.

The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
For the parent company and its recourse subsidiaries, financial risks are managed by a central treasury operation which operates within Board approved policies.
The various types of financial risk are managed as follows: Market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk As at 31 December 2018 the Group held investments in 42 overseas projects 31 December 2017 31 overseas projects all of which are fair valued based on the spot exchange rate at 31 December 2018.
The Groups foreign currency exchange rate risk policy is to determine the total Group exposure to individual currencies: it may then enter into hedges against certain individual investments.
The Groups exposure to exchange rate risk on its investments is disclosed below.
In addition, the Groups policy on managing foreign currency exchange rate risk is to cover significant transactional exposures arising from receipts and payments in foreign currencies, where appropriate and cost effective.
There were 12 forward currency contracts open as at 31 December 2018 31 December 2017 eight.
The fair value of these contracts was a net asset of 0.5 million 31 December 2017 net asset of 1.3 million and is included in investments at FVTPL.
At 31 December 2018, the Groups most significant currency exposure was to the US dollar 31 December 2017 US dollar.

As at 31 December 2018, a 5% movement of each relevant currency against Sterling would decrease or increase the value of investments in overseas projects by c. 59.4 million.
The Groups profit before tax would be impacted by the same amounts.
There would be no additional impact on equity.
125 Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Overview John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2018 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED for the year ended 31 December 2018 18 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Market risk interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk arises due to fluctuations in interest rates which impact on the value of returns from floating rate deposits and expose the Group to variability in interest payment cash flows on variable rate borrowings.
The Group has assessed its exposure to interest rate risk and considers that this exposure is low as its variable rate borrowings tend to be short term, its finance costs in relation to letters of credit issued under the corporate banking facilities are at a fixed rate and the interest earned on its cash and cash equivalents minimal.
The exposure of the Groups financial assets to interest rate risk is as follows: 31 December 2018 31 December 2017  Non-interest bearing Non-interest floating rate bearing Total floating rate bearing Total million million million million million million Financial assets Investments at FVTPL 1,700.5 1,700.5 1,346.4 1,346.4 Trade and other receivables 7.0 7.0 6.9 6.9 Cash and cash equivalents 1.3 4.4 5.7 0.5 2.0 2.5 Financial assets exposed to interest rate risk 1.3 1,711.9 1,713.2 0.5 1,355.3 1,355.8 An analysis of the movement between opening and closing balances of investments at FVTPL is given in note 13.
Investments in project companies are principally valued on a discounted cash flow basis.
At 31 December 2018, the weighted average discount rate was 8.6% 31 December 2017 8.8%.
For investments in project companies, changing the discount rate used to value the underlying instruments would alter their fair value.
As at 31 December 2018, a 0.25% increase in the discount rate would reduce the fair value by 35.1 million 31 December 2017 40.7 million and a 0.25% reduction in the discount rate would increase the fair value by 37.0 million 31 December 2017 42.6 million.
The exposure of the Groups financial liabilities to interest rate risk is as follows: 31 December 2018 31 December 2017  bearing Non-interest bearing Non-interest fixed rate floating rate bearing Total fixed rate bearing Total million million million million million million million Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 51.2 14.5 65.7 173.2 173.2 Trade and other payables 18.6 18.6 16.5 16.5 Total financial liabilities 51.2 14.5 18.6 84.3 173.2 16.5 189.7 Market risk inflation risk The Group has limited direct exposure to inflation risk, but the fair value of investments is determined by future project revenue and costs which can be partly linked to inflation.
Sensitivity to inflation can be mitigated by the project company entering into inflation swaps.
Where PPP investments are positively correlated to inflation, an increase in inflation expectations will tend to increase their value.
However, all other things being equal, an increase in inflation expectations would also tend to increase JLPFs pension liabilities.
Based on a sample of five of the larger PPP investments by value at 31 December 2018, a 0.25% increase in inflation is estimated to increase the value of PPP investments by c. 14 million and a 0.25% decrease in inflation is estimated to decrease the value of PPP investment by c. 13 million.
Certain of the underlying project companies incorporate some inflation hedging.
Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a Group basis and arises from a combination of the value and term to settlement of balances due and payable by counterparties for both financial and trade transactions.
In order to minimise credit risk, cash investments and derivative transactions are limited to financial institutions of a suitable credit quality and counterparties are carefully screened.
The Groups cash balances are invested in line with a policy approved by the Board, capped with regard to counterparty credit ratings.
A significant number of the project companies in which the Group invests receive revenue from government departments, public sector or local authority clients and or directly from the public.
As a result, these projects tend not to be exposed to significant credit risk.
126 John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2018 18 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Price risk The Groups investments in PPP assets have limited direct exposure to price risk.
The fair value of many such project companies is dependent on the receipt of fixed fee income from government departments, public sector or local authority clients.
As a result, these projects tend not to be exposed to price risk.
The Group also holds investments in renewable energy projects whose fair value may vary with forecast energy prices to the extent they are not economically hedged through short to medium-term fixed price purchase agreements with electricity suppliers, or do not benefit from governmental support mechanisms at fixed prices.
At 31 December 2018, based on a sample of seven of the larger renewable energy investments by value, a 5% increase in power price forecasts is estimated to increase the value of renewable energy investments by 17.6 million and a 5% decrease in power price forecasts is estimated to decrease the value of renewable energy investments by 17.7 million.
The Groups investment in JLEN is valued at its closing market share price at 31 December 2018.
Liquidity risk The Group adopts a prudent approach to liquidity management by maintaining sufficient cash and available committed facilities to meet its current and upcoming obligations.
The Groups liquidity management policy involves projecting cash flows in major currencies and assessing the level of liquid assets necessary to meet these.
Maturity of financial assets The maturity profile of the Groups financial assets excluding investments at FVTPL is as follows: 31 December 31 December 2018 2017 Less than Less than one year one year million million Trade and other receivables 7.0 6.9 Cash and cash equivalents 5.7 2.5 Financial assets excluding investments at FVTPL 12.7 9.4 Other than certain trade and other receivables, as detailed in note 14, none of the financial assets is either overdue or impaired.

Capital risk The Group seeks to adopt efficient financing structures that enable it to manage capital effectively and achieve the Groups objectives without putting shareholder value at undue risk.
The Groups capital structure comprises its equity as set out in the Group Statement of Changes in Equity and its net borrowings.
The Group monitors its net debt and a reconciliation of net debt can be found in note 25.
At 31 December 2018, the Group had committed corporate banking facilities of 650.0 million, 500 million expiring in July 2023 and 150 million expiring in January 2020 extended in January 2019 until January 2021.
The Group has requirements for both borrowings and letters of credit, which at 31 December 2018 were met by its 650.0 million committed facilities and related ancillary facilities 31 December 2017 525.0 million.
Issued at 31 December 2018 were letters of credit of 163.9 million 31 December 2017 202.3 million, related to future capital and loan commitments, and contingent commitments and performance and bid bonds of 10.4 million 31 December 2017 7.5 million.

JLPF was closed to future accrual from 1 April 2011 and the Plan was closed to future accrual from September 2003.
Neither Scheme has any active members, only deferred members and pensioners.
The assets of both Schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds.
UK staff employed since 1 January 2002, who are entitled to retirement benefits, can choose to be members of a defined contribution stakeholder scheme sponsored by the Group in conjunction with Legal and General Assurance Society Limited.
Local defined contribution arrangements are available to overseas staff.
JLPF An actuarial valuation of JLPF was carried out as at 31 March 2016 by a qualified independent actuary, Willis Towers Watson.
At that date, JLPF was 85% funded on the technical provision funding basis.
This valuation took into account the Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau CMI Bureau projections of mortality.
The Group agreed to repay the actuarial deficit of 171.0 million at 31 March 2016 over seven years as follows: By 31 March million 2017 24.5 2018 26.5 2019 29.1 2020 24.9 2021 25.7 2022 26.4 2023 24.6 The next triennial actuarial valuation of JLPF is due as at 31 March 2019.
During the year ended 31 December 2018, John Laing made deficit reduction contributions of 26.5 million 2017 24.5 million in cash.
The liability at 31 December 2018 allows for indexation of deferred pensions and post 5 April 1988 GMP pension increases based on the Consumer Price Index CPI.
The Plan No contributions were made to the Plan in the year ended 31 December 2018 2017 none.
At its last actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2017, the Plan had assets of 13.1 million and liabilities of 12.0 million resulting in an actuarial surplus of 1.1 million.
The next triennial actuarial valuation of the Plan is due as at 31 March 2020.

Derivatives can be classified as Level 2 instruments and property as Level 3 instruments.
It is the policy of JLPF to use inflation swaps to hedge its exposure to inflation risk.
The JLPF Trustee invests in return-seeking assets, such as equity and property, whilst balancing the risks of inflation and interest rate movements through the annuity buy-in agreement, inflation swaps and interest rate hedging.
A significant proportion of JLPFs assets are held either as liability-matching holdings including an Aviva bulk annuity buy-in agreement and index-linked UK government gilts or to provide hedges against the impact on liabilities from movements in interest rates and inflation other bonds and gilts.
The JLPF Trustee has adopted a long-term asset allocation strategy that has been determined as being most appropriate to meet JLPFs current and future liabilities.
JLPFs agreed investment strategy is such that, in combination with an agreed recovery plan, it is expected to reach full funding on a gilts flat basis between 2023 and 2028 the Journey Plan.
The Trustee has established a fide-risking programme, whereby JLPFs funding level is monitored regularly, and if it moves ahead of the Journey Plan, the Trustee will lock-in the benefit by fide-risking the portfolio to target a lower expected return.
During 2018, as part of this fide-risking programme, approximately 23.9 million of equity instruments were sold and re-invested in liability matching assets.
The net loss on the returns from equity instruments during 2018 was c. 30 million.
In late 2008, the JLPF Trustee entered into a bulk annuity buy-in agreement with Aviva to mitigate JLPFs exposure to changes in liabilities.
At 31 December 2018, the underlying insurance policy was valued at 218.0 million 31 December 2017 231.0 million, being substantially equal to the IAS 19 valuation of the related liabilities.
The pension liability of 32.6 million at 31 December 2018 31 December 2017 32.3 million is net of a surplus under IAS 19 of 1.9 million in the Plan 31 December 2017 2.9 million.
