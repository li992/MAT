194 S Str tra at teg egic ic r re ep po or rt t G Gove over rn na an nc ce e A Acc cco ou un nt ts s Other information Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2018 OTHER INFORMATION continued NON-IFRS FINANCIAL INFORMATION ADJUSTED MEASURES These Financial Statements include financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
These measures, which include trading profit, trading profit margin, tax rate on trading results, EPSA, ROIC, trading cash flow, free cash flow, trading profit to trading cash conversion ratio, net debt to adjusted EBITDA, and underlying growth, exclude the effect of certain cash and non-cash items that Group management believes are not related to the underlying performance of the Group.
These non-IFRS financial measures are also used by management to make operating decisions because they facilitate internal comparisons of performance to historical results.
Non-IFRS financial measures are presented in these Financial Statements as the Groups management believe that they provide investors with a means of evaluating performance of the business segment and the consolidated Group on a consistent basis, similar to the way in which the Groups management evaluates performance, that is not otherwise apparent on an IFRS basis, given that certain non-recurring, infrequent, noncash and other items that management does not otherwise believe are indicative of the underlying performance of the consolidated Group may not be excluded when preparing financial measures under IFRS.
These non-IFRS measures should not be considered in isolation from, as substitutes for, or superior to financial measures prepared in accordance with IFRS.
Underlying revenue growth Underlying growth in revenue is used to compare the revenue in a given year to the previous year on a like-for-like basis.
This is achieved by adjusting for the impact of sales of products acquired in material business combinations or disposed of and for movements in exchange rates.
Underlying growth in revenue is considered by the Group to be an important measure of performance in terms of local functional currency since it excludes those items considered to be outside the influence of local management.
The Groups management uses this non-IFRS measure in its internal financial reporting, budgeting and planning to assess performance on both a business and a consolidated Group basis.
Revenue growth atconstant currency is important in measuring business performance compared to competitors and compared to the growth ofthemarket itself.
The Group considers that revenue from sales of products acquired in material business combinations results in a step-up in growth in revenue in the year of acquisition that cannot be wholly attributed to local managements efforts with respect to the business in the year of acquisition.
Depending on the timing of the acquisition, there will usually be a further step change in the following year.
A measure of growth excluding the effects of business combinations also allows senior management to evaluate the performance and relative impact of growth from the existing business and growth from acquisitions.
The process of making business acquisitions is directed, approved and funded from the Group corporate centre in line with strategic objectives.
The material limitation of the underlying growth in revenue measure isthat it excludes certain factors, described above, which ultimately have a significant impact on total revenues.
The Group compensates for this limitation by taking into account relative movements in exchange rates in its investment, strategic planning and resource allocation.
In addition, as the evaluation and assessment of business acquisitions is not within the control of local management, performance of acquisitions is monitored centrally until the business is integrated.
The Groups management considers that the non-IFRS measure of underlying growth in revenue and the IFRS measure of growth in revenue are complementary measures, neither of which management uses exclusively.
Underlying growth in revenue reconciles to growth in revenue reported, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS by making two adjustments, the constant currency exchange effect and the acquisitions and disposals effect, described below.
The constant currency exchange effect is a measure of the increase decrease in revenue resulting from currency movements on non-US Dollar sales and is measured as the difference between: 1 the increase decrease in the current year revenue translated into US Dollars at the current year average exchange rate and the prior revenue translated at the prior year rate: and 2 the increase decrease being measured by translating current and prior year revenues into US Dollars using the prior year closing rate.
The acquisitions and disposals effect is the measure of the impact on revenue from newly acquired material business combinations and recent material business disposals.
This is calculated by comparing the current year, constant currency actual revenue which include acquisitions and exclude disposals from the relevant date of completion with prior year, constant currency actual revenue, adjusted to include the results of acquisitions and exclude disposals for the commensurate period in the prior year.
These sales are separately tracked in the Groups internal reporting systems and are readily identifiable.

The adjustments made exclude the impact of specific transactions that management considers affect the Groups short-term profitability and cash flows.
The Group has identified the following items, where material, as those to be excluded from operating profit and cash generated from operations when arriving at trading profit and trading cash flow, respectively: acquisition and disposal related items arising in connection with business combinations, including amortisation of acquisition intangible assets, impairments and integration costs: restructuring events: gains and losses resulting from legal disputes and uninsured losses.
In addition to these items, gains and losses that materially impact the Groups profitability or cash flows on a short-term or one-off basis are excluded from operating profit and cash generated from operations when arriving at trading profit and trading cash flow.
The cash contribution to fund defined benefit pension schemes that are closed to future accrual are also excluded from cash generated from operations when arriving at trading cash flow.

The Group presents this measure to assist investors in their understanding of trends.
Adjusted attributable profit is the numerator used for this measure and is determined by adjusting attributable profit for the items that are excluded from operating profit when arriving at trading profit and items that are recognised below operating profit that affect the Groups short-term profitability.
The most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS is basic earnings per ordinary share EPS.

Cost of goods sold decreased by $24m from $1,272m to $1,248m in 2017 primarily due to underlying efficiencies.
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $6m from $2,366m to $2,360m.
In 2017, administrative expenses included amortisation of software and other intangible assets of $62m 2016: $61m, nil restructuring and rationalisation expenses 2016: $62m, an amount of $140m relating to amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles 2016: $178m, $10m credit for acquisition and disposal related items 2016: $9m charge and $16m net credit for legal and other items 2016: $30m credit.
Excluding the above items, selling, general and administrative expenses were $2,184m in 2017, an increase of $98m from $2,086m in 2016.
Research and development expenditure as a percentage of revenue remained broadly consistent at 4.7% in 2017 2016: 4.9%.
Expenditure was $223m in 2017 compared to $230m in 2016.
Operating profit increased by $133m from $801m to $934m in 2017.
The year-on-year increase in operating profit primarily reflects a gain of $54m from the settlement of an intellectual property matter, no restructuring charges and lower amortisation and impairment of acquisition intangibles in 2017.
The taxation charge decreased by $166m from $278m to $112m in 2017.
The reported tax rate was lower at 12.7% 2016: 26.2% due to the $32m net benefit in 2017 from US tax reform and the tax impact of the Gynaecology disposal in 2016.
COMMENTARY ON THE GROUP BALANCE SHEET AS AT 31 DECEMBER 2017 Non-current assets increased by $320m from $4,815m to $5,135m in 2017.
This is principally attributable to the following: Property, plant and equipment increased by $67m from $982m to $1,049m in 2017.
There were $308m of additions, $1m acquired with the Rotation Medical acquisition and favourable currency movements of $34m.
This was partially offset by depreciation of $243m and $33m of assets disposed.
Goodwill increased by $183m from $2,188m to $2,371m in 2017 due to additions of $132m from the acquisition of Rotation Medical and favourable currency movements of $51m.
Intangible assets decreased by $40m from $1,411m to $1,371m in 2017.
Amortisation and impairment during 2017 was $202m and this was partially offset by net additions of $70m, $61m from the acquisition of Rotation Medical and favourable currency movements of $31m.
Retirement benefit assets of $62m 2016: nil for UK and US retirement schemes due to changes in actuarial assumptions and contributions made during 2017.
Deferred tax assets increased by $30m in the year from $97m in 2016 to $127m in 2017 due to changes primarily in deferred tax on inventory provisions.
Current assets increased by $202m from $2,529m to $2,731m in 2017.
This is principally attributable to the following: Inventories rose by $60m to $1,304m in 2017 from $1,244m in 2016 primarily due to favourable currency movements of $62m.
The level of trade and other receivables increased by $73m to $1,258m in 2016 from $1,185m in 2016.
The movement primarily relates to increased net trade receivables of $68m including favourable currency movements of $44m.
Cash at bank has increased by $69m from $100m in 2016 to $169m in 2017 due to the timing of a receipt for the settlement of patent litigation in 2017.
Current liabilities decreased by $2m from $1,348m in 2016 to $1,346m in 2017 primarily due to a $59m decrease in bank overdrafts to $27m and a $18m decrease in provisions to $129m.
These movements were partially offset by a $73m increase in trade and other payables to $957m primarily due to $47m currency movements and $28m timing difference on the payment of expenses associated with a patent litigation gain.
Non-current liabilities decreased by $162m from $2,038m to $1,876m in 2017.
This is principally attributable to the following: Long term borrowings decreased by $141m from $1,564m in 2016 to $1,423m in 2017 due to repayments made in 2017.
Retirement benefit obligations decreased $33m from $164m in 2016 to $131m in 2017 due to changes in actuarial assumptions.
Trade and other payables were $46m higher at $128m in 2017 from $82m in 2016 primarily due to movements in deferred and contingent consideration for acquisitions.
Provisions decreased by $37m from $134m in 2016 to $97m in 2017 primarily due to changes in classification between provisions due within one year.
