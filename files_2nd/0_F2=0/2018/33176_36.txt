7 Investments at fair value through profit or loss and financial instruments All financial instruments for which fair value is recognised or disclosed are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level Fair value input description Financial instruments Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted and in active markets Quoted equity investments Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are Derivative financial instruments held at fair value observableinthe market either directly ie as prices or indirectly iederived from prices Level 3 Inputs that are not based on observable market data Unquoted investments and unlisted funds For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing the categorisation based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole for each reporting period.
At 31 March 2018, the Group held the following classes of financial instruments that are measured at fair value.
For all other assets and liabilities, their carrying value approximates to fair value.
During the year ended 31 March 2018, there were no transfers of financial instruments between levels of the fair value hierarchy 2017: none.

96 3i Infrastructure plc Annual report and accounts 2018 Governance and accounts 7 Investments at fair value through profit or loss and financial instruments continued The holding period of the investments in the portfolio is expected to be greater than one year.
Therefore investments are classified as non-current unless there is an agreement to dispose of the investment within one year and all relevant regulatory approvals have been received.
It is not possible to identify with certainty whether any investments may be sold within one year.
Investment income of 94.2 million 2017: 80.5 million comprises dividend income of 11.3 million 2017: 11.7 million, interest of 57.5 million 2017: 40.2 million and distributions of 25.4 million 2017: 28.6 million from unconsolidated subsidiaries.
Unquoted investments The Group invests in private companies which are not quoted on an active market.
These are measured in accordance with the International Private Equity Valuation guidelines with reference to the most appropriate information available at the time of measurement.
Further information regarding the valuation of unquoted investments can be found in the Portfolio valuation methodology section.
The Groups policy is to fair value both the equity and shareholder debt investments in infrastructure assets together where they will be managed and valued as a single investment, were invested at the same time and cannot be realised separately.
The Directors consider that equity and debt share the same characteristics and risks and they are therefore treated as a single unit of account for valuation purposes and a single class for disclosure purposes.
As at 31 March 2018, the fair value of unquoted investments was 1,527.3 million 2017: 1,788.3 million.
Individual portfolio asset valuations are shown within the Portfolio summary.
The majority of the assets held within Level 3 are valued on a discounted cash flow basis, hence, the valuations are sensitive to the discount rate assumed in the valuation of each asset.
Other significant unobservable inputs include the long-term inflation rate assumption, the interest rates assumption used to project the future cash flows and the forecast cash flows themselves, the sensitivities of which are captured in the Market risk section in Note 9.
A discussion of discount rates applied can be found in the Movements in portfolio valuation methodology section.
Increasing the discount rate used in the valuation of each asset by 1% would reduce the value of the portfolio by 130.1 million 2017: 167.4 million.
Decreasing the discount rate used in the valuation of each asset by 1% would increase the value of the portfolio by 151.9 million 2017: 200.1 million.
The majority of assets held within Level 3 have revenues that are linked, partially linked or in some way correlated to inflation.
The long-term inflation rate assumptions for the country of domicile of the investments in the portfolio range from 5.0% India 2017: 5.0% to 2.0% Netherlands 2017: 2.0% including the UK at 2.5% UK RPI 2017: 2.5%.
Changing the inflation rate assumption may result in consequential changes to other assumptions used in the valuation of each asset.
The impact of increasing the inflation rate assumption by 1% for the next two years would increase the value of the portfolio by 39.1 million 2017: 41.3 million.
Decreasing the inflation rate assumption used in the valuation of each asset by 1% for the next two years would decrease the value of the portfolio by 38.6 million 2017: 40.9 million.
The valuations are sensitive to changes in interest rates, which may result from: i unhedged existing borrowings within portfolio companies: ii interest rates on uncommitted future borrowings assumed within the asset valuations: and iii cash deposits held by portfolio companies.
These comprise a wide range of interest rates from short-term deposit rates to longer-term borrowing rates across a broad range of debt products.
Increasing the cost of borrowing assumption for unhedged borrowings and any future uncommitted borrowing and the cash deposit rates used in the valuation of each asset by 1% would reduce the value of the portfolio by 56.3 million 2017: 111.6 million.
Decreasing the interest rate assumption used in the valuation of each asset by 1% would increase the value of the portfolio by 54.3 million 2017: 114.0 million.
This calculation does not take account of any offsetting variances which may be expected to prevail if interest rates changed, including the impact of inflation discussed above.
Unlisted funds The Company invests in one externally managed fund, The Dalmore Capital Fund, which is not quoted in an active market.
The Company considered the valuation techniques and inputs used in valuing this fund to ensure they are reasonable and appropriate and therefore the net asset value NAV of this fund may be used as an input into measuring its fair value.
In measuring this fair value, the NAV of the fund is adjusted, as necessary, to reflect restrictions on redemptions, future commitments, illiquid nature of the investments and other specific factors of the fund and fund manager.
The Company classifies the fair value of this investment as Level 3.
As at 31 March 2018, the fair value of unlisted funds was 18.6 million 2017: 17.6 million.
The fund NAV reflects a 31 March 2018 valuation date 2017: 31 March 2017 valuation date.
A 10% adjustment in the NAV of the fund would result in a 1.9 million 2017: 1.8 million change in the valuation.
3i Infrastructure plc Annual report and accounts 2018 97 Governance and accounts N otes to the accounts continued 7 Investments at fair value through profit or loss and financial instruments continued Intermediate holding companies The Company invests in a number of intermediate holding companies that are used to hold the unquoted investments, valued as referred to above.
All other assets and liabilities of the intermediate holding companies are held either at fair value or a reasonable approximation to fair value.
The fair value of these intermediate holding companies therefore approximates to their NAV and the Company classifies the fair value as Level 3.
As at 31 March 2018, the fair value of the other assets and liabilities within these intermediate holding companies was 6.4 million 2017: 9.7 million.
Over-the-counter derivatives The Company uses over-the-counter foreign currency derivatives and interest rate swaps to hedge foreign currency movements and interest rates respectively.
The derivatives are held at fair value which represents the price that would be received to sell or transfer the instruments at the balance sheet date.
The valuation technique incorporates various inputs including foreign exchange spot and forward rates, interest rate curves, and uses present value calculations.
For these financial instruments, significant inputs into models are market observable and are included within Level 2.
Valuation process for Level 3 valuations Valuations are the responsibility of the Board of Directors of the Company.
The valuation of unquoted investments, debt and unlisted funds held by the Group is performed on a half-yearly basis by the valuation team of the Investment Adviser and reviewed by the Investment Committee of the Investment Adviser.
The valuations are also subject to quality assurance procedures performed within the valuation team.
The valuation team verifies the major inputs applied in the latest valuation by agreeing the information in the valuation computation to relevant documents and market information.
On a half-yearly basis, the Investment Committee presents the valuations to the Board.
This includes a discussion of the major assumptions used in the valuations, with an emphasis on the more significant investments and investments with significant fair value changes.
The Investment Committee considers the appropriateness of the valuation methods and inputs, and may request that alternative valuation methods are applied to support the valuation arising from the method chosen.
Any changes in valuation methods are discussed and agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee before being approved by the Board.

9 Financial risk management A full review of the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing and monitoring risk is set out in the Risk report on page 45.
This Note provides further detail on financial risk management, cross-referring to the Risk report where applicable and providing further quantitative data on specific financial risks.
Each investment made by the Group is subject to a full risk assessment through a consistent investment approval process.
The Boards Investment Committee and the Investment Advisers investment process are part of the overall risk management framework of the Group.
The funding objective of the Group is that each category of investment ought to be broadly matched with liabilities and shareholders funds according to the risk and maturity characteristics of the assets, and that funding needs are to be met ahead of planned investment.
98 3i Infrastructure plc Annual report and accounts 2018 Governance and accounts 9 Financial risk management continued Capital structure The Group has a continuing commitment to capital efficiency.
The capital structure of the Group consists of cash held on deposit, borrowing facilities and shareholders equity.
The Companys Articles require its outstanding borrowings, including any financial guarantees to support subsequent obligations, to be limited to 50% of the gross assets of the Group.
The type and maturity of the Groups borrowings are analysed in Note 11 and the Groups equity is analysed into its various components in the Consolidated statement of changes in equity.
Capital is managed so as to maximise the return to shareholders, while maintaining a strong capital base that ensures that the Group can operate effectively in the marketplace and sustain future development of the business.
The Board is responsible for regularly monitoring capital requirements to ensure that the Company is maintaining sufficient capital to meet its future investment needs.
The Company is regulated under the provisions of the Collective Investment Funds Jersey Law 1988 as a closedended collective investment fund and is not required as a result of such regulation to maintain a minimum level ofcapital.
Capital is allocated for investment in utilities, communications, transportation, natural resources and social infrastructure across the UK, continental Europe and Asia, as described on page 4.
As set out in the Groups investment policy, the maximum exposure to any one investment is 25% of gross assets including cash holdings atthe time of investment.
Credit risk The Group is subject to credit risk on the debt component of its unquoted investments, cash, deposits, derivative contracts and receivables.
The maximum exposure to credit risk as a result of counterparty default equates to the current carrying value of these financial assets.
Throughout the year and the prior year, the Groups cash and deposits were held with a variety of counterparties, principally in AAA rated money market funds, as well as in short-term bank deposits with a minimum of a BBB credit rating.
The counterparties selected for the derivative financial instruments were all banks with a minimum of a BBB credit rating with at least one major rating agency.
Thecredit quality of unquoted investments, which are held at fair value and include debt and equity elements, is based on the financial performance of the individual portfolio companies.
The credit risk relating to these assets is based on their enterprise value and is reflected through fair value movements.
The performance of underlying investments is monitored by the Board to assess future recoverability.
For those assets and income entitlements that are not past due, it is believed that the risk of default is small and capital repayments and interest payments will be made in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions oftheinvestment.
If the portfolio company has failed and there is no expectation to recover any residual value fromthe investment, the Groups policy is to record an impairment for the full amount of the loan.
When the net present value of the future cash flows predicted to arise from the asset, discounted using the effective interest ratemethod, implies non-recovery of all or part of the Groups investment a fair value movement is recorded equal tothe valuationshortfall.
No assets held by the Group were considered to be impaired.
The Company had no loans or receivables or debt investments considered past due 2017: nil.
The Company actively manages counterparty risk.
Counterparty limits are set and closely monitored by the Board and a regular review of counterparties is undertaken by the Investment Adviser and the Board.
As at 31 March 2018, the Group did not consider itself to have a significant exposure to any one counterparty and held deposits and derivative contracts with a number of different counterparties to reduce counterparty risk.
Due to the size and nature of the investment portfolio there is concentration risk due to the size of the investments.
This risk is managed by diversifying the portfolio by sector and geography.
See page 4 for an analysis of the portfolio by sector and geography.
The risk exposure at this year end has reduced compared to the prior year end following the new investments during the year and the sale of two of the largest investments in the portfolio.

All derivatives are settled net and therefore the liability shown is the net cash flow expected to be paid on settlement.
The financial commitments relate to the Groups commitments to the 3i India Infrastructure Fund, Valorem, and the A9, RIVM, La Sant, Condorcet, Hart van Zuid and A27 A1 projects and no discount has been applied.
During the year, the Group invested subordinated debt in the Mersey Gateway Bridge project and, as a result, a prior year financial commitment of 13.1 million was extinguished.
In order to manage the contractual liquidity risk the Group is not dependent on the cash flows from financial assets as it has free cash and debt facilities in place.
Market risk The valuation of the Groups investment portfolio is largely dependent on the underlying trading performance of the companies within the portfolio, but the valuation of the portfolio and the carrying value of other items in the financial statements can also be affected by interest rate, currency and market price fluctuations.
The Groups sensitivities to these fluctuations are set out below.
i Interest rate risk Further information on how interest rate risk is managed is provided in the Risk report section.
An increase of 100 basis points in interest rates over 12 months 2017: 100 basis points would lead to an approximate increase in net assets and to the net profit of the Group of 2.8 million 2017: decrease of 0.8 million.
This exposure relates principally to changes in interest receivable on cash on deposit held at the year end.
Due to changes in the economic environment the sensitivity shown here has been reduced from the 250 basis points used in the prior year.
The average cash balance of the Group, which is more representative of the cash balance during the year, was 44.4 million 2017: 121.7 million and the weighted average interest earned was 0.3 % 2017: 0.3%.
The risk exposure at this year end has decreased compared to the prior year end following the repayment of cash drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility.
100 3i Infrastructure plc Annual report and accounts 2018 Governance and accounts 9 Financial risk management continued In addition, the Group has indirect exposure to interest rates through changes to the financial performance of portfolio companies caused by interest rate fluctuations as disclosed in Note 7.
This risk is considered a component of market risk described in section iii.
The Group does not hold any fixed rate debt investments or borrowings and istherefore not exposed to fair value interest rate risk.
ii Currency risk Further information on how currency risk is managed is provided in the Risk report.
The currency denominations of the Groups net assets are shown in the table below.
The sensitivity analysis demonstrates the exposure of the Groups net assets to movements in foreign currency exchange rates.
The hedging strategy is discussed on page 23.

The impact of an equivalent depreciation in sterling against the euro, DKK and US dollar exchange rates has the inverse impact on net profit and net assets from that shown above.
There is an indirect exposure to the rupee through the investment in the 3i India Infrastructure Fund which is denominated in US dollars but it is only the direct exposure that is considered here.
The risk exposure at the year end is considered to be representative of this year as a whole.
iii Market risk Further information about the management of external market risk and its impact on price or valuation, which arises principally from unquoted investments, is provided in the Risk report.
A 10% increase in the fair value of those investments would have the following direct impact on net profit and net assets.
The impact of a change in all cash flows has an equivalent impact on the fair value, as set out below.

By the nature of the Groups activities, it has large exposures to individual assets that are susceptible to movements inprice.
This risk concentration is managed within the Companys investment strategy as discussed in the Risk report.
iv Fair values The fair value of the investment portfolio is described in detail in the Portfolio valuation methodology section and in Note 7.
The fair values of the remaining financial assets and liabilities approximate to their carrying values 2017:same.
The sensitivity analysis in respect of the interest rate, currency and market price risks is considered to be representative of the Groups exposure to financial risks throughout the period to which they relate 2017: same.
