Contract liabilities represents customer invoices where performance obligations have not yet been satisfied.
All opening balances have subsequently been satisfied in the year.
In most business categories our customers are invoiced in advance or simultaneously with performance obligations being satisfied.
Put options are held following the acquisition of Rentokil PCI in 2017, where the seller may require the Group to purchase the remaining shares of the business in stages over a fixed term.
The put options are accounted for as an anticipated acquisition of the remaining shares and no non-controlling interest is recognised.
The Group recognised a put option liability for the anticipated acquisition of these shares in deferred and contingent consideration, and any movements in the carrying value are recognised through equity.
Provisions for other liabilities and charges The Group has vacant property, environmental, self-insurance and other provisions.
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the amount is capable of being reliably estimated.
If such an obligation isnot capable of being reliably estimated it is classified as a contingent liability Note D3.
Future cash flows relating to these obligations are discounted when the effect is material.
The discount rates used are based on government bond rates in the country of the cash flows, and were between 0.3% and 0.7% 2017: between 0.3% and 0.5% for the UK, and between 0.8% and 2.8% 2017: between 0.8% and 2.3% for the US.
Judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for environmental restoration.
These provisions tend to be long-term in nature and theuse of an appropriate market discount rate and forecast future utilisation based upon managements best estimate determines the level of provision required at the balance sheet date.
The phasing and actual cash spend may be different from the forecast on which the provision is based.
