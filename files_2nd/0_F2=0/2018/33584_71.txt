FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NET DEBT AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 23.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT Overview The Board approves and monitors the risk management processes, including documented treasury policies, counterparty limits and controlling and reporting structures.
The risk management processes of the Groups independently listed subsidiaries are in line with the Groups own policy.
The types of risk exposure, the way in which such exposure is managed and quantification of the level of exposure in the Consolidated balance sheet at 31December is as follows: liquidityrisk: credit risk: commodity price risk: foreign exchange risk: and interest rate risk.
Liquidity risk The Group ensures that there are sufficient committed loan facilities including refinancing, where necessary in order to meet short-term business requirements, after taking into account cash flows from operations and its holding of cash and cash equivalents, as well as any Group distribution restrictions that exist.
In addition, certain projects may be financed by means of limited recourse project finance, if appropriate.
Certain borrowing facilities within the Group are the subject of financial covenants that vary from facility to facility, but which would be considered normal for such facilities, such as the ratio of net debt to tangible net worth.
The respective borrowers remain in compliance with these facilities at 31 December 2018.
The expected undiscounted cash flows of the Groups net debt related and other financial liabilities, by remaining contractual maturity, based on conditions existing at the balance sheet date are as follows: 2018 Net debt related financial liabilities Expected Derivatives Other future interest hedging financial US$ million Borrowings payments net debt liabilities Total Amount due for repayment within one year 462 337 134 4,262 5,195 Greater than one year, less than two years 530 313 152 20 1,015 Greater than two years, less than three years 1,044 286 140 17 1,487 Greater than three years, less than four years 1,787 254 169 19 2,229 Greater than four years, less than five years 880 193 207 18 1,298 Greater than five years 4,133 478 77 333 5,021 Total due for repayment after more than one year 8,374 1,524 745 407 11,050 Total 8,836 1,861 879 4,669 16,245 2017 Net debt related financial liabilities Expected Derivatives Other future interest hedging financial US$ million Borrowings payments net debt liabilities Total Amount due for repayment within one year 1,174 469 195 3,985 5,823 Greater than one year, less than two years 1,338 382 19 22 1,761 Greater than two years, less than three years 1,450 321 39 1,810 Greater than three years, less than four years 1,592 280 72 1,944 Greater than four years, less than five years 1,811 222 65 2,098 Greater than five years 4,313 513 79 228 5,133 Total due for repayment after more than one year 10,504 1,718 274 250 12,746 Total 11,678 2,187 469 4,235 18,569 The Group had the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities at 31 December: US$ million 2018 2017 Expiry date Within one year 223 490 Greater than one year, less than two years 1,182 598 Greater than two years, less than three years 1,035 7,676 Greater than three years, less than four years Greater than four years, less than five years 4,874 244 7,314 9,008 In March 2018 the Group replaced a number of credit facilities maturing between March 2019 and March 2020 with a total value of $5.4 billion, with a $4.5billion credit facility maturing in March 2023.
On 8 February 2019, the Group extended the maturity of $4.3 billion of its revolving credit facility by one year from March 2023 to March 2024.
Undrawn committed borrowing facilities expiring within one year include undrawn South African rand facilities equivalent to $0.2 billion 2017: $0.3 billion in respect of facilities with a 364 day maturity which roll automatically on a daily basis, unless notice isserved.
In addition to the amounts above, on 1 January 2019, a committed shareholder loan facility of $1.8 billion from Mitsubishi Corporation became available to Anglo American Quellaveco S. A. to meet Mitsubishis commitment to fund 40% of remaining capital expenditure on the Quellaveco project Copper.

Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will cause a loss to the Group by failing to pay its obligation.
The Groups principal financial assets are cash, trade and other receivables, investments and derivative financial instruments.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk primarily arises from these financial assets and is as follows: 2017 US$ million 2018 Cash and cash equivalents 6,567 7,800 Trade and other receivables 1,806 2,152 Financial asset investments 358 446 Derivative financial assets 341 390 9,072 10,788 The Group limits credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments through diversification of exposures with a range of financial institutions approved by the Board.
Counterparty limits are set for each financial institution with reference to credit ratings assigned by Standard & Poors, Moodys and Fitch Ratings, shareholder equity in case of relationship banks and fund size in case of asset managers.
Given the diverse nature of the Groups operations both in relation to commodity markets and geographically, and the use of payment security instruments including letters of credit from financial institutions, it does not have significant concentration of credit risk in respect of trade receivables, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.
The classification of trade and other receivables exclude prepayments and tax receivables and the classification of financial asset investments exclude equity investments held at fair value through other comprehensive income.
C. Commodity price risk The Groups earnings are exposed to movements in the prices of the commodities it produces.
The Groups policy is to sell its products at prevailing market prices and is generally not to hedge commodity price risk, although some hedging may be undertaken for strategic reasons.
In such cases, the Group generally uses forward contracts and other derivative instruments to hedge the price risk.
Certain of the Groups sales and purchases are provisionally priced, meaning that the selling price is determined normally 30 to 180 days after delivery to the customer, based on quoted market prices stipulated in the contract, and as a result are susceptible to future price movements.
The exposure of the Groups financial assets and liabilities to commodity price risk is as follows: 2018 2017 Commodity price linked Commodity price linked Not Not Subject to linked to Subject to linked to price Fixed commodity price Fixed commodity US$ million movements price price Total movements price price Total Total net financial instruments excluding derivatives 286 456 4,711 4,541 262 378 6,167 5,527 Derivatives 67 442 375 86 320 406 219 456 5,153 4,916 176 378 6,487 5,933 Commodity price linked financial instruments subject to price movements include provisionally priced trade receivables and trade payables.
Commodity price linked financial instruments at fixed price include receivables and payables for commodity sales and purchases not subject to price adjustment at the balance sheet date.
D. Foreign exchange risk As a global business, the Group is exposed to many currencies principally as a result of non-US dollar operating costs and, to a lesser extent, from non-US dollar revenue.
The South African rand, Brazilian real and Australian dollar are the most significant non-US dollar currencies influencing costs.
A strengthening of the US dollar against the currencies to which the Group is exposed has a positive effect on the Groups earnings.
The Groups policy is generally not to hedge such exposures given the correlation, over the longer term, with commodity prices and the diversified nature of the Group, although exceptions can be approved bythe Group Management Committee.
In addition, currency exposures exist in respect of non-US dollar capital expenditure projects and non-US dollar borrowings in US dollar functional currency entities.
The Groups policy is to evaluate whether or not to hedge its non-US dollar capital expenditure on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the estimated foreign exchange exposure, liquidity of foreign exchange markets and the cost of executing a hedging strategy.
Net otherfinancial liabilities excluding net debt related balances and cash in disposal groups, but including the debit valuation adjustment attributable to derivatives hedging net debt are $2,068 million.
This includes net assets of $25 million denominated in Brazilian real, and net liabilities of $247 million denominated in US dollars, $399 million denominated in Australian dollars, $349 million denominated in Chilean pesos and $825 million denominated in South African rand.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued E. Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises due to fluctuations in interest rates which impact the value of short-term investments and financing activities.
The Group is principally exposed to US and South African interest rates.
The Groups policy is to borrow funds at floating rates of interest given the link with economic output and therefore the correlation, over the longer term, with commodity prices.
The Group uses interest rate swap contracts to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its debt.
In respect of financial assets, the Groups policy is to invest cash at floating rates of interest and to maintain cash reserves in short-term investments less than one year in order to maintain liquidity.
Analysis of interest rate risk associated with net debt balances and the impact of derivatives to hedge against this risk is included within the table below.
Netother financial liabilities excluding net debt related balances and cash in disposal groups, but including the debit valuation adjustment attributable to derivatives hedging net debt of $2,068 million 2017: $1,432 million are primarily non-interest bearing.
The table below reflects the exposure of the Groups net debt to currency and interest rate risk.
