Determining the amount of such a provision requires estimating the future net cash flows receivable in respect of these assets, and in the particular case where the leased properties are vacant this requires assessing the likely period for which the property will remain vacant, the cost of any works required to enhance its marketability and the rental income receivable when the property is sublet.
Onerous lease provision Prior to the acquisition of the BCA Group two properties in the UK had been identified for which the Group had no future use.
A provision exists for the minimum lease payments estimated to be paid until the end of the leases in 2031, net of managements estimate as to likely revenues receivable in respect of sub-leases or other uses of the properties.
The future payments have been discounted, where appropriate, at the risk appropriate rate of 3%.
Other provisions This balance primarily relates to a dilapidations provision, which was made in order to make good any defects within leasehold buildings used in the business and is expected to be utilised within the next ten years.

Contingencies At any point in time the Company and its subsidiaries may be party to various legal proceedings, some of which may involve claims for damages.
The outcome of such proceedings cannot be readily foreseen.
Management believes that there are no disputes with any third parties that would result in a material liability for the Group.
