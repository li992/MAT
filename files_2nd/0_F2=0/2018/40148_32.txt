Pensions continued The St. Modwen Pension Scheme is governed by the trustee company, St. Modwen Pensions Limited.
It is regulated by the UK regulatory regime, overseen by the Pensions Regulator.
The last formal actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 5 April 2017, when the market value of the net assets of the scheme was 32.1m and the funding level was 107% based on the Trustees proposed assumptions for technical provisions.
The main actuarial assumptions were: % per annum Rate of increase in pensions 2.7 Discount rate 3.0 Inflation rate 2.7 The next formal actuarial valuation of the scheme is expected to be prepared as at 5 April 2020.
Funding policy As the scheme is fully funded, the current schedule of contributions requires the Group to fund the Scheme to such an extent as to cover administrative expenses only.
The contribution for the year ended 30 November 2019 is expected to be nil, consistent with the current year contributions of nil.
From 1 January 2015, administrative expenses have been met by St. Modwen Properties PLC.
The actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section, a final salary scheme, was updated to 30 November 2018 on an IAS basis by a qualified independent actuary.
The valuation was performed using the Projected Unit Credit Method under IAS 19.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were: 2018 2017 % % Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.40 2.30 Rate of increase in pensions in payment pre 6 April 1997 benefits 2.60 2.55 Rate of increase in pensions in payment post 5 April 1997 benefits 3.30 3.20 Discount rate 2.90 2.60 Inflation rate 2.40 2.30 Following the closure of the defined benefit section to future accrual, the assumption regarding the rate of increase in salaries is no longer applicable as retirement benefits will be based on salaries at 31 August 2009.
Benefits earned up to the point of the scheme closure will be protected and will be increased in line with inflation, subject to a maximum of 5% per annum.
From 2010 the basis of the inflation assumption has been amended, in line with market practice, from the Retail Price Index to the Consumer Price Index.
The mortality rates adopted are from 85% of the S2PxA tables with CMI 2017 core model previously the CMI 2016 core model and a long-term improvement of 1.25% per annum.
The resultant assumptions are, for example: Average future life expectancy in years for a pensioner aged 65 at 30 November 2018: 23.2 male and 25.1 female.
Average future life expectancy in years at age 65 for a non-pensioner aged 40 at 30 November 2018: 25.1 male and 27.0 female.
