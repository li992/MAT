They are generally due for settlement within 30 days and therefore are all classified as current.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at the amount of consideration that is unconditional.
The Group holds the trade receivables with the objective to collect the contractual cash flows and therefore measures them subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Due to the short-term nature of the current receivables, their carrying amount is not considered to be materially different to their fair value.
Land Lease Premium represent the fair value asset of leases acquired with Cinema City Holdings B. V and with Regal.
Further information relating to loans to jointly controlled entities is set out in Note 12.
18. Business Combinations 2018 Acquisition of Regal Entertainment Group On the 5 December 2017, the Group announced the proposed acquisition of Regal by means of an acquisition of the entire issued, and to be issued, share capital of Regal.
The acquisition was based on an implied enterprise value of $5.8bn.
The acquisition of Regal completed on 28 February 2018.
Consideration Transferred Of the total consideration for the acquisition, $3.4bn was settled fully in cash, funded by the proceeds of the fully underwritten Rights Issue at the Rights Issue Price of 157.0 pence per New Ordinary Share, which raised $2.3bn, plus an additional $4.1bn was raised through committed Debt Facilities.
The restructured debt arrangement consists of a US Dollar and Euro term loan totalling $4.1bn and a $300.0m revolving credit facility.
The previous financing arrangements in place as at 31 December 2017 for the Group and Regal have been terminated and superseded by the new financing arrangements from 28 February 2018.
As the consideration was entirely paid in cash the acquisition is being accounted for as an acquisition under IFRS 3 rather than as a reverse takeover under IFRS 3, notwithstanding the size of the acquisition.
