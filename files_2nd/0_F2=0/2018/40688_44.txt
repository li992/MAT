NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNILEVER GROUP CONTINUED 6.
INCOME TAX Income tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Current tax in the consolidated income statement will differ from the income tax paid in the consolidated cash flow statement primarily because of deferred tax arising on temporary differences and payment dates for income tax occurring after the balance sheet date.
Unilever is subject to taxation in the many countries in which it operates.
The tax legislation of these countries differs, is often complex and is subject to interpretation by management and the government authorities.
These matters of judgement give rise to the need to create provisions for tax payments that may arise in future years with respect to transactions already undertaken.
Provisions are made against individual exposures and take into account the specific circumstances of each case, including the strength of technical arguments, recent case law decisions or rulings on similar issues and relevant external advice.
The provision is estimated based on the individual most likely outcome approach.

For this reason, the rate may vary from year to year according to the mix of profit and related tax rates.
b See not e 3 for explanation of non-underlying items.
Our tax rate is reduced by incentive tax credits, the benefit from preferential tax regimes that have been legislated by the countries and provinces concerned in order to promote economic development and investment.
The tax rate is increased by business expenses which are not deductible for tax, such as entertainment costs and some interest expense and by irrecoverable withholding taxes on dividends paid by subsidiary companies and on other cross-border payments such as royalties and service fees, which cannot be offset against other taxes due.
In 2018 the effective tax rate was reduced by the impact of the spreads disposals where a significant part of the disposals benefited from the participation exemption in the Netherlands.
The Groups future tax charge and effective tax rate could be affected by several factors, including changes in tax laws and their interpretation and still to be determined tax reform proposals in the EU, Switzerland and the continuing OECD international tax reform work, as well as the impact of acquisitions, disposals and any restructuring of our businesses.

DEFERRED TAX Deferred tax is recognised using the liability method on taxable temporary differences between the tax base and the accounting base of items included in the balance sheet of the Group.
Certain temporary differences are not provided for as follows: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted, or substantively enacted, at the year end.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of unused tax losses of 4,914 million 2017: 4,179 million and tax credits of 570 million 2017: 612 million, as it is not probable that there will be future taxable profits within the entities against which the losses can be utilised.
Many of these tax losses and credits arise in tax jurisdictions where they do not expire with the exception of 4,752 million 2017: 2,934 million comprising mainly corporate income tax losses in the Netherlands which expire between now and 2027.
Other deductible temporary differences of 48 million 2017: 51 million have not been recognised as a deferred tax asset.
There is no expiry date for these differences.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 2,681 million 2017: 1,719 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences, and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.
