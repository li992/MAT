Significant accounting policies specific to one note are included within the note itself.
Accounting policies have been consistently applied to all years presented.
This section also includes details on new EU endorsed accounting standards, amendments and interpretations and their expected impact on the financial performance of the Group, specifically the impact of IFRS 16.
1.1 Significant Accounting Policies a Basis of preparation The consolidated Financial Statements of Cairn Energy PLC Cairn or the Group for the year ended 31 December 2018 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 11 March 2019.
Cairn is a limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom whose shares are publicly traded.
The registered office is located at 50 Lothian Road, Edinburgh, Scotland, EH3 9BY.
The registered company number is SC226712.
Cairn prepares its Financial Statements on a historical cost basis, unless accounting standards require an alternate measurement basis.
Where there are assets and liabilities calculated on a different basis, this fact is disclosed either in the relevant accounting policy or in the notes to the Financial Statements.
The Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies using International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
The Groups Financial Statements are prepared on a going concern basis.
b Accounting standards Cairn prepares its Financial Statements in accordance with applicable IFRS, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB as adopted by the EU, and interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC, and Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Groups Financial Statements are also consistent with IFRS as issued by the IASB as they apply to accounting periods ended 31 December 2018.
Effective 1 January 2018, Cairn has adopted the following amendments to standards: Amendments to IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures Amendments to IFRS 2 Share Based Payments IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers In addition, Cairn has early adopted the following interpretation issued by IFRIC: IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments The following standard, issued by the IASB and endorsed by the EU has yet to be adopted by the Group: IFRS 16 Leases effective 1 January 2019 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments The adoption of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments on 1 January 2018 resulted in the re-classification of the Groups available-for-sale financial assets as financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss.
Fair value gains and losses on the financial assets are now reflected through the Income Statement rather than Other Comprehensive Income.
IFRS 9 also required the change in fair value relating to the time value of an option, designated for hedge accounting, to be recorded in Other Comprehensive Income: previously Cairn had recorded such movements through the Income Statement.
Both these changes have been applied fully retrospectively and result in the restatement of comparative information, details of which can be found in note 1.3.
Other standards and amendments effective 1 January 2018 The other changes to IFRS effective 1 January 2018, including the adoption of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, have no significant impact on Cairns Financial Statements.
Relevant accounting policies have been reviewed and updated to reflect adoption of IFRS 15 but given that Cairns customers are clearly identified, the performance obligations easily identifiable and the price readily determinable, the changes to policies have no impact on the resulting accounting.
IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments Cairn has chosen to adopt IFRIC 23 in advance of its effective date of 1 January 2019.
This interpretation provides guidance on how uncertain tax treatments should be addressed and requires an entity to assess the probability of an uncertain tax position being accepted by the relevant taxation authority.
The interpretation has been applied in calculating Cairns unused tax losses disclosed in the notes to the Financial Statements.
The prior year impact of adoption is not material and comparative disclosure has not been amended.
130 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial Statements Section 1 Basis of Preparation continued 1.1 Significant Accounting Policies continued b Accounting standards continued IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 introduces a single lessee accounting model and requires a lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value.
A lessee is required to recognise a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying leased asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments.
In assessing the impact of IFRS 16, Cairn has identified the following assets where right-of-use assets and lease liabilities will be recognised on adoption: Accounting for the FPSO on the UK Catcher development producing asset: and Accounting for non-cancellable leases of the Groups office premises in Edinburgh, London, Stavanger and Mexico City.
All other leases are either for periods of less than one year or have less than one year remaining on the date of adoption or are for low-value items which have no material impact on the Groups Financial Statements.
Additional disclosure will be provided in the 2019 Financial Statements relating to these leases where material.
The Catcher FPSO is classified as an operating lease under the current accounting standard see significant accounting judgements in section 3.
Under IFRS 16 Cairn will recognise a right-of-use asset and lease liability for the vessel based on the minimum lease commitment over the expected charter period.
On initial adoption of IFRS 16, Cairn will recognise a lease liability of US$147.5m and a corresponding right-of-use asset.
Forecast minimum lease payments of US$33.9m in 2019 will reduce the lease liability rather than be charged against profit as a lease charge.
Forecast finance lease interest charges on the Catcher FPSO for 2019 are US$7.2m.
Variable lease charges in excess of the minimum commitment will continue to be charged against profit.
The right-of-use asset will be amortised on a unit-of-production basis consistent with the Groups other development producing assets.
In the Cash Flow Statement, minimum lease payments relating to the Catcher FPSO will be classified as financing cash flows: currently they are included in operating cash flows.
Variable lease payments shall remain in operating cash flows.
There is no change in accounting for the Kraken FPSO which is currently accounted for as a finance lease.
The Groups leasehold property will be measured based on the lease liability remaining on adoption of IFRS 16.
The Group expects to recognise lease liabilities of US$10.0m and corresponding right-of-use assets for the same amount.
The assets will be amortised on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the lease.
Again, cash flows will be re-classified as financing rather than operating cash flows.
Cairn are continuing to assess accounting for leases held through joint operations, particularly where the operator enters into a lease agreement on behalf of the joint operation but where the joint operators are not direct parties to the lease agreement.
Assessing whether such contracts will be treated as a lease by Cairn, as a non-operator, is likely to be highly judgemental with assumptions and other considerations based on the right of substitution by the operator and the reasonable certainty of leases being extended beyond an initial period.
Details of current finance leases can be found in note 3.4, while current operating lease commitments are disclosed in notes 2.1, 2.5 and 4.3 as they relate to operating costs, intangible exploration appraisal assets and property, plant & equipment development producing assets, and administrative expenses respectively.
A reconciliation of operating lease commitments at 31 December 2018 to the opening lease liabilities on adoption of IFRS 16 is as follows: Production Exploration Development Administrative costs Appraisal assets Producing assets expenses Total US$m US$m US$m US$m US$m Operating lease commitments 171.6 21.2 13.4 11.5 217.7 Attributable to: Leases yet to commence 20.7 9.5 30.2 Short-term leases 0.5 3.9 4.4 Lease of low value items 0.3 0.3 Gross lease liability 171.6 11.2 182.8 Interest implicit in lease 24.1 1.2 25.3 Opening lease liability 147.5 10.0 157.5 c Basis of consolidation The consolidated Financial Statements include the results of Cairn Energy PLC and its subsidiary undertakings to the balance sheet date.
Where subsidiaries follow differing accounting policies from those of the Group, those accounting policies have been adjusted to align with those of the Group.
Intercompany balances and transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation, though foreign exchange differences arising on intercompany balances between subsidiaries with differing functional currencies are not offset.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or incorporated in any year are included in the Income Statement and Statement of Cash Flows from the effective date of acquisition while the results of subsidiaries disposed of or liquidated during the year are included in the Income Statement and Statement of Cash Flows to the date at which control passes from the Group.
Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 131 Financial Statements 1.1 Significant Accounting Policies continued d Joint arrangements Cairn is a partner joint operator in oil and gas exploration and development licences which are unincorporated joint arrangements.
All of the Groups current interests in these arrangements are determined to be joint operations.
A full list of oil and gas licence interests can be found on page 178.
Costs incurred relating to an interest in a joint operation are capitalised in accordance with the Groups accounting policies for oil and gas assets as appropriate notes 2.2 and 2.3.
All the Groups intangible exploration appraisal assets and property, plant & equipment development producing assets relate to interests in joint operations.
Cairns working capital balances relating to joint operations are included in trade and other receivables note 3.5 and trade and other payables note 3.7.
Any share of finance income or costs generated or incurred by the joint operation is included within the appropriate income statement account.
e Foreign currencies These Financial Statements continue to be presented in US dollars US$, the functional currency of the Parent.
In the financial statements of individual Group companies, Cairn translates foreign currency transactions into the functional currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the transaction date or an approximation thereof where not materially different.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising are taken to the Income Statement except for those incurred on borrowings specifically allocable to development projects, which are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset, though there were none in either the current or preceding year.
The Group maintains the Financial Statements of the Parent and subsidiary undertakings in their functional currency.
Where applicable, the Group translates subsidiary financial statements into the presentation currency, US$, using the closing rate method for assets and liabilities which are translated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date and rates at the date of transactions for income statement accounts.
Cairn takes exchange differences arising on the translation of net assets of Group companies whose functional currency is non-US$ directly to reserves.
Rates of exchange to US$1 were as follows: YTD YTD Closing Average Closing Average 2018 2018 2017 2017 GBP 0.784 0.749 0.740 0.776 NOK 8.641 8.133 8.209 8.263 Effective 1 January 2018, the functional currency of the Groups subsidiary undertaking Nautical Petroleum Limited, which holds the Groups interests in the UK Catcher and Kraken producing assets, changed from GBP to US$.
This change reflects the significant revenue streams now being generated by the entity which are receivable in US$.
Changes in functional currency are accounted for prospectively, therefore there is no adjustment to comparative information.
f Exceptional items Cairn does not present any items of income and expense as extraordinary items.
However, where items have a significant impact on profit or loss, occur infrequently and are not part of the Groups normal operating cycle, such items may be disclosed as exceptional items on the face of the Income Statement.
132 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial Statements Section 1 Basis of Preparation continued 1.2 Going Concern The Directors have considered the factors relevant to support a statement of going concern.
In assessing whether the going concern assumption is appropriate, the Board and Audit Committee considered the Group cash flow forecasts under various scenarios, identifying risks and mitigants and ensuring the Group has sufficient funding to meet its current commitments as and when they fall due for a period of at least 12 months from the date of signing these Financial Statements.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will continue in operational existence for this 12-month period and have therefore used the going concern basis in preparing the Financial Statements.
The Board and Audit Committee assessments of risk and mitigants to the Groups operational existence beyond this 12-month period is included in the Viability Statement on page 33.

Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 133 Financial Statements Section 2 Oil and Gas Assets and Operations This section focuses on revenue generated during the year, related cost of sales and the assets in the Balance Sheet which form the core of Cairns business.
This section quantifies the financial impact of exploration appraisal and development producing activities fully described in the Operational Review on pages 18 to 31.
Included are details of the impairment reviews and tests performed on the Groups assets, including goodwill, and related sensitivity analysis.
Significant accounting judgements in this section: Impairment testing of oil and gas assets and related goodwill Hydrocarbon reserves on the UK Kraken producing asset have been downgraded at the year end, reflecting the performance of the field to the balance sheet date which was below expectations.
Goodwill relating to the UK & Norway segments is also tested for impairment annually and as such all development producing assets in the region have been tested for impairment.
Cairn maintained its long-term oil price assumption at US$70 per boe which it believes reflects current market conditions.
The Groups three-year short-term assumption remains linked to the forward curve.
Full details are included in note 2.3.
Key estimates and assumptions in this section: Estimation of hydrocarbon reserves Oil and gas reserve volumes and related production profiles are estimated based on Cairns internal process manual which follows industry bestpractice.
This represents Cairns best estimate of reserves as at the reporting date.
Cairns Reserves and Resources Reporting Committee, which provides oversight, advice and guidance whilst providing senior level review, reports to the Groups Audit Committee before ultimately requesting approval of annual reserve volumes by the PLC Board.
Third-party audits of Cairns reserves and resources are conducted annually.
A change in reserve volumes could impact depletion and decommissioning charges, impairment testing, release of deferred revenue and related deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Impairment testing of intangible exploration appraisal assets and property, plant & equipment development producing assets Where an indicator of impairment is identified on an intangible exploration appraisal asset or a development producing asset, an impairment test is conducted in accordance with the Groups accounting policies.
The test compares either the carrying value of the asset or the carrying value of the cash-generating unit CGU containing the asset, to the recoverable amount of that asset or CGU.
The recoverable amount of an asset represents its fair value less costs of disposal.
This is based on either a verifiable third-party arms length transaction from which a fair value can be obtained or, where there is no such transaction, the fair value less costs of disposal of an asset is calculated using a discounted post-tax cash flow model over the field life of the asset.
Cairn do not believe that the value in use of the asset would materially exceed its fair value less cost of disposal.
The key assumptions used in the Groups discounted cash flow models reflect past experience and take account of external factors.
These assumptions include: Short medium-term oil price based on a three-month average forward curve for three years from the balance sheet date: Long-term oil price of US$70 per boe 2017: US$70 per boe escalated at 2.0% 2017: 2.0% per annum: Reserve estimates of discovered resource 2P and 2C based on P50 reserve estimates: Production profiles based on Cairns internal estimates including assumptions on performance of assets: Cost profiles for the development of the field and subsequent operating costs supplied by the operator and escalated at 2.0% 2017: 2.0% per annum: and Post-tax discount rates of 10% 2017: 10%.
Impairment testing of goodwill The goodwill arising from past corporate transactions in the UK & Norway region is tested for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount against the carrying value of the underlying oil and gas assets in the UK & Norway operating segment.
As with individual assets, fair value less costs of disposal are based on discounted post-tax cash flow models where no recent third-party transactions exist on which a reliable market-based fair value can be established.
The key assumptions are therefore consistent with those for testing intangible exploration appraisal assets.
Where resource is prospective, fair value represents the expected net present value of the prospect, risk-weighted for future exploration success.
Given the inherent risk associated with exploration activities, valuations of prospective resource are highly subjective.
Decommissioning estimates Provisions for decommissioning are based on the latest estimates provided by operators, subject to review by Cairn and adjustment where deemed necessary.
Costs provided to date are an estimate of the cost that would be incurred to remove and decommission facilities that existed at the year end and to plug and abandon development wells drilled to that date.
Costs are escalated at 2.0% per annum 2017: 2.0% and discounted at a risk-free rate of 2.0% 2017: 2.0%.
134 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial Statements Section 2 Oil and Gas Assets and Operations continued 2.1 Gross Profit: Revenue and Cost of Sales Accounting policies Revenue Revenue from oil sales represents the Groups share of sales, on a liftings basis, from its producing interests in the UK North Sea, at the point in time where ownership of the oil or gas has been passed to the buyer.
This occurs when the customer takes delivery of a cargo of oil from the FPSO as this is the point in time that the consideration due is unconditional as only the passage of time is required before payment is due.
Revenue is measured using the Brent or estimated Brent oil price plus or minus the applicable discount based on the quality of the oil.
Revenue from the sale of gas is recorded based on the volume of gas accepted each day by customers at the delivery point.
Revenue from royalties is calculated on production from fields in Mongolia.
Commodity price hedging Cairn may hedge oil production for the Groups assets in line with hedging policies approved by the Board.
Where a hedging instrument has been formally designated as a hedge for hedge accounting, changes in the intrinsic value of the hedged item and the time value of the option are recognised within Other Comprehensive Income where the hedge is effective based on fair value and are reclassified to the Income Statement when the hedged production itself affects profit or loss.
Hedge effectiveness is assessed on a prospective basis at commencement and throughout the life of the option.
Any hedge ineffectiveness identified is immediately charged to the Income Statement.
A change in the fair value of an option that is either not designated as a hedging instrument for hedge accounting or does not qualify for hedge accounting is recognised in the Income Statement.
Cost of sales Production costs include Cairns share of costs incurred by the joint operation in extracting oil and gas.
Also included are marketing and transportation costs and loss-of-production insurance costs payable over the year.
Adjustments for overlift where liftings taken by Cairn exceed the Groups working interest share, underlift where liftings taken by Cairn are less than the Groups working interest share and movements in inventory are included in cost of sales.
Oil inventory is measured at market value in accordance with established industry practice.
Variable lease charges represent lease payments made on finance leases over and above the minimum lease commitment.
Operating lease costs are charged directly to the Income Statement.

Both assets commenced production during 2017.
On Kraken, where only oil is sold, Cairn takes a full lifting of crude on a scheduled basis to reflect the Groups working interest.
On Catcher, Cairn receives its working interest percentage share of each lifting of crude and the Groups working interest share of gas sales.
Payment terms are within 30 days.
Sales volumes during the year averaged 16,000 boepd for the two assets combined, realising an average sales price of US$67.99 bbl.
Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 135 Financial Statements 2.1 Gross Profit: Revenue and Cost of Sales continued Commodity price hedging During 2018, Cairn realised losses on hedge options of US$8.0m through the first 10 months of the year as the oil price exceeded the ceiling on several hedge contracts.
This was offset by gains of US$0.2m as the oil price fell back in November and December below the US$60 bbl floor on one hedging contract.
Hedging losses are recycled to the Income Statement from Other Comprehensive Income when the option matures.
Details on the Groups hedging position at 31 December can be found in note 3.6.
Cost of sales Inventory of oil held at the year end is recorded at a market value of US$8.2m 2017: US$10.4m.
Underlift adjustments on Kraken production volumes were US$0.1m 2017: US$5.6m at 31 December 2018.
Variable finance lease costs on the Kraken FPSO of US$22.7m 2017: US$6.0m, see note 3.4, are charged to the Income Statement with US$36.8m 2017: US$1.0m of operating lease charges on the Catcher FPSO.
Operating lease commitment At the year end, Cairn had the following operating lease commitment relating to the Catcher FPSO: 2018 2017 US$m US$m Production costs operating lease charges Not later than one year 33.9 33.9 After one year but no more than five years 114.7 124.0 After five years 23.0 47.4 171.6 205.3 Following adoption of IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019, accounting for the Catcher FPSO will change with a lease liability and right-of-use asset being recorded on the Balance Sheet.
See note 1.1b for further detail.
136 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial Statements Section 2 Oil and Gas Assets and Operations continued 2.2 Intangible Exploration Appraisal Assets Accounting policy Cairn follows a successful-efforts based accounting policy for oil and gas assets.
Costs incurred prior to obtaining the legal rights to explore an area are expensed immediately to the Income Statement as pre-award costs.
Expenditure incurred on the acquisition of a licence interest is initially capitalised on a licence-by-licence basis.
Costs are held, undepleted, within intangible exploration appraisal assets until such time as the exploration phase on the licence area is complete or commercial reserves have been discovered and a field development plan approved.
Exploration expenditure incurred in the process of determining oil and gas exploration targets is capitalised initially within intangible exploration appraisal assets and subsequently allocated to drilling activities.
Costs are recognised following a cost accumulation model where any contingent future costs on recognition of an asset are recognised only when incurred.
This includes where Cairn has entered into a farm-in agreement to either acquire or part-dispose of an exploration interest.
A farm-in is an agreement in which a party agrees to acquire from one or more of the existing licencees, an interest in an exploration licence, for a consideration which may consist of the performance of a specified work obligation on behalf of the existing licencees.
This obligation may be subject to a monetary cap.
Refund of full or partial costs incurred to date may also be included in a farm-in agreement.
Where Cairn has part-disposed of an exploration licence interest through a farm-in arrangement, a farm-down, the contingent consideration payable by the third party on Cairns behalf is not recognised in the Financial Statements.
The future economic benefit which Cairn will receive as a result of the farm-down will be dependent upon future success of any exploration drilling.
Exploration appraisal drilling costs are capitalised on a well-by-well basis until the success or otherwise of the well has been established.
The success or failure of each exploration appraisal effort is judged on a well-by-well basis.
Drilling costs are written off on completion of a well unless the results indicate that hydrocarbon reserves exist and there is a reasonable prospect that these reserves are commercial and work to confirm the commercial viability of such hydrocarbons is intended to be carried out in the foreseeable future.
Where results of exploration drilling indicate the presence of hydrocarbons which are ultimately not considered commercially viable, all related costs are written off to the Income Statement.
Following appraisal of successful exploration wells, if commercial reserves are established and technical feasibility for extraction demonstrated and approved in a field development plan, then the related capitalised intangible exploration appraisal costs are transferred into a single field cost centre within property, plant & equipment development producing assets, after testing for impairment see below.
Proceeds from the disposal or farm-down of part or all of an exploration appraisal asset are credited initially to that interest with any excess being credited to the Income Statement.
Impairment Intangible exploration appraisal assets are reviewed regularly for indicators of impairment and tested for impairment where such indicators exist.
An indicator that one of the Groups assets may be impaired is most likely to be one of the following: There are no further plans to conduct exploration activities in the area: Exploration drilling in the area has failed to discover commercial reserve volumes: Changes in the oil price or other market conditions indicate that discoveries may no longer be commercial: or Development proposals for appraisal assets in the pre-development stage indicate that it is unlikely that the carrying value of the exploration appraisal asset will be recovered in full.
In such circumstances the intangible exploration appraisal asset is allocated to any property, plant & equipment development producing assets within the same CGU and tested for impairment.
Any impairment arising is recognised in the Income Statement for the year.
Where there are no development assets within the CGU, the excess of the carrying amount of the exploration appraisal asset over its recoverable amount is charged immediately to the Income Statement.

Costs of US$115.7m were transferred from intangible exploration appraisal assets to property, plant & equipment development producing assets during the year.
Additions in the current year of US$102.2m include US$25.9m incurred on Nova pre-development activities prior to re-classification as a development asset.
Well costs incurred in the year were US$18.2m for the P1863 Agar-Plantain well and US$16.7m for the P2184 Ekland well in the UK North Sea.
In the Norwegian North Sea US$17.1m was incurred for the PL682 Tethys well and US$6.2m for the PL790 Raudsen well.
Further costs of US$18.1m were incurred across the Groups other licences in the UK & Norway region.
Total additions funded through cash and working capital were US$104.9m, offset by a release of US$2.7m of provisions for well abandonment costs.
The Tethys, Ekland and Raudsen wells were unsuccessful and related costs of US$27.5m, US$14.6m and US$8.3m respectively were charged to the Income Statement in 2018.
Remaining unsuccessful costs of US$12.2m include US$8.0m relating to the P2077 Sunbeam licence where the well commitment has been transferred and the joint operators plan to relinquish.
Portfolio turnover in the UK & Norway during the year has resulted in the addition of three new licences in Norway, with three relinquished and one disposed of: and six new licences in the UK, with two relinquished.
Cairn has also entered into a farm-out agreement for a 40% non-operated interest in Licence P2312 containing the Chimera prospect.
This is conditional upon regulatory consent.
The net book value of exploration appraisal assets remaining capitalised at the year end of US$77.2m includes costs of US$35.9m relating to discovered resource across two fields: the current year Agar discovery US$18.2m and the Laverda discovery US$17.7m, both in the UK North Sea.
The remaining US$41.3m of costs have been incurred across further exploration licences in the UK and Norwegian North Sea, the Norwegian Sea and the Barents Sea.

Ireland During 2018 exploration additions of US$6.1m were incurred principally across two licences: LO16 18 and LO16 19.
Unsuccessful costs of US$0.9m were incurred on other licences in Ireland.
Total costs capitalised at the year end were US$14.8m.
Mexico Three exploration wells are planned in shallow water in the Gulf of Mexico commencing in the second half of 2019.
Two wells are planned in Block 9, with costs of US$11.9m incurred in 2018.
The third well is planned to be drilled in Block 7, with costs of US$3.4m incurred during the year.
A further US$2.6m was incurred on Block 15 during 2018.
Total costs capitalised in Mexico were US$31.0m at the balance sheet date.
Western Sahara Following the close out of licences, remaining accruals for US$15.4m have been released and are credited against additions and reverse prior-years unsuccessful exploration costs charges.
Others The remaining additions and carrying value within International assets of US$9.1m relates to licence acquisition and seismic costs on new licences.
Impairment review At the year end, Cairn reviewed its intangible exploration appraisal assets for indicators of impairment.
Indicators were identified where future exploration plans remain uncertain or where the carrying value of assets relating to discovered resource may not be fully recovered through future development and production.
Subsequent impairment tests performed did not identify any impairment.
2.3 Property, Plant & Equipment Development Producing Assets Accounting policy Costs All costs incurred after the technical feasibility and commercial viability of producing hydrocarbons has been demonstrated and a development plan approved, are capitalised within development producing assets on a field-by-field basis.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only where it either enhances the economic benefits of the development producing asset or replaces part of the existing development producing asset.
Any remaining costs associated with the part replaced are expensed.
Costs of borrowings relating to the ongoing construction of development producing assets and facilities are capitalised during the development phase of the project.
Capitalisation ceases once the asset is ready to commence production.
Net proceeds from any disposal, part-disposal or farm-down of development producing assets are credited against the appropriate portion of previously capitalised cost.
A gain or loss on disposal of a development producing asset is recognised in the Income Statement to the extent that the net proceeds, measured at fair value, exceed or are less than the appropriate portion of the net capitalised costs.
Depletion Depletion is charged on a unit-of-production basis, based on proved and probable reserves on a field-by-field basis.
Fields within a single development area may be combined for depletion purposes.
Where production commences prior to completion of the development, costs to be depleted include the costs-to-complete of the facility required to extract the volume of reserves recorded.
Impairment Development producing assets are reviewed for indicators of impairment at the balance sheet date.
Indicators of impairment for the Groups development assets include: Downward revisions of reserve estimates: Increases in cost estimates for development projects: or A decrease in the oil price or other negative changes in market conditions.
Impairment tests are carried out on each development producing asset at the balance sheet date where an indicator of impairment is identified.
The test compares the carrying value of an asset to its recoverable amount based on the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal or value in use.
Where the fair value less costs of disposal supports the carrying value of the asset, no value-in-use calculation isperformed.
If it is not possible to calculate the fair value less costs of disposal of an individual asset, the fair value less costs of disposal is calculated for the CGU containing the asset and tested against the carrying value of the assets and liabilities in the CGU for impairment.
Where an asset can be tested independently for impairment, this test is performed prior to the inclusion of the asset into a CGU for further impairment tests.
If the carrying amount of the asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment charge is made.
Where there has been a charge for impairment in an earlier period that charge will be reversed in a later period where there has been a change in circumstances to the extent that the recoverable amount is higher than the net book value at the time.
In reversing impairment losses, the carrying amount of the asset will be increased to the lower of its original carrying value or the carrying value that would have been determined net of depletion had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years.

Cairn recognises the full discounted cost of decommissioning as an asset and liability when the obligation to rectify environmental damage arises.
The decommissioning asset is included within property, plant & equipment development producing assets with the cost of the related installation.
The liability is included within provisions.
Revisions to the estimated costs of decommissioning which alter the level of the provisions required are also reflected in adjustments to the decommissioning asset.
The amortisation of the asset is calculated on a unit-of-production basis based on proved and probable reserves.
The amortisation of the asset is included in the depletion charge in the Income Statement and the unwinding of discount of the provision is included within finance costs.

During Q4 further development costs of US$13.6m were incurred in relation to the field.
The UK Kraken and Catcher fields ramped up production during 2018 with gross production of 30,300 and 43,000 boepd respectively.
Combined depletion charges for the year were US$153.0m 2017: US$17.4m.
Kraken additions represent development activity spend of US$31.8m 2017: US$100.0m, all funded through cash and working capital, which was offset by a US$23.0m reversal of accruals following the successful renegotiation of the development drilling rig contract.
During 2017, there was a further US$9.6m of non-cash decommissioning asset increases.
The decommissioning asset remains unchanged in 2018.
On Catcher, additions funded through cash and working capital during the year were US$28.8m 2017: US$83.9m with further non-cash additions of US$5.3m 2017: US$19.0m relating to the increase in the Catcher decommissioning asset.

Further additions in 2017 of US$4.1m represent the recognition of a decommissioning asset associated with the FPSO.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the lease agreement was amended which reduced the finance lease liability by US$36.4m and a corresponding reduction to the leased production asset.
In the second half of 2018, the lease agreement was further amended resulting in a reduction of the lease liability and right-of-use asset by US$11.5m see note 3.4.
Amortisation of US$18.2m 2017: US$3.4m was charged against the FPSO in the year.
Impairment review At the year end, impairment tests were conducted on the Groups UK & Norway development producing assets, resulting in an impairment charge of US$166.3m on the UK Kraken producing asset.
No impairment arose on either Catcher or Nova.
Sensitivity analysis on the Groups impairment charge can be found in note 2.7.
The impairment on Kraken reflects performance of the field to the balance sheet date that is below expectations and has led to a reserves downgrade at the year end.
During 2017, impairments of US$23.0m were reversed due to an increase in the volume of oil reserves estimated to be recoverable through production on Catcher.
All previous impairments recorded on the Catcher development producing asset have been fully reversed.

Operating lease costs for items directly attributable to oil and gas exploration and development activities, such as drilling rigs, are capitalised within intangible exploration appraisal assets or property, plant & equipment development producing assets as appropriate.
At the year end, Cairn had the following operating lease commitments relating to oil and gas exploration, appraisal and development activities including commitments for leases that are yet to commence.
These amounts are also included in total capital commitments above and exclude operating lease commitments relating to producing activities.

2.6 Intangible Assets Goodwill Accounting policy Cairn allocates the purchase consideration on the acquisition of a subsidiary to the assets and liabilities acquired on the basis of fair value at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the assets and liabilities is recognised as goodwill.
Any goodwill arising is recognised as an asset and is subject to annual review for impairment.
Goodwill is written off where circumstances indicate that the recoverable amount of the underlying CGU including the asset may no longer support the carrying value of goodwill.
Any such impairment loss arising is recognised in the Income Statement for the year.
Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future years.
In testing for impairment, goodwill arising on business combinations is allocated from the date of acquisition to the group of CGUs representing the lowest level at which it will be monitored.
Cairns policy is to monitor goodwill at operating segment level.
Currently, no operating segments containing goodwill are combined into segments for reporting.
The recoverable amount of a CGU, or group of CGUs, within the segment is based on its fair value less costs of disposal, using estimated cash flow projections over the licence period of the exploration assets risk-weighted for future exploration success.
The key assumptions are sensitive to market fluctuations and the success of future exploration drilling programmes.
The most likely factor which will result in a material change to the recoverable amount of the CGU is the result of future exploration drilling, which will determine the licence areas future economic potential.

142 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial Statements Section 2 Oil and Gas Assets and Operations continued 2.7 Impairment Testing Sensitivity Analysis UK & Norway At 31 December 2018, impairment tests were conducted on the Groups development producing assets, on goodwill and on certain exploration appraisal assets where indicators of impairment were identified.
The recoverable amount for all assets is based on fair value less costs of disposal estimated using discounted cash flow modelling.
The key assumptions used in determining the fair value are often subjective, such as the future long-term oil price assumption, or the operational performance of the assets.
With Cairns two North Sea producing assets completing their first full year of production, reserve estimates have been updated to reflect the performance of fields to the balance sheet date, which have either been in line or exceeded pre-drill estimates for the Catcher asset but have been below expectations for the Kraken asset where performance issues with the FPSO have led to lower than expected daily production volumes.
Following a downgrade of recoverable reserves in place at the year end, an impairment charge has been recorded on the Kraken asset of US$166.3m.
Cairn has run sensitivities on its long-term oil price assumption of US$70 boe, using alternate long-term price assumptions of US$65 boe and US$60 boe and a long-term assumption equal to the forward curve price at the end of the Groups three-year short-term assumption period US$66.3 boe.
These are considered to be reasonably possible changes for the purposes of sensitivity analysis.
There was no impairment of the Groups exploration appraisal assets under any of the sensitivities run.
The impact of these changes on the impairment recorded on the Groups development producing assets together with the impairment that would arise on goodwill at the balance sheet date is summarised below: Forward Curve US$65 US$60 Reduction in long-term oil price assumption to: US$m US$m US$m Impairment of development producing assets 205.9 218.6 272.7 Impairment of goodwill 18.5 23.0 42.6 Total impairment 224.4 241.6 315.3 All impairment arising on development producing asset sensitivities relates to the Kraken asset and the numbers above would replace the current impairment charge of US$166.3m.
The Groups proved and probable and contingent reserve estimates are based on P50 probabilities.
P10 and P90 estimates are also produced but would not provide a reasonable estimate to be used in calculating the fair value of the Groups assets.
The reserve estimates are incorporated into production profiles which include assumptions on the performance of the asset.
Cairns current assumptions imply a maximum uptime for producing assets of 85%-90%.
Further sensitivity analysis was performed on the Kraken asset reducing forecast production volumes and associated operating costs by 5% and 10%, as an approximation of a reduction in the uptime of the asset, which are seen as reasonably possible alternatives.
With this reduced production, the following impairment charges would arise on development producing assets no impairment arises on goodwill : 5% reduction 10% reduction in production in production Reduction in production volumes: US$m US$m Impairment of development producing assets 219.9 271.3 No sensitivities have been performed on Catcher production volumes where performance has been either in line or ahead of expectations.
Therefore there is no evidence to suggest that reduced production levels would be a reasonably possible alternative assumption to apply.
Senegal The Groups exploration assets in Senegal have been tested for impairment as a single cash generating unit.
Downside sensitivity analysis performed on reasonably possible changes in assumptions, including the Groups oil price assumption using the sensitivities above, did not identify an impairment.
Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 143 Financial Statements Section 3 Financial Assets, Working Capital and Long-term Liabilities This section includes details of the Groups cash resources and the loans and borrowings drawn in the year, together with details of the finance lease liability recognised on the Kraken FPSO.
Key accounting issues in this section include the impact on Cairns financial assets of the sale by the IITD of the majority of Cairns shares in Vedanta Limited.
Significant accounting judgements in this section: Lease classification of Kraken and Catcher FPSO lease agreements Cairn is party to lease agreements on its North Sea producing assets for the charter of an FPSO on each licence.
In determining whether each lease should be classified as either a finance lease or an operating lease, Cairn has considered the substance of both transactions individually, including the term of each lease in relation to the expected life of the asset and whether options to purchase the FPSO at the end of the lease term are reasonably certain to be exercised.
Cairn concluded that the lease agreement for the Kraken FPSO, where it is considered reasonably certain that the FPSO will be purchased by the joint operation toward the end of the initial term, should be classified as a finance lease.
By contrast, the Catcher FPSO, with a shorter initial lease term and with no current expectation that the joint operation shall purchase the FPSO at the end of that lease term, was determined to be an operating lease, with substantially all risks and rewards of ownership remaining with the lessor.
The new accounting standard, IFRS 16 Leases, is effective for Cairns financial year beginning 1 January 2019 and will require the Catcher FPSO operating leased asset to be recognised on the Balance Sheet as a right-of-use asset.
Further details are provided in note 1.1b.
Key estimates and assumptions in this section: Measurement of Kraken FPSO finance lease The measurement of the Kraken FPSO lease liability of US$200.8m on initial recognition was: Calculated from the date the lease agreement became effective which was on commencement of the lease in June 2017: Based on minimum lease commitments of 50% from the end of the ramp-up period the period from first oil production to the FPSO operating at contracted performance levels in the original lease term, with no adjustment for a contingent Interim Production Period agreement: Inclusive of the final optional purchase price of US$56.6m: Inclusive of refunds due after commencement of the lease resulting from delays in delivering the FPSO: and Calculated using an interest rate based on the Groups incremental borrowing rate at commencement rather than a rate determined in the lease agreement which could not be readily determined.
Post initial recognition, adjustments of US$36.4m in 2017 and US$11.5m in 2018 have reduced the lease liability and right-of-use asset following amendments to the lease agreement.
The revised liability is computed based on updated minimum lease commitments using an interest rate calculated at the date of the modification.
Minimum lease payments were reduced to nil during an interim production period which ran from the end of the ramp-up period in 2017 through to September 2018 when the partners in the joint operation agreed a further amendment to the original lease agreement.

Foreign exchange differences related entirely to the EFF.
RBL The Groups RBL facility had cash drawings of US$85.0m at 31 December 2018, all advanced in the year.
Cairn has signed an extension to its existing RBL facility with a syndicate of international banks.
The extension became effective on 20 December 2018 and brought the Nova asset into the borrowing base.
Interest on outstanding debt is charged at the appropriate LIBOR for the currency drawn plus an applicable margin.
The facility remains subject to bi-annual redeterminations, has a market standard suite of covenants and is cross-guaranteed by all Group companies party to the facility.
Debt is repayable in line with the amortisation of bank commitments over the period from 1 July 2022 to the extended final maturity date of 31 December 2025.
Under IFRS 9, the extension of the facility to December 2025 constitutes substantially different terms from the original and as such the financial liability relating to the original facility was extinguished on the date of the extension and replaced with a new liability based on the revised terms.
This resulted in the acceleration of the amortisation of borrowing costs relating to the previous facility, resulting in a charge of US$15.1m to the Income Statement in the year.
Total commitments remain unchanged at US$575.0m under the revised facility, but an accordion feature permits additional future commitments of up to US$425.0m.
The maximum available drawdown is currently forecast to be US$478.0m during the life of the facility.
The facility can also be used for general corporate purposes and may also be used to issue letters of credit and performance guarantees for the Group of up to US$250.0m.
EFF As at 31 December 2018, US$27.1m NOK 233.8m was drawn under the Norwegian EFF.
The maximum available amount is currently forecast to be US$59.0m NOK 446.3m.
During the year, US$32.4m was drawn under the facility and US$31.2m repaid following receipt of the tax refund.
Cairn signed an extension to its existing EFF in December 2018.
The extension became effective 31 December 2018 and increased total commitments to NOK 700.0m, with an accordion feature permitting additional future commitments of up to NOK 300.0m.
The extension of this facility has no material impact on the results for the year.
Interest on outstanding debt is charged at the appropriate NIBOR plus an applicable margin.
Debt is repayable by the final maturity date, which is now the earlier of 31 December 2022 or the date of receipt of the tax refund relating to exploration spend for 2021.
Details of guarantees granted under these facilities can be found in note 6.3.
146 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial Statements Section 3 Financial Assets, Working Capital and Long-term Liabilities continued 3.4 Finance Lease Liability Accounting policy Finance lease liabilities are measured at inception and recorded on commencement of the asset being brought in to use.
Measurement is based on the lower of fair value of the asset or the net present value of minimum lease commitments.
Lease payments made in excess of the minimum commitment are charged direct to the Income Statement as variable lease costs.
Lease payments are allocated between capital and interest based on the rate implicit in the lease agreement.
Where this is not practical to determine, the Groups incremental borrowing rate is used.
Where there are changes subsequent to initial recognition, adjustments are made to both the lease liability and the capitalised asset.
The interest rate used where the rate implicit in the lease is not determinable is updated at the date of the remeasurement.

The lease agreement became effective on commencement.
This agreement is considered to be a finance lease and commenced on the date of first oil production on 23 June 2017.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the lease agreement was amended to incorporate an interim production period, commencing in November 2017 and which concluded on commencement of a second amendment agreement in September 2018.
During this interim period, minimum lease payments were reduced to nil, with all lease payments dependent upon the availability and performance of the FPSO.
The second amendment agreement provided additional compensation to the joint venture partners for ongoing performance issues with the FPSO and also introduced a zero hire rate effective after 72 hours of a period of shutdown.
Amounts due to Cairn from the lessor of US$3.0m 2017: US$1.4m have been offset by the lessor against outstanding invoices disputed by the operator.
Cairn fully expects to recover this amount, and the receivable is recognised within other receivables.
Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 147 Financial Statements 3.5 Trade and Other Receivables Accounting policy Trade receivables represent amounts due from the sale of oil and gas from the Groups UK producing assets and royalty payments receivable from producing fields in Mongolia.
Other receivables primarily represent recharges to joint operations.
Joint operation receivables are receivables that relate to Cairns interest in its oil and gas joint arrangements, including Cairns participating interest share of the other receivables of the joint arrangements themselves.
Trade receivables, other receivables and joint operation receivables, which are financial assets, are measured initially at fair value and subsequently recorded at amortised cost.
A loss allowance is recognised, where material, for expected credit losses on all financial assets held at the balance sheet date.
Expected credit losses are the difference between the contractual cash flows due to Cairn, and the discounted actual cash flows that are expected to be received.
Where there has been no significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, the loss allowance is equal to 12-month expected credit losses.
Where the increase in credit risk is considered significant, lifetime credit losses are provided.
For trade receivables a lifetime credit loss is recognised on initial recognition where material.
Prepayments, which are not financial assets, are measured at historic cost.

Revenue is recognised at the point in time where title passes to the customer and payment becomes unconditional.
Following the draw-down on the RBL facility in 2018, facility fees of US$15.1m held in prepayments at 31 December 2017, were netted against the loan balance and then amortised over the useful life of the loan.
US$50.6m of dividends receivable from Cairn India Limited were accrued to 31 December 2016.
In April 2017, on the merger of Cairn India Limited with Vedanta Limited, a further dividend of US$52.4m was declared, which increased the total due to Cairn to US$104.7m, after exchange adjustments.
Post declaration of the April 2017 dividend, the IITD has seized the funds due to Cairn from Vedanta Limited in part-settlement of the assessment order issued relating to the disputed retrospective tax demand.
Consequently a loss allowance was recognised in 2017 against the dividends receivable.
No further dividend income due to Cairn, but seized by the IITD, has since been recognised.
As at 31 December 2018, following the declaration of further dividends, the total of dividends receivable by Cairn, seized by the IITD is US$164.2m.

The 2017 non-cash movement mainly relates to the loss allowance recognised on the dividends receivable from Vedanta Limited.
The increase in trade and other receivables movements through operating cash flows primarily reflects the increase in trade receivables held at the year end.

Mark-to-market gains on oil price hedge options are recorded as financial assets at 31 December 2018.
At 31 December 2018 the Group had hedged 2.7m barrels of 2019 Kraken and Catcher oil production, using collar structures.
The weighted average floor and ceiling prices are US$67.07 bbl and US$83.08 bbl respectively all prices quoted relate to dated Brent.
In addition, at 31 December 2018, the Group had hedged 500,000 barrels of 2020 oil production using a collar with floor and ceiling prices of US$67.50 bbl and US$87.50 bbl respectively.
Further hedging of 2020 production has continued post the balance sheet date.
The collar structures have been designated as hedges for hedge accounting.
Hedge effectiveness is assessed at commencement of the option and prospectively thereafter.
At the year end, the closing Brent oil price was US$50.70 bbl, below the floor price of all collars entered into.
Fair value movements on the cost of the option are recorded in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year, with fair value gains of US$43.9m being offset by a loss of US$7.8m 2017: nil on options that matured in the year 2017 restated: fair value loss of US$2.9m.

The Board of Cairn Energy PLC, through the Treasury Sub-Committee, reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and these are summarised below.
The Groups Treasury function and Executive Team as appropriate are responsible for managing these risks, in accordance with the policies set by the Board.
Management of these risks is carried out by monitoring of cash flows, investment and funding requirements using a variety of techniques.
These potential exposures are managed whilst ensuring that the Company and the Group have adequate liquidity at all times in order to meet their immediate cash requirements.
There are no significant concentrations of risks unless otherwise stated.
The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivatives, for speculative purposes.
The primary financial assets and liabilities comprise cash, short and medium-term deposits, notice accounts, tri-party purchase transactions repos, certificates of deposit, money market liquidity funds, listed equity shares, intra-group loans and other receivables and financial liabilities held at amortised cost.
The Groups strategy has been to finance its operations through a mixture of retained profits, bank borrowings and other production related streaming agreements.
Other alternatives such as equity issues and other forms of non-investment-grade debt finance are reviewed by the Board, when appropriate.
Commodity price risk Commodity price risk arises principally from the Groups North Sea production, which could adversely affect revenue and debt availability due to changes in commodity prices.
The Group measures commodity price risk through an analysis of the potential impact of changing commodity prices.
Based on this analysis and considering materiality and the potential business impact, the Group may choose to hedge.
Linked to production in the UK North Sea, the Group continued to hedge during 2018 in order to protect debt capacity and support committed capital programmes.
Details of current hedging arrangements, together with oil price sensitivity analysis, can be found in note 3.6.
Transacted derivatives are designated, where possible, in cash flow hedge relationships to minimise accounting income statement volatility.
The Group is required to assess the likely effectiveness of any proposed cash flow hedging relationship and demonstrate that the hedging relationship is expected to be highly effective prior to entering into a hedging instrument and at subsequent reporting dates.
Liquidity risk The Group closely monitors and manages its liquidity risk using both short and long-term cash flow projections, supplemented by debt and equity financing plans and active portfolio management.
Cash forecasts are regularly produced and sensitivities run for different scenarios including, but not limited to, changes in asset production profiles and cost schedules.
The Groups forecasts show that the Group will be able to operate within its current debt facilities and have financial headroom for the 12 months from the date of approval of the 2018 Annual Report and Accounts.
Details of the Groups debt facilities can be found in note 3.3.
The Group is subject to quarterly forecast liquidity tests as part of the RBL facility agreement.
The Group has complied with the liquidity requirements of this test at all times during the year.
The Group runs various sensitivities on its liquidity position on a quarterly basis throughout the year.
Further details are noted in the Viability Statement provided on page 33.
The Group invests cash in a combination of money market liquidity funds, repos, notice accounts and term deposits with a number of international and UK financial institutions, ensuring sufficient liquidity to enable the Group to meet its short and medium-term expenditure requirements.
Credit risk Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, investments with banks and financial institutions, trade receivables and joint operation receivables.
Customers and joint operation partners are subject to a risk assessment using publicly available information and credit reference agencies, with follow-up due diligence and monitoring if required.
Investment credit risk for investments with banks and other financial institutions is managed by the Group Treasury function in accordance with the Board-approved policies of Cairn Energy PLC.
These policies limit counterparty exposure, maturity, collateral and take account of published ratings, market measures and other market information.
The limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate the risk of financial loss through counterparty failure.
It is Cairns policy to invest with banks or other financial institutions that firstly offer the greatest degree of security in the view of the Group and, secondly the most competitive interest rates.
Repayment of principal is the overriding priority and this is achieved by diversification and shorter maturities to provide flexibility.
The Board continually re-assesses the Groups policy and updates as required.
At the year end the Group does not have any significant concentrations of bad debt risk.
As at 31 December 2018 the Group had investments with 7 counterparties 2017: 9 to ensure no concentration of counterparty investment risk.
The reduction in the number of counterparties holding investments reflects the Groups reduced cash balance.
At 31 December 2018 all of these investments were instant access.
At 31 December 2017 the investments ranged from instant access to one month.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by the carrying value as at the balance sheet date.
Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 153 Financial Statements 3.10 Financial Risk Management: Objectives and Policies continued Foreign currency risk Cairn manages exposures that arise from non-functional currency receipts and payments by matching receipts and payments in the same currency and actively managing the residual net position.
The Group also aims where possible to hold surplus cash, debt and working capital balances in the functional currency of the subsidiary, thereby matching the reporting currency and functional currency of most companies in the Group.
This minimises the impact of foreign exchange movements on the Groups Balance Sheet.
Where residual net exposures do exist and they are considered significant, the Company and Group may from time to time opt to use derivative financial instruments to minimise exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to movements in the US$:GBP and US$:NOK exchange rates, with all other variables held constant, on the Groups monetary assets and liabilities.
The Groups exposure to foreign currency changes for all other currencies is not material.

The effect on the loss before tax is due to inter-group loans between subsidiaries with differing functional currencies.

The primary inputs to the model are consistent with those of the other share award schemes, though vesting percentages for LTIPs can be above 100%.
For details on the vesting conditions attached to the LTIPs refer to the Directors Remuneration Report on page 107.
The other Cairn Energy PLC share awards during 2018 were also valued using a Monte Carlo model.
Awards in prior years were valued similarly.
Cairn Energy PLC share options were exercised on a regular basis throughout the year, subject to the normal employee dealing bans imposed by the Company at certain times.
The weighted average share price during the year was 2.14 2017: 2.01.
The main inputs to the models include the number of options, share price, leaver rate, trigger points, discount rate and volatility.
Leaver rate assumptions are based on past history of employees leaving the Company prior to options vesting and are revised to equal the number of options that ultimately vest.
Trigger points are based on the length of time after the vesting periods for awards in 2018, further details are below.
The risk-free rate is based on the yield on a zero-coupon government bond with a term equal to the expected term on the option being valued.
Volatility was determined as the annualised standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the shares of a peer group of similar companies selected from the FTSE, as disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 109, over a 3-year period to the date of award.

Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 161 Financial Statements Section 5 Taxation This section highlights the Groups taxation policies, including both the accounting policy and wider strategy and governance policies.
Analysis is provided of the Groups Income Statement tax charges and credits and deferred tax movements through the Balance Sheet.
This section also includes details of the contingent liability relating to the Indian Tax dispute where final international arbitration proceedings were held during the year.
Significant accounting judgements in this section: Deferred taxation At each reporting date, Cairn reviews unused tax losses and allowances to assess whether it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the Group can utilise these losses and allowances and whether or not a deferred tax asset should be recognised.
At 31 December 2017 and 2018, Cairn concluded that no deferred tax asset should be recognised.
Contingent liability Indian tax Cairn continue to resolutely defend the Groups position in India following the tax assessment order and demand notice issued by the Indian Income Tax Department.
Final hearings in the international arbitration proceedings were held in 2018 with the award of the arbitration panel expected in 2019.
Cairn remains confident that the Group will be successful in the arbitration and therefore no provision is made in the Financial Statements for any amount demanded by the Indian Income Tax Department.
Full details on the contingent liability are given in note 5.5.
Key estimates and assumptions in this section: Future taxable profits used in determining whether it is appropriate to recognise a deferred tax asset are based on the key assumptions used in impairment testing, detailed in section 2.
Downside sensitivities are used to determine the extent to which future taxable profits are probable.
Accounting policy The total tax charge or credit represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
The current tax credit is based on the taxable loss for the year.
Taxable profit or loss differs from net profit or loss as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
In Norway, tax refunds may be claimed on qualifying exploration activities and related overhead costs: the tax refundable is included as a tax credit in the period in which the qualifying expenditure is incurred.
Where there are uncertain tax positions, Cairn assess whether it is probable that the position adopted in tax filings will be accepted by the relevant tax authority, with the results of this assessment determining the accounting that follows.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the Financial Statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences that exist only where it is probable that taxable profits will be generated against which the carrying value of the deferred tax asset can be recovered.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint operations where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
A deferred tax asset or liability is not recognised if a temporary difference arises on initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
However, where the recognition of an asset is associated with an interest in a joint operation, which applies to all Cairns intangible exploration appraisal asset and property, plant & equipment development producing asset additions, and Cairn is not able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference or the temporary difference is expected to reverse in the foreseeable future, a deferred tax asset or liability shall be recognised.
Current and deferred tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
162 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial Statements Section 5 Taxation continued 5.1 Tax Strategy and Governance The Groups tax strategy is fully aligned with its overarching business objectives and principles.
In its approach to tax Cairn aims to be a good corporate citizen, managing its tax affairs in a transparent and responsible manner in all the jurisdictions in which it operates.
Cairn is committed to having open and constructive relationships with all tax authorities.
For the past several years, the Groups UK activities have been focused on assets at exploration, appraisal and development stages with no production: but from 2017, receipt of production income recommenced.
Due to the level of costs incurred in developing the fields which came on-stream in 2017, there are no taxable profits in 2018 and it is unlikely that any taxable profits will be realised for several years.
Taxable profits in other jurisdictions, where Cairns assets are at various stages of the value creation cycle, are also minimal and as a result there were no cash payments of corporation taxes made during the year 2017:US$nil.
Cairn undertakes tax planning that supports the business and reflects commercial and economic activity.
The Groups policy is to not enter into any artificial tax avoidance schemes but to build and maintain strong collaborative working relationships with all relevant tax authorities based on transparency and integrity.
The Group aims for certainty in relation to the tax treatment of all items: however, it is acknowledged that this will not always be possible, for example where transactions are complex or there is a lack of maturity in the tax regime in the relevant jurisdiction in which the Group is operating.
In such circumstances Cairn will seek external advice where appropriate and ensure that the approach adopted in any relevant tax return includes full disclosure of the position taken.

166 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial Statements Section 5 Taxation continued 5.5 Contingent Liability Indian Tax Assessment In January 2014 Cairn UK Holdings Limited CUHL, a direct subsidiary of Cairn Energy PLC, received notification from the IITD that it was restricted from selling its shareholding in Cairn India Limited CIL : at that time the shareholding was approximately 10% and had a market valuation of INR 60bn US$1.0bn.
In that notification, the IITD claimed to have identified unassessed taxable income resulting from certain intra-group share transfers undertaken in 2006 the 2006 Transactions, such transactions having been undertaken in order to facilitate the IPO of CIL in 2007.
The notification made reference to retrospective Indian tax legislation enacted in 2012, which the IITD was seeking to apply to the 2006 Transactions.
Following the merger in April 2017 of CIL and Vedanta Limited, CUHLs shareholding in CIL was replaced by a shareholding of approximately 5% in Vedanta Limited issued together with preference shares.
In addition to attaching CUHLs shares in Vedanta Limited, the IITD seized dividends due to CUHL from those shareholdings totalling INR 11.4bn US$164.2m.
The IITD has also notified Cairn that a tax refund of INR 15.9bn US$249.0m due to CUHL as a result of overpayment of capital gains tax on a separate matter in 2011, has been applied as partial payment of the tax assessment of the 2006 Transactions.
This tax refund was previously classified in Cairns accounts as a contingent asset where the inflow of economic benefits was considered less than probable.
The IITD holds CUHL as an assessee in default in respect of tax demanded on the 2006 transactions, and as such has pursued enforcement against CUHLs assets in India.
To date these enforcement actions have included attachment of CUHLs shareholding in Vedanta Limited and sale of 181,764,297 shares and seizure of the proceeds, seizure of the proceeds from the redemption of the preference shares, seizure of the US$164.2m dividends due to CUHL as described above, and offset of a US$249.0m tax refund due to CUHL in respect of another matter.
To date 99% of CUHLs shareholding has been liquidated by the IITD see note 3.1.
The assessment by the IITD of principal tax due on the 2006 Transactions is INR 102bn US$1.6bn, plus applicable interest and penalties.
Interest is currently being charged on the principal at a rate of 12% per annum from February 2017, although this is potentially subject to the IITDs Indian court appeal that interest should be back-dated to 2007.
Penalties are currently assessed as 100% of the principal tax due, although this is subject to appeal by CUHL that penalties should not be charged given the retrospective nature of the tax levied.
The Group has legal advice confirming that the maximum amount that could ultimately be recovered from Cairn by the IITD, in excess of the assets already seized, is limited to the value of CUHLs assets, principally the remaining ordinary shares in Vedanta Limited.
In March 2015 Cairn filed a Notice of Dispute under the UK-India Bilateral Investment Treaty the Treaty in order to protect its legal position and seek restitution of the value effectively seized by the IITD in and since January 2014.
Cairns principal claims are that the assurance of fair and equitable treatment and protections against expropriation afforded by the Treaty have been breached by the actions of the IITD, which is seeking to apply retrospective taxes to historical transactions already closely scrutinised and approved by the Government of India.
The IITD has attached and seized assets to try to enforce such taxation.
Cairns plea is therefore that the effects of the tax assessment should be nullified and that Cairn should receive recompense from India for the loss of value resulting from the 2014 attachment of CUHLs shares in CIL and the withholding of the tax refund, which together total approximately US$1.4bn.
The Treaty proceedings formally commenced in January 2016 following agreement between Cairn and the Republic of India on the appointment of a panel of three international arbitrators under the terms of the Treaty.
Cairns statement of claim was submitted to the arbitral tribunal in June 2016 and the Republic of India submitted its statement of defence in February 2017.
Further submissions and document production took place in 2017 and 2018.
The main evidentiary hearing of Cairns claim under the Treaty took place in August 2018 in The Hague with a final hearing in December 2018.
All formal hearings and submissions have now been made and the tribunal is in the process of drafting its award.
Based on detailed legal advice, Cairn remains confident that it will be successful in this arbitration and accordingly no provision has been made for any of the tax or penalties assessed by the IITD.

c Foreign currency translation Unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses arising on consolidation of non-US$ functional currency subsidiary undertakings are taken directly to reserves.
Foreign exchange differences arising on intra-group loans are not eliminated on consolidation: this reflects the exposure to currency fluctuations where the subsidiaries involved have differing functional currencies.
These intra-group loans are not considered to be an investment in a foreign operation.
