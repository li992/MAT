NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 18.
Trade and other receivables continued 120 movement in the allowance for doubtful debts THE GROUP 2013 2012 m m At 1 January 48.3 54.5 Amounts written off during the year 26.0 21.7 Increase in allowance recognised in the income statement 11.6 15.5 At 31 December 33.9 48.3 In determining the recoverability of the trade receivables, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable that may have occurred between the date credit was initially granted and the reporting date.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that no further credit provision is required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
Included in the Groups trade receivable balance are debtors unprovided against with a carrying amount of 62.3m 2012: 57.4m which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not identified a significant change in credit quality and as such, the Group considers that the amounts are still recoverable and therefore there is no allowance for doubtful debts.
Except for some instances of personal guarantees the Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
Ageing of past due but not impaired receivables THE GROUP Days overdue 2013 2012 m m 0 30 days 44.2 44.5 31 60 days 10.7 8.6 61 90 days 7.4 4.3 62.3 57.4 Included in the allowance for doubtful debts are specific trade receivables with a balance of 11.9m 2012: 27.2m which have been placed into liquidation.
The impairment represents the difference between the carrying amount of the specific trade receivable and the amount it is anticipated will be recovered.
None of the Companys debts are overdue.
The directors do not consider there to be any significant credit risk, as the majority of the debt is due from subsidiaries.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and cash deposits with an original maturity of three months or less held by the Group and Company, net of overdrafts.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.
