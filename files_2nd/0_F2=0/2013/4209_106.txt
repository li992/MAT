Notes to the Company Accounts A.
Profit and loss account Of the Groups profit for the year, 96.2m 2012: 167.4m is dealt with in the profit and loss account of the Company which was approved by the Board on 5 March 2014 but which is not presented as permitted by s. 408 Companies Act 2006.
Included in the Company profit and loss account is a charge of 0.1m 2012: 0.1m in respect of the Companys audit fee.
Retirement benefit obligations The Companys employees are members of the UK defined benefit scheme, details of which are disclosed in note 12 to the Group financial statements.
Whilst the Group reports under IFRS, the UK GAAP equivalent figures for the UK scheme would not be significantly different.
As the Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of of the scheme, due mainly to changes in the Groups corporate structure over the years, the Company has accounted as though the scheme was a defined contribution scheme and has charged the contributions paid each year to the profit and loss account.
