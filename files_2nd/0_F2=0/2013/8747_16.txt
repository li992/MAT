It included legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax to 21% with effect from 1 April 2014 and 20% from 1 April 2015.
The lower rate of 20% has been used to determine the overall net deferred tax liability, as the temporary differences are expected to reverse at the lower rate.
The reversal of the deferred tax asset, in relation to capital losses, is dependent on the availability of capital gains on future disposals.
This asset is likely to be reversed after more than 12 months.
The deferred tax liabilities are expected to unwind after more than 12 months.
