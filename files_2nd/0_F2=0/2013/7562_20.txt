The fees are then amortised over the life of the facility.
The Groups current facility expires in July 2016.
At the current and prior period ends, the amount of fees relating to the period in excess of one year from the balance sheet date were greater than the corresponding amounts drawn down under the facility, thereby creating a net debit balance as shown above.
At the current period end, the amount of fees relating to the period less than one year from the balance sheet date was also greater than the corresponding amount drawn down, creating a further net debit balance.
All borrowings are in sterling.
The weighted average interest rates paid on the borrowings were as follows: 52 weeks to 53 weeks to 28 December 2013 29 December 2012 % % 2.5 2.9 The directors estimate the fair value of the Groups borrowings are as follows: 28 December 2013 29 December 2012 m m 1.0 0.1 127 Notes to the Company balance sheet continued 8 PROVISIONS Property provision Total m m At 29 December 2012 8.9 8.9 Additional provision in the period 1.7 1.7 Utilisation of provision in the period 8.1 8.1 At 28 December 2013 2.5 2.5 The property provision covers onerous leases on any non-trading leased properties.
For some properties, the provision is based on the shortfall between rent payable and rent receivable.
For other properties, where negotiations to surrender the lease are in progress, the provision is based on the amount which the landlord has indicated that they are willing to take as a premium in order for the Group to surrender the lease.
The provision is based on the period until the end of the lease, or until the Group considers that it can cover the shortfall by subletting, assigning, or surrendering the lease.
Throughout the course of the year the Group reviews the range of options for unused properties, and maintains ongoing discussions with landlords and external agents, with a view to identifying possible lease surrenders and finding tenants.
The property provision also includes amounts for any related shortfalls in business rates on these properties, and for dilapidations, agents fees and other professional fees.
During the current period, the property provision has been increased by 0.1m arising from an unwinding of the discount rate over time.
None of this amount relates to a change in the discount rate.
The amount of the expected future cash flows has been adjusted to reflect the expected range of possibilities and, as the outflows under this provision are expected to take place over a number or years, the provision has been discounted to its present value.
The timing of outflows from the provision is variable dependent on property lease expiry dates and also on opportunities to surrender leases.
