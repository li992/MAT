Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset where they relate to the same taxation authority and net settlement and offset is permitted.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: 27 December 2013 28 December 2012 $000 $000 Deferred tax assets 109,181 89,193 Deferred tax liabilities 4,948 4,891 104,233 84,302 At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of $716,703,068 2012: $539,850,605 and unused tax credits of $38,192,791 2012: $33,945,792 available for offset against future profits.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining unused tax losses of $498,808,643 2012: $315,635,132 and unused tax credits of $26,728,251 2012: $25,454,151 due to either a history of tax losses, uncertain tax positions, or it is not considered probable that there will be sufficient future taxable profits to realise the benefit of all deferred tax assets within certain subsidiary entities.
Included in unrecognised tax losses and unrecognised tax credits are tax losses of $212,129,934 2012: $72,278,400 and tax credits of $26,728,251 2012: $25,454,151 that will expire in 5-19 years.
Other losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, no deferred tax liability has been recognised on temporary differences of $28,289,628 2012: $31,784,663 relating to the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The temporary differences at 27 December 2013 represent only the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries where remittance to the uK of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate.
The recognition of the deferred tax asset is based on managements assessment of historic profitability, forecasted operating results based upon approved business plans and a review of the tax planning opportunities.
Based on this, management concluded that there is convincing evidence for the recognition of deferred tax assets in excess of the deferred tax liability by $88,250,962 2012: $21,892,569 in entities that have suffered a loss in the current or preceding periods.
12 Loss Earnings Per Share Basic loss earnings per share is calculated by dividing loss profit by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue throughout the period, adjusting for ordinary shares held in Treasury and ordinary shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust.
For diluted loss earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares is further adjusted for the effect of potentially dilutive ordinary shares, arising from the assumed exercise of employee share options and share awards that are in the money and for which management has identified that performance conditions, associated with the vesting of certain employee share options and awards, are likely to be achieved.
For a description of the Groups employee share option and share award plans, refer to note 29.
Loss earnings per share is only diluted when the result for the period is a profit.

indb 114 11 03 2014 21:17 CSR in review Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information 13 Goodwill continued Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
Further disclosures are provided below for all cash generating units where the Group holds an individual goodwill item relating to a CGu which is significant, which management considers to be 10% of the total net book value in comparison with the Groups total carrying value of goodwill, or, where there are no significant allocations of goodwill at a lower level, for groups of cash generating units within a reportable segment.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 27 December 2013 28 December 2012 Reportable segments and cash generating units $000 $000 Automotive Business Group 51,404 51,404 Consumer Business Group Printers 58,161 58,161 Cameras 50,537 Other Consumer CGUs 9,505 9,505 Voice & Music Business Group 12,270 12,270 131,340 181,877 Movements in goodwill In 2013 $50.5 million of goodwill allocated to the Camera CGu was impaired following the decision to cease development of future cameraon-a-chip COACH platform products.
There is now no goodwill allocated to the Cameras cash generating unit.
During 2012 goodwill of $151.5 million allocated to the Legacy CGu was fide-recognised following the disposal of development operations in handset connectivity and handset location to Samsung during 2012, as it was no longer deemed to be recoverable.
There is now no goodwill allocated to this CGu.
During 2011 the acquisition of the Zoran group recognised goodwill of $108.7 million.
Of the total goodwill, $50.5 million was allocated to Cameras and $58.2 million was allocated to Printers based on the relative value in use of these CGus.
2013 Impairment Testing The Group tests the assets allocated to different CGus for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The assets tested include directly attributable goodwill, intangible and tangible assets, and inventory as well as an allocation of corporate assets.
The annual test during 2013 impaired $76.9 million of assets allocated to the Camera CGu, including $50.5 million of goodwill.
In 2013 the Group also conducted additional impairment reviews during the year when indicators of impairment were assessed to exist in the Camera CGu.
These reviews did not result in any impairments being found to exist but the reasonably likelihood of future impairments of the assets in the Camera CGu were disclosed in the June and September quarterly result announcements.
Estimation Methodology The estimation methodology is the same for all cash generating units.
The recoverable amounts of the Groups CGus are determined from value in use calculations based upon cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budget and longer range financial plans that have been reviewed and approved by management and the Board of Directors.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the growth in future sales, projected production costs, operating expenditures, discount rates and terminal growth rates.
Future sales are estimated based on recent reports on the markets the Group operates in, produced by independent analysts and containing estimates for market size for a number of different technologies in different end markets.
These external estimates are compared with internal estimates to produce a considered view of available market size and likely market shares.
Management uses this information, combined with internal customer specific information regarding design wins, projected changes in market share based on current positions and forecast technology penetration rates, to derive its best assessment of the future sales and gross margins.
A terminal value is included for the period beyond five years from the balance sheet date based upon the estimated cashflows in the fifth year and a terminal growth rate.
Variation in selling prices and direct costs are based on well established trends in the semiconductor industry as well as managements experience of how pricing and direct costs vary over a products lifecycle, incorporating the impacts of already quoted selling prices and the result of discussions with suppliers on future direct cost movements.
Projected operating expenditures are consistent with the long term operating model of the Group, specifically R&D expense of approximately 25% 2012: 25%: 2011: 23% of revenue and SG&A expense of around 12% 2012: 12%: 2011: 10% of revenue.
Approved forecasts assume the Group reaches these ratios over a period of a number of years.
The actual operating costs for the group were 56% in 2013 2012: 52%.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the group, specifically using a weighted average cost of capital and estimating risk free rates based on uS Treasury Bonds, using published equity betas for the group and making a reasonable estimate of the Equity Risk Premium.
Management has concluded that it is appropriate to use a pre tax discount rate of 12.7% 2011: 11.7%, which fully reflects the risk profile of the Group.
