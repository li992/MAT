5.4 Net financing expense This note details the interest income generated on the Groups financial assets and the interest expense incurred on borrowings and other financial assets and liabilities.
In reporting adjusted earnings the Group adjusts net financing expense to exclude foreign exchange gains losses on forward contracts, ineffectiveness on hedges, other fair value movements and exceptional items.
Foreign exchange and fair value movements reflect the value of these instruments at a point in time, resulting in a variable impact on profit and loss.
Accounting policy Interest expense and interest income are calculated under the effective interest method.
As no interest is directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to prepare for its intended use or, all interest expense is recognised as finance expense when incurred.
