98 Financial statements BG Group Annual Report and Accounts 2013 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 1 SEGMENTAL ANALySIS AND RESULTS PRESENTATION BG Groups reportable segments are those used by the Groups Board and management the Chief Operating Decision Maker as defined in IFRS 8 Operating Segments to run the business and are based on differences in the Groups products and services.
Segment information is presented onthe same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes.
BG Group has two principal operating and reporting segments: Upstream and LNGShipping & Marketing.
Upstream comprises exploration, development, production, liquefaction and marketing of hydrocarbons.
LNG Shipping &Marketing combines the development and use of LNG import facilities with the purchase, shipping and sale of LNG and regasified natural gas.
The Groups  and Distribution businesses T&D, principally Mahanagar Gas in India, and certain corporate activities have been included in the Other segment.
Intra-Group sales are settled at market prices and are generally based on the same prices as those charged to third parties arms length principle.
Grouprevenue, profit for the year, depreciation, amortisation and impairment and capital investment attributable to BG Group activities are shownon pages 98 to 101, analysed by operating segment.
The presentation of BG Groups results under IFRS separately identifies the effect of the re-measurement of certain financial instruments, profits andlosses on the disposal and impairment of non-current assets and certain other exceptional items.
Results excluding discontinued operations and disposals, certain re-measurements, certain other exceptional items and impairments Business performance are used by management andare presented in order to provide readers with a clear and consistent presentation of the underlying operating performance of the Groups ongoing business.
Further information on Business performance is given on page 146.
The disposals, re-measurements and impairments column includes unrealised gains and losses in respect of certain gas sales contracts classified asderivatives under IAS 39, commodity instruments that represent economic hedges but do not qualify for hedge accounting, and financial instruments used to manage foreign exchange and interest rate exposure.
Where these instruments represent economic hedges but cannot be designated as hedges under IAS 39, unrealised movements in fair value, together with foreign exchange movements associated with the underlying borrowings and foreign exchange movements in respect of certain inter-company balances, are recorded in the income statement and disclosed separately as disposals, re-measurements and impairments.
The separate presentation of these items best reflects the underlying performance ofthe business since it distinguishes between the temporary timing differences associated with re-measurements under IAS 39 rules and actual realised gains and losses.
Under IFRS the results from jointly controlled entities joint ventures and associates are presented net of tax and finance costs on the face of theincome statement.
BG Group also presents the operating profit of the Group including results of joint ventures and associates before interest andtax, as this approach provides additional information on the source of the Groups operating profits.
The following tables provide a reconciliation between the overall results and Business performance, and operating profit including and excluding theresults of joint ventures and associates.
The geographical information provided for external revenue is based on country of production.
Furtherinformation is given in the Supplementary information on page 134.
External revenue attributable to non-UK countries is $15 922m 2012: $15 881m.
Included in the Upstream segment is revenue of$2090m attributable to Kazakhstan representing 11% of Group revenue 2012: $2 299m, 12%.
Further geographical information on the Groups E&P revenues can be found in Supplementary information gas and oil unaudited on page 134.
LNG Shipping & Marketing revenues are not considered reliant on individual countries since they are associated with the global deployment oftheGroups portfolio of flexible LNGsupplies.
External revenue in respect of a single external customer amounted to $2 198m 2012: $2 402m, recognised in the Upstream segment.
These revenues are associated with the sale of marketable commodities and over 95% are secured by letters of credit: accordingly, this single customer is not considered to represent a concentration of business risk to the Group.

The costs in respect of these awards are charged to the income statement over the vesting period, based on the fair value of the shares and options at the award date, adjusted for the probability of market-related performance conditions being achieved.
The fair value of shares and options awarded during the year is estimated using a Monte Carlo projection model with the following assumptions: share price on date of issue of 12.71 2012: 12.71, exercise price of nil 2012: nil, a risk-free rate of 0.81% 2012: 0.36% and a vesting period of three years 2012: three years.
The model also contains assumptions for both the Group andeach member of the industry peer group set out on page 74 in respect of volatility, average share price growth and share price correlation.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the share price over the previous three-year period.
Share price correlation was determined by calculating the historical correlation of the share price over the previous three-year period.
Average share price growth was determined from historical growth over the previous year.
Dividend equivalents accrue on the award duringthe vesting period.
The fair value of shares andoptions awarded during the year was 6.13 per share 2012: 5.02 per share.

Thedeferred tax liability of $4 120m 2012: $4 636m is shown after the offset of certain deferred tax assets relating to the same fiscal authority: theliability prior to such offset is $7 367m 2012: $8 515m.
The net amount expected to be settled after more than 12 months is $4 159m 2012: $4 551m.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences, unutilised tax losses and unused tax credits to the extent that realisation ofthe related tax benefit through future taxable income is probable.
To determine the future taxable income, reference is made to the latest available profit forecast.
This requires assumptions regarding future profitability and is therefore inherently uncertain.
The Group has unrecognised deductible temporary differences of $840m 2012: $896m and unrecognised tax losses of $3 228m 2012: $2 802m to carry forward against future taxable income.
To the extent unutilised, $180m of these losses will expire by 2018.
In addition, the Group has unrecognised capital losses of $5m 2012: $183m : these tax losses can only be offset against specific types of future capital gains.
The Group also has unrecognised overseas tax creditsof $464m 2012: $393m.
The aggregate amount of taxable temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, forwhich deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised, is approximately $6m 2012: $5m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences either because no liability is expected to arise on distribution under applicable tax legislation or because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
As at 31 December 2013, the Company had a deferred tax asset of $10m 2012: $12m.

As part of its business operations, the Group uses derivative financial instruments derivatives in order to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates.
The Group enters intointerest rate derivatives to manage the fixed and floating composition of its debt.
The Group enters into currency exchange rate derivatives tohedge certain currency cash flows and to adjust the currency composition of its assets and liabilities.
Certain agreements are combined currencyand interest swap transactions, described as cross-currency interest rate derivatives.
The Groups policy is to enter into interest orcurrencyexchange rate derivatives only where these are matched by an underlying asset, liability or transaction.
Further information on treasury risks is contained in the Principal risks and uncertainties section, pages 38 to 43.
COMMODITy INSTRUMENTS Within the ordinary course of business the Group routinely enters into sale and purchase transactions for commodities.
The majority of these transactions take the form of contracts that were entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of the commodity inaccordance with the Groups expected sale, purchase or usage requirements.
Such contracts are not within the scope of IAS 39.
Certain gas sales contracts fall within the scope of IAS 39.
These contracts include pricing terms that are based on a variety of commodities andindices.
They are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value with movements in fair value recognised in the income statement.
Financial statements 118 Financial statements BG Group Annual Report and Accounts 2013 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 18 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS COntInuED COMMODITy INSTRUMENTS COntInuED Certain short-term market traded contracts for the purchase and subsequent resale of third-party commodities are within the scope of IAS 39 andare recognised in the balance sheet at fair value with movements in fair value recognised in the income statement.
The Group uses various commodity-based derivative instruments to manage some of the risks arising from fluctuations in commodity prices.
Such contracts include physical and net-settled forwards, futures, swaps and options.
Where these derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedges of underlying commodity price exposures, certain gains and losses attributable to these instruments are deferred in other comprehensive income and subsequently recognised in the income statement when the underlying hedged transaction crystallises.
Commodity derivatives that are not part of a hedging relationship are recognised in the balance sheet within Other commodity derivatives at fair value, with movements in fair value recognised in theincome statement.
Further information on commodity price exposure is contained in the Principal risks and uncertainties section, pages 38 to 43.

The amounts in respect of other commodity derivatives represent the grosscombination of notional principals relating to all purchase and sale contracts and accordingly do not show the extent to which these contracts may offset.
These notional principal amounts give an indication of the scale of derivatives held, but do not reflect the risks that the Group is exposed to from their use.
vALUATION All financial instruments that are initially recognised and subsequently re-measured at fair value have been classified in accordance with the hierarchy described in IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
Fair value measurement hierarchy The fair value hierarchy, described below, reflects the significance of the inputs used to determine the valuation of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value.
Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived directly from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
BG Group Annual Report and Accounts 2013 | Financial statements 119 18 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS COntInuED vALUATION COntInuED Level 2 fair value measurements are those including inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset orliability directly or indirectly.
The fair value of the Groups interest rate and currency exchange rate derivatives and the majority of the Groups commodity derivatives are calculated from relevant market prices and yield curves at the balance sheet date and are therefore based solely on observable price information.
These instruments are not directly quoted in active markets and are accordingly classified as Level 2 in the fair valuehierarchy.
Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include significant inputs for the asset or liability that are notbased on observable market data.
Where observable market valuations of commodity contracts are unavailable, the fair value on initial recognition is the transaction price and issubsequently determined using the Groups forward planning assumptions for the price of gas, other commodities and indices.
Due to the assumptions underlying their fair value, certain gas contracts are categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
One of the assumptions used fortheir valuation is that observable commodity prices are liquid for four years 2012: four years.
Thefairvalues of the commodity contracts arecalculated using the market yield curve at the balance sheet date.

There were no reclassifications between levels in the fair value hierarchy during 2013.
Reclassifications from Level 3 to Level 2 during 2012 were attributable to contracts maturing within the four-year liquid period for observable commodity prices.

All gains or losses for the period ended 31 December 2012 related to financial assets andliabilities held at 31 December 2012.
As at 31 December 2013, the potential pre-tax change in the fair value of gas contracts, assuming a $10 per barrel change in the Brent price assumption, was $53m 2012: $4m.
A reasonably foreseeable change in the valuation assumptions underlying other commodity derivatives wouldnot significantly change their fair value measurement.

HEDGE ACCOUNTING In line with the Groups risk management policies, certain derivative and non-derivative instruments are designated as hedges of currency, interestrate and commodity price exposures in accordance with IAS 39.
Further information can be found in the Principal risks and uncertainties section, pages 38 to 43.
Fair value hedges As at 31 December 2013, the Group held a number of interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps designated as hedges of the fair valuerisk associated with the Groups fixed rate debt.
At 31 December 2012, the Group also held a number of commodity derivatives designated ashedges of the fair value risk associated with fixed price firm sales commitments.
The hedged items and the related derivatives have the same critical terms to ensure that they are an effective hedge under IAS 39.
The fair value of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges outstanding as at 31 December 2013 is $66m 2012: $72m.
During 2013, adjustments of $65m 2012: $ 12 m have been made to hedged items inrespect of the risks being hedged.
Cash flow hedges The Group has forward commodity contracts, currency exchange rate derivatives and interest rate derivatives designated as hedges of highly probable forecast purchases and sales, and of interest flows and currency exposure on Group debt.
As at 31 December 2013, an unrealised pre-tax lossof $4m 2012: $228m was deferred in other comprehensive income in respect of effective cash flow hedges.
The hedged transactions are expected to occur within 24 years 2012: 25 years and the associated gains and losses deferred in other comprehensive income will be released to theincome statement as the underlying transaction crystallises.
As at 31 December 2013, deferred pre-tax losses of $nil 2012: $96m are expected tobereleased to the income statement within one year.
The fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges outstanding as at31December 2013 is $174m 2012: $ 210 m. During 2012, certain forecast commodity sales for which cash flow hedge accounting wasused were nolonger expected to occur.
This resulted in the transfer of a pre-tax gain of $47m from other comprehensive income to the incomestatement.
Page 93 identifies the amounts that have been transferred from other comprehensive income in respect of transactions completed during theyear.
These items are reported within the income statement to match against the underlying transaction.
hedges of net investments in foreign operations As at 31 December 2013, certain borrowings and currency derivatives have been designated as hedges of the currency risk associated with net investments in foreign operations.
The portion of gains or losses on the hedging instruments determined to be an effective hedge are transferred toother comprehensive income to offset the gains or losses arising on the retranslation of net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
The pre-tax gain oneffective hedging instruments deferred within other comprehensive income as at 31 December 2013 is $529m 2012: $331m.
The fair value of financial instruments designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations outstanding as at 31 December 2013 is $ 5 681 m 2012: $ 4 885 m.

FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS The principal financial risks arising from financial instruments are commodity price risk, exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and credit and liquidityrisk.
A description of these principal risks is outlined in the Principal risks and uncertainties section, pages 38 to 43.
Additional quantitative information and market sensitivities in relation to certain principal market risks are included in the following sections.
Liquidity risk The Group limits the amount of borrowings maturing within any specific period and the Groups financial assets are primarily held as short-term, liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash.
These measures reduce liquidity risk.
The Group proposes tomeet its financing commitments from the operating cash flows of the business, existing cash and cash equivalent investments, proceeds from asset disposals and borrowings from a range of sources which are expected to include money and debt capital markets, government lending agencies and existing committed lines of credit.
The undiscounted contractual cash flows receivable payable under financial instruments asat the balance sheet date are as follows: The Group Between Between as at 31 December 2013 Within one and two and After one year two years five years five years Total $m $m $m $m $m Non-derivative financial liabilities Borrowings 1 150 1 977 6 864 25 750 35 741 Short-term payables 1 878 1 878 3 028 1 977 6 864 25 750 37 619 Outflows from derivative financial instruments Currency and interest rate derivatives 974 88 78 722 1 862 Gross-settled commodity derivatives 1 232 397 276 1 905 Net-settled commodity derivatives 49 17 12 78 2 255 502 366 722 3 845 Non-derivative financial assets and inflows from derivative financial instruments 12 751 1 478 724 1 675 16 628 Total as at 31 December 2013 7 468 1 001 6 506 24 797 24 836 The Group Between Between as at 31 December 2012 Within one and two and After one year two years five years five years Total $m $m $m $m $m Non-derivative financial liabilities Borrowings 1 686 667 3 890 27 501 33 744 Short-term payables 1 599 1 599 Other financial liabilities 2 2 3 285 667 3 890 27 503 35 345 Outflows from derivative financial instruments Currency and interest rate derivatives 2 013 449 196 690 3 348 Gross-settled commodity derivatives 1 185 197 306 1 688 Net-settled commodity derivatives 149 30 8 187 3 347 676 510 690 5 223 Non-derivative financial assets and inflows from derivative financial instruments 11 202 1 708 1 160 1 629 15 699 Total as at 31 December 2012 4 570 365 3 240 26 564 24 869 Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a Group basis.
Credit risk in financial instruments arises from cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments, aswell as credit exposures of commercial counterparties including exposures in respect of outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with a minimum long-term credit rating of A are normally accepted as a counterparty and credit limits are established based primarily on the credit ratings, although other credit assessment factors that determine credit quality, including the external environment, are taken into account when considering the awarding of or maintenance of a limit.
Similarly if a commercial counterparty is independently credit rated, the rating is primarily used to determine credit quality and limits, with other relevant assessment factors also considered.
If there is no independent credit rating, credit quality is assessed in accordance with credit policies that take account of the counterpartys financial position and other similar factors.
Exposures are monitored by the relevant Group businesses and at a Group level.
As at 31 December 2013, the Groups maximum credit risk exposure after the impact of any netting arrangements under interest rate related derivatives was $79m 2012: $78m, currency derivatives $491m 2012: $295m and commodity related derivatives $41m 2012: $43m.
The Groups credit risk exposure under receivables and other financial assets is represented by the book values.
The Group considers its portfolio for credit related concentration risks where risks may result from strategic investments, commercial relationships or sales of product in a variety of locations.
Mitigation may be considered where appropriate to diversify or reduce risk profile.
BG Group Annual Report and Accounts 2013 | Financial statements 123 18 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS COntInuED FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS COntInuED As at 31 December 2013, the Groups receivable balance with Egypt General Petroleum Corporation EGPC in respect of domestic gas sales was $1.2bn 2012:$1.3bn, of which $0.5bn 2012: $0.6bn was overdue.
Following an agreement signed with EGPC in 2011, the repayment of this receivable balance is partly secured by cash from LNG exports through Egyptian LNG.
Higher than agreed gas volumes continue to be diverted to the Egyptian domestic market, and as aresult, the volume of gas available for export has reduced and the effectiveness of this receivable securitisation agreement has diminished.
In addition, the Group issued Force Majeure notices under its Egyptian LNG arrangements in January 2014.
Despite this, the Group considers that the current receivable balance remains fully recoverable as direct cash payments from EGPC continue to be received and discussions with the Egyptian government to seek other forms ofpayment security are ongoing.
However, the recoverability of the receivable balance depends on the business environment in Egypt, the Groups continued investment plans and the volume of gas available for export, together with the outcome of ongoing negotiations with EGPC.
The Group reviewed the agreement signed with EGPC in 2011 to determine whether the receivable balance should bederecognised and replaced with another asset.
As the Group retained the rights to receive cash flows from the asset, and the risks and rewards associated with the asset, it concluded that no derecognition was required.
Market risk Financial instruments used by the Group that are affected by market risks primarily comprise cash and cash equivalents, borrowings and derivative contracts.
The principal market variables that affect the value of these financial instruments are UK and US interest rates, US Dollar to Pound Sterling exchange rates, UK and US gas prices, and Japan Custom-cleared Crude JCC and Brent oil prices.

Provision is made for the estimated cost of decommissioning at the balance sheet date, to the extent that current circumstances indicate BG Group will ultimately bear this cost.
The payment dates of expected decommissioning costs are uncertain and are based oneconomic assumptions surrounding the useful economic lives of the fields concerned.
Useful economic lives of fields are affected by the estimation ofhydrocarbon reserves and resources, which is in turn impacted by available reservoir data, commodity prices and future costs.
Payments onadiscounted basis of $828m 2012: $226m are currently anticipated within one to five years: $829m 2012: $513m within six to 10 years: and$2005m 2012:$3 028m over 10 years.
OTHER The balance as at 31 December 2013 includes provisions for onerous contracts of $146m 2012: $149m, field-related payments of $51m 2012: $53m, insurance costs of $67m 2012: $52m and costs associated with acquisitions, disposals and restructuring of $112m 2012: $122m.

Financial statements 126 Financial statements BG Group Annual Report and Accounts 2013 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 22 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES COntInuED E LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Italian criminal charges were brought in 2008 against certain current and former employees and consultants of BG Group in connection with allegations of improper conduct associated with the authorisation process for the planned Brindisi LNG S. p. A. regasification terminal.
BG Italia S. p. A. BGItalia, a wholly owned subsidiary of BG Group, was also charged under Italian Legislative Decree No.
Allcharges have been declared time barred, including those against a former director previously convicted of abusive land occupation.
A civil claim, brought by the Region of Puglia against BG Italia within the framework of the criminal case, remains outstanding.
The claim was rejected by the Brindisi court in April 2012 and the Puglia Region appealed.
Appeals in relation to this case and the above criminal cases are duetobeheard on5May 2014.
Various civil proceedings relating to the Brindisi LNG regasification terminal remain outstanding, for example relatingtotheconsent process.
However, in December 2012 the Board of BG Group decided in any event not to pursue the Brindisi LNG regasification terminal project.
Two separate tax deficiency notices have been issued against Petrobras in December 2009 based on alleged irregularities in connection with theimport of equipment and rigs on behalf of the BM-S-9 consortium Petrobras 45% Operator, BG E&P Brasil 30% and Repsol Sinopec Brasil 25%.
BGGroups potential liability arises from indemnity provisions in favour of Petrobras, as set out in the Joint Operating Agreement.
The first tax deficiency notice was issued due to the So Paulo State Tax Authoritys allegation that Petrobras cannot enjoy lower tax rates in the importation oftheStena Drillmax rig because the rig was not disembarked and cleared in a So Paulo state port.
Petrobras challenged this decision through theadministrative courts but the appeal was rejected.
Petrobras filed a lawsuit before the judicial branch and, in October 2011, the first instance court declared thatthe So Paulo State Tax Authority was not competent to decide unilaterally where customs clearance takes place or to consider iftheConsortium would be entitled to the special tax treatment.
In February 2014, the second instance court dismissed the So Paulo State Tax Authoritys appeal against this ruling.
These rulings were positive decisions for the Consortium.
TheSo Paulo State Tax Authority may appeal the judicial decision to the Brazilian Superior Court of Justice.
A final decision is expected within one to three years depending on whether there are any further appeals.
The second tax deficiency notice was issued by the So Paulo Tax Authority reflecting their view that Petrobras should have recorded transfers ofgoods to and from a rig by issuing invoices for the purposes of allowing authorities to monitor taxable transactions as if the offshore rig andtheonshore base were two distinct branches of Petrobras.
As such, the authorities claim that transfers of goods to and from the Petrobrasaffiliated branches should attract a transfer tax equivalent to VAT.
Petrobras challenged this deficiency notice before the administrative courts and, on 23 March 2010, an unfavourable decision was issued.
Thisdecision has been appealed by Petrobras, the outcome of which may be received by the end of 2014.
If the appeal by Petrobras is rejected, itisanticipated that judicial proceedings will be brought in a manner similar to the first tax deficiency notice referred to above.
It is expected thatthis matter may take up to five years to be resolved.
It is not practicable at this time to estimate the financial effects other than for the tax deficiency notices, indicate the uncertainties relating totheamounts or timing of any economic inflows or outflows nor the possibility of any reimbursements in relation to the outstanding legal proceedings detailed above.
An amount for the tax deficiency notices has been included within the contingency liabilities amount insubsection F below.
The Company and its subsidiaries are, or may from time to time be, in connection with current or past operations, involved in a number of legal orarbitration proceedings, including, for example, claims, suits, actions, investigations and or inquiries relating to commercial, tax, environmental orothermatters, with third parties or governmental or regulatory authorities.
While the outcome of some of these matters cannot readily beforeseen, it is currently considered that they will be resolved without material effect on the net asset position as set out in these Financialstatements.
F CONTINGENT LIABILITIES The amount of contingent liabilities as at 31 December 2013 mainly the provision of guarantees, indemnities, contingent decommissioning  to third parties and various legal or arbitration proceedings in connection with the current and prior operations oftheGroup amounted to $7 144m 2012: $5 037m, of which $242m 2012: $194m related to the Company.

Financial statements 128 Financial statements BG Group Annual Report and Accounts 2013 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 24 PENSIONS AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS In the year ended 31 December 2013, a number of the Groups UK employees participated in the BG Pension Scheme BGPS, a defined benefit registered pension plan established under trust.
The Trustee is BG Group Pension Trustees Limited.
The BGPS is funded to cover future pension liabilities in respect of service up to the balance sheet date.
It is subject to an independent valuation at least every three years, on the basis of whichthe independent qualified actuary certifies the rate of employers contributions that, together with the specified contributions payable bythe employees and returns on the BGPSs assets, are expected to be sufficient to fund the benefits payable.
For the year ended 31 December 2013, the employers contribution rate in respect of most BGPS members was effectively 35.2% of pensionable pay excluding plan expenses which were met directly by the Company.
In addition, 3% of pensionable pay was contributed by most members either directly or by the Group via a salary sacrifice arrangement.
In common with all workplace pension schemes in the UK, the BGPS is subject to regulation by The Pensions Regulator.
The Trustee is responsible foroverall management and governance of the BGPS, including compliance with all applicable legislation and regulations.
The Trustee also has responsibility for investment of the BGPSs assets, following consultation with the Group.
The BGPS closed to future accrual of benefits on 31 December 2013 and all active members became deferred pensioners with pensions calculated basedonsalaries up until the point of closure for such active members.
These deferred pensions are generally revalued in line with movements intheRetailPrices Index.
Certain benefits relating to individual transfers-in and purchases of additional pensionable service by employees retain alinktopensionable salary post-closure.
The closure of the scheme to future accruals resulted in a curtailment gain of $154m, recognised in theincome statement seenote 4, page 105.
The last full independent actuarial valuation of the BGPS for funding purposes showed that the aggregate market value of the plan assets at 31March 2011 was 865m, representing 79% of the accrued liabilities.
The latest annual actuarial report showed an updated funding level of 70% at31March 2013.
The next full funding valuation will be performed with an effective date of 31 March 2014.
The Group made annual payments of27m in 2011, 2012 and 2013 in order to address the plans deficit.
As part of the funding agreement in respect of the 2011 actuarial valuation andthe closure of the BGPS to future accrual of benefits, the Group and the Trustee have established a Pension Funding Partnership PFP, toaddress the deficit and to provide greater security to the Trustee.
In December 2013, the Group acquired an interest in the PFP for 110m.
It also contributed 350m to the BGPS and the Trustee used this to purchase itsinterest in the PFP.
The PFP has an interest in loans secured on four of the Groups LNG ships, the proceeds from which the PFP will use to make annual distributions of 33m to the BGPS for 15 years and to pay a capital sum in 2028 of 172m which will be used, if necessary, to fund any deficit inthe BGPS at that time, measured on a self-sufficiency funding basis.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption conferred by Regulation 7 ofthe Partnerships Accounts Regulations 2008 and has, therefore, not appended the accounts of this qualifying partnership to these financial statements.
Separate accounts for the PFP are not required to be, and have not been, filed at Companies House.
For scheme funding purposes, the Trustees interest in the PFP is treated as an asset which reduces the BGPS actuarial funding deficit.
However, thePFP is not a plan asset under IAS 19 for the purposes of the Groups consolidated financial statements and therefore does not reduce the deficit onan IAS 19 accounting basis.
The Group is exposed to a number of risks relating to the BGPS.
For example, additional contributions may be required if the life expectancy ofthemembers increases or if investments underperform, compared with the assumptions adopted.
The BGPS holds a diversified investment portfolio see table on page 130, primarily comprising quoted investments, spread across four investment managers.
The portfolio remains weighted towards growth assets, but the Trustee increased the benchmark allocation to corporate bonds and index-linked gilts from 15% to 40% during the year to increase the asset-liability matching characteristics of the portfolio.
As at 31 December 2013, theBGPS held unquoted assets valued at $3m 2012: $4m through its absolute return investment in the Lansdowne Developed Markets Fund.
The BG Supplementary Benefits Scheme BGSBS provides benefits broadly in excess of the lifetime allowance.
This defined benefit plan is anunfunded, non-registered arrangement.
The BGSBS was closed to future accrual of benefits on 31 December 2013, the same date as benefit accrual ceased in the BGPS.
As a result of the closure of the BGPS and the BGSBS, employees who participated in these schemes, in common with new UK employees from April2007, have been offered membership of a defined contribution stakeholder pension plan, the BG Group Retirement Benefits Plan BGRBP.
Lifeassurance and income protection benefits are also provided under separate plans: these benefits are fully insured.
The Group contributes a flat ratepercentage of salary to the BGRBP and members may choose to increase this at their own cost, either directly or via salary sacrifice, or, subject tominimum contributions to ensure compliance with UK pensions automatic enrolment legislation, to reduce it in exchange for a taxable cash allowance.
A wide range of funds is available from which members may choose how the contributions will be invested.
The cost of the BGRBP and therelated life assurance and income protection benefits has been included in the amounts recognised in the consolidated income statement.
The Group has a small number of defined benefit plans outside the UK which are not material in Group terms.
Independent actuaries reported on the financial position of the BGPS and the BGSBS as at 31 December 2013 in accordance with the requirements ofIAS19.
The fair value of plan assets, the present value of plan liabilities and the net balance sheet liability were as follows: as at 31 December 2013 2012 $m $m Fair value of plan assets 1 927 1 598 Present value of liabilities 2 095 1 886 Net balance sheet liability 168 288 BG Group Annual Report and Accounts 2013 | Financial statements 129 24 PENSIONS AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS COntInuED NET DEFINED BENEFIT LIABILITy Movements in the net defined benefit liability during the period were as follows: 2013 2012 $m $m Reconciliation of net defined benefit liability Net defined benefit liability as at 1 January 288 436 Movement in year: Current service cost 63 68 Net interest on defined benefit liability 11 23 Employer contributions 96 103 Re-measurement effects recognised in other comprehensive income 48 31 Curtailment gain 154 Settlement 108 Currency translation adjustments 8 3 Net defined benefit liability as at 31 December 168 288 DEFINED BENEFIT OBLIGATION Movements in the present value of the Defined Benefit Obligation DBO during the period were as follows: 2013 2012 $m $m Reconciliation of the present value of the DBO Present value of the DBO as at 1 January 1 886 1 725 Movement in year: Current service cost 63 68 Interest cost 83 90 Employee contributions 1 1 Benefit payments 45 43 Actuarial gain due to experience adjustments 4 23 Actuarial loss due to changes in financial assumptions 210 106 Curtailment gain 154 Settlement 108 Currency translation adjustments 55 70 Present value of the DBO as at 31 December 2 095 1 886 As at 31 December 2013, $2 021m of the DBO relates to the funded BGPS 2012: $1 816m and $74m relates to the unfunded BGSBS 2012: $70m.
The weighted average duration of the DBO as at 31 December 2013 is 22 years.
As at 31 December 2013, $1 530m of the DBO relates to deferred pensioners and $565m relates to pensions in payment.
The valuations as at 31 December were based on the following assumptions: 2013 2012 % % a Rate of price inflation and benefit increases 3.4 3.0 b Future increases in earnings 4.4 4.0 Discount rate 4.5 4.6 a Rate of increase of deferred pensions and pensions in payment in excess of any Guaranteed Minimum Pension element.
b Due to the closure of the BGPS to future accrual of benefits on 31 December 2013 the future increase in earnings is no longer considered a significant assumption.
The assumptions set out in the table above are those applicable to the currency in which the liabilities of each plan are denominated.
In the case ofthe BGPS and BGSBS this is Pounds Sterling.
If the discount rate used for the valuation of the BGPS and BGSBS was reduced by 0.1% to 4.4%, the DBO would increase by$44m.
A 0.1% increase in the inflation rate would have a similar impact on the DBO.

Based on these assumptions, the life expectancies of pensioners on the measurement date and also of pensioners in 10 years time are as follows: Life expectancy of pensioners years as at 31 December 2013 2012 2013 2023 2012 2022 Male age 60 28.3 29.0 28.2 29.0 Male age 65 23.6 24.2 23.5 24.2 Female age 60 29.4 30.2 29.3 30.1 Female age 65 24.6 25.4 24.6 25.3 If the life expectancy of a member currently age 60 was increased by one year, with consistent changes for members at other ages, the DBO in respect of the BGPS and BGSBS would increase by $54m.

Future cash inflows have been computed by reference tothe Groups estimate of future production of net proved gas and oil reserves at the end of each year and estimates of third-party prices.
Prices foreach year are calculated using a 12-month average price in line with SEC methodology.
The standardised measure of discounted future net cash flowinformation presented below is not intended to represent the replacement cost or fair market value of the Groups gas and oil properties.
