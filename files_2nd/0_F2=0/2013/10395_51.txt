92 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 24. Financing liabilities Private placement notes On 13 December 2012, the group issued US$153.0m and 55.0m of private placement PP notes in the United States Private Placement market.
This follows the issue on 16 December 2010 of US$96.0m and 40.0m of PP notes in the United States Private Placement market.
The PP notes are unsecured and rank pari passu with other senior unsecured indebtedness of the group.
In order to manage the risk of foreign currency fluctuations and to manage the groups finance costs through a mix of fixed and variable rate debt, the group has entered into cross currency interest rate swaps.
The swap contracts have the same duration and other critical terms as the borrowings and are considered to be highly effective.
The amount, maturity and interest terms of the PP notes are as shown below: Tranche Maturity date Amount Interest terms Swap interest 7 year 16 December 2017 US$48.0m US$ fixed at 3.39% fixed at 3.88% 7 year 16 December 2017 US$48.0m US$ fixed at 3.39% LIBOR 1.26% 9 year 16 December 2019 40.0m fixed at 4.38% n a 10 year 16 December 2022 US$76.0m US$ fixed at 3.85% fixed at 4.05% 10 year 16 December 2022 US$77.0m US$ fixed at 3.85% fixed at 4.02% 10 year 16 December 2022 25.0m fixed at 3.87% n a 12 year 16 December 2024 30.0m fixed at 4.04% n a The weighted average interest rates paid during the year on the overdrafts and loans outstanding were as follows: 2013 2012 % % Overdrafts 1.9 1.9 Bank loans 1.9 1.8 3.6 Private placement notes 2010 3.6 Private placement notes 2012 4.0 At 31 March 2013, the group had available 231.2m 2012: 193.4m of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.
The facilities have an expiry date of 2015.
The loans carry interest rates which are currently determined at 1.3% over LIBOR.
Details of the groups contingent liabilities are provided in Note 32.
Financial instruments Classification The groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and derivative financial instruments.
With the exception of derivative financial instruments, all financial assets are classified as loans and receivables.
The groups principal financial liabilities are trade payables, financing liabilities and derivative financial instruments.
With the exception of derivative financial instruments and private placement notes, contained within financing liabilities, all financial liabilities are held at amortised cost.
Derivative financial instruments and private placement loan notes are measured initially at fair value at the date the contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value through profit or loss unless they are designated as hedges for which hedge accounting can be applied.
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the bases for recognition of income and expense for each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in Note 1.
Risk management objectives The groups Treasury function monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the group.
These risks include those arising from interest rates, foreign currencies, liquidity, credit and capital management.
The group seeks to minimise the effects of these risks by using effective control measures and, where appropriate, derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by group policies and reviewed regularly.
Group policy is not to trade in financial instruments.
The risk management policies remain unchanged from the previous year.

Financial instruments Interest rate risk The groups activities expose it to the financial risks of interest rates.
The groups Treasury function reviews its risk management strategy on a regular basis and will appropriately enter into derivative financial instruments in order to manage interest rate risk.
Having issued US$96.0m and 40.0m of notes in the US PP fixed rate market in December 2010, and a further US$153.0m and 55.0m in December 2012, the group has swapped US$48.0m into floating rate debt.
Details of derivative financial instruments are given in Derivative financial instruments below.
Interest rate sensitivity The interest rate sensitivity has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and nonderivative instruments at the balance sheet date.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
All financial liabilities, other than financing liabilities, are interest free.
If interest rates had been 0.5% higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the groups profit after tax for the year ended 31 March 2013 and reserves would decrease increase by 0.5m 2012: 0.5m.
Foreign currency risk The group has limited exposure to transactional foreign currency risk from trading transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of individual group entities and some exposure to translational foreign currency risk from the translation of its operations in Europe.
The group considers the need to hedge its exposures appropriately and will enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate any significant risks.
In addition, the group has fully hedged the US dollar exposure on its PP notes into sterling using cross currency interest rate swaps see Hedging activities below.
At 31 March 2013 6.0m 2012: 6.5m of cash and cash equivalents were held in foreign currencies.
Included in bank loans were 18.8m 2012: 16.6m of loans denominated in foreign currency.
Liquidity risk The group monitors its liquidity risk using a cash flow projection model which considers the maturity of the groups assets and liabilities and the projected cash flows from operations.
Bank facilities, which allow for appropriate headroom in the groups daily cash movements, are then arranged.
Details of our bank facilities can be found in Note 24.
The tables below summarise the maturity profile including both undiscounted interest and principal cash flows of the groups financial assets and liabilities: Within In the second After one year to fifth years five years Total Financial assets at 31 March 2013 m m m m Trade receivables 274.3 274.3 Financing assets 0.8 26.2 27.0 Cash and cash equivalents 90.8 90.8 Financial assets 365.9 26.2 392.1 Within In the second After one year to fifth years five years Total Financial assets at 31 March 2012 m m m m Trade receivables 282.5 282.5 Financing assets 0.1 8.7 0.7 9.5 Cash and cash equivalents 60.8 60.8 Financial assets 343.4 8.7 0.7 352.8 MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 94 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 25.

The value of business placed with financial institutions is reviewed on a daily basis.
The groups credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies and are managed through regular review.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet in relation to the groups trade receivables are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
Before accepting a new customer, the group uses external credit scoring systems to assess the potential customers credit quality and define an appropriate credit limit which is reviewed regularly.
In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the group considers the credit quality of the counterparty.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The Directors believe that there is no further provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts at the balance sheet date.
The maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to trade receivables at the balance sheet date is the fair value of trade receivables.
The groups customer base is large and unrelated and, accordingly, the group does not have a significant concentration of credit risk with any one counterparty or group of counterparties.
Capital management risk The group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of debt and equity.
The capital structure of the group consists of net debt per Note 28 and equity per the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
The groups capital structure is reviewed regularly.
The group is not subject to externally imposed regulatory capital requirements with the exception of those applicable to the groups captive insurance subsidiary, which is monitored on a regular basis.
Hedging activities Cash flow hedges The group holds a number of cross currency interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges.
Bi-annual fixed interest cash flows arising over the periods to December 2022 and denominated in US$ from the US Private Placement market are exchanged for fixed interest cash flows denominated in sterling.
The group also holds a number of forward exchange currency contracts designated as hedges of highly probable forecast transactions.
All cash flow hedges were assessed as being highly effective as at 31 March 2013.
Fair value hedges The group holds a number of cross currency interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges.
Fixed interest cash flows denominated in US$ from the US Private Placement market are exchanged for floating interest cash flows denominated in sterling.
All fair value hedges were assessed as being highly effective as at 31 March 2013.
Hedge of net investment in foreign operations Included in bank loans at 31 March 2013 was a borrowing of 9.5m 2012: 9.5m which has been designated as a hedge of the net investment in the Republic of Ireland business of Dalkia FM in Ireland and is being used to hedge the groups exposure to foreign exchange risk on this investment.
Gains or losses on the translation of the borrowing are transferred to equity to offset gains or losses on the translation of the net investment.
