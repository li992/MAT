Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
As a result of the provisions of Finance Act 2012 to reduce the UK corporation tax rate from 24% to 23% from 1 April 2013 the applicable rate of corporation tax for the year is 23.25%.
Finance Act 2013 introduced further changes to the main rate of corporation tax, which was reduced from 23% to 21% from 1 April 2014 and to 20% from 1 April 2015.
UK deferred tax balances have therefore been re-measured to reect the rate at which they are expected to reverse.
Reconciliation of tax expense to profit before taxation The differences between the total tax expense shown above and the amount calculated by applying the standard rate of UK corporation tax to the profit before tax is as follows.

The key assumptions for those discounted cash ow calculations are the discount rate, profitability and growth rate.
The discount rate is based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted, where appropriate, for the risk premium attributable to the particular CGUs activities and geography of operation.
profitability and growth rates are based on past experience combined with managements expectations for future business performance, which is informed by a number of factors including economic growth, internal plans and competitor and customer activity.
Discount rates of 11% 2012 11% and 12% 2012 12% have been used in the above calculations for Europe & North America and Asia & Rest of World respectively.
The profit used in the cash ows for the first year is derived from management forecasts: for years 2 to 10 a growth rate is applied.
The profit for year 10 is then assumed to apply without further growth into perpetuity.
Growth rates of between 2% 2012 2% and 5% 2012 5% have been used for Europe & North America and Asia & Rest of World respectively, representing managements best estimate of each CGUs circumstances, and these do not exceed the long-term growth rates for the markets concerned.
There is no reasonable possible change in key assumptions that would lead to an impairment.
Of the net book value of goodwill at 31 December 2013, 70.5 million 2012 70.5 million is located in the UK.

Synthomer plc Annual Report 2013 77 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 17 Financial asset The Group disposed of its Pharma Chemicals business on 30 November 2011.
Part of the consideration agreed with the buyer, totalling $10.0 million, was in the form of a deferred payment to the Group which will be made by the buyer on or before 30 September 2014.
In the event that the buyer is unable to full his obligation, this deferred consideration is secured by an irrevocable bank guarantee held in favour of Synthomer plc by HSBC Bank plc.
In view of the security held, the Directors consider this deferred consideration virtually certain to be received and have therefore included it in these financial statements as a Financial Asset, and within the Groups denition of Net Borrowings.
The amount of 5.8 million 2012 5.6 million represents the agreed amount of $10.0 million discounted at the rate of 5% per annum from 30 September 2014 to date of completion, plus an appropriate amount unwound on this discounting in the period up to 31 December 2013.

Cash and cash equivalents are deposited with financial institutions with a credit rating of A or higher.
22 Financial instruments The Groups treasury function operates procedures designed to reduce or eliminate financial risk and ensure that funds are available for current and future needs.
The policies are approved by the Board and the use of financial instruments is strictly controlled.
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the cash and borrowings disclosed in note 21, and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings.

Where market values are not available, fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash ow at prevailing interest rates and by applying year end exchange rates.
The carrying amount of short-term borrowings approximates to book value.
The fair value of the Groups financial instruments are measured using inputs other than quoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are market risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below, together with related disclosure required by IFRS.

The policies adopted to address these risks are as follows: Interest rate risk The Group nances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, loan notes and bank borrowings.
The Group borrows at both xed and oating rates of interest and uses interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest prole in order to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate uctuations.
Foreign currency risk The Group uses currency borrowings, forward contracts and currency swaps to hedge overseas net assets, which are predominantly denominated in euros.
profit translation exposures are not hedged.
The Group hedges currency transaction exposures at the point of confirmed order, using forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Groups policy is, where practicable, to hedge all exposures on monetary assets and liabilities.
Consequently, there are no material currency exposures to disclose 2012 none.
Impact on income statement Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts amounting to 1.2 million have been debited to the income statement in the year 2012 debit of 1.7 million.
These changes are shown separately as a special item in the consolidated income statement.
Hedge accounting The Group has a number of cross currency swaps that are used to reduce the exposure to interest rate and currency risk.
These swaps are fully effective at eliminating the risks they address.
The Group has reviewed the requirements necessary to permit the application of hedge accounting under IAS 39.
It has concluded that the costs involved in meeting these requirements cannot be justied and therefore IAS 39 hedge accounting will not be applied.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments to which hedge accounting is not applied are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
The Group has designated a number of Interest Rate Swap agreements, acquired as part of the acquisition of PolymerLatex Group, which in combination represent a oating to xed interest rate swap on a principal euro amount of 156 million, as an effective hedge against the interest rate exposure associated with a substantial portion of the Groups euro denominated, oating rate, 150 million Term Loan.
As such these contracts are now accounted for as Cash Flow Hedges as permitted by IAS 39.
These contracts matured on 31 December 2013 and have not been renewed.
In addition, the Group has taken out forward foreign exchange contracts to x the sterling value of its net investments in certain foreign operations, which have a euro functional currency.
These contracts, together with 177.8 million drawn on the multi currency term loan facility have been accounted for as net investment hedges as permitted by IAS 39.
Interest rate risk prole Financial liabilities After taking into account the various interest rate and currency swaps entered into by the Group, the currency and interest rate exposure of the Group as at 31 December 2013 was: 2013 2012 Floating rate Fixed rate Total Floating rate Fixed rate Total borrowings borrowings borrowings borrowings borrowings borrowings m m m m m m Sterling 19.9 30.0 49.9 19.3 30.0 49.3 Euro 148.5 148.5 17.9 127.5 145.4 US dollar Other 168.4 30.0 198.4 37.2 157.5 194.7 Cash and cash equivalents 59.0 53.7 Financial asset see note 17 5.8 5.6 Add: special item non-recourse factoring 20.4 Net borrowings underlying performance 133.6 155.8 The effective interest rate for the year was 4.7% 2012 4.7%.

For oating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
The foreign currency sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates.
The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group where the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the functional currency of the lender or borrower.
Liquidity risk The objective of the Group is to meet financial commitments as and when they fall due.
The Board closely monitors liquidity through monthly management accounts.
At the year end, Synthomer plc had the following principal facilities: A committed syndicated bank facility of 210 million comprising a 150 million Term Loan which was drawndown in euros on completion of the PolymerLatex acquisition, and a 60 million revolving credit facility which was undrawn at 31 December 2013.
Unsecured loan notes totalling approximately 51 million raised from the US private placement market in 2004.
With maturity between 2014 and 2016, these loan notes provide the Groups long-term requirements.

23 Asset classied as held for sale 2013 2012 m m Freehold land 1.1 The Group owns approximately 1,900 acres of agricultural land in Malaysia, on which is currently operated a palm oil and natural rubber plantation.
The land is owned by Kind Action Sdn Bhd, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Revertex Malaysia Sdn Bhd, which has a 30% minority interest.
The Directors decided during the year to dispose of this land, excluding the 300 acres immediately surrounding the manufacturing facilities, on the open market.
At 31 December 2013, contracts have been exchanged on 700 acres for a total consideration of approximately 27 million.
These disposals are subject to regulatory approval which may take up to 2 years.

All pension benets since that time are provided by way of a dened contribution scheme.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the companies concerned.
Dened benefit scheme The dened benefit scheme is administered by a separate fund that is legally separated from the Company.
The trustees of the pension fund are required by law to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the scheme.
The trustees of the pension are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out as at 6 April 2012 and updated to 31 December 2013 by a qualied actuary.
The Group has agreed that it will aim to eliminate the pension plan deficit over the next 8 years.
86 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2013 Group financial statements The scheme is exposed to a number of risks the most significant of which are detailed below: Asset return risk The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if plan assets underperform this yield, this will increase the deficit.
The scheme holds a significant proportion of equities which are expected to outperform corporate bonds on the long-term while providing volatility and risk in the short-term.
Interest rate risk A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans bond holdings.
Longevity risk The majority of the plans obligations are to provide benets for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans liabilities.
The risk relating to benets to be paid to the dependents of scheme members widow and orphan benets is re-insured by an external insurance company.
The major assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuations were as follows: 2013 2012 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.30% 3.00% Rate of increase in pensions in deferment 2.30% 2.00% Discount rate 4.55% 4.60% Ination assumption 3.30% 3.00% Assumptions regarding future mortality are based on actuarial advice in accordance with published statistics.
These assumptions translate into an average life expectancy in years for a pensioner retiring at 65 as follows: 2013 2012 Retiring today: Males 87.5 87.4 Females 89.9 89.8 Retiring in 20 years: Males 89.2 89.1 Females 91.9 91.8 significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the dened benefit obligation are discount rate and mortality.
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period assuming that all other assumptions are held constant: Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities Discount rate Increase decrease by 1% Decrease increase by 45 million Rate of mortality Increase by 1 year Increase by 9 million The above senstivities are based on a change of assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may have some correlation.
When calculating the sensitivity of the dened benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method present value of the dened benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the balance sheet.

The weighted average duration of the benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period is 15.5 years 2012 16.0 years.
Contributions from the sponsoring companies are expected to be 8.0 million in 2014.
88 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2013 Group financial statements Overseas pension schemes The Group operates a number of smaller overseas pension and post-retirement schemes.
The assets of these schemes are held separately from those of the Group, with the exception of the unfunded German schemes net liability 51.3 million, 2012 47.7 million, where in line with common practice, the assets are held within the respective companies.
Dened benefit schemes The aggregated pension disclosure below for the overseas dened benefit schemes has been compiled from a number of actuarial valuations at 31 December 2013.
The largest of these schemes accounts for 38.3 million 2012 37.8 million of the deficit at 31 December 2013.
The major assumption used in the actuarial valuation of this scheme are: 2013 2012 Rate of increase in salaries 3.00% 3.00% Rate of increase in pensions 2.00% 2.00% Discount rate 3.80% 3.80% Mortality assumptions Investigations have been carried out within the past three years into the mortality experience of the Groups dened benefit scheme.
These investigations concluded that the current mortality assumptions include sufficient allowance for future improvements in mortality rates.
The assumed life expectations on retirement at age 65 are: 2013 2012 Retiring today: Males 86.0 85.8 Females 91.0 90.8 Retiring in 20 years: Males 89.3 89.1 Females 94.2 94.1 The major assumption used in the valuation of the other overseas schemes do not differ signicantly from the above.

33 Restatement on adoption of IAS 19 revised IAS 19 revised Employee benets was amended in June 2011 and is effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
The Company has implemented IAS 19 revised in the year ended 31 December 2013.
The specic impact of this on the income statement is a change in the calculation of the interest income on plan assets.
This was previously based on the expected returns on the various asset types held within the investment portfolio.
It is now calculated at the same rate used to calculate the interest expense on the pension liability, being a discount rate derived from corporate bonds.
The difference between this calculated return and the actual return is reported as an actuarial gain loss through reserves.
In addition, as part of the implementation of IAS 19 revised the Group has chosen to classify the interest expense on the net pension liability within finance costs.
The expected return on plan assets and interest expense on the pension liability were previously reported as part of operating expenses.
The change in accounting policy has been applied retrospectively to the comparator periods.
There is no significant change to the net pension liability or to net assets as a result of the adoption of IAS 19 revised.
As a result no restatement of the balance sheet is required.
Restatement of prior full year period to 31 December 2012 The effect of adopting IAS 19 revised on the Groups profit is to reduce both underlying and total reported profit after tax by 3.5 million for the prior full-year ended 31 December 2012.
In addition, 2.2 million of expenses relating to the expected return on plan assets and interest expense on the pension liability, previously reported within operating expenses have been reclassied to finance costs.
