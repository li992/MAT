National Grid Gas plc DN Regulatory accounting statements 2012 13 49 Notes to the consolidated financial statements - analysis of items in the primary statements 1.
Segmental analysis Keeping it simple This note sets out the financial performance of the business split into the different parts of the business operating segments.
We monitor and manage the performance of these operating segments on a day-to-day basis.
Our strategy in action We work with our regulators to obtain robust regulatory agreements that balance the risks we face with the opportunity to deliver reasonable returns for our investors.
Our regulated businesses earn revenue for the transmission and distribution services they have provided during the year.
The revenue recognised may differ from the revenue allowed under our regulatory agreements and differences are adjusted against future prices.
Revenue represents the sales value derived from the transmission and distribution of gas and the provision of gas metering services during the year including assessment of the value of services provided, but not invoiced at the year end.
It excludes value added tax and intra-group sales.
The sales value for the transmission and distribution of gas is largely determined from the amount of system capacity sold for the year, and the amount of gas transported for the year, evaluated at contractual prices on a monthly basis.
The sales value for the provision of gas metering services is largely derived from monthly charges for the provision of individual meters under contractual arrangements.
Where revenue for the year exceeds the maximum amount permitted by regulatory agreement and adjustments will be made to future prices to reflect this over-recovery, a liability for the over-recovery is not recognised as such an adjustment to future prices relates to the provision of future services.
Similarly, an asset is not recognised where a regulatory agreement permits adjustments to be made to future prices in respect of an under-recovery.
Revenue includes income arising from the sale of properties as a result of property management activities, from the sale of emission allowances and from the recovery of pension deficit from other gas transporters under regulatory arrangement.
We present revenue and the results of the business analysed by operating segment, based on the information the Board of Directors uses internally for the purposes of evaluating the performance of operating segments and determining resource allocation between operating segments.
The Board is National Grid Gas plc's chief operating decision-making body as dened by IFRS 8 'Operating Segments' and assesses the performance of operations principally on the basis of operating profit before exceptional items and remeasurements see note 3.
The following table describes the main activities for each operating segment: Gas Transmission - the gas transmission network in the UK and the associated UK liquefied natural gas LNG storage activities Gas Distribution - four of the eight regional networks of Great Britain's gas distribution system Other activities relate to the gas metering business which provides regulated gas metering activities in the UK, the xoserve business which provides transportation transaction services on behalf of all the major gas network transportation companies, including ourselves, together with corporate activities.
Our segments are unchanged from those reported in the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2012.
All of the Company's sales and operations take place within the UK.
Sales between businesses are priced having regard to the regulatory and legal requirements that the businesses are subject to, which include requirements to avoid cross-subsidies.

Exceptional items and remeasurements Keeping it simple To monitor our financial performance, we use a profit measure that excludes certain income and expenses.
We call that measure business performance.
We exclude items from business performance because we think these items are individually important to understanding our financial performance and if included, could distort understanding of the performance for the year and the comparability between periods.
This note analyses these items, which are included in our results for the year but are excluded from business performance.
Our financial performance is analysed into two components: business performance, which excludes exceptional items and remeasurements: and exceptional items and remeasurements.
Business performance is used by management to monitor financial performance as it is considered that it improves the comparability of our reported financial performance from year to year.
Business performance subtotals are presented on the face of the income statement or in the notes to the financial statements.
Items of income or expense that are considered by management for designation as exceptional items include such items as significant restructurings, write-downs or impairments of non-current assets, significant changes in environmental or decommissioning provisions, integration of acquired businesses, gains or losses on disposals of businesses or investments and debt redemption costs as a consequence of transactions such as significant disposals or issues of equity.
Costs arising from restructuring programmes include redundancy costs.
Redundancy costs are charged to the income statement in the year in which a commitment is made to incur the costs and the main features of the restructuring plan have been announced to affected employees.
Remeasurements comprise gains or losses recorded in the income statement arising from changes in the fair value of commodity contracts and of derivative financial instruments to the extent that hedge accounting is not achieved or is not effective.
These fair values increase or decrease because of changes in commodity and financial indices and prices over which we have no control.

For the year ended 31 March 2012, restructuring costs included costs relating to  initiatives of 31m.
ii Pension deficit charges in 2013 arise from recovery plan contributions to the National Grid UK Pension Scheme.
iii Other exceptional items for the year ended 31 March 2013 was a 20m provision for legal claims in our Gas Metering business.
For the year ended 31 March 2012 a 6m release of an unutilised provision in our Gas Metering business.
iv Remeasurements - net gains losses on derivative financial instruments comprise gains and losses arising on derivative financial instruments reported in the income statement.
These exclude gains and losses for which hedge accounting has been effective, which have been recognised directly in other comprehensive income or which are offset by adjustments to the carrying value of debt.
v The exceptional tax credit arises from a reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 24% to 23% 2012: from 26% to 24% included and enacted in the Finance Act 2012 and applicable from 1 April 2013.
These reductions have resulted in a decrease in deferred tax liabilities.

Pensions Keeping it simple Substantially all of National Grid Gas employees are members of either the defined benefit or defined contribution sections of the National Grid UK Pension Scheme.
The fair value of plan assets and present value of defined benefit obligations are updated annually.
For further details of the National Grid UK Pension Scheme terms and the actuarial assumptions used to value the associated assets and obligations, see note 24.
The substantial majority of the Company's employees are members of the defined benefit section of the National Grid UK Pension Scheme.
There is no contractual arrangement or stated policy for charging the net defined benefit cost of the Scheme to the Company.
Accordingly, the Scheme is recognised as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
The pension charge for the year represents contributions payable to the Scheme for the period.
A share of the assets and liabilities, or the actuarial gains and losses of the Scheme are not recognised in these financial statements.
The following disclosures relate to the scheme as a whole and include amounts not recognised in these financial statements, but which are recognised in the consolidated financial statements of National Grid plc.

Taxation Keeping it simple We principally operate in the UK and this note gives further details of the tax charge and tax liabilities, including current and deferred tax.
The current tax charge is the tax payable on this years taxable profits.
Deferred tax is an accounting adjustment to provide for tax that is expected to arise in the future due to differences in accounting and tax bases.
The tax charge for the period is recognised in the income statement, the statement of comprehensive income or directly in equity, according to the accounting treatment of the related transaction.
The tax charge comprises both current and deferred tax.
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amounts expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amounts are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
The calculation of the Groups total tax charge involves a degree of estimation and judgement, and management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred tax is provided for using the balance sheet liability method and is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised on all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
However, deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction other than a business combination that affects neither the accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised on taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities, except where the Company is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Company and its subsidiaries intend to settle their current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

Although these reductions in the UK corporation tax rate have now been enacted, these rate changes had not been substantively enacted as at the balance sheet date and have therefore not been reflected in these financial statements.
The overall effect of these changes, if they had applied to the deferred tax balance at the balance sheet date, would be to reduce the deferred tax liability by an additional 237m.
Taxation included within the statement of financial position The following are the major deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised, and the movements thereon, during the current and prior reporting periods: Deferred tax assets liabilities Accelerated ShareOther net tax based Financial temporary depreciation payment instruments differences Total m m m m m Deferred tax assets at 31 March 2011 - 4 - 26 30 Deferred tax liabilities at 31 March 2011 1,870 - 3 30 1,903 At 1 April 2011 1,870 4 3 4 1,873 Credited to income statement 41 - 3 9 53 Charged to other comprehensive income - - 4 - 4 At 31 March 2012 1,829 4 4 5 1,824 Deferred tax assets at 31 March 2012 - 4 - 18 22 Deferred tax liabilities at 31 March 2012 1,829 - 4 13 1,846 At 1 April 2012 1,829 4 4 5 1,824 Credited to income statement 5 - 2 2 9 Charged to other comprehensive income - - 2 - 2 At 31 March 2013 1,824 4 4 7 1,817 Deferred tax assets at 31 March 2013 - 4 - 19 23 Deferred tax liabilities at 31 March 2013 1,824 - 4 12 1,840 At 31 March 2013 1,824 4 4 7 1,817 National Grid Gas plc DN Regulatory accounting statements 2012 13 57 6.
Taxation continued Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
The deferred tax balances after offset for statement of financial position purposes consist solely of deferred tax liabilities of 1,817m 2012: 1,824m.
At the balance sheet date there were no material current deferred tax assets or liabilities 2012: nil.
Dividends Keeping it simple Dividends represents the return of profits to shareholders.
Dividends are paid as an amount per ordinary share held.
We retain part of the profits generated in the year to meet future growth plans and pay out the remainder in accordance with our dividend policy.
Interim dividends are recognised when they become payable to the Companys shareholders.
Final dividends are recognised when they are approved by shareholders.
The following table shows the dividends paid to equity shareholders: 2013 2012 pence pence per ordinary 2013 per ordinary 2012 share m share m Ordinary dividends Interim dividend for the year ended 31 March 2013 48.17 1,900 - - Interim dividend for the year ended 31 March 2012 - - 8.87 350 48.17 1,900 8.87 350 8.
Intangible assets Keeping it simple Intangible assets includes software, which is written down amortised over the length of period we expect to receive a benefit from the asset.
Identifiable intangible assets are recorded at cost less accumulated amortisation and any provision for impairment.
Intangible assets are tested for impairment only if there is some indication that the carrying value of the assets may have been impaired.
Impairments of assets are calculated as the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the recoverable amount, if lower.
Where such an asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which that asset belongs is estimated.
Impairments are recognised in the income statement and are disclosed separately.
Any assets which suffered impairment in a previous period are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
Internally generated intangible fixed assets, such as software, are recognised only if: an asset is created that can be identified: it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits: and that the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recorded as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Intangible assets under development are not amortised.
Other non-current intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives.
The principal amortisation periods for categories of intangible assets are: Amortisation periods Years Software up to 8 Software m Cost at 1 April 2011 308 Additions 70 Disposals 4 Reclassifications between categories i 16 Cost at 31 March 2012 390 Additions 47 Disposals 7 Reclassifications between categories i 36 Cost at 31 March 2013 394 Accumulated amortisation at 1 April 2011 116 Amortisation charge for the year 41 Disposals 4 Accumulated amortisation at 31 March 2012 153 Amortisation charge for the year 54 Disposals 7 Reclassifications between categories i 8 Accumulated amortisation at 31 March 2013 192 Net book value at 31 March 2013 202 Net book value at 31 March 2012 237 i Reclassifications represents amounts transferred to property, plant and equipment see note 9.

Property, plant and equipment Keeping it simple This note shows the physical assets controlled by us.
The cost of these assets primarily represents the amount initially paid for them.
A depreciation expense is charged to the income statement to reflect annual wear and tear and the reduced value of the asset over time.
Depreciation is calculated by estimating the number of years we expect the asset to be used useful economic life and charging the cost of the asset to the income statement equally over this period.
Our strategy in action We operate a gas transmission and distribution business and therefore have a significant physical asset base.
We continue to invest in our networks to maintain reliability, create new customer connections and ensure our networks have the flexibility and resilience necessary to meet future challenges.
Our business plan envisages these additional investments will be funded through a mixture of cash generated from operations and new debt.
Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.
Cost includes the purchase price of the asset, any payroll and finance costs incurred which are directly attributable to the construction of property, plant and equipment.
Property, plant and equipment includes assets in which the Companys interest comprises legally protected statutory or contractual rights of use.
Additions represent the purchase or construction of new assets, including capital expenditure for safety and environmental assets, and extensions to, enhancements to, or replacement of existing assets.
Contributions received prior to 1 July 2009 towards the cost of property, plant and equipment are included in trade and other payables as deferred income and credited on a straight-line basis to the income statement over the estimated useful economic lives of the assets to which they relate.
Contributions received post 1 July 2009 are recognised in revenue immediately, except where the contributions are consideration for a future service, in which case they are recognised initially as deferred income and revenue is subsequently recognised over the period in which the service is provided.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land or assets in the course of construction.
Other items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated, on a straight-line basis, at rates estimated to write off their book values over their estimated useful economic lives.
In assessing estimated useful economic lives, consideration is given to any contractual arrangements and operational requirements relating to particular assets.
The assessment of estimated useful economic lives and residual values of assets are performed annually.
Unless otherwise determined by operational requirements, the depreciation periods for the principal categories of property, plant and equipment are, in general, as shown in the table below: Depreciation periods Years Freehold and leasehold buildings up to 50 Plant and Machinery - mains, services and regulating equipment 30 to 100 - meters and metering equipment 10 to 16 Motor vehicles and office equipment up to 7 Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are, dependent on their magnitude, recognised as an exceptional item within operating profit in the income statement.
Items within property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment only if there is some indication that the carrying value of the assets may have been impaired.

Derivative financial instruments Keeping it simple A derivative is a financial instrument used to manage the risk associated with fluctuations in the value of certain assets or liabilities.
In accordance with Board approved policies, we use derivatives to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rate and foreign exchange rate on borrowings and other contractual cash flows.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured at fair value at each reporting date.
Changes in fair values are recorded in either the income statement or other comprehensive income depending on the applicable accounting standards.
Analysis of these derivatives and the various methods used to calculate their respective fair values is detailed in note 25.
Derivatives are financial instruments that derive their value from the price of an underlying item such as interest rates, foreign exchange, credit spreads, commodities, equity or other indices.
Derivatives enable their users to manage their exposure to these market or credit risks.
We use derivatives to manage the interest rate and foreign exchange risks from our nancing portfolio and this enables the optimisation of the overall cost of accessing debt capital markets.
Derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value through profit or loss.
Where the fair value of a derivative is positive it is carried as a derivative asset, and where negative as a derivative liability.
Assets and liabilities on different transactions are only reported net if the transactions are with the same counterparty, a legal right of set off exists and the cash ows are intended to be settled on a net basis.
Gains and losses arising from the changes in fair value are included in the income statement in the period they arise.
We calculate fair value of the financial derivatives by discounting all future cash ows by the market yield curve at the reporting date.
The market yield curve for each currency is obtained from external sources for interest and foreign exchange rates.
In the case of derivative instruments that include options, the Blacks variation of the Black-Scholes model is used to calculate fair value.
Where possible, derivatives held as hedging instruments are formally designated as hedges as dened in IAS 39.
Derivatives may qualify as hedges for accounting purposes if they are fair value hedges, cash ow hedges or net investment hedges.
Hedge accounting allows derivatives to be designated as a hedge of another non-derivative financial instrument, to mitigate the impact of potential volatility in the income statement of changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments.
To qualify for hedge accounting, documentation is prepared specifying the hedging strategy, the component transactions and methodology used for effectiveness measurement.
National Grid Gas uses two hedge accounting methods, which are described as follows: Fair value hedges Fair value hedges principally consist of interest rate and cross-currency swaps that are used to protect against changes in the fair value of xed-rate, long-term financial instruments due to movements in market interest rates.
For qualifying fair value hedges, all changes in the fair value of the derivative and changes in the fair value of the item in relation to the risk being hedged are recognised in the income statement to the extent the fair value hedge is effective.
Adjustments made to the carrying amount of the hedged item for fair value hedges will be amortised over the remaining life, in line with the hedged item.
Cash ow hedges Exposure arises from the variability in future interest and currency cash ows on assets and liabilities which bear interest at variable rates or are in a foreign currency.
Interest rate and cross-currency swaps are maintained, and designated as cash ow hedges, where they qualify, to manage this exposure.
Fair value changes on designated cash ow hedges are initially recognised directly in the cash ow hedge reserve, as gains or losses recognised in equity and any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts are transferred from equity and recognised in the income statement as the income or expense is recognised on the hedged item.
Forward foreign currency contracts are used to hedge anticipated and committed future currency cash ows.
Where these contracts qualify for hedge accounting they are designated as cash ow hedges.
On recognition of the underlying transaction in the financial statements, the associated hedge gains and losses, deferred in equity, are transferred and included with the recognition of the underlying transaction.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is transferred to the income statement.
Where a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability results from a forecasted transaction or rm commitment being hedged, the amounts deferred in equity are included in the initial measurement of that non-monetary asset or liability.
Derivatives not in a formal hedge relationship Our policy is not to use derivatives for trading purposes.
However, due to the complex nature of hedge accounting under IAS 39 some derivatives may not qualify for hedge accounting, or are specically not designated as a hedge where natural offset is more appropriate.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in remeasurements within the income statement.
Discontinuation of hedge accounting Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gains or losses relating to cash ow hedges recognised in equity are initially retained in equity and subsequently recognised in the income statement in the same periods in which the previously hedged item affects net profit or loss.
For fair value hedges, the cumulative adjustment recorded to the carrying value of the hedged item at the date hedge accounting is discontinued is amortised to the income statement using the effective interest method.
Embedded Derivatives No adjustment is made with respect to derivative clauses embedded in financial instruments or other contracts that are defined as closely related to those instruments or contracts.
Consequently these embedded derivatives are not accounted for separately from the debt instrument.
Where there are embedded derivatives in host contracts not closely related, the embedded derivative is separately accounted for as a derivative financial instrument.

Inventories and current intangible assets Keeping it simple Inventories represent assets that we intend to use in order to generate revenue in future periods, either by using it to fulfil a service to a customer consumables or to maintain our network.
Inventories, which comprise raw materials, spares and consumables, are stated at cost, calculated on a weighted average basis, less provision for damage and obsolescence.
Cost comprises direct materials and those costs that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Emission allowances, principally relating to the emissions of carbon dioxide in the UK, are recorded as intangible assets within current assets and are initially recorded at cost and subsequently at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Where emission allowances are granted by relevant authorities, cost is deemed to be equal to the fair value at the date of allocation.
Receipts of such grants are treated as deferred income, which is recognised in the income statement as the related charges for emissions are recognised or on impairment of the related intangible asset.
A provision is recorded in respect of the obligation to deliver emission allowances and emission charges are recognised in the income statement in the period in which emissions are made.
2013 2012 m m Raw materials and consumables 21 22 Current intangible assets - emission allowances 1 3 22 25 There is a provision for obsolescence of 5m against inventories as at 31 March 2013 2012: 6m.
Trade and other receivables Keeping it simple Trade and other receivables are amounts which are due from our customers for services we have provided.
Other receivables also include prepayments made by us, for example, property lease rentals paid in advance.
Trade, loan and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less any appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
A provision is established for irrecoverable amounts when there is objective evidence that amounts due under the original payment terms will not be collected.
2013 2012 m m Trade receivables 64 72 Amounts owed by fellow subsidiaries 13 17 Prepayments and accrued income 311 207 Other receivables 8 8 396 304 Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and generally have a 30-90 day term.

National Grid Gas plc DN Regulatory accounting statements 2012 13 63 14.
Financial and other investments Keeping it simple Financial investments and other investments includes two main categories.
Assets that are classified as available-for-sale typically represent investments in short-term money funds and quoted investments in equities or bonds of other companies.
The second category is loans and receivables which includes cash balances that cannot be readily used in operations, principally collateral pledged for certain borrowings and restricted cash balances related to our UK pension schemes.
Financial assets, liabilities and equity instruments are classied according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into, and recognised on trade date.
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classied in any other categories.
Loans receivable and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently held at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Interest income, together with gains and losses when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, are recognised in the income statement.
Available-for-sale financial investments are recognised at fair value plus directly related incremental transaction costs, and are subsequently carried at fair value in the statement of financial position.
Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale investments are recognised directly in equity, until the investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired.
At this time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the income statement for the period.
Investment income is recognised using the effective interest method and taken through interest income in the income statement.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the fair values of financial instruments measured at fair value that are quoted in active markets are based on bid prices for assets held and offer prices for issued liabilities.
When independent prices are not available, fair values are determined by using valuation techniques that are consistent with techniques commonly used by the relevant market.
The techniques use observable market data.
2013 2012 m m Current Available-for-sale investments - investments in short-term money funds 582 174 Loans and receivables - amounts due from fellow subsidiaries 21 20 Loans and receivables - restricted cash balances i 272 257 875 451 i Comprises collateral placed with counterparties with whom we have entered into a credit support annex to the ISDA Master Agreement 102m 2012: 115m and secured bank accounts with charges in favour of the UK pension schemes Trustees of 170m 2012: 142m.
Available-for-sale investments are recorded at fair value.
Due to their short maturities the carrying value of loans and receivables approximates their fair value.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of the financial investments.
For further information on our credit risk, refer to note 25 c. None of the financial investments are past due or impaired.
Cash and cash equivalents Keeping it simple Cash and cash equivalents include cash balances, together with short-term investments with an original maturity of less than three months that are readily convertible to cash.
Net cash and cash equivalents reected in the cash ow statement are net of bank overdrafts, which are reported in borrowings.
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents and bank overdrafts approximate their fair values.
Cash at bank earns interest at oating rates based on daily bank deposit rates.
Short-term deposits are made for periods varying between one day and three months, depending on the immediate cash requirements, and earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates.
Net cash and cash equivalents held in currencies other than sterling have been converted into sterling at year-end exchange rates.
For further information on currency exposures, refer to note 25 a i.

Borrowings Keeping it simple We borrow money primarily in the form of bonds, borrowings from fellow subsidiaries and bank loans.
These are for a fixed term and may have fixed or floating interest rates.
As indicated in note 11, we use derivatives to manage risks associated with interest rates and foreign exchange.
Our strategy in action Our price controls and rate plans require us to fund our networks with a certain ratio of debt to equity and as a result we have issued a significant amount of debt.
As we continue to invest in our networks, the value of debt is expected to increase over time.
To maintain a strong balance sheet and to allow us to access capital markets at commercially acceptable interest rates, we balance the amount of debt we issue with the value of our assets, and take account of certain other metrics used by credit ratings agencies.
Borrowings, which include interest-bearing and inflation linked debt and overdrafts are recorded at their initial fair value which normally reects the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs less any repayments.
Subsequently these are stated at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.
Any difference between the proceeds after direct issue costs and the redemption value is recognised over the term of the borrowing in the income statement using the effective interest method.
Market values, where available, have been used to determine fair value.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The notional amount outstanding of the debt portfolio at 31 March 2013 was 10,072m 2012: 8,108m.
Collateral is placed with or received from any counterparty where we have entered into a credit support annex to the ISDA Master Agreement once the current mark-to-market valuation of the trades between the parties exceeds an agreed threshold.
Included in current bank loans is 499m 2012: 479m in respect of cash received under collateral agreements.
At 31 March 2013, we had bilateral committed credit facilities of 425m 2012: 425m of which 425m was undrawn 2012: 425m undrawn.
Subsequent to the year-end these facilities were renegotiated to 400m for a further five years.
All of the unused facilities at 31 March 2013 and 31 March 2012 were held as backup to commercial paper and similar borrowings.
None of the Company's borrowings are secured by charges over assets of the Company.
National Grid Gas plc DN Regulatory accounting statements 2012 13 65 17.
Trade and other payables Keeping it simple Trade and other payables includes amounts owed to suppliers, tax authorities and other parties which are due to be settled within 12 months.
The total also includes deferred income, which represents monies received from customers but for which we have not yet completed the associated service.
These amounts are recognised as revenue when the service is provided.
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.

All other trade and other payables are recorded at amortised cost.
Other non-current liabilities Keeping it simple Other non-current liabilities include deferred income which will not be recognised as income until after 31 March 2014.
It also includes payables that are not due until after that date.

Provisions Keeping it simple We make provisions when an obligation exists, relating to events in the past and it is probable that cash will be paid to settle it, but the amount of cash required can only be estimated.
The main estimates relate to environmental costs for various sites we own or have owned which require restoration or remediation and other provisions, including lease contracts we have entered into that are now unprofitable.
Our strategy in action We are committed to the protection and enhancement of the environment.
However, we have acquired, owned and operated a number of assets which have, during the course of their operations, created an environmental impact.
We have a provision that reflects the expected cost to remediate these sites and it is uncommon that new sites with significant expected costs are added to the provision as a result of current operations.
Provisions are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation exists at the reporting date, as a result of a past event, where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated and where the outflow of economic benefit is probable.
Provision is made for environmental costs, based on future estimated expenditures, discounted to present values.
An initial estimate of environmental costs attributable to property, plant and equipment is recorded as part of the original cost of the related property, plant and equipment.
Changes in the provision arising from revised estimates or discount rates or changes in the expected timing of expenditures that relate to property, plant and equipment are recorded as adjustments to their carrying value and depreciated prospectively over their remaining estimated useful economic lives: otherwise such changes are recognised in the income statement.
The unwinding of the discount is included within the income statement as a nancing charge.

Cash flows are expected to be incurred between 2013 and 2062.
A number of uncertainties affect the calculation of the provision including the impact of regulation, the accuracy of the site surveys, unexpected contaminants, transportation costs, the impact of alternative technologies and changes in the discount rate.
The provision incorporates our best estimate of the financial effect of these uncertainties, but future material changes in any of the assumptions could materially impact on the calculation of the provision and hence the income statement.
The undiscounted amount of the provision at 31 March 2013 was 107m 2012: 92m, being the best undiscounted estimate of the liability having regard to these uncertainties.
Restructuring provision At 31 March 2013, 3m of the total restructuring provision 2012: 14m related to the restructuring of our LNG storage facilities, and 9m consisted of provisions for the disposal of surplus leasehold interests and rates payable on surplus properties 2012: 13m.
The expected payment dates for property restructuring costs remain uncertain.
The remainder of the restructuring provision related to business reorganisation costs which are expected to be paid until 2014.
Other provisions Other provisions at 31 March 2013 include 24m 2012: 24m in respect of employer liability claims.
In accordance with insurance industry practice, the estimates for employer liability claims are based on experience from previous years and, therefore, there is no identifiable payment date associated with these items.
Other provisions also include 20m 2012: nil estimated metering legal claims and 12m 2012: nil in respect of gas distribution transformation.

Share capital Keeping it simple Ordinary share capital represents the total number of shares issued for which dividends accrue.
Share capital is accounted for as an equity instrument.
An equity instrument is any contract that includes a residual interest in the consolidated assets of the Company after deducting all its liabilities and is recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs, with an amount equal to the nominal amount of the shares issued included in the share capital account and the balance recorded in the share premium account.

Commitments and contingencies Keeping it simple Commitments are those amounts that we are contractually required to pay in the future as long as the other party meets their obligations.
These commitments primarily relate to operating lease rentals and energy purchase agreements which, in many cases, extend over a long period of time.
We also disclose any guarantees that companies have given, where we pledge assets against current obligations which will remain for a specific period.

Related party transactions Keeping it simple A related party is a company or individual who also has an interest in us, for example a company that provides a service to us with a director who holds a controlling stake in that company and who is also a Director of National Grid plc.
The related parties identified include joint ventures, associated undertakings, investments and key management personnel.
The following significant transactions with related parties were in the normal course of business: amounts receivable from and payable to related parties are due on normal commercial terms: Parent Other related parties Total 2013 2012 2013 2012 2013 2012 m m m m m m Income: Goods and services supplied - - 5 10 5 10 Expenditure: Services received - - 4 25 4 25 Corporate services received - - 17 15 17 15 Charges in respect of pensions costs - - 67 64 67 64 Interest received on borrowings from fellow subsidiaries - - - 1 - 1 Interest paid on borrowings from fellow subsidiaries - - 7 8 7 8 - - 95 113 95 113 Outstanding balances at 31 March in respect of income, expenditure and settlement of corporation tax: Amounts receivable - - 13 17 13 17 Amounts payable - - 106 107 106 107 Advances to fellow subsidiaries due within one year : At 1 April 19 19 1 - 20 19 Advances 2 - - 1 2 1 At 31 March 21 19 1 1 22 20 Advances to parent due after more than one year : At 1 April 5,611 5,611 - - 5,611 5,611 Repayments 2 - - 2 - At 31 March 5,609 5,611 - - 5,609 5,611 Borrowings payable to fellow subsidiaries amounts due within one year : At 1 April - - 117 369 117 369 Advances - - 1,994 62 1,994 62 Repayments - - - 314 - 314 At 31 March - - 2,111 117 2,111 117 Amounts receivable from or payable to related parties in respect of sales and expenditure are ordinarily settled one month in arrears.
The advance to the parent due after more than one year is not interest bearing.
Other advances to and borrowings from fellow subsidiaries are repayable on demand and bear interest at commercial rates.
No amounts have been provided at 31 March 2013 2012: nil and no expense has been recognised during the year 2012: nil in respect of bad or doubtful debts for related party transactions.
Details of guarantees provided in respect of related parties are provided in note 22.

Actuarial information on pensions Keeping it simple Further details of the defined benefit scheme plans terms and the actuarial assumptions used to value the associated assets and obligations are set out in this note.
When deciding on these assumptions we take independent actuarial advice.
Comparatively small changes in the assumptions used may have a significant effect on the overall deficit or surplus of a defined benefit scheme.
The National Grid UK Pension Scheme is funded with assets held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The arrangements are subject to independent actuarial valuations at least every three years and following consultation and agreement with us, the qualified actuary certifies the rate of employer's contribution, which, together with the specified contributions payable by the employees and proceeds from the scheme's assets, are expected to be sufficient to fund the benefits payable under the scheme.
The last full actuarial valuation was carried out as at 31 March 2010 and the 2013 valuation process has commenced.
The results of the 2010 valuation is as follows: Latest full actuarial valuation 31 March 2010 Actuary Towers Watson Market value of scheme assets at latest valuation 13,399m Actuarial value of benefits due to members 13,998 m Market value as percentage of benefits 96% Funding deficit 599m Funding deficit net of tax 455m The 2010 actuarial valuation showed that, based on long-term financial assumptions, the contribution rate required to meet future benefit accrual was 35% of pensionable earnings 32% employers and 3% employees.
In addition, National Grid makes payments to the scheme to cover administration costs and the Pension Protection Fund PPF levy.
The employer contribution rate, administration and PPF levy costs will be reviewed as part of the 2013 actuarial valuation.
Following the 2010 actuarial valuation, National Grid and the Trustees agreed a recovery plan which would see the funding deficit repaid by 31 March 2027.
Under the schedule of contributions, no deficit contributions were made in 2010 11 or 2011 12.
Annual payments of 47m, rising in line with the RPI from March 2010, commenced in 2012 13 and are set to continue until 2027.
Following this agreement, National Grid has established a secured bank account with a charge in favour of the Trustees.
The balance of the bank account at 31 March 2013 was 170m.
The funds in the bank account will be paid to the scheme in the event that National Grid Gas plc is subject to an insolvency event, or is given notice of less than 12 months that Ofgem intends to revoke its licence under the Gas Act 1986.
The funds in the bank account will be released back to National Grid if the scheme moves into surplus.
This scheme ceased to allow new hires to join from 1 April 2002.
A dened contribution arrangement was offered for employees joining after these dates.
The Group is currently reviewing the defined contribution arrangement it offers to employees and new hires in the UK.
Asset allocations The major categories of plan assets as a percentage of total plan assets were as follows: 2013 2012 % % Equities 29.4 31.6 Corporate bonds 36.2 35.7 Gilts 26.4 23.1 Property 6.5 7.6 Other 1.5 2.0 Total 100.0 100.0 Actuarial assumptions The expected long-term rate of return on assets has been set reflecting the price inflation expectation, the expected real return on each major asset class and the long-term asset allocation strategy adopted for the scheme.
The expected real returns on specific asset classes reflect historical returns, investment yields on the measurement date and general future return expectations, and have been set after taking advice from independent actuaries.

Financial risk Keeping it simple Our activities expose us to a variety of financial risks: market risk, including foreign exchange risk, fair value interest rate risk, cash ow interest rate risk: credit risk: and liquidity risk.
Our overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential volatility of financial performance.
We use financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, to manage risks of this type.
This note describes our approach to managing market risk, including an analysis of assets and liabilities by currency type and an analysis of interest rate category for our net debt.
We are required by accounting standards to also include a number of specific disclosures, such as an analysis of contractual undiscounted cashflows by year falling due and have included these requirements below.
Risk management related to nancing activities is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the Finance Committee of the Board.
The objective of the treasury department is to manage funding and liquidity requirements, including managing associated financial risks, to within acceptable boundaries.
The Finance Committee provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specic areas such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and investment of excess liquidity.
a Market risk i Foreign exchange risk We are exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from non-sterling future commercial transactions and non-sterling recognised assets and liabilities.
Our policy for managing foreign exchange risk is to hedge contractually committed foreign currency cash flows over a prescribed minimum size.
Where foreign currency cash forecasts are less certain, our policy is to hedge a proportion of the cash flows based on the probability of those cash flows occurring.
Instruments used to manage foreign exchange transaction risk include foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign exchange swaps.
During 2013 and 2012, derivative financial instruments were used to manage foreign currency risk as follows: 2013 Sterling Euro Dollar Other Total m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 20 - - - 20 Financial investments 875 - - - 875 Borrowings i 8,066 836 883 369 10,154 Pre-derivative position 7,171 836 883 369 9,259 Derivative effect 1,438 781 878 369 590 Net debt position 8,609 55 5 - 8,669 2012 Sterling Euro Dollar Other Total m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents - 1 - - 1 Financial investments 451 - - - 451 Borrowings i 6,135 832 802 370 8,139 Pre-derivative position 5,684 831 802 370 7,687 Derivative effect 1,458 787 800 370 499 Net debt position 7,142 44 2 - 7,188 i Includes bank overdrafts There was no significant currency exposure on other financial instruments, including trade receivables and payables, and other receivables and payables.

Financial risk continued a Market risk continued ii Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises from our long-term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose us to cash flow interest rate risk, partially offset by cash held at variable rates.
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose us to fair value interest rate risk.
Our interest rate risk management policy seeks to minimise total financing costs being interest costs and changes in the market value of debt subject to constraints.
We do this by using fixed and floating-rate debt and derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps, swaptions and forward rate agreements.
We hold some borrowings on issue that are ination linked.
We believe that these provide a partial economic offset to the ination risk associated with our UK ination linked revenues.
The table in note 16 borrowings sets out the carrying amount, by contractual maturity, of borrowings that are exposed to interest rate risk before taking into account interest rate swaps.
During 2013 and 2012, net debt was managed using derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risk as follows: 2013 Fixed Floating rate rate RPI Other i Total m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 20 - - - 20 Financial investments - 854 - 21 875 Borrowings ii 3,525 2,759 3,870 - 10,154 Pre-derivative position 3,505 1,905 3,870 21 9,259 Derivative effect 1,223 784 151 - 590 Net debt position iii 2,282 2,689 3,719 21 8,669 2012 Fixed Floating rate rate RPI Other i Total m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 1 - - - 1 Financial investments - 431 - 20 451 Borrowings ii 3,420 950 3,769 - 8,139 Pre-derivative position 3,419 519 3,769 20 7,687 Derivative effect 819 435 115 - 499 Net debt position iii 2,600 954 3,654 20 7,188 i Represents financial instruments which are not directly affected by interest rate risk, including investments in equity or other non-interest bearing instruments.

Financial risk continued b Fair value analysis The financial instruments included on the statement of financial position are measured at fair value.
These fair values can be categorised into hierarchy levels that reflect the significance of the inputs used in measuring the fair value.
The best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an actively traded market.
In the event that the market for a financial instrument is not active, a valuation technique is used.
2013 2012 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total m m m m m m m m Assets Available-for-sale investments 582 - - 582 174 - - 174 Derivative financial instruments - 1,095 1 1,096 - 941 1 942 582 1,095 1 1,678 174 941 1 1,116 - - - Liabilities Derivative financial instruments - 447 59 506 - 348 95 443 Total 582 648 58 1,172 174 593 94 673 Level 1: Financial instruments with quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
Level 2: Financial instruments with quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets and financial instruments valued using models where all significant inputs are based directly or indirectly on observable market data.
Level 3: Financial instruments valued using valuation techniques where one or more significant inputs are based on unobservable market data.
Our level 3 derivative financial instruments include currency swaps where the currency forward curve is illiquid and ination linked swaps where the ination curve is illiquid.
In valuing these instruments a third party valuation is obtained to support each reported fair value.
The changes in value of our level 3 derivative financial instruments are as follows: 2013 2012 Level 3 Level 3 Valuation Valuation m m At 1 April 94 1 Net gains losses for the year i 36 22 Purchases - 72 Settlements - 1 At 31 March 58 94 i Gains of 36m 2012: 22m loss are attributable to assets or liabilities held at the end of the reporting period and have been recognised in finance costs in the income statement.
The impacts on a post-tax basis of reasonably possible changes in significant level 3 assumptions are as follows: 2013 2012 Income Other Income Other Statement equity Statement equity reserves reserves m m m m 20 basis points change in LPI market curve i 24 - 22 - - 20 basis points change in LPI market curve 23 - 21 - i A reasonably possible change in assumption of other level 3 derivative financial instruments is unlikely to result in a material change in fair values.
The impacts disclosed above were considered on a contract by contract basis with the most significant unobservable inputs identied.

Financial risk continued c Credit risk We are exposed to the risk of loss resulting from counterparties default on their commitments including failure to pay or make a delivery on a contract.
This risk is inherent in our commercial business activities.
We are exposed to credit risk on our cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments, deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
Treasury related credit risk Counterparty risk arises from the investment of surplus funds and from the use of derivative instruments.
Our limits are managed by the central treasury department of National Grid, as explained under risk factors on pages 15 to 18.
As at 31 March 2012 and 2013, we had a number of exposures to individual counterparties.
In accordance with our treasury policies, counterparty credit exposure utilisations are monitored daily against the counterparty credit limits.
Counterparty credit ratings and market conditions are reviewed continually with limits being revised and utilisation adjusted, if appropriate.
We do not expect any significant losses from non-performance by these counterparties.
The counterparty exposure under derivative financial contracts as shown in note 11 was 1,096m 2012: 942m : after netting agreements it was 808m 2012: 789m.
This exposure is further reduced by collateral received as shown in note 16.
Wholesale and retail credit risk Our principal commercial exposure is governed by the credit rules within the Uniform Network Code.
These lay down the level of credit relative to the regulatory asset value RAV for each credit rating.
Our credit policies and practices are designed to limit credit exposure by collecting security deposits prior to providing utility services, or after utility service has commenced if certain applicable regulatory requirements are met.
Collection activities are managed on a daily basis.
Sales to retail customers are usually settled in cash, cheques, electronic bank payments or by using major credit cards.
The utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored and collateral is collected against these accounts when necessary.
Management does not expect any significant losses of receivables that have not been provided for as shown in note 13. d Liquidity analysis We determine our liquidity requirements by the use of both short and long-term cash flow forecasts.
These forecasts are supplemented by a financial headroom analysis which is used to assess funding adequacy for at least a 24 month period.
We believe our contractual obligations, including those shown in commitments and contingencies in note 22 can be met from existing cash and investments, operating cash ows and other nancings that we reasonably expect to be able to secure in the future, together with the use of committed facilities if required.
Our debt agreements and banking facilities contain covenants, including those relating to the periodic and timely provision of financial information by the issuing entity, and, in addition, certain of our loan agreements assume current rating levels.
Failure to comply with these covenants, or to obtain waivers of these requirements, could in some cases trigger a right, at the lenders discretion, to require repayment of some of our debt.
These requirements are monitored on a regular basis.
The following is an analysis of the contractual undiscounted cash flows payable under financial liabilities, and derivative assets and liabilities as at the reporting date: Due Due Due Due between between 3 years within 1 and 2 2 and 3 and 1 year years years beyond Total At 31 March 2013 m m m m m Non-derivative financial liabilities Borrowings 3,111 127 - 6,834 10,072 Interest payments on borrowings i 224 210 213 3,081 3,728 Other non-interest bearing liabilities 454 7 - - 461 Derivative financial liabilities Derivative contracts - receipts 341 558 158 371 1,428 Derivative contract - payments 171 250 75 450 946 Total at 31 March 2013 3,619 36 130 9,994 13,779 Due Due Due Due between between 3 years within 1 and 2 2 and 3 and 1 year years years beyond Total At 31 March 2012 m m m m m Non-derivative financial liabilities Borrowings 847 475 125 6,661 8,108 Interest payments on borrowings i 229 211 211 3,233 3,884 Other non-interest bearing liabilities 380 16 - - 396 Derivative financial liabilities Derivative contract - receipts 122 475 451 218 1,266 Derivative contract - payments 75 379 187 121 762 Total at 31 March 2012 1,409 606 72 9,797 11,884 i The interest on borrowings is calculated based on borrowings held at 31 March without taking account of future issues.
Floating rate interest is estimated using a forward interest rate curve as at 31 March.
Payments are included on the basis of the earliest date on which the Company can be required to settle.

Financial risk continued e Capital risk management Our objectives when managing capital are: to safeguard our ability to continue as a going concern, to remain within regulatory constraints of our regulated operating company and to maintain an efficient mix of debt and equity funding thus achieving an optimal capital structure and cost of capital.
Maintaining appropriate credit ratings for our regulated company is an important aspect of our capital risk management strategy and balance sheet efficiency.
We monitor our balance sheet efficiency by regulatory asset value RAV gearing calculated as net debt expressed as a percentage of RAV, and indicates the level of debt employed to fund our regulated business.
The RAV gearing ratio at 31 March 2013 was 60% compared with 52% at 31 March 2012.
We regularly review and maintain or adjust the capital structure as appropriate in order to manage the level of RAV gearing.
It is compared with the level of RAV gearing indicated by Ofgem as being appropriate for our business, at around 60%.
Sensitivities on areas of estimation and uncertainty Keeping it simple In order to give a clearer picture of the impact that potential changes in estimates and assumptions could have on our results and financial position, the following sensitivities are presented.
These sensitivities are hypothetical only, as they are based on assumptions and conditions prevailing at the year end, and should be used with caution.
The effects provided are not necessarily indicative of the actual effects that would be experienced because our actual exposures are constantly changing.
Revenue accruals A 10% change in our estimate of unbilled revenues at 31 March 2013 would result in an increase or decrease in our recorded net assets and profit for the year by approximately 29m 2012: 20m net of tax.
Asset useful lives An increase in the economic useful lives of assets of one year on average would reduce our annual depreciation charge on property, plant and equipment by 12m 2012: 12m pre-tax and our annual amortisation charge on intangible assets by 7m 2012: 5m pre-tax.
Hedge accounting If, using our derivative financial instruments, hedge accounting had not been achieved during the year ended 31 March 2013, then the profit after tax for the year would have been 32m higher 2012: 117m higher than that reported net of tax and net assets would have been 32m higher 2012: 112m higher.
Provisions A 10% change in the estimates of future cash flows in respect of provisions for liabilities would result in an increase or decrease in our provisions of approximately 18m 2012: 16m.
Assets carried at fair value A 10% change in assets and liabilities carried at fair value would result in an increase or decrease in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments of 59m 2012: 50m.
Pensions and other post retirement obligations The impact of increases in the discount rate, salary inflation and life expectancy is shown in the table below.
The effect of a change in the discount rate, driven by changes in corporate bond interest rates, would be expected to have a partial offset due to the related effects on asset values.

Sensitivities on areas of estimation and uncertainty continued Financial Risk Our financial instruments are sensitive to changes in market variables, being UK interest rates and the UK RPI.
The changes in market variables impacts the valuation of our borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The following analysis illustrates the sensitivity of our financial instruments to the changes in market variables.
The following main assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: the amount of net debt, the ratio of xed to oating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the hedge designations in place at 31 March 2013 and 2012 respectively: the statement of financial position sensitivity to interest rates relates only to derivative financial instruments and available-for-sale investments, as debt and other deposits are carried at amortised cost and so their carrying value does not change as interest rates move: the sensitivity of accrued interest to movements in interest rates is calculated on net oating rate exposures on debt, deposits and derivative instruments: and changes in the carrying value of derivatives from movements in interest rates of designated cash ow hedges are assumed to be recorded fully within equity.
Using the above assumptions, and a number of others which have a far smaller impact overall, the following table shows the illustrative effect on the income statement and items that are recognised directly in equity that would result from reasonably probable movements in the UK RPI and UK interest rates, after the effects of tax.
