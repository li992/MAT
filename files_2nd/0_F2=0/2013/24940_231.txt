Finance lease receivables HSBC leases a variety of assets to third parties under finance leases, including transport assets such as aircraft, property and general plant and machinery.
At the end of lease terms, assets may be sold to third parties or leased for further terms.
Lessees may participate in any sales proceeds achieved.
Lease rentals arising during the lease terms will either be fixed in quantum or be varied to reflect changes in, for example, tax or interest rates.
Rentals are calculated to recover the cost of assets less their residual value, and earn finance income.

42 Structured entities HSBC is involved with structured entities, mainly through securitisation of financial assets, conduits and investment funds.
HSBC arrangements that involve structured entities are authorised centrally when they are established to ensure appropriate purpose and governance.
The activities of structured entities administered by HSBC are closely monitored by senior management.
HSBC has involvement with both consolidated and unconsolidated structured entities, which may be established by HSBC or by a third party, as detailed below.
Structured entities are assessed for consolidation in accordance with the accounting policy set out in Note 1 e. 550 Consolidated structured entities Total assets of HSBCs consolidated structured entities, split by entity type HSBC managed Conduits Securitisations funds Other Total US$bn US$bn US$bn US$bn US$bn At 31 December 2013.................................... 38.9 7.1 13.9 8.2 68.1 At 31 December 2012..................................... 38.4 9.0 12.1 3.5 63.0 Conduits HSBC has established and manages two types of conduits: securities investment conduits SICs and multi-seller conduits.
These entities have been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who has control: in such cases, the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangement.
The conduits are consolidated as HSBC is exposed or has the right to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect its returns through its power over the entity.
Securities investment conduits Solitaire, HSBCs principal SIC, purchases highly rated asset-backed securities ABSs to facilitate tailored investment opportunities.
At 31 December 2013, Solitaire held US$9.0bn of ABSs 2012: US$10.0bn.
These are included within the disclosures of ABS held through consolidated structured entities on page 206.
HSBCs other SICs, Mazarin, Barion and Malachite, evolved from the restructuring of HSBCs structured investment vehicles SIVs in 2008.
Solitaire Solitaire is currently funded entirely by commercial paper CP issued to HSBC.
Although HSBC continues to provide a liquidity facility, Solitaire has no need to draw on it so long as HSBC purchases the CP issued, which it intends to do for the foreseeable future.
Mazarin HSBC is exposed to the par value of Mazarins assets through the provision of a liquidity facility equal to the lesser of the amortised cost of issued senior debt and the amortised cost of non-defaulted assets.
At 31 December 2013, this amounted to US$7.4bn 2012: US$8.4bn.
First loss protection is provided through the capital notes issued by Mazarin, which are substantially all held by third parties.
At 31 December 2013, HSBC held 1.3% of Mazarins capital notes 2012: 1.3% with a par value of US$17m 2012: US$17m and a carrying amount of US$0.3m 2012: nil.
Barion and Malachite HSBCs primary exposure to these SICs is represented by the amortised cost of the debt required to support the non-cash assets of the vehicles.
At 31 December 2013, this amounted to US$6.3bn 2012: US$7.4bn.
First loss protection is provided through the capital notes issued by these vehicles, which are substantially all held by third parties.
At 31 December 2013, HSBC held 3.8 % of the capital notes 2012: 3.7% issued by these vehicles with a par value of US$37m 2012: US$36m and a carrying amount of US$3.3m 2012: US$1.7m.
Multi-seller conduits These vehicles were established for the purpose of providing access to flexible market-based sources of finance for HSBCs clients.
HSBC bears risk equal to transaction-specific liquidity facilities offered to the multi-seller conduits amounting to US$15.7bn at 31 December 2013 2012: US$14.3bn.
First loss protection is provided by the originator of the assets, and not by HSBC, through transaction-specific credit enhancements.
A layer of secondary loss protection is provided by HSBC in the form of programme-wide enhancement facilities.
Securitisations HSBC uses structured entities to securitise customer loans and advances that it has originated in order to diversify its sources of funding for asset origination and capital efficiency purposes.
The loans and advances are transferred by 551 Shareholder Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Financial Review Strategic Report HSBC HOLDINGS PLC Notes on the Financial Statements continued 42 Structured entities HSBC to the structured entities for cash or synthetically through credit default swaps, and the structured entities issue debt securities to investors.
HSBC managed funds HSBC has established a number of money market and non-money market funds.
Where it is deemed to be acting as principal rather than agent in its role as investment manager, HSBC controls and hence consolidates these funds.
Other HSBC has also entered into a number of transactions in the normal course of business which include asset and structured finance transactions where it has control of the structured entity.
In addition, HSBC is deemed to control a number of third-party managed funds through its involvement as a principal in the funds.
Unconsolidated structured entities The term unconsolidated structured entities refers to all structured entities that are not controlled by HSBC.
HSBC enters into transactions with unconsolidated structured entities in the normal course of business to facilitate customer transactions and for specific investment opportunities.
The table below shows the total assets of unconsolidated structured entities in which HSBC has an interest at the reporting date, as well as its maximum exposure to loss in relation to those interests.
The maximum exposure to loss from HSBCs interests in unconsolidated structured entities represents the maximum loss that HSBC could incur as a result of HSBCs involvement with unconsolidated structured entities regardless of the probability of the loss being incurred.
For commitments and guarantees, and written credit default swaps, the maximum exposure to loss is the notional amount of potential future losses.
For retained and purchased investments in and loans to unconsolidated structured entities, the maximum exposure to loss is the carrying value of these interests at the balance sheet reporting date.
The maximum exposure to loss is stated gross of the effects of hedging and collateral arrangements entered into to mitigate HSBCs exposure to loss.

Securitisations HSBC has interests in unconsolidated securitisation vehicles through holding notes issued by these entities.
HSBC managed funds HSBC establishes and manages money market funds and non-money market investment funds to provide customers with investment opportunities.
Further information on Funds under management is provided on page 130.
HSBC, as fund manager, may be entitled to receive management and performance fees based on the assets under management.
HSBC may also retain units in these funds.
Non-HSBC managed funds HSBC purchases and holds units of third-party managed funds in order to facilitate both business and customer needs.
Other HSBC has established structured entities in the normal course of business such as structured credit transactions for customers, to provide finance to public and private sector infrastructure projects, and for asset and structured finance transactions.
HSBC sponsored structured entities The definition of a sponsor is given in Note 2 o.
In some cases, HSBC does not have an interest in these entities at the reporting date.
The amount of assets transferred to and income received from such sponsored entities during 2013 was not significant.
