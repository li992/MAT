The group makes full provision for the future cost of decommissioning oil and natural gas wells, facilities and related pipelines on a discounted basis upon installation.
The provision for the costs of decommissioning these wells, production facilities and pipelines at the end of their economic liveshas been estimated using existing technology, at current prices or future assumptions, depending on the expected timing of the activity, and discounted using a real discount rate of 1% 2012 0.5%.
The amount provided in the year for new or increased decommissioning provisions was $2,092 million 2012 $3,766 million.
The weighted average period over which these costs are generally expected to be incurred is estimated to be approximately 20 years.
While the provision is based on the best estimate of future costs and the economic lives of the facilities and pipelines, there is uncertainty regarding both the amount and timing of these costs.
Provisions for environmental remediation are made when a clean-up is probable and the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Generally, this coincides with commitment to a formal plan of action or, if earlier, on divestment or on closure of inactive sites.
The provision for environmental liabilities has been estimated using existing technology, at current prices and discounted using a real discount rate of 1% 2012 0.5%.
The weighted average period over which these costs are generally expected to be incurred is estimated to be approximately five years.
The extent and cost of future remediation programmes are inherently difficult to estimate: they depend on the scale of any possible contamination, the timing and extent of corrective actions, and also the groups share of the liability.
The litigation category includes provisions for matters related to, for example, commercial disputes, product liability, and allegations of exposures of third parties to toxic substances.
Included within the other category at 31 December 2013 are provisions for deferred employee compensation of $602 million 2012 $618 million.
These provisions are discounted using either a nominal discount rate of 3.25% 2012 2.5% or a real discount rate of 1% 2012 0.5%, as appropriate.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits Most group companies have pension plans, the forms and benefits of which vary with conditions and practices in the countries concerned.
Pension benefits may be provided through defined contribution plans money purchase schemes or defined benefit plans final salary and other types of schemes with committed pension payments.
For defined contribution plans, retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee.
For defined benefit plans, retirement benefits are based on such factors as the employees pensionable salary and length of service.
Defined benefit plans may be funded or unfunded.
The assets of funded plans are generally held in separately administered trusts.
In particular, the primary pension arrangement in the UK is a funded final salary pension plan under which retired employees draw the majority of their benefit as an annuity.
This pension plan is governed by a trustee board composed of four member-nominated and four company-nominated representatives, an independent chairman, an independent director and a chief executive officer appointed by the chairman.
The trustee board is required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants and is responsible for setting certain policies, such as investment policies of theplan.
