DeFIneD BeneFIt retIreMent sCHeMes The principal pension schemes within the Group have been valued for the purposes of IAS 19 Revised Employee benefits.
For each of these pension schemes valuation information has been updated by Lane Clark & Peacock LLP, qualified independent actuaries, to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 Revised in order to assess the liabilities of the various schemes as at 31 December 2013.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
As permitted by IAS 19 Revised, actuarial gains and losses are recognised outside profit or loss and presented in other comprehensive income.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the various defined benefit obligations, as reduced by the fair value of plan assets.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method.
The Group contributes to various defined benefit pension schemes in the UK and overseas.
By far the most significant arrangement is the Interserve Pension Scheme in the UK, where benefits are generally related to service and final salary.
The Group operates a defined contribution plan for new hires, with membership of the defined benefit arrangements only permitted when specific contract terms require defined benefit provision.
Contributions to the defined contribution arrangements are in addition to those set out below and are charged directly to profit and loss.
The current funding target for the Groups defined benefit schemes is to maintain assets equal to the value of the accrued benefits based on projected salaries where relevant.
The regulatory framework in the UK requires the Trustees and Group to agree upon the assumptions underlying the funding target, and then to agree upon the necessary contributions required to recover any deficit at the valuation date.
There is a risk to the Group that adverse experience could lead to a requirement for the Group to make considerable contributions to recover any deficit.
The following table sets out the key IAS 19 Revised assumptions used to assess the present value of the defined benefit obligation.
The assumptions shown are in relation to the Interserve Pension Scheme, which represents 92% of the total defined benefit obligation.
The life expectancy assumptions shown relate to the vast majority of the membership of that scheme.
Alternative assumptions have been used for the less material arrangements where the specific nature of those schemes deems it appropriate to do so.
The weighted average duration of the expected benefit payments for the schemes is around 18 years.

DeFIneD BeneFIt retIreMent sCHeMes ConTInUED The amount included in the balance sheet arising from the Groups obligations in respect of the various pension schemes is as follows: 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 million million million million million Present value of defined benefit obligation 826.9 799.3 695.0 642.3 627.4 Fair value of schemes assets 819.2 698.2 638.8 590.8 532.1 Liability recognised in the balance sheet 7.7 101.1 56.2 51.5 95.3 The change in the net liabilities recognised in the balance sheet is comprised as follows: 2013 2012 million million restated note 1 opening net liability 101.1 56.2 Expense charges to profit and loss 10.7 9.7 Amount recognised outside profit and loss 21.3 71.8 Employer contributions 82.8 36.6 Closing net liability 7.7 101.1 Indicative change in defined benefit obligation 2013 2012 Sensitivity million million Sensitivity to significant actuarial assumptions Price inflation 0.5% pa -50 -47 Discount rate 0.5% pa -67 -64 Post retirement mortality expectancy of life in years 1 year increase 25 24 The sensitivities shown above reflect only the change in the assessed defined benefit obligation.
In practice any movement in assumptions is likely to be accompanied by a partially offsetting change in asset values, and the corresponding overall impact on the net liability is therefore likely to be lower than the amounts above.
The amounts recognised in the income statement are as follows: 2013 2012 million million restated note 1 Employers part of current service cost 7.4 5.8 Administration costs 1.9 1.9 net interest expense 1.4 2.0 Total expense recognised in the income statement 10.7 9.7 The current service cost and administration costs are included within operating profit.
The interest cost is included within financing costs.
The 2012 figures have been restated under IAS 19 Revised.
There has been no impact on the disclosed benefit obligation, fair value of assets or net liabilities.
However, the net charge to the income statement has increased by 3.1 million relative to that previously disclosed for 2012, and the actuarial losses recognised for 2012 have decreased correspondingly by 3.1 million.

As a result of this investment the Group has additional exposure to 99.5 million of equity performance as at 31 December 2013 2012: 79.3 million.
Around 81% of the Groups direct equity investments are in relation to UK equities 2012: 79%.
Holdings in government bonds are predominantly index-linked.
Alternative investments include diversified growth funds, fund of hedge funds and emerging market multi-asset funds primarily unquoted.
The infrastructure holding is the portfolio of 13 PFI investments transferred by Interserve to the Interserve Pension Scheme at the end of november 2009 and the 19 additional PFI investments transferred in January 2013.
The schemes have not directly invested in any of the Groups other financial instruments nor in other assets or properties used by the Group.
