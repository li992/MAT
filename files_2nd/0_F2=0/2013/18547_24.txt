Adoption of new and revised standards At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective any other standards not listed below have been applied in these financial statements : IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS 11 Joint arrangements IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities IAS 28 amended Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures IAS 27 amended Separate Financial Statements IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 amended Investment Entities IAS 32 amended Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities IAS 36 amended Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets IAS 39 amended Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting IFRIC 21 Levies The Directors of the Company the Directors expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will not have a material impact.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed review has been completed.
Significant accounting policies Compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
IFRS includes the standards and interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB including International Accounting Standards IAS and interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC.
This is the Groups first set of consolidated financial statements that comply with IFRS.
Please refer to note 31 for the disclosures required by IFRS 1, First-Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied in preparing the financial statements for the years ended 31 December 2012 and 2013.
Basis of preparation These financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis.
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.
58 Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2013 3.
Significant accounting policies continued Basis of consolidation The financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries made up to 31 December each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the date the Company gains control until the date when the Company ceases to control the subsidiary.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Going concern After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, having considered the Company forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance and the current economic uncertainty.
Accordingly, they have adopted the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Further detail is contained in the Directors Report on page 45. Business combinations Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The consideration for each acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as incurred.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 2008 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Goodwill Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired the acquisition date.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirers previously held equity interest if any in the entity over the net of the acquisition-date fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Other intangible assets Intangible assets other than goodwill that are acquired by the Group, representing the acquired Foxtons brand name, are stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
The brand name is considered to have an indefinite economic life because of the institutional nature of the brand name, its proven ability to maintain market leadership and profitable operations over long periods of time, and the Groups commitment to develop and enhance its value.
The carrying value of the brand is subject to an annual impairment review, and adjusted to its recoverable amount if required.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts if any and VAT.
Revenue is generated from the Groups operations which are wholly based in the UK.
Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2013 59 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 3.
Significant accounting policies continued Rendering of services Commission earned on sales of residential property is recognised on exchange of contract.
In connection with lettings, the Group offers the following services: 1 Securing the letting for the landlord including rent collection: and 2 Managing the letting on behalf of the landlord.
Commissions earned on the above services are recognised as follows: 1 Commissions on securing the letting are recognised immediately subject to a deferral of revenue in recognition of the following: a percentage of contracts have break clauses and may require a refund if the tenant breaks early: and b the Group is contracted to provide a rent collection service for the estimated duration of the outstanding tenancies, and the related fees are recognised on a straight-line basis over that period.
2 The management fee is billed and recognised monthly at a fixed percentage of the monthly rental.
Commission earned on financial services is recognised when insurance policies go on risk and when mortgage contracts complete.
Income from other services is recognised in the period or periods when the services are provided.
Commission is recognised at fair value which takes account of expected future cancellations.
Interest income The Group deposits its cash with reputable financial institutions.
Interest income is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount on initial recognition.
The Group earns interest income on own funds which is shown as finance income.
It also earns interest on client funds which, as required by IAS 18, is included within Lettings revenue.
Borrowing costs All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
Leases Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Finance leases Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as obligations under finance leases.
Finance lease payments are apportioned between interest and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Interest on obligations under finance leases is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
60 Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2013 3.
Significant accounting policies continued Operating leases Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the lease asset are consumed.
In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability.
The aggregate benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis, except where another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.
Exceptional items As permitted by IAS 1: Presentation and Disclosure, certain items are presented separately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as exceptional where, in the judgement of the Directors, they need to be disclosed separately by virtue of their nature, size or incidence in order to obtain a clear and consistent presentation of the Groups underlying business performance.
Examples of items which may give rise to disclosure as exceptional items are property settlement costs, IPO costs and legal expenses.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2013 61 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 3.
Significant accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost of assets other than land and assets under construction less their residual values over their useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: Leasehold improvements Over the term of the lease Fixtures, fittings and equipment Between 20% and 25% straight-line Motor vehicles 25% straight-line The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or scrappage of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets All financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where the purchase or sale of the financial asset is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within the timeframe established by the market concerned and are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs.
All financial assets, other than cash and cash equivalents, are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
62 Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2013 3.
Significant accounting policies continued Impairment of financial assets Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected.
For certain categories of financial asset, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are, in addition, assessed for impairment on a collective basis.
Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include the Groups past experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit period of 60 days, as well as observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account.
When a trade receivable is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account.
Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Financial liabilities and equity Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.
Equity instruments An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at Fair Value Through Profit and Loss or other financial liabilities.
Other financial liabilities Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs.
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis.
Effective interest method The effective interest method is used in calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Derecognition of financial liabilities The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Groups obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.
Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows.
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, a receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.
Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2013 63 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 4.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the application of the Groups accounting policies, which are described in note 3, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policies The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations which are dealt with separately below, that the Directors have made in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Revenue recognition Estimate of deferred revenue For those contracts with break clauses, there is judgement involved in determining the appropriate point at which to recognise the potentially refundable portion of the commission.
Since the Group uses standard terms for its letting contracts, and its lettings business is focused in one geographical area London, management considers its lettings portfolio to be a homogenous population and estimates the amount of the commission that will be refunded based upon historical data for all lettings contracts, which is considered reliable evidence supporting this judgement.
The Group maintains robust data which demonstrates that patterns of rental behaviour do not change significantly period by period, and thus the Group believes that historical data is a relatively accurate proxy for future trends and circumstances.
Initial recognition and useful economic life of the brand The Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the equity of Foxtons Intermediate Holdings on 30 March 2010.
The Directors identified one material intangible asset: the Foxtons brand, which was deemed to have an indefinite life as there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the asset is expected to generate cash inflows.
The excess earnings methodology was used to value this intangible asset, employing the following key assumptions in the valuation: Cash flow forecasts for the years 2009 to 2013: Revenue growth rate after 2013 of 2% per annum: Contributory asset charges of 0.05 %, 1.4% and 1.6% for the working capital, fixed assets and workforce, respectively: Discount rate of 25%: and Tax amortisation benefit of 25 years.
Whilst these assumptions are all judgemental in nature, the Company believes they are all reasonable in the context of the facts and circumstances at the time, and thus the valuation and conclusion of indefinite life is appropriate.
See note 3 Accounting Policies intangible assets.
The Directors also identified and considered other intangible assets in connection with the acquisition but concluded that they were immaterial in the context of the overall Group.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial period, are discussed on the following page.
64 Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2013 4.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets Determining whether goodwill and intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated, and the group of CGUs to which intangible assets i. e. the Foxtons brand have been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
The carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets at each balance sheet date was 118 million.
There have been no impairments to the value of goodwill and intangible assets.
See note 15 for details of the tests for impairment.
5. Business and geographical segments Products and services from which reportable segments derive their revenues Management has determined the operating segments based on the monthly management pack reviewed by the Directors, which is used to assess both the performance of the business and to allocate resources within the entity.
Management has identified that the Directors are the chief operating decision-makers in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 8 Operating segments.
The operating and reportable segments of the Group are i Sales, ii Lettings and iii Mortgage Broking.
The Sales segment generates commission on sales of residential property.
The Lettings segment earns fees from the letting and management of residential properties and income from interest earned on tenants deposits.
As these two segments operate out of the same premises and share support services, a significant proportion of costs have to be apportioned between the segments.
The basis of apportionment used is headcount in each segment.
The Mortgage Broking segment receives commission from the arrangement of mortgages and related products under contracts with financial service providers and receives administration fees from clients.
Income costs not allocated to an operating segment primarily relate to solicitors referral fees and rental of unused office space.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as the Groups accounting policies described in note 3.
Adjusted EBITDA represents the profit for the period earned by each segment before allocation of depreciation, finance income, finance costs, exceptional items and debt repayment incentive scheme expense.
This is the measure reported to the Directors for the purpose of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance.
All revenue for the Group is generated from within the UK and there is no intra-group revenue.
Segment revenues and results The following is an analysis of the Groups revenue and results by reportable segment for the year ended 31 December 2013: Total Mortgage reportable Sales Lettings Broking segments Other Consolidated 000 000 000 000 000 000 Revenue 67,416 66,360 4,938 138,714 467 139,181 Adjusted EBITDA 26,376 22,983 270 49,629 3 49,632 Depreciation 3,687 Profit on disposal of property, plant and equipment 41 Exceptional items 3,155 1 Debt repayment incentive scheme 223 Finance income 104 Finance costs 4,128 Profit before tax 38,948 1 The debt repayment incentive scheme was introduced in the capital reorganisation of March 2010 in order to incentivise management to repay the senior debt as quickly as possible.
The scheme was limited to a maximum payment of 5 million plus employers national insurance.
The whole of this amount has been recorded as a charge to comprehensive income in the four years ended 31 December 2013.

One-off IPO costs In September 2013, Foxtons Group plc floated on the London Stock Exchange.
One-off IPO costs totalled 5.2 million of which 3.2 million was charged to the income statement and 2.0 million charged to the share premium account as being directly related to the newly issued shares.
Property settlement Foxtons Limited was contractually committed, as part of the sale of the business in 2007, to redeveloping its Notting Hill Gate branch, which would have involved significant capital expense and disruption to the operations of the branch.
Management decided not to proceed with the project and a 1.1 million settlement was made with the landlord.
Additional project costs were also expensed in the latter half of 2012, including design costs.
PAYE legal settlement payable On 4 April 2011, a legal settlement was agreed for inadequate professional advice given to Foxtons Limited prior to the sale of the business in 2007 in relation to historical accounting for PAYE taxes, for which the original claim was submitted during 2010.
The total settlement was for 3.0 million, of which 1.2 million was initially repaid to the vendors of Foxtons Operational Holdings Limited pursuant to the terms of the tax deed of covenant in force from 2007, resulting in a net credit to Foxtons Limiteds profit and loss account of 1.8 million in 2010.
The total sum ultimately repayable to the vendors was 1.7 million, but due to uncertainty over whether corporation tax would be payable on this amount a sum of 470,000 was initially withheld.
Subsequently, once the tax position was resolved with no tax being due on the original amount, the 470,000 became payable to the vendors in 2012.

On 1 April 2012, the UK corporate tax rate was reduced from 26% to 24% rather than 25% as previously announced.
From 1 April 2013, the UK corporate tax rate fell to 23%.
The Finance Act 2013 provides for a reduction in the UK corporation tax rate to 21% from 1 April 2014 and to 20% from 1 April 2015.
As a result, the opening deferred tax balances for the year ending 31 December 2013 have been revised from 23% to 20% as most temporary differences are expected to reverse after 1 April 2015, creating a deferred tax credit in the year ending 31 December 2013.
Group relief is claimed and surrendered between Group companies for consideration equal to the tax benefit with the exception of group relief claimed by Foxtons Limited from Adnams BBPM Holdings Limited Foxtons Group plcs immediate parent prior to completion of the IPO.
In the year ended 31 December 2013, the Group received tax losses which generated group relief of 2.1 million.
A nominal payment of 57k was made for this and the net benefit has been treated as a capital contribution see consolidated statement of changes in equity.
The charge for the period can be reconciled to profit in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as follows: 2013 2012 000 000 Profit before tax 38,948 24,875 Tax at the UK corporation tax rate see above 9,047 6,094 Tax effect of expenses that are not deductible in determining taxable profit 1,836 792 Capital allowances in excess of depreciation 16 Offset of losses brought forward 44 Other short-term timing differences 56 Adjustment in respect of previous periods current tax 138 1,181 Adjustment in respect of previous periods deferred tax 167 41 Impact on deferred tax of change in tax rate 2,869 1,963 Origination and reversal of timing differences 1,127 Group relief paid in excess of tax rate 400 Tax on profit on ordinary activities 6,800 4,101 Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2013 69 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 13.

These financial statements do not reflect this dividend payable.
The dividend payment in 2012 relates solely to special ordinary shares held by Mizuho.
Simultaneously, funds advised by BC Partners subscribed for 32.0 million of A-ordinary shares in the Company and the special ordinary shares were converted into deferred shares.

Intangible assets a Goodwill 000 Cost and carrying amount At 1 January 2012, 31 December 2012 and 2013 19,168 Goodwill for the years ended 31 December 2012 and 2013 has been allocated to segments as follows: Sales 9,819, Lettings 9,349 and Mortgage Broking nil.
b Other intangible assets Brand 000 Cost and carrying amount At 1 January 2012, 31 December 2012 and 2013 99,000 The goodwill and other intangible assets recognised arose on the acquisition of Foxtons Intermediate Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries.
The recoverable amount of the above has been calculated using value in use determined from cash flow projections from formally approved budgets and forecasts covering a two year period for each cash-generating unit.
The key assumptions in determining the cash flows are expected changes in sales and lettings volumes and direct costs to be incurred during the forecast period.
These assumptions are based upon a combination of past experience of recently observable trends and expectations of future changes in the market.
To evaluate the recoverable amount of each CGU or group of CGUs, a terminal value has been assumed from the third year and includes a growth rate in the cash flows of 2% for the year ended 31 December 2013 year ended 31 December 2012: 2% into perpetuity.
The discount rates used reflect the risks specific to the CGUs.
The brand asset has been tested for impairment by aggregating the value in use amounts computed in the goodwill impairment test for each CGU, being the aggregation of Sales and Lettings.
This grouping of CGUs represents the lowest level at which management monitors the brand internally, and reflects the way in which the brand asset is viewed as relating to the Sales and Lettings segments as a whole, rather than being allocated to each segment on an arbitrary basis.
The calculated value in use for Sales is 340 million 2012: 170 million, for Lettings 296 million 2012: 191 million and for the aggregation of Sales and Lettings is 636 million 2012: 361 million.
The rate used to discount cash flows from Sales is 10.45% 2012: 11.86%, from Lettings is 9.95% 2012: 11.86% and from the aggregation of Sales and Lettings is 10.20% 2012: 11.86%.
The headroom taken from the calculation was significant, with Sales at 286 million 2012: 151 million, for Lettings 335 million 2012: 176 million and for the aggregation of Sales and Lettings, 522 million 2012: 228 million.
There have been no indicators of impairment for either goodwill or the brand asset during the periods presented.

Trade and other receivables are all current and any fair value difference is not material.
Trade receivables are considered past due once they have passed their contracted due date.
Amounts invoiced to customers are due immediately, albeit in the case of lettings they may be collected over time through initial rental payments received.
The Group has recognised an allowance for doubtful debts of 100% against all receivables over 180 days because historical experience has been that receivables that are past due beyond 180 days are not recoverable.
Allowances against doubtful debts are recognised against trade receivables between 30 days and 180 days based on estimated irrecoverable amounts determined by reference to past default experience of the counterparty and an analysis of the counterpartys current financial position.
The Group does not hold any collateral or other credit enhancements over any of its trade receivables nor does it have a legal right of offset against any amounts owed by the Group to the counterparty.
Trade receivables disclosed above include amounts which are past due at the reporting date but against which the Group has not recognised an allowance for doubtful receivables because there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.
Trade debtor days and comparative debtor days at the year end were 32 days 2012: 31 days.

These companies provided cross guarantees over their assets as security against the loans.
The senior debt was repayable via an annual cash sweep of excess cash with the balance remaining due in 2015.
The cash sweep was dependent on cash generation during the year.
During 2012, the Group repaid 22 million of senior debt, being: 443,610 Mandatory repayment under the cash sweep provisions relates to the year ended 31 December 2011 : and 21,536,390 Voluntary repayment at par.
For 2012, a cash sweep was not payable due to the significant voluntary repayments during the year.
The subordinated debt was owned by FSFV Limited which is wholly owned by funds advised by BC Partners.
During 2013, the Group made further voluntary repayment totalling 10m before full repayment of the senior and subordinate debt was made using the proceeds from the share issue on listing.
Interest was payable on these loans at the rate of LIBOR plus margin and mandatory costs as prescribed in the loan agreement.
An element of the subordinated margin was non-cash and rolled up into the loan.
The loans were variable interest rate debt with repayment periods not exceeding five years.

Deferred tax Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to do so.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: 2013 2012 000 000 Deferred tax assets 666 537 Deferred tax liabilities 19,800 23,500 19,134 22,963 Deferred tax liabilities primarily relate to the intangible asset, the Foxtons brand, which has an indefinite life.
This deferred tax liability will not reverse unless the Foxtons brand is impaired, in which case the liability would be released to profit and loss, or sold by the Group, which would result in a cash outflow.
The following are the major deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised by the Group and movements thereon during the current and prior reporting periods.

Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2013 81 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 28.
Financial instruments Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to shareholders.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or negotiate debt facilities.
The capital structure of the Group consists of equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings.
A regulated subsidiary of the Group, Alexander Hall Associates Limited, is subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
The required amount is calculated as 2.5% of the subsidiarys annual revenue as defined by the Financial Conduct Authority.
As at 31 December 2013, the threshold was 120,000, which is immaterial to the Group.
Gearing ratio The gearing ratio at each period end is as follows: 2013 2012 000 000 Loans 67,165 Cash and cash equivalents 23,352 9,774 Net funds debt 23,352 57,391 Equity 142,448 55,252 Net debt to equity ratio 16 % 104% Equity includes all capital and reserves of the Group that are managed as capital.

Interest rate risk management The Group is exposed to interest rate risk because entities in the Group earn interest on client deposits see note 30 offset by borrowings if any.
The Group had borrowed funds at LIBOR plus margin interest rates.
The Group did not have in place any financial instruments to hedge against interest rate movements as the Group expected interest rates to remain low.
The Groups exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section of this note.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole period.
If interest rates had been 1% higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit before tax and total equity for the 12 months ended 31 December 2013 would increase decrease by 0.2 million year ended 31 December 2012: decrease increase by nil.
This increase in variability is due to the Company now being debt free so that there is no natural hedge against client deposits.
This contrasts to the prior year where the Groups exposure to interest rates on its client funds was offset partially by interest paid on variable rate borrowings.
82 Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2013 28.
Financial instruments continued Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers and are monitored on an ongoing basis.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar characteristics.
The Group defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are related entities.
Concentration of credit risk to any counterparty did not exceed 1% of gross monetary assets at any time during the period.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international creditrating agencies.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk as no collateral or other credit enhancements are held.
Client funds see note 30 are held with three reputable financial institutions.
The credit risk of banks cannot be totally eliminated.
However, as the funds are client monies there is the additional protection of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS under which the government guarantees amounts up to 85k each.
This guarantee applies to each individual clients deposit monies, not the sum total on deposit.
Liquidity risk management Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has established an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Liquidity and interest risk tables The following tables detail the Groups remaining contractual maturity for its financial liabilities with agreed repayment periods.
The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.
The tables include both interest and principal cash flows.
To the extent that interest flows are floating rate, the undiscounted amount is derived from interest rate curves at the balance sheet date.
The contractual maturity is based on the earliest date on which the Group may be required to pay.

Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2013 83 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 28.
Financial instruments continued The Groups non-derivative financial assets consist of cash and trade and other receivables, both of which are non-interest bearing.
The Groups expected maturity for its non-derivative financial assets is less than one month as trade receivables are payable on exchange.

The significant inputs required to fair value all of the Groups financial instruments are observable.
The Group only holds Level 2 financial instruments and therefore does not hold any financial instruments categorised as either Level 1 or Level 3 financial instruments.
There have also been no transfers of assets or liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy.
Fair values have been arrived at by discounting future cash flows, assuming no early redemption, or by revaluing forward currency contracts to year-end market rates or rates as appropriate to the instrument.
Management considers that the book value of financial assets and liabilities recorded at amortised cost and their fair value are approximately equal.

Restatement of prior periods to IFRS These are the Groups first consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU.
The accounting policies set out in note 3 have been applied in preparing the financial statements for all periods.
The last consolidated financial statements prepared under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP for the Group were for the period ended 31 December 2012.
The date of transition to IFRS for the Group was 1 January 2012.
IFRS 1, First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, sets out the transitional rules for when IFRS are applied for the first time.
The Group is required to select accounting policies in accordance with IFRS valid at its first IFRS reporting date and apply those policies retrospectively.
The standard sets out certain mandatory exceptions to retrospective application and certain optional exemptions.
The Group did not elect to use any optional exemptions.
IFRS 3 has been adopted effective 30 March 2010.

However, the consolidated financial statements under UK GAAP did not present total comprehensive income and the Group has reported no other comprehensive income under IFRS.
Thus only profit for the year has been reconciled.

Restatement of prior periods to IFRS continued The balance sheet prepared under IFRS at the date of transition is presented below: Balance sheet 1 January 2012 000 Non-current assets Goodwill 19,168 Other intangible assets 99,000 Property, plant and equipment 15,887 Deferred tax assets 778 134,833 Current assets Trade and other receivables 11,317 Prepayments 5,103 Cash and cash equivalents 13,738 30,158 Total assets 164,991 Current liabilities Trade and other payables 7,793 Current tax liabilities 4,620 Obligations under finance leases 563 Provisions 169 Borrowings 739 Deferred revenue 4,248 18,132 Net current assets 12,026 Non-current liabilities Borrowings 86,459 Obligations under finance leases 656 Deferred tax liabilities 25,266 112,381 Total liabilities 130,513 Net assets 34,478 Equity Share capital Retained earnings 34,478 Total equity 34,478 Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2013 87 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 31.
Restatement of prior periods to IFRS continued Adjustments made under IFRS Below is a summary of the adjustments made to convert the Group results from UK GAAP to IFRS: i Goodwill and other intangibles Under UK GAAP, goodwill is amortised over its expected useful economic life.
Under IAS 38: Intangible Assets, goodwill is no longer amortised, but instead is held at its carrying value on the balance sheet and tested annually for impairment.
In addition, IAS 38: Intangible Assets requires other intangible assets arising on acquisitions after the transition date to be separately identified and amortised over their useful economic life to the extent they are finite-lived.
Indefinite-lived intangibles are held at carrying value on the balance sheet and tested annually for impairment.
The UK GAAP goodwill amortisation charge in the years ended 31 December 2010, 2011 and 2012 has been reversed along with the impairment of goodwill recognised in 2012 under UK GAAP which did not arise under IFRS.
The intangible asset arising from the acquisition on 30 March 2010 has been recognised as having an indefinite life and there have been no impairments to its value identified from annual reviews performed.
ii Revenue recognition Under UK GAAP the Group deferred all of the potentially refundable commission earned on lettings contracts until the expiry of the refund right.
Under IFRS the Group has adopted an accounting policy of estimating the proportion of potentially refundable commission at any point in time and recognising the balance immediately because management considers this better reflects the Groups earnings activities.
This leads to revenue generally being recognised earlier as compared with UK GAAP.
iii Net taxation impact The above taxation adjustment includes the related taxation impacts of the IFRS adjustments for the recognition of intangibles and the adjustment for revenue recognition.
Net free cash flow Net free cash flow is used as a measure of financial performance and is highlighted on page one.
It is defined as net cash from operating activities less net cash used in investing activities exclusive of exceptional items.
