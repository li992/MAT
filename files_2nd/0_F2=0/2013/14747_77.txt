Service concession arrangements In 50:50 partnership with Royal Bank Leasing Limited, the Group established three companies to provide street lighting services to councils under the Private Finance Initiative PFI.
These services are thereafter sub-contracted to SSE Contracting Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group.
The companies established are as follows: Company Council Tay Valley Lighting Stoke on Trent Limited Stoke-on-Trent Tay Valley Lighting Newcastle and North Tyneside Limited Newcastle and North Tyneside Tay Valley Lighting Leeds Limited Leeds City Council 183 Financial statements Accompanying information continued for the year ended 31 March 2013 A3.
Subsidiary undertakings continued Under SIC-12 Consolidation Special Purpose Entities, despite being 50% owned, these companies are categorised as subsidiaries and are accounted for accordingly due to the Group being deemed to bear the majority of the risks and rewards associated with these companies.
The debt associated with these companies is non-recourse to the Group.
The arrangements for all three companies are materially similar.
In addition to these, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of entities which perform similar services under eight PFI contracts.
The terms of the service concession arrangement are similar to those operated by the companies noted above.
The council and contract holder within the acquired group are as follows: Company Council Dorset Lighting Limited Dorset County Council Ealing Lighting Limited London Borough of Ealing Islington Lighting Limited London Borough of Islington Tay Valley Lighting Hampshire Limited Hampshire County Council Tay Valley Lighting Southampton Limited Southampton City Council Tay Valley Lighting West Sussex Limited West Sussex County Council Tay Valley Lighting Nottingham Limited Nottingham County Council Tay Valley Lighting Knowsley Limited Knowsley Metropolitan Borough Council Characteristics of the arrangements Description The contracts are 25 year arrangements to replace ageing street lighting stock and to subsequently maintain the new assets throughout each Councils areas.
Significant terms The cash flows under the PFI arrangements come from the unitary charge for these services paid by the Councils.
The unitary charge can only be adjusted if performance under the contract falls below the required standards.
Any significant change to the services proposed by either party is subject to a formal change procedure and agreement to such a change is required by the other party.
Nature and extent of rights and obligations The assets are part of the public highway and ownership of the assets remains with the Councils.
The contract holding companies are licensed to replace and maintain the assets for the period of the contract.
This obligation is passed down to SSE Contracting Limited or to other companies within the SSE contracting group through the operating sub-contract.
Any failure to provide the services to the required standards will result in financial penalties which are taken from the unitary charge.
The companies have 25 year contracts with no extension options.
Termination during this period can be initiated through a number of routes including service provider default, force majeure or the event of a risk becoming uninsurable, authority default, voluntary authority termination, or termination for a prohibited act or breach of refinancing provisions.
In all cases, a formula exists for calculating compensation payments to the service provider.
Throughout the contract period there are a number of circumstances under which the companies could potentially be required to provide additional services: i Changes in the law If circumstances arise where by a change in legislation would mean a change in the way the services are to be provided the companies would be liable for part of the cost of this change.
ii Final survey The Councils have the ability to deduct a percentage of the unitary charge in the last two years if an independent survey indicates the assets are unlikely to have a 5-year residual life.
