The Groups forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group will be able to operate within the level of its current facilities.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The Group therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its consolidated financial statements.

Segmental information Reportable segments are presented in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker.
The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the segments, has been identified as the Board of Directors.
The Group is organised on a geographical basis and derives its revenue from the provision of colocation and related services in Bulgaria, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, Turkey and the United Kingdom.
These geographical locations comprise the Groups segments.
Due to similarities in services, customers, regulatory environment and economic characteristics across the countries in which the Group operates, the Group aggregates these operating segments into the UK and the Rest of Europe.
The Board reviews the Groups internal reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources.
The internal reporting principally analyses the performance of the UK and the Rest of Europe.
When further detail is required the results of individual countries are reviewed.
The Board has therefore determined the reportable segments to be the UK and the Rest of Europe.
Sales between segments are made at market rates and accounted for in the same way as external transactions.
The Groups income statement split by segment is shown below.
Treasury and financing is managed on a Group-wide basis, as such it is not practical to allocate costs below operating profit to an individual reporting segment.
The Group had no customers from which greater than 10% of revenue was derived during the year.
The Groups KPIs by reportable segment are shown below.
To the extent it is not practical to measure a KPI by reportable segment due to, for example, the common financing structure, the Group KPI is given.
Segmental information continued The following table shows the Groups assets and liabilities by reporting segment.
Segment assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, trade and other receivables, and cash and cash equivalents.
Segment liabilities principally comprise trade and other payables, deferred income and provisions for other liabilities and charges.
Certain assets and liabilities, for example Group treasury cash balances and bank borrowings, are managed on a central basis and as such have not been allocated to individual segments.
Directors emoluments and key management compensation The Directors emoluments, including retirement benefits, are disclosed on page 80 within the Directors Remuneration Report, which forms part of the financial statements.
Key management compensation, which includes that of the executive and non-executive Directors, is as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2013 2012 000 000 Salaries and other short-term employee benefits 2,160 2,438 Pension payments defined contribution plans 182 172 1 Share-based payment charges 805 777 3,147 3,387 1 The share-based payment charge is measured in line with the IFRS2 expense charged to the income statement during the year.

Exceptional items Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the financial statements where it is necessary to do so to provide further understanding of the financial performance of the Group.
They are material items of income or expense that have been shown separately due to the significance of their nature or amount.
During the year the Group acquired SadeceHosting, 3DC and PLIX note 18.
As part of these transactions the Group incurred associated costs, mainly professional fees, stamp duty and restructuring costs, totalling 3,157,000.
The transaction-related expenses in respect of the prior year relate to the acquisition of Tenue and Academica.
In addition, in conducting the annual review of provisions held in respect of onerous leases note 25, the Group has increased the amounts provided in respect of certain leases.
During the year the departure of the Group Finance Director was announced.
Following the Boards decision to apply good leaver provisions, employment costs that would ordinarily have been recognised in 2014 and beyond have been provided for as exceptional costs in the current year.
In addition, directly related attributable incremental costs, including recruitment fees, have been similarly provided.

Expenses analysed by nature The Group classifies its expenses by nature into the following categories.
Power costs represent the total cost of power to the Group including environmental taxes.
Property costs include rent payments, service charge and taxes in addition to ancillary property costs such as insurance.
Staff and staff-related costs include expenses such as training and recruitment in addition to the staff remuneration costs disclosed in note 6.
Other costs comprise operational maintenance costs, sales and administrative costs and cost of sales of services.

Finance costs Finance costs are recognised in the income statement over the term of such instruments at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Finance costs which are directly attributable to the construction of property, plant and equipment are capitalised as part of the cost of those assets.
The commencement of capitalisation begins when both finance costs and expenditure for the asset are being incurred and activities that are necessary to get the asset ready for use are in progress.
Capitalisation ceases when substantially all the activities that are necessary to get the asset ready for use are complete.
The interest rate charged on the capitalised interest was 4.3% 2012: 4.7%.
Tax relief is available on capitalised interest.

Other financing items Other financing items represent finance costs or income not directly related to the Groups trading activity or financing, but those that are triggered as a result of external factors principally foreign exchange movements on financial assets and liabilities.
As such, these financing items are disclosed separately in the financial statements to provide a clearer understanding of the Groups underlying financing costs.
Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2013 2012 000 000 Net foreign exchange gains losses on financing items 50 515 13.
Income tax charge The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the tax is also dealt with in equity.
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method and at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

Accordingly, the Groups UK profits for 2013 were taxed at an effective rate of 23.25%.
Furthermore as a result of the change in the UK corporation tax rate from 22% to 21% that was substantively enacted on 2 July 2013 and that will be effective from 1 April 2014, the relevant deferred tax balances at 31 December 2013 have been re-measured at 21%.
Further reductions to the UK tax rate have been announced.
The changes, which are expected to be enacted separately each year, propose to reduce the rate to 20% by 1 April 2015.
The changes had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, are not recognised in these financial statements.
In addition to the amounts that have been charged to the income statement, the following amounts of tax have been credited charged directly to equity: Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2013 2012 000 000 Current tax Share-based payment schemes 924 2,838 Deferred tax Share-based payment schemes 810 809 Tax effect of interest rate cash flow hedges 651 560 537 4,207 The deferred tax charge credit in respect of the share-based payment schemes relates to the expected future tax deduction the Group will receive when employees exercise options in excess of the IFRS 2 share-based payment charge at the standard corporation tax rate.

Income tax charge continued Deferred tax At the year end the Group recognised a net deferred tax liability of 26,509,000 2012: 16,015,000 mainly in respect of accelerated tax depreciation and intangible customer contract assets, partially offset by tax losses.

Intangible assets The Groups intangible assets comprise goodwill and customer contracts and are treated as assets of the entity to which they relate and are translated at the relevant closing foreign exchange rate.
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identiable assets, including intangible assets, of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Separately recognised goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Intangible assets, other than goodwill, represent customer contracts acquired during business combinations.
The customer contracts are initially recognised at fair value and amortised over estimated useful economic lives of between five and 20 years, with current remaining lives of between three and 20 years 2012: four and 13 years.
The fair value is calculated by estimating the future cash flows expected to arise from the intangible asset and applying a suitable discount rate.

Intangible assets continued Impairment testing Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.
The allocation is made to those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units CGU that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
The Group allocates goodwill to each country in which it has operations.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually.
The main assumptions used when performing the impairment test are set out below.
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value-in-use calculation requires an estimation of future cash flows expected to arise from the CGUs and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value.
For goodwill recognised before the current period, these calculations use cash ow projections based on financial budgets for 2014 approved by the Board.
Cash ows beyond 2014 are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates of 2.5% 2012: 2.5% for both the UK and Rest of Europe.
The growth rate does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the operating segment in which the CGU operates.
The pre-tax discount rate used was 10.2% 2012: 12.3% for both the UK and rest of Europe.
The discount rates used are adjusted for estimated tax cash flows and reect specic risks relating to the relevant segments.
For goodwill recognised in the current year associated with the acquisitions of SadeceHosting, 3DC and PLIX, cash flows from the board approved acquisition models were used, as these provided the most reliable sources of future cash flows.
Post-tax discount rates of between 12.0% and 13.0% were applied, reflecting the specific risks relating to these CGUs.
A segment-level summary of goodwill allocation is presented below: Year ended 31 December 2012 Year ended 31 December 2013 Rest of Rest of UK Europe Total UK Europe Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Goodwill 42,454 84,356 126,810 42,454 63,014 105,468 The Group assesses at each reporting date whether its customer contracts intangible assets may be impaired.
If any such indicator exists, the Group tests for impairment by estimating the recoverable amount.
If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value of an asset an impairment loss is recognised.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
The cost of property, plant and equipment comprises their purchase cost, together with the costs of installation and directly attributable external and internal costs, such as staff and property rentals, incurred during the construction or commissioning phase.
Additions to property, plant and equipment also include capitalised finance costs.
When property, plant and equipment is acquired as part of a business combination, the cost of such assets is deemed to be their fair value at the date of acquisition.
The principal periods over which assets are depreciated are: Freehold land and buildings Freehold land is not depreciated, freehold property is depreciated over 50 years Leasehold improvements 730 years straight-line Plant and machinery 520 years straight-line Ofce equipment 35 years straight-line Depreciation of the above assets is calculated from the date an asset becomes available for use, so as to write off the difference between the cost and the residual value over its expected useful economic life.
The expected period of the property leases in which an asset is located is taken into account when determining the useful economic life of the asset.
Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until they are operational.
At this time such assets are transferred into the appropriate asset class and depreciated over the expected useful economic lives referred to above.
The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed on an annual basis and, if appropriate, adjusted on a prospective basis.

Property, plant and equipment continued Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
Such assets are categorised as plant and machinery in the above table.
Included within additions to assets in the course of construction for the year are capitalised finance and other costs principally rent and rates incurred during the construction or commissioning phase in respect of the Groups new data centres, totalling 5,376,000 and 3,892,000 respectively 2012: 5,376,000 and 3,670,000.
The interest rate charged on the capitalised interest is disclosed in note 11.
Freehold land and buildings with a carrying amount of 3,598,000 2012: 3,562,000 have been pledged to secure borrowings for the Group.
The Group is not allowed to pledge these assets as security for other borrowings or sell them to another entity.
The Company does not hold any property, plant and equipment.

Business combinations SadeceHosting On 7 May 2013, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Hosting nternet Hizmetleri Sanayi five Ticaret Anonim irketi, which trades under the name of SadeceHosting, a data centre operator based in Istanbul, Turkey.
SadeceHosting offers a range of data centre and hosting services and is considered a complementary strategic fit within the Group that offers the opportunity for growth in the local domestic market as well as attracting international business in the region.
The cash consideration was 25.0m, with associated costs of acquisition, including stamp duty, of 1.0m.
Should SadeceHosting reach certain challenging financial targets, then additional consideration of up to 3.4m is payable.
The fair value of net assets acquired was 8.7m.
The Group expects much of the value relating to the acquisition will arise from executing the expansion plans for the business.
The goodwill is attributable to the operating cash flows of new customer contracts expected to be signed post-acquisition relating to such expansions and economies of scale expected from combining the operations of the Group and SadeceHosting.
The results of SadeceHosting from the start of its financial year, 1 January, to the date of acquisition, along with the post-acquisition results, are summarised below.
These amounts have been calculated before allocation of the Groups central costs, using the Groups accounting policies and by adjusting the results to reflect the depreciation and amortisation that would have been charged assuming the fair value adjustments to property, plant and equipment had applied from 1 January 2013, together with the consequential tax effects.

The bank borrowings attract interest at LIBOR, or equivalent based on the currency of the borrowing herein referred to as LIBOR, plus a margin.
The margin is variable and calculated with reference to the ratio of the Groups last twelve months EBITDA to net debt.
The margin is recalculated based on interest periods set by the Group, typically between one and three months.
The borrowings are secured by a debenture over all the assets of the Company, including shares in, and assets of, certain subsidiary undertakings.
The Directors consider the carrying value of the borrowings to approximate to their fair values as they attract a market rate of interest.
The Group has three principal banking covenants under its senior debt facility which are outlined below: Total leverage: the Groups net debt to EBITDA ratio is covenanted to not breach certain levels.
Fixed charge cover: the Groups interest and rent expenses fixed charge must be covered by a multiple of pre-rent and interest earnings.
Total cash cover: the Groups interest cost must be covered by a multiple of cash flows, excluding certain permitted capital expenditure.
At the year end, the Group is in full compliance with these covenants and expects to remain so for the foreseeable future.
Lease liabilities are effectively secured as the rights to the leased asset revert to the lessor in the event of default.

Derivative financial instruments Interest rate derivatives are recognised initially at fair value and subsequent to initial recognition are revalued at each reporting date.
The fair value is based on the market values of equivalent instruments at the relevant date.
Amounts payable and receivable on interest rate derivatives are recognised in the period to which they relate.
Where the instrument meets the definition for hedge accounting, movements in fair value of the interest rate swap are taken to reserves.
In all other cases movements are charged or credited to the income statement.
In order to manage the Groups exposure to movements in LIBOR, or equivalent based on the currency of the borrowing herein referred to as LIBOR, the Group uses interest rate swaps.
Under these arrangements the Group pays interest at a fixed rate and receives interest at LIBOR.
The amounts of interest paid and received are calculated on the nominal value of the interest rate swap.
After taking account of the effect of the interest rate swaps, the average interest rate in respect of drawn borrowings was 3.5% 2012: 4.0%.

Provisions for other liabilities and charges Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the obligation.
The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense.
After initial measurement, any subsequent adjustments to dilapidations provisions are normally recorded against the original amount included in leasehold improvements with a corresponding adjustment to future depreciation charges.

The dilapidations provision relates to the estimated costs of returning one of the Groups properties to its original condition at the expiry of the lease within the next year.
The Directors consider the carrying values of the provisions to approximate to their fair values as they have been discounted at the risk free rate.

Share plans Under the Groups long-term incentive plans, performance shares and share options are granted to senior management.
In addition, the Group operates a sharesave scheme which is available to all staff.
The details of the share option schemes are contained in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 72.
The release of these shares is conditional upon continued employment, certain market vesting conditions and, in the case of enhanced awards, three-year target EPS compound annual growth rates.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined, using the Black Scholes or Monte Carlo models, at the grant date of equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will ultimately vest.
Non-market vesting conditions, which for the Group mainly relate to the continual employment of the employee during the vesting period, and in the case of the enhanced awards the achievement of EPS growth targets, are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of options that eventually vest.
Any market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the options granted.
To the extent that share options are granted to employees of the Groups subsidiaries without charge, the share option charge is capitalised as part of the cost of investment in subsidiaries.

Reserves The Group and the Company Statements of Changes in Equity are disclosed as primary statements on pages 90-91.
Below is a description of the nature and purpose of the individual reserves: share capital represents the nominal value of shares issued, including those issued to the EBT note 26 : share premium account includes the amounts paid over nominal value in respect of share issues, net of related costs: retained profits include the accumulated realised and certain unrealised gains and losses made by the Company and the Group: own shares held by the Group represent 132,000 2012: 222,000 shares in Telecity Group plc.

Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Benets received by the Group as an incentive to sign the lease are spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term, or to the first break clause, if sooner.
During the construction phase of a data centre, operating lease costs are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset.

Contingent liabilities Financial guarantees granted by the Groups banks, primarily in respect of operating leases, amount to 2,617,000 at 31 December 2013 2012: 5,493,000.
At the inception of a property lease and annually thereafter, the Directors assess the cost of restoring leasehold premises to their original condition at the end of the lease and the likelihood of such costs actually being incurred.
If the likelihood of this liability arising is judged to be possible, rather than probable, it is disclosed as a contingent liability.
When assessing the likely duration of the lease and the likelihood of this liability arising, the Directors take into account their contractual and statutory rights to renew or extend the lease terms.
If the likelihood of this liability arising is judged to be probable, the discounted cost of the liability is included in leasehold improvements and is depreciated over the duration of the lease.
At 31 December 2013 the estimated discounted cost of reinstating leasehold properties at the end of leases in accordance with the lease contracts amounted to 7,814,000 2012: 9,180,000.
In addition to this, 1,557,000 2012: 1,557,000 is recorded within provisions note 25.
The leases expire over a range of one to 30 years.

Trade receivables impairment disclosures Due to effective credit control procedures, the Group mitigates its exposure to the risk of bad debt.
In addition the Groups up-front billing cycle means that customers are generally due to pay in advance of receiving the service.
The following disclosures are in respect of trade receivables that are either impaired or past due.
The credit quality of the remaining trade receivables is considered good.
Included within trade receivables is an amount of 5,710,000 2012: 7,998,000 in respect of amounts which are past their due date.
These relate to a number of independent customers for whom there is considered to be little risk of default and therefore such amounts have not been impaired.

A reconciliation from EBITDA to operating profit is contained in note 3.
Fitted-out space The amount of space contained within the Groups data halls.
This does not include any non-data hall space which, for example, contains plant and supporting infrastructure.
In certain sites where light items of infrastructure, for example climate control units, are located within the data hall, the gross floor area may be subject to a formula adjustment to compute a notional amount of space available to customers.
Gross interest rate Gross cost of borrowings note 11 divided by the average borrowings note 23 during the year.
Investment capital expenditure Capital expenditure that results in additional available customer power or a significant enhancement to the currently installed customer power.
Leverage Year end net debt divided by adjusted EBITDA for the year.
Net debt Borrowings note 23 less cash note 20.
Sold power percentage Year end sold customer power divided by year end available customer power.
Occupancy Year end occupied space divided by year end fitted-out space.
Occupied space Fitted-out space less the remaining space available to sell to customers.
This does not include any future contracted and committed sales.
The remaining space available to sell to customers is measured on a net basis, i. e. after actual or formula-based deduction to take account of physical restrictions within the data hall for example light items of infrastructure.
Operating free cash flow Cash inflow from operating activities as stated on the cash flow statement less operational property, plant and equipment capital expenditure.
Capital expenditure is classified as operating rather than investment if it does not result in additional available customer power or a significant enhancement to the currently installed available customer power.
Organic currency neutral For organic growth rates, the contribution from acquisitions made in the current year is excluded, and for acquisitions made in the previous year, the full year contribution is included in the prior year results.
Currency-neutral results are calculated by retranslating the prior year results using current year exchange rates.
Return on capital employed ROCE EBITA divided by the average equity plus debt during the year.
