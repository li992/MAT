The Board is responsible for the Companys system of internal control and has reviewed its effectiveness for the year ended 30 September 2013.
This review encompasses all controls including financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management.
The system of internal control is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Companys consolidated annual financial statements, along with the half-yearly financial statements and interim management statements are prepared in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.
Since investment management, custody of assets and many administrative systems are provided or arranged for the Company by Electra Partners, the Companys system of internal control mainly comprises the monitoring of the services provided by Electra Partners, including the operating controls established by them to ensure they meet the Companys business objectives.
As part of this process Electra Partners is responsible for submitting performance statistics, investment valuations and management accounts to the Board.
The key elements designed to provide effective internal control are as follows: Financial Reporting - regular and comprehensive review by the Board of key investment and financial data, including management accounts, revenue projections, analyses of transactions and performance comparisons.
Investment Strategy - regular review by the Board of the Companys Objective and Investment Policy, including commitments to new funds.
Management Agreements and Investment Performance - the Board regularly monitors the performance of Electra Partners to ensure that the Companys assets and affairs are managed in accordance with the Companys Objective and Investment Policy.
The Board keeps under review the effectiveness of the Companys system of internal control by monitoring the operation of the key controls of Electra Partners as follows: The Board reviews the terms of the management agreements and receives regular reports from Electra Partners executives.
The Board reviews the certificates verifying compliance with documented controls provided by Electra Partners on a six monthly basis.
Additionally, the external auditors perform certain agreed upon procedures regarding these controls.
