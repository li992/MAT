The recoverable amount of goodwill is determined based on expected cash ows within the cash-generating units of the group to which the goodwill is allocated.
Key assumptions within the calculation include discount rates, growth rates in revenue and related expenditure and loan impairment rates.
Discount rates are based on pre-tax rates that reect current market conditions, adjusted for the specic risks associated with the 1 cash-generating unit.
Growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
Cash ow forecasts are based on the most recent financial budgets for the next financial year and are extrapolated for a period of three to five years, adjusted for expected future events.

Goodwill continued UK, Europe and Australia The three most significant cash-generating units giving rise to goodwill are Investec Asset Management, Kensington and Investec Wealth & Investment IWI which now includes the business of Williams fide Bro acquired in 2012 as part of the Evolution Group EVG which was merged with IWI in August 2012.
For IWI goodwill of 236.3 million has been tested for impairment on the basis of the cash ow projections for the next three years discounted at 10.4% 2012: 11.5% which incorporate an expected revenue growth rate of 2% March 2012: 3%.
For Investec Asset Management, the value placed on the business in the proposed sale of 15% of the company to management comfortably supports the value of the goodwill of 88 million.
Goodwill of 121.1 million arising on the acquisition of Kensington on 7 August 2008 was written down by 60.0 million at 31 March 2008 and by a further 21.5 million in the year ended 31 March 2012 to 39.7 million.
The remaining goodwill has been tested for impairment on the basis of the existing book, assuming no new mortgage origination and no recovery in securitisation markets.
Cash ows have been projected for a seven year period using the latest available information on debts and expected repayments discounted at 16.1% 2012: 14.9%.
Future impairment of this goodwill will be largely dependent on the level of impairment of the underlying mortgage assets.
On this basis and based on the sensitivity analysis performed by management, the goodwill valuation is above book value.
South Africa The majority of the goodwill attributed to the South African operations relate to Investec Asset Management, particularly to the businesses from the Fedsure acquisition, which have been identied as a separate cash-generating unit.
The goodwill relating to Fedsure has been tested for impairment, taking into account profitability, being the current year profits and the budgeted profits and funds under management.
The discount rate applied of 13.4% is determined using the South African risk-free rate adjusted for the risk related to the cash-generating unit.
