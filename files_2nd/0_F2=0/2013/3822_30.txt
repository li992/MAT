Notes to the Company financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2013 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The financial statements of Computacenter plc were approved for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 10March 2014.
The balance sheet was signed on behalf of the Board by MJ Norris and FA Conophy.
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the applicable UK Accounting Standards.
No profit and loss account is presented for the Company as permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in paragraph 2D b of FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and has not disclosed information required by that standard, as the Groups consolidated financial statements, in which the Company is included, provide equivalent disclosures for the Group under IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
Intellectual property Licences purchased in respect of intellectual property are capitalised, classified as an intangible asset on the balance sheet and amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of the licence, normally 20 years.
Depreciation of fixed assets Freehold land is not depreciated.
Depreciation is provided on all other tangible fixed assets at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset evenly over its expected useful life, as follows: Freehold buildings 25 years Investments Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
In addition, subsequent to the adoption of UITF Abstract 41, investments in subsidiaries also include the FRS 20 cost of share-based payments.
Impairment of assets The carrying values of assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Share-based payment transactions The expense for share-based payments is recognised in the subsidiary companies employing the relevant employees.
The Company records a corresponding increase in its investments in subsidiaries with a credit to equity which is equivalent to the FRS 20 cost in the subsidiary undertakings.
Taxation Corporation tax payable is provided on taxable profits at the current tax rate.
Where Group relief is surrendered from other subsidiaries in the Group, the Company is required to pay to the surrendering company an amount equal to the loss surrendered multiplied by the current tax rate.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
