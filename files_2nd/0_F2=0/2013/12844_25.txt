62 PZ Cussons Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements General information PZ Cussons Plc is a public limited company which is listed on the London stock exchange and is domiciled and incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006.
The address of the registered office is given on page 95.
These financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 1.
Accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted for use inthe European Union EU, including International Accounting Standards IAS and interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to Companies reporting under IFRS.
Further standards may be issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and standards currently in issue and endorsed by theEUmay be subject to interpretations issued by the IFRIC.
The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles under IFRS, requires management tomake estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements bestknowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for the revaluation of certain financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value through the income statement.
The financial statements have been prepared using consistent accounting policies except as stated below.
Standards and interpretations The following new standards, new interpretations and amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued but are not effective for the financial year beginning 1 June 2012 and have not been early adopted: Amendment to IAS 1, Presentation of financial statements on OCI effective 1 July 2012 Amendment to IAS 12, Income taxes on deferred tax effective 1 January 2012 and endorsed 1 January 2013 IFRS 13, Fair value measurement effective 1 January 2013 IAS 19 revised 2011, Employee benefits effective 1 January 2013 Amendment to IFRS 1, First time adoption on government grants effective 1 January 2013 Amendments to IFRS 7 on Financial instruments asset and liability offsetting effective 1 January 2013 IFRS 9, Financial instruments effective 1 January 2015, not EU endorsed IFRS 10, Consolidated financial statements effective 1 January 2013 and endorsed 1 January 2014 IFRS 11, Joint arrangements effective 1 January 2013 and endorsed 1 January 2014 IFRS 12, Disclosures of interests in other entities effective 1 January 2013 and endorsed 1 January 2014 IAS 27 revised 2011, Separate financial statements effective 1 January 2013 and endorsed 1 January 2014 IAS 28 revised 2011, Associates and joint ventures effective 1 January 2013 and endorsed 1 January 2014 Amendments to IFRS 10, 11 and 12 on transition guidance effective 1 January 2013 and endorsed 1 January 2014 Amendments to IFRS 10, 12 and IAS 27 on consolidation for investment entities effective 1 January 2014, not EU endorsed Amendments to IAS 32 on Financial instruments asset and liability offsetting effective 1 January 2014 Amendment to IAS 36, Impairment of assets on recoverable amount disclosures effective 1 January 2014, not EU endorsed IFRIC 21, Levies effective 1 January 2014, not EU endorsed None of the above are expected to have a significant effect on the financial statements of the Group.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of PZ Cussons Plc and entities controlled by PZ Cussons Plc itssubsidiaries made up to 31 May each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the ability to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the fair value of consideration over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired i. e. discount on acquisition is credited to the income statement inthe period of acquisition.
The total profits or losses of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated income statement and the interest of noncontrolling interests is stated at the noncontrolling interests proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised.
Subsequently, losses applicable to the noncontrolling interest in excess of the noncontrolling interests interest in the subsidiarys equity are allocated against the interests of the Group except to the extent that the noncontrolling interest has a binding obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses.
The interest of noncontrolling interests in the acquiree is initially measured at the noncontrolling interests proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
Where noncontrolling interests areacquired, the excess of cost over the value of the noncontrolling interest acquired is recorded in equity.
63 PZ Cussons Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 1.
Accounting policies continued The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, the accounts of overseas subsidiaries are adjusted to conform to the Groups accounting policies.
All intragroup transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Operating profit Operating profit is the profit of the Group before finance income, finance costs and taxation.
Exceptional items The Group adopts a columnar income statement format to highlight significant items within the Group results for the period.
Such itemsare considered by the Directors to be exceptional in nature rather than being representative of the underlying trading of the Group, and may include such items as restructuring costs, acquisition related costs, material impairments of noncurrent assets, material profits and losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment, profit or loss on disposal or termination of operations and material pension settlements and amendments.
The Directors apply judgement in assessing the particular items, which by virtue of their scale and nature should be disclosed in a separate column of the income statement and notes to the financial statements as Exceptional items.
The Directors believe that the separate disclosure of these items is relevant to an understanding of the Groups financial performance.
Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The fair value of consideration of the acquisition is measured atthe aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 Business combinations are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date, except for noncurrent assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Noncurrent assets held for sale anddiscontinued operations, which are recognised and measured at the lower of the assets previous carrying value and fair value lesscosts to sell.
Interests in joint ventures A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control, that is when the strategic financial and operating policy decisions relating to the activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
Joint venture arrangements that involve the establishment of a separate entity in which each venturer has an interest are referred to as jointly controlled entities.
The Group reports its interests in jointly controlled entities using the equity method of accounting.
Under IAS 28 Investments in associates and IAS 31 Interests in joint ventures, a single figure for posttax results is presented as a separate item on the face of the income statement as part of profit before tax within operating profit.
Longterm loans which are considered to be permanent as equity are combined with the Groups share of net assets liabilities and shown on a single linewithin noncurrent assets.
Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary or a jointly controlled entity represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the subsidiary or jointly controlled entity recognised at the date of acquisition.
If, after reassessment, the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Goodwill also includes amounts to reflect deferred tax liabilities established in relation to acquisitions in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cashgenerating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Cashgenerating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cashgenerating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit prorata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary or a jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit orloss on disposal.
Other intangible assets An acquired brand is only recognised on the balance sheet where it is supported by a registered trademark, where brand earnings areseparately identifiable and the brand could be sold separately from the rest of the business.
Brands acquired as part of a business combination are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Trademarks, patents and purchased brands are recorded at purchase cost.
Brands currently held are not amortised as the Directors believe they have indefinite lives due to their market leading nature.
In accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of assets, the brands are tested for impairment annually, and whenever there isanindication that the asset may be impaired.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement.
64 PZ Cussons Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 1.
Accounting policies continued Applying indefinite lives to certain acquired brands is appropriate due to the stable longterm nature of the business and the enduring nature of the brands.
A core element of the Groups strategy is to invest in building its brands through an ongoing programme of product innovation and sustained and rising marketing particularly media investment.
A brand typically comprises an assortment of base products and more innovative products.
Both contribute to the enduring nature of the brand.
The base products establish the longterm positioning of the brand while a succession of innovations attracts ongoing consumer interest and attention.
Indefinite life brands are allocated to the cash generating units to which they relate and are tested annually for impairment.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately as income.
Profitor losses on disposal of brands are included within operating profit.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods provided inthe normal course of business, net of discounts, rebates and sales related taxes but including interest receivable on sales on extended credit and income from the provision of technical services and agreements.
Sales of goods are recognised when title has passed and the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Leases Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straightline basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straightline basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group entity are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates its functional currency.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each entity are expressed in Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual entities, transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency arerecorded at the actual rate of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets andliabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from the settlement of foreign currency transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly.
Cumulative foreign currency translation differences arising on the translation and consolidation of foreign operations income statements and balance sheets denominated in foreign currencies are recorded as a separate component of equity.
Applying the exemption under IFRS 1 First time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, the Group has set the currency reserve to zero at 1 June 2004, the date oftransition to IFRS and measured and recorded separately in that currency reserve all cumulative foreign currency translation differences arising after that date.
On disposal of a foreign operation the cumulative translation differences will be transferred to the income statement in the period of the disposal as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
Finance income and expense Finance income and expense are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Government grants Government grants related to property, plant and equipment are reflected in the balance sheet as deferred income and credited to the income statement over the useful lives of the assets concerned.
Government grants relating to income are reflected in the balance sheet as deferred income and credited to the income statement over the period to which the grant relates.
Employee benefits Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates retirement benefit schemes in the United Kingdom and for most overseas countries in which it carries on business.
Those in the United Kingdom are defined benefit schemes and defined contribution schemes: overseas schemes vary in detail depending on local practice.
The UK defined benefit schemes were closed to future accrual on 31 May 2008.
65 PZ Cussons Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 1.
Accounting policies continued In respect of the defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with full actuarial valuations being carried out every three years or more frequently should a material change occur in any of the schemes.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside the income statement and presented in the statement of comprehensive income.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits have already vested, and otherwise amortised on a straightline basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
All components of the pension cost are included within operating profit.
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Sharebased payments The Group operates a Deferred Annual Share Bonus Scheme, a Performance Share Plan and an Executive Share Option Scheme for senior executives, all of which involve equitysettled sharebased payments.
Equitysettled sharebased payments under the Executive Share Option Scheme are measured at fair value excluding the effect of nonmarket based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straightline basisover the vesting period.
Fair value is measured using the BlackScholes pricing model.
The expected life used in the model has beenadjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of nontransferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The awards under the Performance Share Plan are measured at the fair value at the date of grant and are expensed over the period to which the performance relates based on the expected outcome of the vesting conditions.
At each balance sheet date, the entity revises itsestimates of the number of options that are expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, intheincome statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The awards under the Deferred Annual Share Bonus Scheme are measured at fair value at the date of grant and are expensed over the period to which the performance relates.
Taxation Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current and deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax liabilities on a net basis.
Property, plant and equipment Land and buildings held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, or for administration purposes, are stated in the balance sheet at deemed cost at the date of transition to IFRS less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
All other assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the item.
66 PZ Cussons Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 1.
Accounting policies continued Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets, other than land, over their estimated useful lives, using the straightline method, on the following basis: Freehold buildings at rates not less than 2% Leasehold buildings at rates which will reduce the book value to nil on or before the termination of the leases with a minimum of 2% Plant and machinery not less than 8% Fixtures, fittings and vehicles not less than 20% In the case of major projects depreciation is provided from the date the project in question is brought into use.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement for the period.
The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at each balance sheet date.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and where applicable, directlabour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Costiscalculated using the FIFO method.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completionand costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence thatthe Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
Research and development Research and development expenditure is charged against profits in the year in which it is incurred, unless it meets the criteria for capitalisation set out in IAS 38 Intangible assets.
Cash, cash equivalents and bank overdrafts Cash, cash equivalents and bank overdrafts includes cash at bank and in hand plus shortterm deposits less overdrafts.
Shortterm deposits have a maturity of less than three months from the date of acquisition.
Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Derivative financial instruments The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates and to fluctuations in interest rates.
TheGroup uses derivative financial instruments primarily foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations relating to certain firm commitments and forecasted transactions.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps to hedge a proportion of the exposure to floating interest rate fluctuations.
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles inthe use of financial derivatives consistent with the Groups risk management strategy.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value at the contract date, and are remeasured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, and any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Borrowings Interestbearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis through the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent they are not settledin the period in which they arise.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
67 PZ Cussons Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 1.
Accounting policies continued Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
Anequity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Investments Investments other than interests in joint ventures are recognised and derecognised on a trade date when a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs.
Investments are classified as either heldtomaturity, heldfortrading, loans and receivables or availableforsale.
Heldtomaturity investments and loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost.
Heldfortrading and availableforsale investments are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value.
Where securities are heldfortrading purposes, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in the income statement for the period.
For availableforsale investments, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the security is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the income statement for the period.
Segmental reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Executive Board.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will berequired to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for therestructuring that has been communicated to affected parties.
Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
In respect of interim dividends these are recognised once paid.
Critical accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty Estimates and accounting judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires management to make assumptions and estimates about future events.
Theresulting accounting estimates will, by definition, differ from the actual results.
The assumptions and estimates that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are as follows: Accounting for intangible assets The Group records all intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination at fair value.
Intangible assets are deemed to haveindefinite lives and as such are not amortised but are subject, as a minimum, to annual tests for impairment.
Determining whether intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cashgenerating units to which the intangible asset hasbeen allocated.
The value in use calculation requires management to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cashgenerating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
Details of key estimates are discussed in note 10.
Revenue recognition The Group recognises revenue generally at the time of delivery, which represents the point at which the significant risks and rewards ofownership are transferred to the customer, and when collection of the resulting consideration for those goods is reasonably assured.
Should management consider that the criteria for recognition are not met, revenue is deferred until such time as the consideration has been fully earned.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable net of discounts, rebates and salesrelated taxes but including interest receivable on sales on extended credit and income from the provision of technical services and agreements.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Segmental analysis The chief operating decisionmaker has been identified as the Executive Board which comprises the three Executive Directors.
The Executive Board reviews the Groups internal reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources.
Management has determined the operating segments based on these reports which include an allocation of central revenue and costs as appropriate.
The Executive Board considers the business from a geographic perspective, with Africa, Asia and Europe being the reporting segments.
The Executive Board assesses the performance based on operating profit before any exceptional items.
Other information provided, except as noted below, to the Executive Board is measured in a manner consistent with that of the financial statements.
Sales between segments are carried out on an arms length basis.

This includes some initial costs in relation to the Group structure andsystems project.
Boutique spas closure The Group has decided to close the boutique spas to concentrate on product sales within the Beauty division.
The exceptional costs include a 1.6 million impairment of boutique spa related assets with the remainder consisting of restructuring costs.
Deferred tax benefit of reduction in UK Corporation tax rate principally relating to brands The UK corporation tax rate reduced to 23% from 24% on 1 April 2013.
As a result of this change, the deferred tax balances relating to UK assets and liabilities were reduced to take account of the substantively enacted rate change.
The largest single effect of the rate change was in relation to the deferred tax liabilities recognised when the Sanctuary, St Tropez and Charles Worthington brands were acquired andthis is disclosed as an exceptional item due to its size and the fact that it relates to previous acquisitions.
Year to 31 May 2012 Supply chain optimisation The Group initiated the implementation of a supply chain optimisation project to significantly reduce the overhead footprint of the Groups manufacturing activities.
The main activities involved in this project related to the closure of manufacturing facilities in Australia and Ghana, in addition to other optimisation projects in Africa and Asia.
Exceptional costs principally relating to the write down of manufacturing facilities and certain other restructuring costs were therefore incurred.
Pension scheme derisking charge The Group finalised the derisking exercise that was commenced in the year to 31 May 2011 in relation to the enhanced transfer value exercise for deferred members of the main UK defined benefit pension scheme.
Beauty division acquisition & integration costs The Group incurred 1.1 million of acquisition and related costs for the purchase of the Fudge hair care brand and associated inventory.
Inaddition, charges totalling 3.2 million were incurred in integrating the Fudge business selling and logistics activities into the Beauty division.
Further costs totalling 2.0 million were also incurred rationalising the activities of the Beauty division post Fudge integration.
Australian Home Care brand impairment A decision was made to fully impair the Groups value dishcare brand in Australia, Trix.
Deferred tax benefit of reduction in UK Corporation tax rate principally relating to brands The UK corporation tax rate reduced to 24% from 26% on 1 April 2012.
The largest single effect of the rate change was in relation to the deferred tax liabilities recognised when the Sanctuary, St Tropez and Charles Worthington brands were acquired andthis was disclosed as an exceptional item due to its size and the fact that it related to previous acquisitions.

Goodwill and other intangible assets, which all have indefinite useful lives, are subject to annual impairment testing, or more frequent testing if there are indicators of impairment.
Intangible assets including goodwill are allocated to the appropriate cashgenerating units CGUs based on the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows independently in relation to the specific intangible goodwill.
The recoverable amounts of theCGUs are determined from valueinuse calculations that use cash flow projections from approved budgets and plans over a period offive years.
Key assumptions in the budgets and plans include future revenue volumes, growth rates and prices, associated future levels of marketing support, costbase of manufacture and supply and directly associated overheads and tax.
Cash flows beyond the fiveyear period are extrapolated using the estimated longterm growth rate of 3% 2012: 2.3%.
Management has assessed the appropriate discount rate for each individual CGU, using a Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC for comparable companies operating in similar markets and geographies as the Group as the base discount rate, adjusted for risks specific to each CGU.
Due to the similar geographic andproduct diversification of their respective markets and risks associated with each CGU, a pretax discount rate of 8.8% was deemed appropriate for all reviewed CGUs.

Trade receivables consist of a broad cross section of our international customer base for whom there is no significant history of default.
The credit risk of customers is assessed at a subsidiary and Group level, taking into account their financial positions, past experiences and other relevant factors.
Individual customer credit limits are imposed based on these factors.
The credit period taken on sales ranges from 4 to 100 days 2012: 15 to 100 days due to the differing nature of trade receivables in the Groups geographical segments.

These facilities are committed until 2016.
As at 31 May 2013 100 million was drawn.
The Groups borrowings are all denominated in Sterling.
At 31 May 2013, the Group had total undrawn facilities of 109.9 million 2012:101.7 million available to it.
All borrowings are at floating rate and the applicable weighted average interest rates are as follows: 2013 2012 Interest Interest 2013 rate 2012 rate m % m % Borrowing 100.0 2.0 90.8 1.7 b Financial instruments Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Financial instruments utilised by the Group during the years ended 31 May 2013 and 31 May 2012, together with information regarding themethods and assumptions used to calculate fair values, can be summarised as follows: Current and noncurrent investments In accordance with IAS 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and Measurement, unlisted investments are held in the Groups balance sheet at cost because their fair value cannot be measured reliably due to the lack of quoted market prices.
Current assets and liabilities Financial instruments included within current assets and liabilities excluding cash and borrowings are generally shortterm in nature andaccordingly their fair values approximate to their book values.
Borrowings and cash The carrying values of cash and shortterm borrowings approximate to their fair values because of the shortterm maturity of these instruments.
The financial instruments held by the Group do not, either individually or as a class, create a potentially significant exposure to market, credit, liquidity or cash flow interest rate risk.
Set out below is a comparison by category of the carrying values and fair values of all the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities asat 31 May 2013 and 31 May 2012.

The balance earns interest at a rate of 13% 2012: 11%.
The fair value of trade receivables and payables is considered to be equal to the carrying amount of these items due to their shortterm nature.
Derivative financial instruments 2013 2012 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities m m m m Forward foreign exchange contracts cash flow hedges 0.6 0.8 0.6 0.8 The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a noncurrent asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months and as a current asset or liability if the maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months.
Forward foreign exchange contracts The net notional principal amounts of the outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts at 31 May 2013 were 26.7 million 2012:39.6 million.
The hedged highly probable forecast transactions denominated in foreign currency are expected to occur at various dates during the next12 months.
Gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve in equity on forward foreign exchange contracts as of 31 May 2013 are recognised in the income statement in the period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects the income statement.
This is generally within 12 months from the balance sheet date unless the gain or loss is included in the initial amount recognised for the purchase of fixed assets, in which case recognition is over the lifetime of the asset.
Interest rate swaps An interest rate swap was in place at year end.
The notional principal amounts of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts as at 31 May 2013 was 45 million.
c Financial risk management The Groups operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in exchange rates, credit risk, liquidity and interest rates.
The Groups treasury function reports to the Board at least annually with reference to the application of the Group treasury policy.
The policy addresses issues of liquidity, funding and investment as well as interest rate, currency and commodity risks.
The Groups risk management policies are designed to identify and analyse these risks, to set appropriate risk limits and controls andtomonitor the risks and limits continually by means of reliable and uptodate systems.
The Group modifies and enhances its risk management policies and systems to reflect changes in markets and products.
The Group Risk Committee, under authority delegated bythe Board, formulates the high level Group risk management policy, monitors risk and receives reports that allow it to review the effectiveness of the Groups risk management policies.
i Credit risk management Credit risk is the risk that financial loss arises from the failure of a customer or counterparty to meet its obligations under a contract.
Group has dedicated standards, policies and procedures to control and monitor all such risks.
Although the Group is potentially exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties, such credit risk is controlled through credit rating and equity price reviews of the counterparties and by limiting the total amount of exposure to any one party.
The Group does not believe it is exposed to any material concentrations of credit risk.
As an example the Groups borrowings are arranged with a syndicate of major banks and are committed until2016.
An analysis of the international longterm credit ratings of counterparties where cash and shortterm deposits are held is as follows: 2013 2012 m m AA 14.1 26.4 A 23.9 8.6 B 55.0 30.0 C 0.9 93.0 65.9 ii Liquidity management Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group maintains a strong liquidity position and manages the liquidity profile of its assets, liabilities and commitments so that cash flows are appropriately balanced and all funding obligations are met when due.

Financial liabilities, financial instruments and financial risk management continued iii Market risk management Market risk is the risk that movements in market rates, including foreign exchange rates, interest rates, equity and commodity prices willreduce the Groups income.
The management of market risk is undertaken by the operating unit Finance Directors under delegated authority using risk limits approved by the Board.
iv Foreign exchange risk management The Groups activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Subsidiary undertakings must ensure that all transactional exposures arising from commitments in a currency other than their functional currency are identified and monitored.
The Group uses foreign currency forward contracts to manage these exposures.
The below sensitivity analysis was conducted by modelling a 10% weakening based on average annual fluctuations of Sterling against the following currencies at 31 May which would have increased equity and increased decreased profit loss by the following amounts shown below.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.
2013 2012 Income Income Equity statement Equity statement m m m m Nigerian Naira 20.6 2.1 18.7 1.1 Euro 4.7 0.1 4.3 0.2 Indonesian Rupiah 3.5 0.7 3.9 0.7 Australian Dollar 1.4 0.4 2.0 2.5 Polish Zloty 2.4 0.2 2.2 0.3 A 10% strengthening of Sterling against the above currencies would have had the equal and opposite effect on equity and profit by the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.
v Price risk management Due to the nature of the business, the Group is exposed to commodity price risk.
The Group does take measures to protect against shortterm impacts of these fluctuations, however, failure to recover higher costs could have a negative impact on profits.
vi Cash flow and interest rate risk The Groups variable rate borrowings are exposed to a risk of change in cash flows due to changes in interest rates.
The Group has reduced its exposure to this by entering into interest rate swaps.
vii Capital risk management The Group considers capital to be net funds debt plus total equity.
Net funds debt is defined as cash, shortterm deposits and current asset investments less borrowings.
Total equity includes share capital, reserves and retained earnings as shown in the consolidated balance sheet.
The Group had net funds debt positions as at 31 May 2013 and 31 May 2012 respectively, as shown below: 2013 2012 m m Cash at bank and in hand see note 17 42.3 34.2 Shortterm deposits see note 17 50.7 31.7 Cash and cash equivalents 93.0 65.9 Current asset investments 10.4 7.0 Bank loans due within one year 15.0 90.8 Bank loans due between two and five years 85.0 Net funds debt 3.4 17.9 The objectives for managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern, in order to provide returns for Shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an efficient capital structure to optimise the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital toshareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Groups capital is not restricted.
