Segment analysis Operating segments reflect internal management reporting to the Groups chief operating decision maker, defined as the Group Executive Board GEB.
The operating segments are determined based on differences in the nature of their services.
Geographical location also strongly affects the Group and both are therefore disclosed.
The reportable operating segments derive their revenue primarily from property related services.
Refer to the Group overview on page 1 and the Segmental reviews on pages 17 to 25 for further information on revenue sources.
Operations are based in four main geographical areas.
The UK is the home of the parent Company with segment operations throughout the region.
Asia Pacific segment operations are based in Hong Kong, Macau, China, Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam and Australia.
Continental Europe segment operations are based in Germany, France, Spain, Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Italy, Ireland and Poland.
America segment operations are based in New York.
The sales location of the client is not materially different from the location where fees are received and where the segment assets are located.
Within the UK, both commercial and residential services are provided.
Other geographical areas, although largely commercial based, also provide residential services, in particular Hong Kong, China, Vietnam, Singapore, Australia, Taiwan and Thailand.
The GEB assesses the performance of operating segments based on a measure of underlying profit before tax which adjusts reported pre-tax profit by profit on disposals, share-based payment adjustment, restructuring costs, amortisation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets excluding software and impairment of available-for-sale investments, joint ventures or associated undertakings.
Segmental assets and liabilities are not measured or reported to the GEB, but non-current assets are disclosed geographically on page 95.
