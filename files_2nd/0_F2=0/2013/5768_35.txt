Business overview Business review Governance Financial statements 171 Capital Gains Tax CGT base cost for UK shareholders On 10 October 2006, GUS plc separated its Experian business from its Home Retail Group business by way of demerger.
Following the demerger, GUS plc shareholders at 4.30pm on 6 October 2006 were entitled to receive one share in Experian plc and one share in Home Retail Group plc for every share they held in GUS plc at that time.
The base cost of any GUS plc shares held at 4.30pm on 6 October 2006 is apportioned for UK CGT purposes in the ratio 58.235% to Experian plc shares and 41.765% to Home Retail Group plc shares.
This is based on the closing prices of the respective shares on their first day of trading after their admission to the Official List of the London Stock Exchange on 11 October 2006.
For GUS plc shares acquired prior to the demerger of Burberry on 13 December 2005 which are affected by both the Burberry demerger and the subsequent separation of Experian and Home Retail Group, the original CGT base cost is apportioned 50.604% to Experian plc shares, 36.293% to Home Retail Group plc shares and 13.103% to Burberry Group plc shares.
