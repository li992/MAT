FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Company Financial Statements 1.
Accounting policies Basis of preparation The Financial Statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
No profit and loss account is presented for the Company as permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
The auditors remuneration for audit and other services is disclosed in note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company has taken the exemption in FRS 1 5 a and consequently no cash flow statement is presented for the Company.
Use of estimates and judgements The preparation of Financial Statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The most significant areas of estimation uncertainty, and areas where critical judgements are made in applying accounting policies that have a material effect on the Financial Statements, are listed below.
The uncertainties encountered, and judgements made, are described in more detail in the accompanying notes: Note 4 contingent consideration and remuneration Investments Investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in profit or loss using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill is recognised on the acquisition of trade and assets, representing any excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired.
The amounts are capitalised and written off on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life, which is five years.
Provision is made for any impairment.
Other Intangible Assets The cost of other intangible assets acquired in a business combination is fair value at the date of acquisition.
Where this can be measured reliably after initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
All of the Companys intangible assets have been identified as having finite useful lives.
As such they are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Customer lists 3 years For accounting purposes, customer lists have been identified separately.
Customer lists allow the Company to undertake targeted marketing activities.
Share-based payment transactions The Groups share schemes allow certain Group employees to acquire ordinary shares in the Company.
The fair value of share awards made is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at award date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards.
The fair value of the awards made is measured using an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards were made.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of share awards expected to vest.
Subsidiaries are recharged for the amount recognised as share-based payments relating to awards to their employees.
The fair value of the recharge is recognised over the vesting period.
Dividends Dividends receivable are recognised when the Companys right to receive payment is established.
Dividends payable to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability and deducted from shareholders equity in the period in which the shareholders right to receive payment is established.
Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the profit and loss account except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates in force for the year, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
com Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 76 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
Share-based payments The analysis and disclosures in relation to share-based payments are given in the Consolidated Financial Statements in note 18.

com MSE On 21 September 2012, the Company purchased trade and certain assets from Martin Lewis for an initial consideration of 64.5m.

In addition, a contingent amount of up to 27.0m, payable in part against the achievement of certain non-financial metrics and in part at the discretion of the Company Board, is dependent on the continued employment of Martin Lewis for three years following the acquisition.
Part of this payment is due to individuals who were employed by MSE at the point of acquisition and who remain in employment at the end of the earnout period, with the remainder payable to Martin Lewis.
The amounts due to MSE employees have been accounted for separate to the business combination as remuneration.
The fair value of this element will be charged to the Company profit and loss account over the earnout period.
At the balance sheet date the fair value of the contingent amount was 1.7m 2012: 1.7m and 0.6m 2012: 0.2m has been charged to the Company profit and loss account during the period as an employment expense.
