Any increase in provisions due to discounting, only recorded where material, is recognised as interest expense within other net financing charges.
Standards, revisions and amendments to standards and interpretations issued but not yet adopted The Group does not intend to adopt any standard, revision or amendment before the required implementation date.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU : IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements: IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: and IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities.
The impact of IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements and IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities has been assessed for adoption on 1 January 2014 and it is considered there will be no material impact on the Groups results, assets or liabilities.
All other revisions and amendments to standards and interpretations which have an implementation date for 2015 or after are still being assessed.
Significant judgements, key assumptions and estimates The Groups significant accounting policies are set out above.
The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with IFRS, requires the use of estimates, subjective judgement and assumptions that may affect the amounts of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and reported profit and earnings for the year.
The Directors base these estimates, judgements and assumptions on a combination of past experience, professional expert advice and other evidence that is relevant to the particular circumstance.
The accounting policies where the Directors consider the more complex estimates, judgements and assumptions have to be made are those in respect of acquired assets and liabilities business combinations changes to 2012 acquisition note 1, post-employment obligations note 24, derivative and other financial instruments notes 4b and 20, taxation note 6, provisions note 21 and impairment of non-current assets note 11.
Details of the principal estimates, judgements and assumptions made are set out in the related notes as identified.

Details of the effective tax rate for the Group and the underlying events and transactions affecting this are given on page 39.
Significant judgements and estimates The Group operates in many jurisdictions and is subject to tax audits which are often complex and can take several years to conclude.
Therefore, the accrual for current tax includes provisions for uncertain tax positions which require estimates for each matter and the exercise of judgement in respect of the interpretation of tax laws and the likelihood of challenge to historic tax positions.
Where appropriate, estimates of interest and penalties are included in these provisions.
As amounts provided for in any year could differ from eventual tax liabilities, subsequent adjustments which have a material impact on the Group's tax rate and or cash tax payments may arise.
Tax payments comprise payments on account and payments on the final resolution of open items and, as a result, there can be substantial differences between the charge in the income statement and cash tax payments.
Where companies utilise brought forward tax losses such that little or no tax is paid, this also results in differences between the tax charge and cash tax payments.
With regard to deferred tax, judgement is required for the recognition of deferred tax assets, which is based on expectations of future financial performance in particular legal entities or tax groups.

Deferred tax assets are recognised where management projections indicate the future availability of taxable profits to absorb the deductions.
Other deferred tax arises mainly in relation to items that are taxable or tax deductible in a different period than the income or expense is accrued in the accounts.

f Changes in UK tax rate A reduction in the mainstream rate of UK corporation tax to 23% took effect from April 2013 which gives rise to an effective rate of 23.25% for the year.
Further reductions from 23% to 21% with effect from 1 April 2014 and from 21% to 20% from 1 April 2015 have also been substantively enacted.
UK temporary differences are measured at the rate at which they are expected to reverse.
g Franked investment income litigation Since 2003, the Group has been involved in litigation with HMRC in respect of various advance corporate tax payments made and corporate tax paid on certain foreign dividends which, in its view, were levied by HMRC in breach of the Groups EU community law rights.
A High Court judgment regarding payments on account was handed down in January 2013 confirming HMRC should repay payments on account to GKN.
The European Court of Justice published its decision on 13 November 2012 and the case will return to the UK High Court in April 2014.
The continuing complexity of the case and uncertainty over the issues raised means that it is not possible to predict the final outcome of the litigation with any reasonable degree of certainty and, as a result, no contingent asset has been recognised.

"Where grants were made after 7 November 2002 they have been accounted for as required by IFRS 2 ""Share-based payment""."
Awards made before that date have not been so accounted.
Details of awards made since 7 November 2002 that impact the 2013 accounting charge are: Sustainable Earnings Plan SEP Awards comprising a Core Award and a Sustainability Award were made to Directors and certain senior employees in August 2012 and March 2013.
A Core Award is subject to EPS growth targets over an initial three year performance period and a Sustainability Award is subject to the highest level of EPS achieved over the initial three year period being sustained for a further two year period.
Sustained EPS growth is measured independently in years four and five.
50% of the Core Award will be released at the end of the initial three year period: the balance of the Core Award and any Sustainability Award will be released at the end of year five.
There is no provision for retesting performance for either the Core Award or Sustainability Award.
On release, dividends are treated as having accrued on the shares from the date of grant to the date of release with the value delivered in either shares or cash.

c s 201 om 3 131 131 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2013 11 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued c Impairment testing An impairment test is a comparison of the carrying value of the assets of a business or cash generating unit CGU to their recoverable amount.
Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment results.
During the year, all goodwill was tested for impairment with no impairment charges resulting.
For the purposes of carrying out impairment tests, the Groups total goodwill has been allocated to a number of CGUs and each of these CGUs has been separately assessed and tested.
The size of a CGU varies but is never larger than a primary or secondary reportable segment.
In some cases, a CGU is an individual subsidiary or operation.
Significant judgements, assumptions and estimates One CGU within the Group, Power Management Devices Land Systems, has been assessed for impairment using an estimation of fair value less costs of disposal based on a multiple of EBITDA and recent comparable market prices.
Due to unfavourable market conditions in the year value in use was no longer considered to be a representative assessment for impairment testing.
The relevant assets of Power Management Devices have been assessed against fair value less costs of disposal.
The assessment used an assumed EBITDA taking into account past performance, and a market based multiple following a review of comparable companies within a peer group.
Sensitivity analysis on this CGU is provided below.
All other CGUs recoverable amounts were measured based on value in use.
Detailed forecasts for the next five years have been used which are based on approved annual budgets and strategic projections representing the best estimate of future performance.
In the case of certain CGUs within the Groups Aerospace business, value in use at 31 December 2013 was measured using operating cash flow projections covering the next ten years which incorporate the anticipated timing of volumes on current programmes.
Management consider forecasting over this period to more appropriately reflect the length of business cycle of those CGUs programmes, in particular the growth of certain military programmes.
In determining the value in use of CGUs it is necessary to make a series of assumptions to estimate the present value of future cash flows.
In each case, these key assumptions have been made by management reflecting past experience and are consistent with relevant external sources of information.
Operating cash flows The main assumptions within forecast operating cash flow include the achievement of future sales prices and volumes including reference to specific customer relationships, product lines and the use of industry relevant external forecasts of global vehicle production within Driveline businesses and consideration of specific volumes on certain military and civil programmes within Aerospace, raw material input costs, the cost structure of each CGU and the ability to realise benefits from annual productivity improvements, the impact of foreign currency rates upon selling price and cost relationships and the levels of ongoing capital expenditure required to support forecast production.
Pre-tax risk adjusted discount rates Pre-tax risk adjusted discount rates are derived from risk-free rates based upon long term government bonds in the territory, or territories, within which each CGU operates.
A relative risk adjustment or beta has been applied to risk-free rates to reflect the risk inherent in each CGU relative to all other sectors on average, determined using an average of the betas of comparable listed companies.
The range of pre-tax risk adjusted discount rates set out below have been used for impairment testing.
The range of rates reflects the mix of geographical territories within CGUs within the reportable segments.
Aerospace: Europe 11% 2012: 11% and North America 12% 2012: 12% Driveline: North and South America 13%-24% 2012: 13%-24%, Europe 12%-14% 2012: 12%-14% and Japan and Asia Pacific region countries 10%-19% 2012: 10%-17% Powder Metallurgy: Europe 12% 2012: 12% and North America 13% 2012: 13% Land Systems: Europe 11%-14% 2012: 11%-14% and North America 13% 2012: 13% Long term growth rates To forecast beyond the detailed cash flows into perpetuity, a long term average growth rate has been used.
In each case, this is not greater than the published International Monetary Fund average growth rate in gross domestic product for the next five year period in the territory or territories where the CGU is primarily based.
This results in a range of nominal growth rates: Aerospace: Europe 3% 2012: 3% and North America 3% 2012: 3% Driveline: North and South America 3%-8% 2012: 3%-8%, Europe 2%-7% 2012: 2%-7% and Japan and Asia Pacific region countries 2%-10% 2012: 2%-8% Powder Metallurgy: Europe 4% 2012: 4% and North America 3% 2012: 3% Land Systems: Europe 2%-4% 2012: 2%-4% and North America 3% 2012: 3% 132 132 GKN p GKN p lc Ann lc u Annua al Repo l R rt epor and tAcco and Ac unfit c s ou 201 nts 3 2013 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION c Impairment testing continued Goodwill sensitivity analysis The results of the Groups impairment tests are dependent upon estimates and judgements made by management, particularly in relation to the key assumptions described above.
Sensitivity analysis to potential changes in key assumptions has therefore been reviewed.
At 31 December 2013, the date of the Groups annual impairment test, the estimated recoverable amount of one CGU within the Groups Aerospace operations using value in use and one CGU within the Groups Land Systems operations using fair value less costs of disposal exceeded their carrying value by 188 million and 12 million respectively.
The table below shows the discount rate, long term growth rate and forecast operating cash flow assumptions used in the calculation of value in use and the amount by which each assumption must change in isolation in order for the estimated recoverable amount to equal the carrying value.

c s 201 om 3 139 139 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2013 19 Financial risk management The Groups activities give rise to a number of financial risks: market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Market risk includes foreign currency risk, cash flow and fair value interest rate risk and commodity price risk.
The Group has in place risk management policies that seek to limit the effects of financial risk on financial performance.
Derivative financial instruments, mainly forward foreign currency contracts, are used to hedge risk exposures that arise in the ordinary course of business.
Further information is provided in the treasury management section of the Strategic Report.
Risk management policies have been set by the Board and are implemented by the central Treasury Department that receives regular reports from all the operating companies to enable prompt identification of financial risks so that appropriate actions may be taken.
The Treasury Department has a policy and procedures manual that sets out specific guidelines to manage foreign currency risks, interest rate risk, financial credit risk and liquidity risk and the use of financial instruments to manage these.
a Foreign currency risk The Group has transactional currency exposures arising from sales or purchases by operating subsidiaries in currencies other than the subsidiaries functional currency.
These exposures are forecast on a monthly basis by operating companies and are reported to the central Treasury Department.
Under the Groups foreign currency policy, such exposures are hedged on a reducing percentage basis over a number of forecast time horizons using forward foreign currency contracts.
The Groups reporting currency for its consolidated financial statements is sterling.
Changes in exchange rates will affect the translation of results and net assets of operations outside of the UK.
The Groups largest exposures are the euro and the US dollar where a 1% movement in the average rate impacts trading profit of subsidiaries and joint ventures by 1 million and 4 million respectively.
Regarding financial instruments a 1% strengthening of sterling against the currency rates indicated below would have the following impact on operating profit: Trading profit: Derivative Payables and financial Intra-group receivables instruments funding m m m Euro 0.3 1.4 1.8 US dollar 0.4 19.3 1.0 The derivative sensitivity analysis has been prepared by reperforming the calculations used to determine the balance sheet values adjusted for the changes in the individual currency rates indicated with all other cross currency rates remaining constant.
The sensitivity is a fair value change relating to derivatives for which the underlying transaction has not occurred at 31 December 2013.
The Group intends to hold all such derivatives to maturity.
The analysis of other items has been prepared based on an analysis of a currency balance sheet.

The Groups policy is to optimise interest cost in reported earnings and reduce volatility in the debt related element of the Groups cost of capital.
This policy is achieved by maintaining a target range of fixed and floating rate debt for discrete annual periods, over a defined time horizon.
The Groups normal policy is to require interest rates to be fixed for 50% to 80% of the level of underlying borrowings forecast to arise over a 12 month horizon.
At 31 December 2013, 96% 2012: 82% of the Groups gross borrowings were subject to fixed interest rates.
As at 31 December 2013, 31 million 2012: 4 million was in bank deposits, 3 million of which was on deposit with banks on the Isle of Man 2012: 4 million.
c Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments.
In terms of substance, and consistent with the related balance sheet presentation, the Group considers it has two types of credit risk: operational and financial.
Operational credit risk relates to non-performance by customers in respect of trade receivables and by suppliers in respect of other receivables.
Financial credit risk relates to non-performance by banks and similar institutions in respect of cash and deposits, facilities and financial contracts, including forward foreign currency contracts.
Operational As tier-one suppliers to automotive, land systems and aerospace original equipment manufacturers the Group may have substantial amounts outstanding with a single customer at any one time.
The credit profiles of such original equipment manufacturers are available from credit rating agencies.
The failure of any such customer to honour its debts could materially impact the Groups results.
However, there are many advantages in these relationships.
In Land Systems there are a greater proportion of amounts receivable from small and medium sized customers.
Credit risk and customer relationships are managed at a number of levels within the Group.
At a subsidiary level documented credit control reviews are required to be held at least every month.
The scope of these reviews includes amounts overdue and credit limits.
At a divisional level debtor ratios, overdue accounts and overall performance are reviewed regularly.
Provisions for doubtful debts are determined at these levels based upon the customers ability to pay and other factors in the Groups relationship with the customer.
At 31 December the largest 5 trade receivables as a proportion of total trade receivables analysed by major segment is as follows: 2013 2012 % % Aerospace 69 69 Driveline 54 56 Powder Metallurgy 21 19 Land Systems 23 25 The amount of trade receivables outstanding at the year end does not represent the maximum exposure to operational credit risk due to the normal patterns of supply and payment over the course of a year.
Based on management information collected as at month ends the maximum level of trade receivables at any one point during the year was 1,156 million 2012: 1,055 million.
Financial Credit risk is mitigated by the Groups policy of only selecting counterparties with a strong investment graded long term credit rating, normally at least Aor equivalent, and assigning financial limits to individual counterparties.
The maximum exposure with a single bank for deposits is 28 million 2012: 4 million, whilst the maximum mark to market exposure for forward foreign currency contracts at 31 December 2013 to a single bank was 11 million 2012: 11 million.
c s 201 om 3 1 141 41 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2013 19 Financial risk management continued d Capital risk management The Group defines capital as total equity.
The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain a capital structure which optimises the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
The Group monitors borrowings on the basis of the ratio of gross borrowings to EBITDA.
The Group seeks to operate at a gross debt to EBITDA of subsidiaries ratio of 3 times or less and the ratios at 31 December 2013 and 2012 were as follows: 2013 2012 m m Gross borrowings 916 1,052 EBITDA 866 739 Gross borrowings to EBITDA ratio 1.1 times 1.4 times The Groups two external banking covenants require an EBITDA of subsidiaries to net interest payable and receivable ratio of 3.5 times or more and net debt to EBITDA of subsidiaries of 3 times or less measured at 30 June and 31 December.
The ratios at 31 December 2013 and 2012 were as follows: 2013 2012 m m EBITDA 866 739 Net interest payable and receivable excluding borrowing costs capitalised 73 57 EBITDA to net interest payable and receivable ratio 11.9 times 13.0 times 2013 2012 m m Net debt 732 871 EBITDA 866 739 Net debt to EBITDA ratio 0.8 times 1.2 times restated for the impact of IAS 19 revised, see note 1.
The Group monitors these ratios on a rolling basis and they are part of the budgeting and forecasting processes.

Borrowings normally peak in May and September following dividend and bond coupon payments.
The Groups policies are to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to meet obligations when they fall due and to maintain sufficient flexibility in order to fund investment and acquisition objectives.
Liquidity needs are assessed through short and long term forecasts.
Committed bank facilities total 837 million of which 595 million expires in 2016 and 242 million in 2017.
There were no drawings on these facilities at 31 December 2013.
In addition the Groups European Investment Bank unsecured facility 80 million is repayable in five equal annual instalments of 16 million commencing in June 2015.
Committed facilities are provided through 16 banks.
The Group also maintains 82 million of uncommitted facilities, provided by 4 banks.
There were no drawings against these facilities at 31 December 2013.

f Commodity price risk The Group is exposed to changes in commodity prices, particularly of metals, which has a significant impact on input costs and the overall financial results.
The Group seeks to mitigate this exposure in a variety of ways including medium term price agreements, surcharges and advance purchasing.
In rare circumstances and only in respect of certain specified risks the Group uses derivative commodity hedging instruments.
The impact of such financial instruments in respect of the overall commodity price risk is not material.

IFRS 13 The financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are forward currency contracts, commodity contracts and embedded derivatives.
All of these financial instruments are classified as Level 2 fair value measurements, as defined by IFRS 7, being those derived from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable.
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been determined with reference to available market information at the balance sheet date, using the methodologies described in their relevant notes: Forward currency contracts, commodity contracts and embedded derivatives, see note 20: Unsecured bank overdrafts, other short term bank borrowings, bank balances and cash and short term bank deposits, see note 18: Bonds included within other borrowings, see note 18: and Fair values of trade receivables and payables, short term investments and cash and cash equivalents are assumed to approximate to cost due to the short term maturity of the instruments and as the impact of discounting is not significant.
The discounted contingent element of deferred and contingent consideration of 6 million 2012: 8 million is categorised as a Level 3 fair value measurement, see note 17.

Significant estimates and judgement Whilst estimating provisions requires judgement, the range of reasonably possible outcomes is narrow.
After consideration of sensitivity analysis, amounts stated represent managements best estimate of the likely outcome.
Contract provisions The Group has a small number of onerous contracts and a non-beneficial lease arrangement, primarily arising on business combinations.
Onerous contracts relate to customer programmes where the unavoidable costs of delivering product are in excess of contracted sales prices.
Utilisation of the provision due in more than one year is estimated as 8 million in 2015 and 58 million from 2016.
Warranty Provisions set aside for warranty exposures either relate to amounts provided systematically based on historical experience under contractual warranty obligations attaching to the supply of goods or specific provisions created in respect of individual customer issues undergoing commercial resolution and negotiation.
In the event of a claim, settlement will be negotiated with the customer based on supply of replacement products and compensation for the customers associated costs.
Amounts set aside represent managements best estimate of the likely settlement and the timing of any resolution with the relevant customer.
Utilisation of the provision due in more than one year is estimated as 8 million in 2015 and 10 million from 2016.

In addition, in the USA and UK various plans operate which provide members with post-retirement medical benefits.
The Groups post-employment plans in the UK, USA and Germany together account for 98% of plan assets and 97% of plan liabilities.
The Groups post-employment plans include both funded and unfunded arrangements.
The UK pension schemes are funded, albeit in deficit in common with many other UK pension schemes, with the scheme assets held in trustee administered funds.
The German and other European plans are generally unfunded, with pension payments made from company funds as they fall due, rather than from scheme assets.
The USA includes a combination of funded and unfunded pension and medical plans, whilst Japan also operates a funded pension plan.
The Groups defined benefit pension arrangements provide benefits to members in the form of an assured level of pension payable for life.
The level of benefits provided typically depends on length of service and salary levels in the years leading up to retirement.
In the UK and Germany, pensions in payment are generally updated in line with inflation, whereas in the USA pensions generally do not receive inflationary increases once in payment.
The UK and German schemes are closed to new entrants, whilst with one small exception, the USA schemes are closed to future accrual.
Independent actuarial valuations of all major defined benefit scheme assets and liabilities were carried out at 31 December 2013.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation and the related service cost elements were measured using the projected unit credit method.

The key current year mortality assumptions for both GKN1 and GKN2 use S1NA year of birth mortality tables with CMI 2013 improvements and a 1.25% p. a. long term improvement trend.
These assumptions give the following expectations for each scheme: for GKN1 a male aged 65 lives for a further 21.7 years and a female aged 65 lives for a further 23.7 years whilst a male aged 45 is expected to live a further 23.4 years from age 65 and a female aged 45 is expected to live a further 25.6 years from age 65.
For GKN2 a male aged 65 lives for a further 22.7 years and a female aged 65 lives for a further 25.0 years whilst a male aged 45 is expected to live a further 24.5 years from age 65 and a female aged 45 is expected to live a further 27.0 years from age 65.
Overseas In the USA, PPA2013 tables have been used whilst in Germany the RT2005-G tables have been used.
In the USA, the longevity assumption for a male aged 65 is that he lives a further 19.2 years female 21.1 years whilst in Germany a male aged 65 lives for a further 18.7 years female 22.8 years.
The longevity assumption for a USA male currently aged 45 is that he also lives for a further 19.2 years once attaining 65 years female 21.1 years, with the German equivalent assumption for a male being 21.4 years female 25.3 years.
These assumptions are based on the prescribed tables, rather than GKN experience.
Assumption sensitivity analysis The impact of a one percentage point movement in the primary assumptions longevity: 1 year on the defined benefit net obligations as at 31 December 2013 is set out below: UK Americas Europe ROW Liabilities Liabilities Liabilities Liabilities m m m m Discount rate 1% 383 32 64 3 Discount rate -1% 479 38 82 3 Rate of inflation 1% 416 54 Rate of inflation -1% 344 46 Life expectancy 1 year 100 8 15 Life expectancy -1 year 97 8 13 Health cost trend 1% 2 1 Health cost trend -1% 2 1 The above sensitivity analyses are based on isolated changes in each assumption, whilst holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and there is likely to be some level of correlation between movements in different assumptions, although the above sensitivities are shown to illustrate at a high level the scale of sensitivity of the balance sheet to key actuarial assumptions.
The same actuarial methods have been used to calculate these sensitivities as are used to calculate the relevant balance sheet values, and have not changed compared to the previous period.
Judgements and estimates Pension partnership interest On 31 March 2010, the Group agreed an asset-backed cash payment arrangement with the Trustee of the UK pension scheme via a pension partnership arrangement, which entitled the UK pension scheme to a distribution of 30 million per annum for 20 years, subject to discretion exercisable by the Group in certain circumstances.
When the UK pension scheme was split into two separate schemes during 2012, the income interest was also split accordingly.
The income interest has previously been recognised as an IAS 19 plan asset, having been valued on a discounted cash flow basis, with the corresponding non-controlling interest in equity, in line with the Groups application of IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation, rather than being shown as a liability.
During 2012 the Group had been monitoring reporting developments in respect of asset-backed pension arrangements.
It had noted a public reference to the concerns of the Financial Reporting Review Panel, in relation to accounting for pension partnerships, before its successor body, the Conduct Committee of the Financial Reporting Council FRC approached the Group about its accounting for the arrangement in the 2011 Annual Report.
The Board and Audit Committee, which debated extensively the FRC Conduct Committees position on the accounting, valuation and associated disclosures for the asset-backed cash payment arrangement, concluded in February 2013 that there were no grounds to make amendments at that time: a position supported by external legal and accounting advice.
The Groups view was not shared by the FRCs Conduct Committee.
Following the February Audit Committee meeting it was agreed to review possible amendments to the asset-backed pension arrangement that, with no change to the underlying economics of the arrangement, would give the Group greater control over the future of the partnership and address for the future the FRC Conduct Committees concerns.
The resultant amendments to agreements were made in May 2013 and reported at the 2013 half year.
The changes in the pension arrangements resulted in a simpler accounting treatment which, post the changes, also addresses the concerns raised by the FRCs Conduct Committee.
Discussions with the FRCs Conduct Committee were satisfactorily bought to a close in early 2014.
c s 201 om 3 1 149 49 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2013 24 Post-employment obligations continued a Defined benefit schemes significant judgements, assumptions and estimates continued Judgements and estimates continued Pension partnership interest continued As noted, the accounting and disclosure for this arrangement has changed during 2013 following the amendments to the pension partnership agreement agreed with the Trustees of the two UK pension schemes.
The most significant amendment introduced restrictions on the ability of each UK pension scheme to sell or otherwise transfer its respective income interest.
Besides giving the Group greater control over the future of the pension partnership, the result of this change is that the respective income interests no longer meet the criteria for recognition as an IAS 19 plan asset and have, consequently, been removed with an effective date of 31 May 2013.
This increases the Groups reported post-employment obligation deficit by an amount of 342 million being the fair value at 31 May 2013, and eliminates the non-controlling interest of 332 million which was previously recognised in equity in relation to the schemes income interests.
The remaining difference of 10 million has been recognised in equity within retained earnings, as it represents a transaction with equity holders.
During the year the Group has paid a combined amount of 30 million 2012: 30 million to the two UK pension schemes through the pension partnership.
20 million 2012: nil of this amount was paid following the removal of the pension partnership plan asset, so is included within the amount of contributions benefits paid, and 10 million 2012: 30 million was paid as a distribution from the pension partnership to the UK Pension scheme, before the effective date of the new agreement.
For comparative purposes only, if the partnership amendment had an effective date of 1 January 2012 the beginning of the comparative period, rather than 31 May 2013, the pro forma net amounts for Post-employment obligations reported at the previous balance sheet date 31 December 2012 would have been 1,320 million.
The amount actually reported at 31 December 2012 was 978 million.
Similarly, the pro forma balance sheet value of Non-controlling interests would have been 19 million at 31 December 2012 compared to the amount actually reported at 31 December 2012 353 million.
In the income statement, pro forma Other net financing charges would have increased by 16 million from 26 million to 42 million for the year end 31 December 2012, as a result of a full period impact.

Both UK pension schemes have undergone a funding valuation as at 5 April 2013 and as at 31 December 2013 the Group was close to agreement on recovery plans with the scheme trustees.
The Groups UK pension funding deficit is lower than the equivalent UK accounting deficit.
Subsequent to the year end, the UK funding valuation has been agreed in principle, subject only to execution of final documentation.
This has resulted in additional UK deficit recovery payments of 10 million per year commencing in 2014 and the potential for further additional payments commencing in 2015, contingent upon asset performance.
In addition the Group has also agreed, in early 2014, to pay 2 million per year for 4 years to UK scheme, GKN1, to cover a funding requirement arising from a 123 million bulk annuity purchase in 2014.

The equivalent proportions for the USA plans were: equities 75% 25%: bonds 97% 3%.
Further geographical diversification of the USA portfolio is planned to take place.
c Defined benefit scheme risk factors Through its various post-employment pension and medical plans, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below.
The Groups focus is on managing the cash demands which the various pension plans place on the Group, rather than balance sheet volatility in its own right.
For funded schemes cash requirements are generally determined by funding valuations which are performed on a different basis from accounting valuations.
Asset volatility: Plan liabilities are calculated using discount rates set with reference to bond yields although the discount rate methodology differs for accounting and funding purposes.
If plan assets deliver a return which is lower than the discount rate, this will create or increase a plan deficit.
GKNs various pension plans hold a significant proportion of equities and similar growth assets, which are expected to out-perform bonds in the long term, albeit at the risk of short term volatility.
As the plans mature, with a shorter time horizon to cope with volatility, the Group will gradually reduce holdings of growth assets in favour of increased matching assets bonds and similar.
In the meantime, the Group considers that equities and similar assets are an appropriate means of managing pension funding requirements, given the long term nature of the liabilities and the strength of the Group to withstand volatility.
Changes in bond yields: A decrease in bond yields will typically increase plan liabilities and vice-versa, although this will be offset partially by an increase in the value of bonds held in the asset portfolios of the various plans.
The effect of changes in bond yields is more pronounced in unfunded schemes where there is no potential for an offsetting movement in asset values.
Inflation risk: As UK and some European pension obligations are linked to inflation, higher inflation expectations will lead to higher liabilities, although caps are in place to protect against unusually high levels of inflation.
The UK asset portfolio includes some inflation linked bonds to provide an element of protection against this risk, whilst additional protection is provided by inflation derivatives.
Member longevity: As the Groups post-employment obligations are generally to provide benefits for the life of the member, increases in life expectancy will generally result in an increase in plan liabilities and vice-versa.
