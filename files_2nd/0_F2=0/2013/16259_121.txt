Until October 2012, under two US Dollar cross currency interest rate swap contracts totalling $166.7m, the Group paid annual interest of 6.336% and received annual interest of 6.5% on 100m.
These hedges were assessed to be highly effective at 31 December 2013 and 2012 with the ineffective portion of the hedging contracts transferred to financing expense Note 5.4.
Fair value hedges 2013 2012 m m Interest rate swaps derivative financial assets 11.4 22.9 Interest rate swaps at 31 December 2013 and 2012 include floating rate swaps for 150m matched against 150m of the 250m 6.5% Sterling bonds due 2016 and $100m matched against $100m of the $350m 5.75% Dollar bonds due 2020.
Under these swaps the Group receives 6.50% and 5.75% respectively to match the bond coupons and pays six-month Sterling LIBOR plus 2.90% and six-month US LIBOR plus an average of 2.63% respectively.
The interest rate swaps are used to increase the Groups exposure to interest rates to maintain a balance of fixed and floating interest rate cost.
The hedges were assessed to be highly effective at 31 December 2013 and 2012 with the ineffective portions of the hedging contracts included in financing expense.
Until 3 October 2012 there were also floating rate swaps in place for a further $50m matched against $50m of the $350m Dollar bonds due 2020.
The terms were the same as above.
On 3 October 2012, the Group ceased fair value hedge accounting for this $50m portion of the bond, resulting in an exceptional financing gain of 4.0m Note 5.4.
5.6 Fair values and fair value hierarchy Valuation techniques Valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.
The fair values of interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts are measured using discounted cash flows.
Future cash flows are based on forward interest exchange rates from observable yield curves forward exchange rates at the end of the reporting period and contract interest rates, discounted at a rate that reflects the credit risk of the counterparties.
The fair values of put options over non-controlling interests including exercise price and contingent and deferred consideration on acquisitions are measured using discounted cash flows models with inputs derived from the projected financial performance in relation to the specific contingent consideration criteria for each acquisition, as no observable market data is available.
The terms of instruments granted during 2013 and 2012 are detailed in Note 6.1.
The fair values are most sensitive to the projected financial performance of each acquisition: management makes a best estimate of these projections at each financial reporting date and regularly assesses a range of reasonably possible alternatives for those inputs and determines their impact on the total fair value.
An increase of 20% to the projected financial performance used in the put option measurements would increase the aggregate liability by 3.9m.
The fair value of the contingent and deferred consideration on acquisitions is not significantly sensitive to a reasonable change in the forecast performance.

Fair value hierarchy The fair value measurements at the reporting date are classified according to the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
The level in the hierarchy within which the fair value is categorised is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: i nputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly e. g. prices or indirectly e. g. derived from prices.
Level 3: inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data.
For financial assets and financial liabilities that are recognised at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between Levels in the hierarchy by reassessing categorisation based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole at the end of each reporting period.
During the reporting periods ended 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012, there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements, and no transfers into and out of Level 3 measurements.
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.
