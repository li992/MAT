Notes to the financial statements 1 Segmental analysis IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be determined based on the Groups internal reporting to the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
The CODM has been determined to be the Companys Board members as they are primarily responsible for the allocation of resources to segments and the assessment of performance of the segments.
The CODM uses trading profit, as reviewed at monthly business review meetings, as the key measure of the segments results as it reflects the segments underlying trading performance for the period under evaluation.
Trading profit is a consistent measure within the Group and the reporting of this measure at the monthly business review meetings, which are organised according to the product types, has been used to identify and determine the Groups operating segments.
Trading profit is defined as profit on operations before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangible assets, but includes the Group share of post-tax results of associates.
The Groups operating segments at 31 March 2013 were Cheese, Spreads, MH Foods, Dairies, Share of Associates and Other.
Certain of these operating segments have been aggregated and the Group reports on five continuing segments within the business: Cheese, Spreads, Dairies, Share of Associates and Other.
At 31 March 2012 St Hubert was an operating segment which was aggregated into the Spreads segment.
St Hubert was sold in August 2012 and therefore St Hubert has now been disclosed as a Discontinued Operation for 2012 and 2013.
In years up to 2011, the Liquid Products and Customer Direct segments were aggregated into one reportable segment being Dairies.
During the year ended 31 March 2012, these two businesses were merged with one senior management team responsible for the whole of the Dairies segment.
Since the restructuring, discrete financial information for the former Liquid Products and Customer Direct divisions is no longer available or reviewed by either the Dairies senior management team or the CODM in the past, segment information was based on allocations of the combined cost base which is not now necessary.
The Dairies segment principally comprises the sale of non-branded fresh milk in the UK to a number of customers including major retail, foodservice and residential customers.
The segment is managed on a combined basis including milk sourcing, production volumes, demand planning, technical, quality and distribution.
The factories process and pack milk for a mix of customers which varies depending on customer and demand mix.
Having considered these factors, management has judged that this business now comprises one operating segment under IFRS 8.
The Spreads segment incorporates the MH Foods business acquired in June 2011.
This business is branded, has similar end-customers as Spreads and shares the same input cost risks.
Therefore management judges that this meets the IFRS 8 aggregation criteria.
Furthermore, its revenue, result and assets do not represent more than 10% of the Group so the quantitative criteria for a reportable segment are not met.
The Cheese segment has not been aggregated with any other segment.
This business manufactures predominantly branded cheese in the UK and sells mainly to retail customers.
Share of Associates forms a separate segment whose results are reviewed on a post-tax basis.
The Other segment comprises revenue earned from distributing product for third parties and certain central costs net of recharges to the operating segments.
Generally, all central costs less external other revenue are recharged to the operating segments such that their result reflects the total cost base of the Group.
Other segment profit therefore is nil.

Group treasury is centrally managed and external interest income and expense is all incurred in the UK following the sale of St Hubert and is not allocated to segments.
Where interest is reviewed by the CODM it is done so on a net basis.
Further analysis of the Group interest expense is provided in Note 5.
Tax costs are not included in the measure of segment profit reviewed by the CODM.
Tax is centrally managed and the group effective tax rate, not individual segment tax rates, is reported.
Segment assets comprise property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets, inventories, receivables, assets in disposal group held for sale and investments in associates and joint ventures using the equity method and deferred consideration but exclude cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial assets and deferred tax assets as these items are managed on a Group basis.
Other segment assets comprise certain property, plant and equipment that is not reported in the segments.
Total segment liabilities have not been presented as this measure is not regularly reviewed by or provided to the CODM.
Inter-segment revenue comprises the sale of finished Cheese and Spreads products to the Dairies segment on a cost plus basis and is included in the segment result.
Other Inter-segment transactions principally comprise sales of cream from the Dairies segment to the Spreads segment for the manufacture of butters.
Cream sold into Spreads is priced by reference to external commodity markets and is adjusted regularly so as to reflect the costs that the Spreads segment would incur if it were a stand alone entity.
Revenue from Inter-segment cream sales is not reported as revenue to the CODM but as a reduction to the Dairies segments input costs.
Segment depreciation and amortisation excludes amortisation of acquired intangible assets of 0.4 million 2012: 0.8 million as these costs are not charged in the segment result.
Segment additions to non-current assets comprise additions to goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment through capital expenditure and acquisition of businesses.

indd 74 04 06 2013 06:06 Exceptional items in the year ended 31 March 2013 comprise: 9.2 million of costs associated with the rationalisation of administrative activities and other structural changes in the Dairies depot network.
This restructuring results in centralisation of back office activities supporting the depot network.
These costs relate to redundancies 7.4 million, incremental operating costs associated with delivery of the project 1.1 million and write downs of property, plant and equipment 0.7 million.
The project has now completed.
During the year the Group has closed two processing sites at Aintree in Liverpool and Fenstanton in Cambridgeshire.
The closure of the sites and resultant changes in the supply chain, volume requirements and customer channels has resulted in exceptional costs of 21.3 million.
These costs relate to redundancies 9.0 million, duplicate running costs 6.2 million, asset write downs 0.7 million and other costs 5.4 million including stock write offs and duplicate running costs.
In September 2012 the Group announced that it was to consult with employees on plans to consolidate spreads production into a single UK location at its site in Kirkby, Liverpool.
As a result of this consolidation the site at Crudgington, Shropshire will close in 2014.
Following the transfer of Clover manufacture to Kirkby in the first half of 2012, the Crudgington cash generating unit CGU does not generate material cash flows from the remaining site production.
Subsequent to this decision, value in use calculations have been prepared to 2014 rather than in perpetuity using a discount rate of 8.7%.
As a result we have impaired the carrying value of property, plant and equipment by 12.3 million.
This impairment has resulted in a carrying value of nil for plant and equipment and 1.0 million for land and buildings.
The relevant CGU for goodwill testing purposes is Spreads which encompases both the Crudgington and Kirkby sites.
This restructure will result in a more efficient Spreads supply chain and Spreads goodwill has not been impaired.
In addition to the impairment of property, plant and equipment, 1.5 million of costs were incurred during the year both to complete the transfer of Clover manufacture from Crudgington to Kirkby and to commence the project that will result in the closure of the Crudgington site.
In February 2013 the Group announced plans to reorganise the business into a single management and operational structure from 1 April 2013.
This is replacing the divisional structures that previously existed and will lead to a more efficient and simplified organisation.
This reorganisation has resulted in exceptional costs in the year ended 31 March 2013 of 3.5 million comprising predominantly redundancy costs.
Further costs will be incurred in 2013 14 as the project is conmpleted.
In March 2013 the Group gave notice to the holders of its 2007 private placement loan notes that it would repay 100 million of principal in April 2013.
The costs of early repayment have been accrued at 31 March 2013 as the Group was irrevocably committed to the repayment at that date.
Costs of 8.7 million predominantly comprise make whole penalties which are calculated based on the discounted future coupons between repayment date and original note maturity.
Exceptional items in the year ended 31 March 2012 comprised: 5.3 million of costs associated with the rationalisation of administrative activities and other structural changes in the Dairies depot network.
This restructuring resulted in centralisation of back office activities supporting the depot network.
The majority of costs related to redundancies 2.2 million and other incremental operating costs associated with delivery of the project 3.1 million.
Trading in the Dairies segment was was adversely impacted in 2011 12 by increased costs of milk, the ongoing level of competition in the sector and in the second half by significant falls in the value of cream.
Furthermore, volume declines in doorstep deliveries continued despite the growth of our milk&more business.
A range of actions was taken in order to restore margins within Dairies to an acceptable level in the medium term and create a cost-efficient, sustainable dairies business.
These included the expected closure of sites referred to below subject to consultation.
However, the outlook for Dairies was weaker and more uncertain than it was in 2011.
This, combined with the volatility of assumptions in forecasting future cash flows due to the commoditised nature of the business and the competitive environment, led management to conclude that the total carrying amount of Dairies goodwill of 70.7 million should be impaired as it could not be supported on a value in use basis.
This impairment reduced the carrying value of goodwill in this segment to nil.
Further details are provided in Note 11.
Furthermore, the Group has announced a major restructuring of its Dairies operations with the expected closure of two processing sites at Aintree in Liverpool and Fenstanton in Cambridgeshire subject to consultation.
These closures were expected to be completed in 2012 13.
As a result of the anticipated closures, the carrying value of property, plant and equipment at these sites could no longer be supported by a value in use calculation based upon future cash flows generated by these assets.
Consequently, the carrying value of property, plant and equipment was impaired by 9.8 million at 31 March 2012.
Further details are provided in Note 10.
In addition, an impairment of 0.4 million was recorded against intangible assets see Note 12 and 0.8 million of inventories of engineering spares and packaging were written off see Note 15.
At 31 March 2012, following the impairments of goodwill, property, plant and equipment and intangibles, there remained property, plant and equipment and intangibles with a carrying value of 161.6 million in the Dairies segment.
On 13 February 2012, the Group announced that a customer, Quadra Foods Limited Quadra had gone into administration.
As a result a bad debt provision of 4.3 million was charged representing the entire amount owing from this customer.
Bad debt write-offs of this size are extremely rare and management considered this a one-off incident which, due to its material size, has been classified as exceptional.
The Group previously purchased fresh milk from Farmright Limited Farmright, a member of the same group as Quadra, which also went into administration.
In the opinion of management, set-off arrangements were agreed and in place between Dairy Crest Limited and Quadra Farmright at the date of them going into administration, however this is being challenged in the administration process.
Under IFRS, the recognition criterion threshold for a contingent asset is higher than that required for a contingent liability and therefore, although a provision has been recorded against amounts due from Quadra, no exceptional gain was recognised in the year ended 31 March 2012 in relation to amounts owed to Farmright as the outcome was not yet virtually certain.

indd 75 04 06 2013 06:06 The numbers Notes to the financial statements continued 4 Exceptional items continued On 17 May 2011, the Group announced that, subject to a consultation process, production of its leading dairy spread brand, Clover, would be consolidated into its site in Kirkby, Liverpool.
The Clover manufacturing process was split between Kirkby, Liverpool and Crudgington, Shropshire.
This consolidation would result in approximately 90 redundancies at Crudgington and the creation of approximately 45 jobs at Kirkby.
The consolidation would be completed in 2012 13, however exceptional costs of 2.6 million were incurred in the year ending 31 March 2012.
These predominantly comprised redundancy costs 1.2 million and the impairment of property, plant and equipment impacted by the restructured operations 1.0 million.
This impairment reduced the carrying value of equipment made redundant by this processing change to managements best estimate of its fair value less costs to sell see Note 10.
In addition, inventories of engineering spares of 0.2 million were written off see Note 15 and other project costs of 0.2 million were incurred.

The UK corporation tax rate reduced to 23% from April 2013.
A further 2% reduction was proposed in the December 2012 Autumn Statement, taking the rate to 21% by April 2014.
An additional 1% reduction was then proposed in the March 2013 Budget, taking the rate to 20% by April 2015.
At the balance sheet date, only the 23% rate had been substantively enacted and therefore it is only the impact of this reduction that has been reflected in the Groups financial statements as at 31 March 2013.
We estimate the effect of the reduction in the tax rate to 20% to be a reduction in the deferred tax liability of 2.2 million.
The effect on the Group of the further proposed reductions in the UK corporation tax rate will be reflected in the Groups financial statements in future years, as appropriate, once the proposals have been substantively enacted.

Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing the profit loss from continuing operations by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
Note that in the circumstances where there is a basic loss per share, share options are anti-dilutive and therefore are not included in the calculation of diluted losses per share.
The shares held by the Dairy Crest Employees Share Ownership Plan Trust ESOP are excluded from the weighted average number of shares in issue used in the calculation of earnings and diluted earnings per share.
To show earnings per share on a consistent basis, which in the Directors opinion reflects the ongoing performance of the business more appropriately, adjusted earnings per share has been calculated.

2012 13 Following the decision in 2011 to transfer all Clover manufacture from Crudgington, Shropshire to Kirkby, Liverpool, in September 2012 the Group announced plans to consolidate all spreads production into a single UK location at its site in Kirkby.
Subject to consultation, this decision will result in the closure of the site at Crudgington in 2014.
As a result of this decision 11.4 million of plant and equipment at the sites have been impaired to nil net book value representing managements best estimate of resale value net of costs of sale.
In addition, the land and buildings at Crudgington were impaired by 0.9 million.
The culmination of the centralisation of administrative activity in the Dairies depot network along with the closures of milk processing sites at Fenstanton, Cambridgeshire and Aintree, Liverpool resulted in impairments of 0.5 million to land and buildings and 0.9 million to plant and equipment.
The carrying value of property, plant and equipment within each cash generating unit CGU is reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
With regard to the Dairies CGU, goodwill was fully impaired Dairy Crest Annual Report 2013 81 The numbers Notes to the financial statements continued 10 Property, plant and equipment continued in 2011 12 however given the low margins in this business and large movements in milk input costs during 2012 13, the carrying value of property, plant and equipment within this CGU has been reviewed along with its value in use.
The impairment methodology and key inputs are as set out in Note 11.
The discount rate applied to the value in use calculation was 8.7% and cash flows are forecast to year five with no growth assumed thereafter.
The impairment review has not indicated any required write down of the carrying value of property, plant and equipment in the year ended 31 March 2013, however management believes that there are changes in key assumptions that could result in impairments.
The key assumptions are discount rates and margins.
A 1.0% increase in the discount rate applied, with all other assumptions unchanged, would result in a carrying amount equal to value in use.
A margin of 2% versus the assumption of 2.5% in perpetuity from year five with all other assumptions unchanged, would result in a carrying value equal to value in use.
2011 12 Following the decision to close, subject to consultation, two Dairies processing sites at Fenstanton, Cambridgeshire and Aintree, Liverpool in 2012 13, the assets within these cash generating units and other assets in the Dairies supply chain were reviewed for evidence of impairment.
The carrying value of property, plant and equipment at these sites and certain plant and equipment at our site in Foston, Derbyshire could no longer be supported by value in use and an impairment was recorded to reduce the carrying value to managements best estimate of fair value less costs to sell.
Land and buildings at Aintree and Fenstanton were impaired by 2.1 million resulting in a carrying value of 4.5 million reflecting the best estimate of resale value of these sites, both of which were owned.
Plant and equipment at Aintree, Fenstanton and Foston were impaired by 7.7 million resulting in a carrying value of 0.2 million reflecting the best estimate of resale value less costs of sale or disposal at that time.
All of these impairments were recorded as exceptional items in the Dairies segment see Note 4.
At 31 March 2012, there remained property, plant and equipment with a carrying value of 142.1 million in the Dairies segment after these impairments.
Following the decision in 2011 to transfer all Clover manufacture from Crudgington, Shropshire to Kirkby, Liverpool certain assets at Kirkby became obsolete as future plans for the utilisation of these assets had changed.
Obsolete assets with a carrying value of 1.0 million were identified and these assets were impaired to nil value reflecting managements best view as to their fair value less costs of removal and sale.
This impairment was recorded as an exceptional item in the Spreads segment see Note 4.

At March 2012 goodwill in relation to the Dairies CGU was fully impaired and the carrying value of goodwill for this CGU at 31 March 2013 is nil.
All groups of CGUs with goodwill are tested for impairment annually by comparing the carrying amount of that CGU with its recoverable amount.
Recoverable amount is determined based on a value-in-use calculation using cash flow projections based on financial budgets and strategic plans approved by senior management covering a three-year period and appropriate growth rates beyond that other than for Dairies where a five-year period was forecast with appropriate growth rates beyond that.
The discount rate applied to the projections is 8.7% for Spreads, MH Foods and Cheese 2012: 8.4% and Dairies 9.4%.

indd 82 04 06 2013 17:46 11 Goodwill continued Discount rates are pre-tax and calculated by reference to average industry gearing levels, the cost of debt and the cost of equity based on the capital asset pricing model and CGU-specific risk factors.
Discount rates have not changed significantly since March 2012.
The growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the three-year period for Spreads, MH Foods and Cheese is 2.0% per annum being the estimated UK long-term growth rate adjusted for industry growth rates and extrapolation risks 2012: 2.0% per annum beyond year three.
The growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond a five-year period for the Dairies CGU was 0% at March 2012 with cash flows in the first five years being based on extended strategic plans for that business.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to groups of CGUs at 31 March 2013 is: Dairies Nil 2012: nil MH Foods 6.7 million 2012: 6.7 million Spreads 65.5 million 2012: 65.5 million St Hubert n a 2012: 185.7 million Cheese 2.1 million 2012: 2.1 million Gross margin budgeted gross margins are based initially on actual margins achieved in the preceding year further adjusted for projected input and output price changes, volume changes, initiatives implemented and associated efficiency improvements.
The budgeted margins form the basis for strategic plans, which incorporate longer-term market trends.
Discount rates reflect managements estimate of the risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital for each CGU.
Raw materials prices budgets are prepared using the most up to date price and forecast price data available.
This is based on forward prices in the market place adjusted for any contracted prices at the time of forecast.
The key resources are milk, vegetable oils, fuel oil, diesel, gas and electricity and packaging costs.
Growth rate estimates for periods beyond the length of the strategic plans, growth estimates are based upon published industry research adjusted downwards to reflect the risk of extrapolating growth beyond a three year time frame.
For the residential business, long-term rates of market decline as seen over recent years have been extrapolated forward offset by growth assumptions for milk&more, FRijj and the liquid milk business.
The Directors consider the assumptions used to be consistent with the historical performance of each CGU where appropriate and to be realistically achievable in the light of economic and industry measures and forecasts.
2012 13 Sensitivity to changes in assumptions With regard to the assessment of value in use of the UK Spreads, MH Foods and Cheese CGUs, management believes that no reasonably possible change in the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of those units to exceed their recoverable amount.
2011 12 Dairies CGU impairment of goodwill Dairies margins were impacted in 2011 12 by a number of factors including higher input costs, falling realisations for cream a by-product of milk production, the ongoing decline of residential sales and high levels of competition in the sector.
Furthermore, weak UK consumer demand and a very competitive landscape had adversely impacted the Groups expectations regarding the speed of recovery in future Dairies margins.
In 2011 we highlighted that changes in key assumptions could cause the carrying value of the then Liquid Products and Customer Direct CGUs to exceed their recoverable amount.
As described in Note 4, management has taken action to close certain sites in order to underpin factory utilisation and improve operating efficiencies.
This combined with other activities will, in the opinion of management, restore margins to an acceptable level in the medium term.
However, the outlook is significantly weaker than it was in 2011 and margin recovery will take longer than previously anticipated.
Given the inherent uncertainties of cash flow forecasts in what is a predominantly commodity business in a competitive sector especially given the sensitivity of low absolute margins, management has concluded that it is appropriate to fully impair the carrying amount of Dairies goodwill as there is no assurance that it can be supported on a value in use basis, excluding the impact of restructuring activities.
Therefore, management has concluded that it is appropriate to fully impair the carrying value of Dairies goodwill resulting in an exceptional charge of 70.7 million recorded in the year ended 31 March 2012.
After fully impairing goodwill and impairing certain other property, plant, equipment and intangible assets, the remaining carrying value of these items at 31 March 2012 was 161.6 million.
As goodwill has been fully impaired, there is no headroom and any future adverse change in key assumptions would lead to further impairment against these assets.
There are changes in key assumptions in the calculation of Dairies CGU value in use that could result in further impairments.
The key assumptions are discount rates and annual cash flows.
A 1% increase in the discount rate applied, with all other assumptions unchanged, would result in a further impairment of approximately 20 million.
A reduction in cash flows of 2 million per annum in perpetuity, representing approximately 2% margin, with all other assumptions unchanged, would result in a further impairment of 22 million.
Other CGUs Sensitivity to changes in assumptions With regard to the assessment of value in use of the UK Spreads, St Hubert, MH Foods and Cheese CGUs, management believes that no reasonably possible change in the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed its recoverable amount.

Following the sale of 50% of the ordinary shares of WCL in June 2010, the Group equity accounts for a 20% shareholding in that company.
The Group holds a further 10% of the issued share capital of WCL however, due to the existence of fixed-price put and call options in relation to this additional holding, it is considered deferred consideration and is not equity accounted.

The WCL options comprise call and put options over 20% of the company for a price of 3.6 million adjusted for 20% of WCLs post-tax profits losses from June 2010 until the date of exercise.
This comprises a Level 3 valuation, namely that it is not based on inputs observable directly or indirectly.
Management has valued this option by comparing the current equity accounted carrying value of the 20% holding with the estimated present value of consideration received from the exercise of the option.
The difference between these amounts comprises the option value of 1.6 million at 31 March 2013.
The principal input assumptions in valuing these options are i estimated future profits of WCL which have been based upon best available budgets and forecasts ii an appropriate post-tax discount rate of 6% and iii an option exercise date of 2018.
Over the period until exercise of these options, any movement in the fair value of these instruments is charged credited to the income statement.
There has been no material movement in the fair value of the WCL options between recognition in June 2010 and 31 March 2013.

In March 2013, the Group gave irrevocable notice to holders of the loan notes maturing in 2014 and 2017, that 72% of the principal plus any make whole penalties would be repaid in April 2013.
Those notes repaid in April have therefore been classified as current liabilities at 31 March 2013, along with any cross currency swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges against those notes.
Furthermore, in March 2013, 0.3 million of unamortised debt issuance costs were written off representing approximately one sixth of the unamortised amount.
This write down resulted from a proportionate reduction in the revolving credit facility that was completed in April 2013.
On 12 October 2011, the Group entered into a new five year revolving credit facility of 170 million plus 150 million with a syndicate of five banks.
The existing 100 million and 85 million plus 175 million revolving credit facilities maturing in November 2011 and July 2013 respectively were cancelled and repaid on 19 October 2011 using funds drawn under the new facility.
Upfront debt issuance costs amounted to 3.0 million and these are charged to the consolidated income statement over four years being the expected life of the new facility before it is replaced.
Unamortised debt issuance costs at 31 March 2013 amounted to 1.8 million 2012: 2.7 million of which 0.6 million 2012: 0.7 million will amortise within 12 months.
The Group raised $85 million 54.5 million by way of a debt private placement with US investors on 30 November 2011.
These notes were a mix of seven-year $25 million and ten-year $60 million maturities.
All principal and interest cash flows have been swapped into Sterling at an exchange rate of 1.56 and interest rates of 3.87% and 4.52% on the seven and ten year notes respectively.
The Group is subject to a number of covenants in relation to its borrowing facilities which, if contravened, would result in its loans becoming immediately repayable.
These covenants specify a maximum net debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.5 times, and minimum interest cover ratio of 3.0 times.
No covenants were contravened in the year ended 31 March 2013 2012: None.
Key covenants under the 2011 revolving credit facility and debt private placement were unchanged from existing covenants.
Details of the Groups interest rate management strategy and interest rate swaps are included in notes 30 and 31.

indd 90 04 06 2013 17:54 20 Retirement benefit obligations The Group has one defined benefit pension scheme in the UK which was closed to future service accrual from 1 April 2010.
This pension scheme is a final salary scheme that had previously been closed to new employees joining after 30 June 2006.
Employees joining after this date and those members of the defined benefit pension scheme on its closure to future service accrual were invited to join the Dairy Crest Group defined contribution plan.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the Dairy Crest Group Pension Fund was carried out as at 31 March 2010 by the funds independent actuary using the projected unit credit method.
Full actuarial valuations are carried out triennially.
This valuation resulted in a deficit of 137 million compared to the IAS19 deficit of 142.4 million reported at that date.
The next full actuarial valuation will be carried out in 2013 14 on the 31 March 2013 position.
The following tables summarise the components of net benefit expense recognised in the consolidated income statement and the funded status and amounts recognised in the consolidated balance sheet for the defined benefit pension scheme.

The level of cash contributions will continue at this level until March 2018 based on the latest schedule of contributions which was signed in June 2011.
However a new schedule of contributions will be agreed with the Trustee following the next full actuarial review at 31 March 2013.
The 20 million per annum amount includes 2.8 million per annum of rental payments for land and buildings that are subject to a sale and leaseback agreement between the Group and the scheme as part of the final schedule of contributions.
The land and buildings included in these arrangements are subject to long term leases and the Group will continue to benefit from substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership.
On this basis, under IFRS, these land and buildings continue to be recognised in property, plant and equipment and rental payments of 2.8 million per annum are treated as cash contributions, reflecting the substance of the arrangements.

indd 91 04 06 2013 17:55 The numbers Notes to the financial statements continued 20 Retirement benefit obligations continued The Group is entitled to any surplus on winding up of the pension scheme albeit refunds are subject to tax deductions of 35% at source.
Based on the present value of committed cash contributions at 31 March 2013 and the IAS 19 valuation at that date of 56.3 million, 10.9 million would be deducted from any notional surplus returned to the Group and this has been recognised as an additional liability in accordance with IFRIC 14.
However, it should be noted that cash contributions are determined by reference to the triennial actuarial valuation, not the IAS 19 valuation.
The actuarial deficit is greater than that recognised under IAS 19 since liabilities are discounted at gilt yields rather than high quality corporate bond yields.
In December 2008, certain obligations relating to retired members were hedged by the purchase of an insurance contract.
A further insurance contract for retired members was purchased in June 2009 resulting in coverage for all members who retired up to August 2008.
These contracts are included within scheme assets and their value will always be equal to the obligation as calculated under IAS 19 for those members covered.
The purchase of the second insurance contract in June 2009 was funded by the sale of equities.
Subsequently, in order to re-establish an appropriate equity weighting of scheme assets, the Fund purchased equity total return swaps synthetic equity.
These instruments comprise an asset leg and a liability leg.
The asset leg generates a return based on UK and overseas equity indices and the liability leg incurs a cost based on LIBOR plus margin.
Credit risk is minimised since collateral is provided by the counterparties to the benefit of the Fund when the instruments are in the money.
At 31 March 2013, the valuation of the above comprises a positive equity exposure of 276.8 million and a negative LIBOR exposure of 233.9 million 2012: equity exposure of 226.4 million and LIBOR exposure of 164.6 million.
An Enhanced Transfer Value ETV exercise took place during the year ended 31 March 2012 which resulted in approximately 220 members transferring a total of 14.3 million in ETVs out of the Fund.
The net gain as a result of this settlement of 0.3 million represents the difference between the 14.3 million transferred out and the corresponding liabilities, measured on an IAS 19 basis, at the date that the settlement became binding.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates with the exception of the insured retirement obligations which equal the IAS 19 valuation of obligations which they cover.
The Group will adopt amendments to IAS 19R in the year ending March 2014.
These amendments will result in the return on assets being calculated by reference to the discount rate assumption and not return assumptions for individual asset classes.
Had IAS 19R been adopted in the year ended 31 March 2013, the expected return on scheme assets in the table above would have amounted to 38.0 million, resulting in an overall net cost of 3.5 million being charged to the consolidated income statement.
Under the revised IAS 19, the net pension liability of 56.3 million would be unchanged.
Furthermore under changes to IAS 19, future scheme administrative expenses will be charged as operating costs in the consolidated income statement.
Had this been effective for the year ended 31 March 2013, the Group would have charged 0.7 million to operating costs.
The average duration of scheme liabilities is approximately 18 years 2012: 19 years.
Discount rate assumptions for each reporting period are based upon quoted AA-rated corporate bond indices, excluding collateralised bonds, with maturities matching the Schemes expected benefit payments.
The RPI inflation assumptions are determined by adopting a yield curve approach, based on the break-even rate of inflation implied by fixed interest gilt yields and index-linked yields.
Applying this approach to the Schemes projected benefit payments gives an average break-even inflation assumption of 3.5% 2012: 3.4%.
The CPI inflation assumption is determined by reference to adjusted RPI rather than by reference to CPI-linked investments where the market is small and illiquid.
The principal differences between RPI and CPI are i the formula effect due to RPI using arithmetic means and CPI geometric means, and ii the bundles of goods considered CPI excludes mortgage payments and other housing costs.
The assumption used at 31 March 2013 is that CPI inflation will track 1.0% points below RPI inflation in the long term 2012: 1% and is therefore set at 2.5% 2012: 2.4%.
Pension increase assumptions are based on RPI with an adjustment to reflect caps within the Scheme rules.
Mortality assumptions were updated in the year ended 31 March 2011 based on analysis of the membership data performed as part of the March 2010 full actuarial valuation.
The result was an increase in life expectancy assumptions of approximately 1.7 years.
Broadly the same mortality input assumptions have been used for March 2012 and 2013 with no material resultant change in life expectancies.
The Scheme deficit is highly dependent upon these input assumptions which are set at the reporting period end dates.
A 0.1% decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase the Scheme obligation by approximately 19 million 2012: 17 million.
A 0.1% increase in the inflation assumption would increase the Scheme obligation by approximately 14 million 2012: 16 million.
An increase in life expectancy across all members of one year would increase the scheme obligation by approximately 37 million 2012: 43 million.

The directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on transition to IFRS, and taken directly to equity of 93.2 million, is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of those pension schemes.
Consequently, the directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group statement of other recognised income and expense before 1 April 2004.

The Dairy Crest Long Term Incentive Share Plan LTISP This is a long-term incentive scheme under which awards are made to directors and senior managers consisting of the right to acquire shares for a nominal price subject to the achievement of financial targets based on i total shareholder return TSR over a three year period versus comparator companies and ii growth in adjusted basic earnings per share.
From 2009, the TSR element was increased from 50% to 60% of the awards granted.
The vesting period for grants made under this scheme is 3 years with an exercise period of 7 years.
In June and July 2012, a total of 1,094,734 options was granted under the LTISP scheme July 2011: 995,183.
There are no cash settlement alternatives.
Dairy Crest Sharesave Scheme All employees are eligible to join the Dairy Crest Sharesave Scheme, which allows employees to use regular monthly savings to purchase shares.
Options are granted at a discount of up to 20% of the market value of the shares.
No financial performance criteria are attached to these options and they vest three years from the date of grant with an exercise period of six months.
On 14 December 2012 2,390,456 options were granted under the Dairy Crest Sharesave Scheme at a grant price of 281 pence December 2011: 1,145,978 options at a grant price of 265 pence.
Deferred bonus scheme From 2005 06, bonuses earned that are in excess of 50% of basic salary are deferred in shares and from 2011 in share options with a vesting period of three years.
The only vesting condition is continuing employment.
The cost of these shares is charged over four years being the year the bonus was earned and the three-year vesting period and is based on the number of shares issued or from 2011 over which nil cost options are granted and the share price at the date of issue.
No deferred shares were awarded or issued in relation to the year ended 31 March 2013 2012: nil.

The key assumptions used in the valuation model for the December 2012 grant were: Expected share price volatility 22% December 2011: 38%, risk free rate of interest 0.5% December 2011: 0.5% and dividend yield 5.22% December 2011: 6.2%.
The volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of the Dairy Crest Group plc share price over a period commensurate with the expected option life, ending on the grant date of the option.
The LTISP has market and non-market based performance conditions.
The fair value of the market performance element of the LTISP awards is calculated using a Monte Carlo option pricing model.
The fair value factor for the award made in July 2012 is 65% for the TSR element and 100% for the EPS element July 2011: 65% TSR and 100% EPS giving a fair value of 2.75 per option granted 2011: 2.91.
The share price on granting 2012 awards was 3.34 2011: 3.68.
The non-market performance element of the LTISP is based on EPS and the charge for this is the value of shares expected to vest calculated by reference to the share price at the date of grant.
Volatility assumptions are made for Dairy Crest Group plc and comparator companies based on historical volatility of share prices over a period commensurate with the option life.
The input assumptions for the LTISP grant in the year ended 31 March 2013 were as follows: Term 3 years 2012: 3 years Volatility 23% 2012: 40% Risk free rate 0.4% 2012: 1.3% Average volatility of comparator TSR 36% 2012: 44% TSR correlation Dairy Crest vs comparators 22% 2012: 22% The expected life of the LTISP options is assumed to be equal to the vesting period, being three years.
The Group expense arising from share option plans for the year ended 31 March 2013 is 1.9 million 2012: 2.4 million See Note 9.

29 Business combinations and disposals Year ended 31 March 2013 Disposal of Discontinued Operation Following a strategic review of the Groups overseas operations in the light of the inability to undertake synergistic acquisitions, on 28 August 2012 the Group completed the disposal of St Hubert SAS St Hubert for a cash consideration of 341.1 million 430.5 million.
St Hubert formed part of the Spreads reportable segment.
Cash held in the disposed business at that date amounted to 4.1 million, resulting in a net cash inflow to the Group of 337.0 million.
This amount has been reduced by fees of 6.2 million.
The disposal resulted in a post-tax profit of 47.7 million which can be analysed as follows: m m Sales proceeds cash consideration 341.1 Book value of assets disposed of: Property, plant and equipment 10.3 Goodwill 176.4 Intangible assets 131.5 Inventories 3.3 Trade and other receivables 14.9 Cash and short-term deposits 4.1 Trade and other payables 18.4 Current tax 5.5 Deferred tax 44.5 272.1 Gain on disposal before fees and recycling of exchange differences 69.0 Fees 6.2 Amounts reclassified to profit and loss 11.4 Pre-tax gain on disposal 51.4 Expected tax charge 3.7 Post-tax gain on disposal of Discontinued Operation 47.7 The expected tax charge principally comprises capital gains taxes resulting from the disposal as well as expected taxation on 74million of dividends paid in the period up to the date of disposal.
These taxes were crystallised as a result of the divestment and as a consequence the breaking of the St Hubert tax group.
An estimate has been made of the likely tax costs resulting from these transactions however the final assessment has yet to be agreed with the French tax authorities which may result in a change to the level of tax provisioning.

The fair value of the net assets acquired was 0.3 million, comprising property, plant and equipment of 0.5 million less statutory and other liabilities taken over of 0.2 million, resulting in goodwill on acquisition of nil.
During the year ended 31 March 2013, the Group acquired 7% of the share capital of HIECO Limited for a consideration of 0.3 million.
Year ended 31 March 2012 Acquisition On 30 June 2011, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Morehands Limited trading as MH Foods Limited, a manufacturer of branded low calorie spray oils and salad dressings.
Initial cash consideration was 11.9 million, with further consideration of 1.6 million paid in October 2011.
The final fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the business at the date of acquisition was: Fair value Book to Group value m m Property, plant and equipment 0.5 0.5 Intangible asset Frylight brand 6.0 Inventories 0.6 0.6 Receivables 1.5 1.5 Cash 1.2 1.2 Payables 0.9 0.9 Current tax 0.5 0.5 Deferred tax 1.6 0.1 Net assets 6.8 2.3 Goodwill 6.7 13.5 Comprising: Cash consideration 13.5 100 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2013 29 Business combinations and disposals continued The Frylight brand is estimated to have a useful economic life of 15 years and the amount capitalised as an intangible asset and related deferred tax will be amortised over this period.
This life is consistent with the 1525 year useful economic lives assumed on the acquisition of St Hubert.
Goodwill, representing the cost of acquisition less net identifiable assets and liabilities assumed on acquisition, arises on consolidation only and there is no amortisation or related tax deduction in the accounts of Dairy Crest Limited, the acquiring entity.
Group reported revenue and result would not be materially different had the acquisition occurred on 1 April 2011.
Revenue and profit from the date of acquisition to 31 March 2012 were 5.8 million and 1.3 million respectively.
The Group incurred fees of 0.3 million in relation to this acquisition which have been charged to administrative expenses in the income statement in the year ended 31 March 2012.
Goodwill of 6.7 million comprises certain intangible benefits of the acquisition that could not be individually separated and reliably measured due to their nature.
These include the synergistic benefits resulting from access to the wider groups sales channels, marketing expertise and product development pipeline.
30 Financial risk management objectives and policies The objective of the treasury function, which is accountable to the Board, is to manage the Groups and Companys financial risk, secure cost-effective funding for the Groups operations and to minimise the effects of fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates on the value of the Groups and Companys financial assets and liabilities, on reported profitability and on cash flows.
The Groups principal financial instruments comprise bank loans and overdrafts, loan notes, finance leases and cash and short-term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions: principally cross currency swaps and forward currency contracts.
The purpose is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout 2012 and 2013, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, price risk and credit risk.
Information on how these risks arise is set out below, as are the objectives, policies and processes agreed by the Board for their management and the methods used to measure each risk.
Derivative instruments are used to change the economic characteristics of financial instruments in accordance with the Groups treasury policies.
The Groups accounting policies in relation to derivatives are set out in the Accounting Policies note.
Liquidity risk The Groups objectives are: to ensure that forecast peak net borrowings, plus a prudent operating headroom are covered by committed facilities which mature after at least 12 months: to ensure that prudent headroom versus bank and loan note covenant ratios are forecast for the next three years: to maintain flexibility of funding by employing diverse sources of funds eg use of non-bank markets such as private placements : and to avoid a concentration of facility maturities in any particular year.
The maturity analysis of Group borrowings is set out in Note 19.
At 31 March 2013 the Groups total credit facilities amounted to 627.3 million 2012: 640.5 million excluding finance leases of 5.5 million 2012: 7.2 million and the impact of cross-currency swaps on US Dollar and Euro loan notes of 17.8 million 2012: 8.6 million.
The facilities at 31 March 2013 and 2012 consisted of: March 2013 170 million plus 150 million multi-currency revolving credit facility repayable at maturity in October 2016: and loan notes totalling 330.4 million repayable between April 2013 and November 2021.
March 2012 170 million plus 150 million multi-currency revolving credit facility repayable at maturity in October 2016: and loan notes totalling 345.5 million repayable between April 2013 and November 2021.
Undrawn revolving credit facilities at 31 March 2013 amounted to 297 million 2012: 223.8 million.
Effective headroom including cash and short term deposits amounted to 573.1 million 2012: 303.2 million.
On 4 April 2013 60 million of loan notes matured and on 18 April 2013 100 million of loan notes were repaid early.
This reduced the loan notes outstanding to 170 million.
At the same time, the revolving credit facility was reduced by 60 million 51 million.
Therefore total facilities at 18 April 2013 amounted to 416 million.
The Group aims to mitigate liquidity risk by closely managing cash generation by its operating businesses and by monitoring performance to budgets and forecasts.
Capital investment is carefully controlled, with detailed authorisation limits in place up to Executive level and cash payback criteria considered as part of the investment appraisal process.
Short-term and long-term cash and debt forecasts are constantly reviewed and there are regular treasury updates to the Executive highlighting facility headroom and net debt performance.
Day-to-day cash management utilises undrawn revolving credit facilities, overdraft facilities and occasionally short-term money market deposits if there is excess cash.
Dairy Crest Annual Report 2013 101 The numbers Notes to the financial statements continued 30 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to the risk for changes in market interest rates relate primarily to the Groups long-term debt obligations with a floating interest rate.
The Groups policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt.
The Groups long-term strategy is to keep between one third and three quarters of its borrowings at fixed rates of interest in the medium term.
To manage this mix in a cost-efficient manner, the Group has issued fixed coupon loan notes and also enters into interest rate swaps from time to time on a portion of its floating bank borrowings, in which the Group agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount.
These swaps are designated to hedge underlying debt interest cash flow obligations.
In the short-term the proportion of fixed and floating rate borrowings can go outside the long-term range.
At 31 March 2013, 100% of the Groups borrowings were at a fixed rate of interest 2012: 83%.
The proportion of fixed interest borrowings is higher than our long-term target, however following the maturity and repayment of loan notes referred to above, amounts drawn under revolving credit facilities will increase in 2013 14 and the fixed rate percentage of borrowings will fall.
In the medium term we expect the fixed proportion of borrowings to return to the target range.
The Groups borrowing facilities require minimum interest cover of 3.0 times.
The Groups exposure to interest rate risk is shown by way of a sensitivity analysis in Note 31.
Foreign currency risk Following the sale of St Hubert SAS, the Group has no significant operations outside the UK.
However it buys and sells a small amount of goods in currencies other than Sterling.
As a result the value of the Groups non-Sterling revenues, purchases, assets, liabilities and cash flows can be affected by movements in exchange rates predominantly Euro Sterling.
When the Group owned St Hubert, a Euro-denominated subsidiary, it mitigated the effect of its structural currency exposures by borrowing to some extent in the same functional currency as the foreign operation into which it invested.
Our policy was to hedge 100% of the inventories and tangible fixed assets and 33% of goodwill and intangible assets exposure through borrowings and or cross-currency swaps in Euros.
At 31 March 2012, all borrowings designated as a net investment hedge were done so on a pre-tax basis and no cross currency swaps were utilised as part of the hedging relationship.
The majority of the Groups transactions are carried out in the relevant entitys functional currency and therefore transaction exposures are limited.
It can be seen in Note 16 that the only significant non-Sterling debtors are in Dollars.
The Group trades skimmed milk products and bulk butter mainly to customers in Europe and Central and South America.
The Group also exports its own skimmed milk products, bulk butter and other branded products.
The Groups policy requires foreign currency sales and purchases through Philpot Dairy Products Limited, a subsidiary company, to be hedged by foreign exchange contracts once the transaction is committed so that the margin on the transaction can be fixed.
Currency exposures on other transactions, such as certain capital expenditure denominated in a foreign currency, are hedged following approval of the project using forward foreign exchange contracts.
In 2006 and November 2011, the Group issued loan notes denominated in $US.
At the same time, cross-currency swaps were implemented to hedge the interest and principal repayment cash flows.
These have the effect of fixing the liability and coupon in Sterling.
The principal amount and interest and principal payment dates on these swaps match those on the loan notes exactly and all swaps are with counterparties with strong credit ratings.
There is no profit and loss exposure in relation to $US debts as any retranslation impact on the profit and loss account is offset by reclassification of amounts from other comprehensive income into profit and loss.
In 2009, the Group entered into cross-currency swaps on 75 million of its loan notes denominated in Euros in order to hedge the future interest and principal repayment cash flows.
This has the effect of fixing the liability and coupon on those notes in Sterling.
There is no profit and loss exposure in relation to this 75 million of debt as any retranslation impact on the profit and loss account is offset by reclassification of amounts from other comprehensive income into profit and loss.
Price risk The Group is exposed to price risk related to certain commodities and their by-products used by the Groups businesses.
The principal non-milk commodities that affect input prices for the Group are vegetable oils, gas, electricity, diesel, heavy fuel oil and crude oil by-products used in packaging.
The Group monitors prices on an ongoing basis in order to assess the impact that movements have on profitability and to assess whether the amount of forward cover is appropriate.
This includes vegetable oil contracts and energy, which is generally contracted one season in advance for both Summer and Winter energy but with some requirement contracted at more regular intervals.
The Group regularly reviews relevant commodity markets and levels of future cover.
Fixed price contracts are only entered into with the approval of the Commodity Risk Committee comprising senior operational and finance management and external advisers.
102 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2013 30 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Credit risk It is the Groups policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
The Group only offers these terms to recognised, creditworthy third parties.
In addition, receivables balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Groups history of bad debt losses is not significant.
In the year ended 31 March 2012 one customer, Quadra Foods Limited, went into administration and the outstanding balance of 4.3 million was fully provided.
The Dairies doorstep business trades with individuals and receives cash payments on a weekly basis.
Cash and debt management is a crucial part of this business and cash collection and balances due are closely monitored to ensure write-downs are minimised.
Debtor days outstanding are closely monitored throughout the year and action is taken promptly when payment terms are breached.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade and other debtors excludes prepayments and certain derivative instruments, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty.
The maximum exposure for the Group is equal to the carrying amount of these financial assets of 395.5 million 2012: 223.5 million.
Following the sale of St Hubert the Group had significant cash deposits and until those funds were utilised to repay loan notes and provide one-off funding to the pension scheme in April 2013, no one financial institution had deposits in excess of 60 million and all institutions holding deposits were required to be rated A or above.
All borrowings are through banks with long-term credit ratings of A or above.
Funds temporarily surplus to business requirements are invested overnight through deposit accounts with mainstream UK commercial banks with a credit rating of A or better.
The Group currently has no requirement to place deposits for a longer period, accordingly counterparty risk is considered to be acceptable.
Derivative financial instruments are contracted with a range of banks with long-term credit ratings of A or above to avoid excessive concentration of financial instruments with one counterparty.
Capital management The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure that it maintains an appropriate level of gearing in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
In addition, the Group monitors its forecast net debt to EBITDA ratios in order that they are comfortably within its banking covenant requirements.
The maximum net debt to EBITDA ratio for the purposes of bank covenants is 3.5 times.
At 31 March 2013 the ratio of net debt to EBITDA was 0.6 times March 2012: 2.2 times.
The Group monitors its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions or changes in Group structure.
Possible mechanisms for changing capital structure include adjusting the level of dividends, issuance of new shares or returning capital to shareholders.
No significant changes in capital structure have been implemented in the year ended 31 March 2013 or 2012.
The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by shareholders funds.
The analysis of net debt is included in Note 33.
The gearing ratio at March 2013 and 2012 can be analysed as follows: 2013 2012 m m Net debt 59.7 336.4 Shareholders funds 307.4 274.3 Gearing ratio 19% 123% Dividends Details of dividends paid and proposed during the year are given in Note 7.
The dividend policy following the sale of St Hubert is to maintain a progressive dividend whilst seeking to maintain a level of dividend cover between 1.5 and 2.5 times.
The final proposed dividend for 2012 13 is 15.0 pence up 0.3 pence from last year 2012: 14.7 pence.
Total dividends paid and proposed in respect of the year ended 31 March 2013 amount to 20.7 pence 2012: 20.4 pence.

Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is repriced at intervals of less than one year.
Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
Interest rate risk The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings.
There is no impact on the Groups equity resulting from movements in interest rates other than in relation to the $US GBP and EUR GBP cross-currency swaps used as a cash flow hedge on $US and EUR loan notes.
The impact on equity is nil over the life of the instruments as these swaps comprise an effective hedge.
At 31 March 2013 100% of Group borrowings were at fixed rates of interest 2012: 83% see Note 30.
The sensitivity analysis excludes all non-derivative fixed rate financial instruments carried at amortised cost but includes non-derivative floating rate financial instruments except those where interest rate swaps have been used as cash flow hedges.
This is due to the fact that gains and losses on the hedging instrument offset losses and gains on the non-derivative floating rate financial instrument which are subject to the hedge and are matched in both profit and loss and cash terms.
No non-derivative fixed rate financial instruments have profit and loss exposure due to floating rates as a result of interest rate swaps.

These cross currency swaps have both legs at fixed interest rates, are designated as cash flow hedges and meet the criteria for hedge accounting.
The gain deferred in equity will reverse in the income statement finance costs during the next one to nine years being the life of the swaps.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding EUR GBP cross currency swap contracts at 31 March 2013 was 75.0 million 67.0 million 2012: 75.0 million, 67.0 million.
At 31 March 2013 and 2012 the fixed interest rates varied from 4.955% to 5.180%.
The loss deferred in equity will reverse in the income statement finance costs during the next year being the life of the swaps.
Hedge of net investment in foreign entities Until 28 August 2012, the Group had Euro denominated borrowings which it designated as a hedge of the net asset investment in St Hubert SAS, its subsidiary in France.
The fair value of the Euro borrowings at 31 March 2012 was 124.2 million.
A foreign exchange gain of 6.0 million 2012: 7.7 million on translation of the borrowings into Sterling to 28 August 2012 has been recognised in other comprehensive income.
Forward currency contracts The Group has entered into certain forward currency contracts in order to hedge the Sterling cost of currency-denominated future purchases and receipts.
These forward currency purchases have been designated cash flow hedges and meet the criteria for hedge accounting.
They all have a duration of less than one year and any gains or losses deferred will then be reclassified to the income statement operating costs.
Borrowing facilities The Group has undrawn committed long-term borrowing facilities available at 31 March 2013 of 297 million 2012: 223.8 million in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date.
In April 2013, 51 million of the facilities were cancelled see Note 34.
Undrawn facilities expire in October 2016.

There is no impact on the Companys equity resulting from movements in interest rates other than in relation to the $US GBP and EUR GBP cross-currency swaps used as a cash flow hedge on $US and EUR loan notes.

This is due to the fact that gains and losses on the hedging instrument offset losses and gains on the non-derivative floating rate financial instrument which are subject to the hedge are matched in both profit and loss and cash terms.
The 2013 analysis below reflects lower reasonably possible changes in interest rates to 2012 upside LIBOR expectations assumed last year were not realised and the assumption is that base rates will increase less than anticipated at March 2012.
