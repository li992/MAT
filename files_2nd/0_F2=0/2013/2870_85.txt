Details of the schemes are as follows: Deferred Annual Bonus Plan This scheme is applicable to Executive Directors and Divisional Executive Directors.
Under this scheme awards are made annually consisting of Deferred Shares, which are linked to the payout under the Annual Bonus Scheme details of which are contained in the Directors remuneration report on pages 78 to 92 and Matching Shares.
The value of Deferred Shares is determined by the payout under the Annual Bonus Scheme: half of the annual bonus is paid in cash and the remainder is compulsorily deferred on a gross basis into Deferred Shares.
Directors have the option to defer up to 100% of their annual bonus into Deferred Shares.
The Deferred Shares are held for a period of 3 years from the date of award during which they are not forfeitable, except in the case of dismissal for gross misconduct.
A conditional award of Matching Shares is made at the same time as the award of Deferred Shares.
Participants will be eligible to receive up to 2 Matching Shares for every Deferred Share.
Prior to 2010 Matching Shares will vest after the 3 year holding period to the extent to which performance conditions have been met.
33.3% of the Matching Shares will vest if growth in the Companys earnings per share EPS is equal to growth in the UK Retail Price Index RPI plus 6% per annum, rising on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting if growth in the Companys EPS is equal to or greater than growth in the RPI plus 16% per annum.
The performance condition attached to the awards may be amended by the Remuneration Committee, a sub-committee of the Group Board, from time to time, subject to the new condition being no less demanding than the original condition.
The vesting conditions for matching awards made in 2010 were such that 33% of the Matching Shares will vest if growth in the Companys earnings per share EPS is equal to growth in the UK Retail Price Index RPI plus 4% per annum, rising on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting if growth in the Companys EPS is equal to or greater than growth in the RPI plus 14% per annum.

An award will not vest if Capitas average share price at the date of vesting is below the average share price at the date of grant.
This scheme is open to all senior employees and shares will vest according to performance criteria.
The number of shares which will vest is dependent upon the Companys EPS growth exceeding RPI growth by 4% and on banding within the scheme.
