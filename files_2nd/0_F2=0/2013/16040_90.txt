Deferred consideration payable totalling 38.7m included in trade and other payables is included in financial liabilities designated as fair value through profit and loss.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
The Group has considered the impact of credit risk on its financial instruments and because the counterparties are banks with a high credit rating considers its impact to be immaterial.
c. Fair value of financial instruments The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows: Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates Interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs There were no transfers between levels during the year.

Interest risk management The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates.
The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, by the use of interest rate swap contracts and forward interest rate contracts.
Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with interest rate views and defined risk appetite, ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied, by either positioning the balance sheet or protecting interest expense through different interest rate cycles.
Interest rate swap contracts The Group adopts a policy of ensuring that its exposure to changes in interest rates on borrowings is on either a fixed rate basis or is subject to movements within pre-defined limits.
To achieve its desired interest rate profile the Group uses interest rate swap contracts.
Contracts with notional values of 50m are designated as cash flow hedges with fixed interest payments at an average rate of 1.71% for periods up until may 2014 and have floating interest receipts equal to 1 month LIBOR.
During the period the cash flow hedges were 100% effective in hedging the exposure to interest rate movements.
Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating interest rate amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the fair value of issued fixed rate debt held and the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate debt held.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.
At 31 December 2013 the fair value of interest rate derivatives, all of which terminate before one year from the balance sheet date, to which the Group and the Company were parties was estimated at 0.3 m 2012: 3.1 m. This amount is based on market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
Interest rate swaps are designated and effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value thereof has been deferred in equity.
A credit of 1.9m 2012: 1.3m in respect of the fair value movement on interest rate swaps with a call option has been taken to the income statement through net finance charges, as the Group has not applied hedge accounting.
The non-amortising interest rate swap with a call option matured on 3 October 2013.
The following table details the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges at the reporting date: Cash flow hedges outstanding receive floating pay fixed contracts Average contract Notional principal fixed interest rate amount Fair value 2013 2012 2013 2012 2013 2012 % % m m m m Under 1 year 1.71 - 50.0 - 0.3 - 1 to 2 years - 1.71 - 125.0 - 1.2 50.0 125.0 0.3 1.2 The interest rate swaps settle on a monthly basis.
The floating rate on the interest rate swaps is 1 month LIBOR.
The Group will settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis.
All current interest rate swap contracts, which exchange floating rate interest amounts for fixed rate interest amounts are designated as cash flow hedges in order to reduce the Groups cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on borrowings.
The interest rate swaps and the interest rate payments on the loan occur simultaneously and the amount deferred in equity is recognised in the income statement over the period that the floating rate interest payments on debt affect profit or loss.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 24.
Financial instruments continued 126 e. Cross currency swaps and currency forward contracts In order to eliminate the currency risk associated with the $200m unsecured senior notes the Group and Company has two cross currency swaps of 23m and 29m to fix the exchange rate at 1 equal to $1.73 for the entire lives of $90m of the unsecured loan notes.
The forward options fixed the notional amount receivable and payable in respect of the unsecured senior notes to 52m as well as fixing the exchange rate applicable to future coupon payments.
The two currency swaps convert the borrowing rates on US$50m and US$40m of debt from 5.89% to a variable rate based on six month LIBOR plus basis point increment of 86.5 and 86.7 respectively.
The currency swaps settle on a halfyearly basis.
The Group will settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest on a gross basis.
Currency swap contracts exchanging fixed rate interest for floating rate interest are designated and effective as fair value hedges in respect of interest rates.
During the period, the hedge was 100% effective in hedging the fair value exposure to interest movements and as a result, the carrying amount of the loan was adjusted by 3.5m 2012: 14.4m, which was included in the income statement at the same time that the fair value of the interest rate swap was also included in the income statement.
The following table details the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of currency swap contracts accounted for as fair value hedges as at the reporting date: Fair value hedges outstanding receive fixed pay floating contracts Average contract floating interest rate Notional principal amount Fair value 2013 2012 2013 2012 2013 2012 % % m m m m Less than 1 year - 1.9% - 115.6 - 12.7 2 to 5 years 1.4% 1.9% 52.0 52.0 9.3 12.8 52.0 167.6 9.3 25.5 The Group and the Company have three currency forward contracts with a notional value of $30m each and one with a notional value of 20m to hedge $110m of unsecured senior notes.
These contracts have a maturity date of January 2016.
At 31 December 2013 the fair value of these forward contracts was estimated at 4.5 m 2012: 3.7 m. These contracts are designated cash flow hedges.
The Group acquires goods for sale from overseas, which when not denominated in sterling are paid for principally in US dollars.
The Group has entered into forward foreign exchange contracts all of which are less than one year in duration to buy US dollars to hedge the exchange risk arising from these anticipated future purchases.
At the balance sheet date the total notional value of contracts to which the Group was committed was US$83.0m 2012: US$120.3m.
The fair value of these derivatives is 1.5 m 2012: 0.7 m. These contracts are not designated cash flow hedges and accordingly the fair value movement has been reflected in the income statement.
During 2010 the Group and Company novated one cross currency interest rate swap with a notional value of $110m and a sterling equivalent of 63m for total proceeds of 13.7m in the Group and 16.3m in the Company.
The proceeds are being amortised to the income statement over the remaining life of the unsecured senior notes with the total credit to income statement being 1.0m 2012: 1.0m.
f. Liquidity analysis The following table details the Groups liquidity analysis for its derivative financial instruments and other financial liabilities.
The table has been drawn up based on the undiscounted net cash flows on the derivative instrument that settle on a net basis and the undiscounted gross flows on those derivatives that require gross settlement.
When the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to the projected interest and foreign currency rates as illustrated by the yield curves existing at the reporting date.
