The Finance Act 2012 enacted a reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 24% to 23% with effect from April 2013.
On 20 March 2013 the UK Government announced that the corporation tax rate will further reduce to 20% from April 2015, in addition to the planned reduction to 21% by April 2014 previously announced in the December 2012 Autumn Statement.
Other than the enacted change to 23%, the effects of the announced changes are not reflected in these financial statements as they were either substantively enacted after the balance sheet date or they have not yet been enacted and, in each case, the impact has not yet been estimated.
