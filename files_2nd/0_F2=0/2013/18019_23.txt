This 451,000 sq ft 31 storey office building is adjacent to the Groups EC1 & EC2 interests and benefits from an index linked lease to the Metropolitan Police Authority until 2019.
The partnership contributed revenues of 2.4 million during the period between exchange in May and completion in August, of which 1.2 million is disclosed as being attributable to non-controlling interests.
A net profit of 1.0 million was attributable to non-controlling interests during this time.
Had the acquisition occurred on 1 January 2013 the Groups revenue and the net profit would have been 3.1 million and 7.9 million higher respectively.
The net profit amount includes revaluation gains recognised on exchange of contracts.
On the date control was acquired, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of the business combination were fair valued with resulting gains or losses being taken to the Groups income statement.
No deferred tax was recognised on this date because the tax base of the underlying asset was equal to its fair value.
The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed by the business combination were as follows: m Non-current assets 117.0 Current assets 2.8 Current liabilities 75.9 Net assets acquired 43.9 Completion of the acquisition occurred on 1 August 2013.
Consideration for the net assets acquired, including the non-controlling interest share of profits, was 45 million.

The Empress State Limited Partnership is now consolidated as a subsidiary of the Group.
A&P Bolding Limited On 5 September 2013 the Lillie Square joint venture acquired 100 per cent of the share capital of A&P Bolding Limited for the purpose of obtaining a number of properties situated adjacent to the joint ventures land interest at Lillie Square.
The Groups share of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by the business combination, which represents the consideration paid, was as follows: m Current assets 7.4 Current liabilities 0.1 Net assets acquired 7.3 Had the acquisition occurred on 1 January 2013, there would have been no material impact on either the Groups revenue or profit.
13 DISCONTINUED OPERATION On 29 April 2013, the Group exchanged contracts for the disposal of the final asset, Park Crescent West, in The Great Capital Partnership GCP.
This was effected as part of the Groups strategy to dispose of non-core assets in support of the Groups core estates and, as a result, the partnership has been presented as a discontinued operation with comparatives re-presented accordingly.
GCP was established as a joint venture in 2007 with Great Portland Estates plc, to own, manage and develop a number of central London properties.
The partnership has been accounted for as a joint venture of the Group and has been proportionately consolidated in accordance with the Groups published accounting policy.
The Groups share of results and residual net assets of GCP which have been included in the income statement and balance sheet, were as follows: 2013 2012 Summarised income statement m m Revenue 1.2 5.9 Net rental income 1.2 5.4 Gain on revaluation and sale of investment and development property 2.8 23.0 Administration expenses 0.2 0.1 Operating profit 3.8 28.5 Net finance costs 1.7 Profit before tax 3.8 26.8 Taxation 0.9 2.5 Profit for the year from discontinued operation 4.7 29.3 102 Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2013 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 13 DISCONTINUED OPERATION CONTINUED 2013 2012 Summarised balance sheet m m Investment and development property 48.4 Deferred tax 0.3 Other current assets 0.3 3.7 1 Partners loans 93.0 96.5 Current liabilities 7.1 Net assets 93.6 141.5 1 Eliminates on consolidation.
A profit of 2.8 million 2012: 15.8 million arose on disposal of the assets of GCP, being the proceeds of disposal less the carrying amount of the assets.

This gain is unrealised and relates to assets held at the end of the year.
2 In respect of the transfer value of Earls Court Properties, further details are disclosed in note 7.
3 The value of trading property carried at net realisable value was 39.1 million at 31 December 2013 2012: 1.8 million.
4 Included within investment and development property is 0.8 million 2012: 2.6 million of interest capitalised during the year on developments in progress.
5 The unrecognised revaluation surplus on trading property is shown for informational purposes only and is not a requirement of IFRS.
Trading property continues to be measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value in the consolidated financial statements.
At 31 December 2013, the Group was contractually committed to 105.9 million 2012: 21.4 million of future expenditure for the purchase, construction, development and enhancement of investment, development and trading property.
Refer to note 35 for further information on capital commitments.
The fair value of the Groups investment, development and trading property as at 31 December 2013 was determined by independent, appropriately qualified external valuers Jones Lang LaSalle for Earls Court Properties excluding the Empress State Building and Venues: and CB Richard Ellis for the remainder of the Groups investment, development and trading property.
The valuations conform to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS Valuation Professional Standards.
Fees paid to valuers are based on fixed price contracts.
Each year the Investment Director, on behalf of the Board, appoints the external valuers.
The valuers are selected based upon their knowledge, independence and reputation for valuing assets such as those held by the Group.
Valuations are performed bi-annually and are performed consistently across all properties in the Groups portfolio.
At each reporting date appropriately qualified employees of the Group verify all significant inputs and review computational outputs.
Valuers submit and present summary reports to the Groups Audit Committee, with the Investment Director reporting to the Board on the outcome of each valuation round.
Valuations take into account tenure, lease terms and structural condition.
The inputs underlying the valuations include market rent or business profitability, likely incentives offered to tenants, forecast growth rates, yields, EBITDA, discount rates, construction costs including any site specific costs for example section 106, professional fees, planning fees, developers profit including contingencies, planning and construction timelines, lease regear costs, planning risk and sales prices based on known market transactions for similar properties or properties similar to those contemplated for development are considered.
Valuations are based on what is determined to be the highest and best use.
When considering the highest and best use a valuer will consider, on a property by property basis, its actual and potential uses which are physically, legally and financially viable.
Where the highest and best use differs from the existing use, the valuer will consider the cost and the likelihood of achieving and implementing this change in arriving at its valuation.
A number of the Groups properties have been valued on the basis of their development potential which differs from their existing use.
Most notably, within Earls Court Properties the Groups interests at EC1 & EC2 have been valued on the basis of a mixed use, residential led scheme.
The properties are currently used as exhibition venues, generating an income stream for the Group, while the process to achieve the change in use is being implemented.
Within the Covent Garden segment, where appropriate, a number of properties have been valued on the basis of their development potential, principally for the conversion of existing use to residential use or for improving the configuration of retail units.
In respect of development valuations, the valuer ordinarily considers the gross development value of the completed scheme based upon assumptions of capital and rental values and yields of the properties which would be created through the implementation of the development.
Deductions are then made for anticipated costs, including an allowance for developers profit before arriving at a valuation.
The valuer has applied this methodology to derive a residual land valuation of the Groups interests at EC1 & EC2 on the basis of a standalone development of these interests.
There are often restrictions on both freehold and leasehold property which could have a material impact on the realisation of these assets.
The most significant of these occur when planning permission or lease extension and renegotiation of use are required as is the case currently regarding the Empress State Building and EC1 & EC2 respectively or when a credit facility is in place.
These restrictions are factored into the propertys valuation by the external valuer.
Also see disclosures surrounding development risks on page 15. www.
com 107 Notes to the accounts continued 18 PROPERTY PORTFOLIO CONTINUED Non-financial assets carried at fair value, as is the case for investment, development and trading property held by the Group, are required to be analysed by level depending on the valuation method adopted.
The different valuation levels are defined as: Level 1: valuation based on quoted market prices traded in active markets.
Level 2: valuation based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that maximise the use of observable data either directly or from market prices or indirectly derived from market prices.
Level 3: where one or more inputs to valuation are not based on observable market data.
All investment, development and trading properties held by the Group are classified as Level 3.
When the degree of subjectivity or nature of the measurement inputs changes, consideration is given as to whether a transfer between fair value levels is deemed to have occurred.
Unobservable data becoming observable market data would determine a transfer between Level 3 and Level 2.
The following tables set out the valuation techniques used in the determination of fair values on a property by property basis, as well as the key unobservable inputs used in the valuation models.

The fair values of financial assets and liabilities have been established using the market value, where available.
For those instruments without a market value, a discounted cash flow approach has been used.
The maturity profile of gross debt excluding finance leases is as follows: Group Group 2013 2012 m m Wholly repayable within one year 16.0 77.9 Wholly repayable in more than one year but not more than two years 11.0 Wholly repayable in more than two years but not more than five years 343.4 266.3 Wholly repayable in more than five years 370.4 344.2 Certain borrowing agreements contain financial and other conditions that, if contravened, could alter the repayment profile.

Certain leases provide for payment of contingent rent, usually a proportion of net rental income, in addition to the minimum lease payments above.
Finance lease liabilities are effectively secured obligations, as the rights to the leased asset revert to the lessor in the event of default.
com 113 Notes to the accounts continued 29 OPERATING LEASES The Group earns rental income by leasing its investment properties to tenants under operating leases.
In the United Kingdom standard commercial leases vary considerably between markets and locations but typically are for a term of five to 15 years at market rent with provisions to review every five years.
The future minimum lease amounts receivable under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: Group Group 2013 2012 m m Not later than one year 54.3 56.1 Later than one year and not later than five years 174.9 175.1 Later than five years 128.3 151.8 357.5 383.0 The consolidated income statement includes 0.3 million 2012: 0.1 million recognised in respect of expected increased rent resulting from outstanding reviews where the actual rent will only be determined on settlement of the rent review.
The future minimum lease amounts payable under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: Group Group 2013 2012 m m Not later than one year 0.5 0.5 Later than one year and not later than five years 0.2 0.7 0.7 1.2 30 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Group is exposed to a variety of risks arising from the Groups operations: market risk including interest rate risk, and market price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The majority of the Groups financial risk management is carried out by Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
The policies for managing each of these risks and the principal effects of these policies on the results for the year are summarised below.
Market risk a Interest rate risk Interest rate risk comprises both cash flow and fair value risks.
Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.
Fair value risk is the risk that the fair value of financial instruments will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates.
The Groups interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at variable rates that expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, whereas borrowings issued at fixed interest rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
Bank debt is typically at floating rates linked to LIBOR.
It is Group policy, and often a requirement of our lenders, to eliminate substantially all short and medium-term exposure to interest rate fluctuations in order to establish certainty over medium-term cash flows by using fixed interest rate derivatives.
Swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating to fixed rates.
Interest rate collars protect the Group by capping the maximum interest rate paid at the collars ceiling but sacrifices the profitability of interest rate falls below a certain floor.
Interest rate swaptions provide the Group with the right but not the obligation to enter into an interest rate swap on a specific future date at a set rate.
The table below shows the effects of derivative contracts that are linked to the drawn borrowings profile of the Group: Fixed Floating Fixed Floating 2013 2013 2012 2012 m m m m Borrowings 3.8 370.4 3.8 344.2 Derivative impact nominal value of derivative contracts 370.4 370.4 344.2 344.2 Borrowings profile net of derivative impact 374.2 348.0 Interest rate protection 100% 100.0% Group policy is to ensure that interest rate protection on Group external debt is within the range of 75 per cent to 100 per cent.
The weighted average rate of interest rate swaps currently effective is 3.2 per cent 2012: 3.6 per cent.
114 Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2013 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 30 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED The approximate impact of a 50 basis point shift upwards in the level of interest rates would have a positive impact on the movement in fair value of derivative financial instruments recognised in the consolidated income statement of 6.2 million 2012: 9.8 million.
The approximate impact of a 50 basis point shift downwards in the level of interest rates would have a negative impact on the movement in fair value of derivative financial instruments recognised in the consolidated income statement of 6.2 million 2012: 9.8 million.
In practice, a parallel shift in the yield curve is highly unlikely.
However, the sensitivity analysis above is a reasonable illustration of the possible effect from the changes in slope and shifts in the yield curve that may actually occur and represents managements assessment of possible changes in interest rates.
Because the fixed rate derivative financial instruments are matched by short-term floating rate debt, such a movement would have a very limited effect on Group cash flow overall.
b Foreign exchange risk The Group does not have significant foreign exchange exposure.
c Market price risk The financial results are subject to movements in the value of underlying investment and development properties, interest rates and economic sentiment.
A one per cent increase in the valuation of investment and development property would increase the valuation of investment and development property in the consolidated income statement by 20.5 million.
A one per cent decrease in the valuation of investment and development property would decrease the gain on revaluation of investment and development property in the consolidated income statement by 20.5 million.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is managed to ensure that the Group is able to meet future payment obligations when financial liabilities fall due.
Liquidity analysis is intended to provide sufficient headroom to meet the Groups operational requirements and investment commitments.
The Groups treasury policy also includes maintaining adequate cash, as well as maintaining adequate committed facilities.
A key factor in ensuring existing facilities remain available to the Group is the borrowing entitys ability to meet the relevant facilitys financial covenants.
The Group has a process to monitor regularly both current and projected compliance with the financial covenants.
The Groups policy is to seek to minimise its exposure to liquidity risk by managing its exposure to interest rate risk and to refinancing risk.
The Group seeks to borrow for as long as possible at the lowest cost.
The Group regularly reviews the maturity profile of its financial liabilities and will seek to avoid concentrations of maturities through the regular replacement of facilities and by staggering maturity dates.
Refinancing risk may be reduced by reborrowing prior to the contracted maturity date, effectively switching liquidity risk for market risk.
This is subject to credit facilities being available at the time of the desired refinancing.
The tables below set out the maturity analysis of the Groups financial liabilities based on the undiscounted contractual obligations to make payments of interest and to repay principal.
Where interest payment obligations are based on a floating rate the rates used are those implied by the par yield curve.

Contractual maturities reflect the expected maturities of financial instruments.
com 115 Notes to the accounts continued 30 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a tenant or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract.
Credit risk arises primarily from trade receivables relating to tenants but also from the Groups undrawn commitments and holdings of assets such as cash deposits and loans with financial counterparties.
Credit risk associated with trade receivables is actively managed: tenants are managed individually by asset managers, who continuously monitor and work with tenants, anticipating and wherever possible identifying and addressing risks prior to default.
Prospective tenants are assessed through an internally conducted review process, by obtaining credit ratings and reviewing financial information.
As a result, deposits or guarantees may be obtained.
The amount of deposits held as collateral at 31 December 2013 is 4.2 million 2012: 3.1 million.
Due to the nature of tenants being managed individually by asset managers, it is the Groups policy to calculate any impairment specifically on each contract.
In relation to the Groups exhibition income, receivables greater than 90 days are provided for in full.
Additionally, specific provisions are made for trade receivables less than 90 days where active credit control highlights recoverability concerns.
The amounts of trade receivables presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
The ageing analysis of these trade receivables, past due but not impaired, is as follows: Group Group 2013 2012 m m Up to 90 days 5.5 8.4 Over 90 days 0.3 0.4 Trade receivables 5.8 8.8 In 2013 there was an impairment write back on trade receivables of 0.1 million 2012: 0.1 million.
This is considered to be an immaterial amount and within budgeted levels given current economic conditions.
Also included within receivables are 6.0 million 2012: 4.0 million of loan notes.
All loan notes have been reviewed for potential impairment and the carrying values at year end are deemed to be recoverable.
The credit risk relating to cash, deposits and derivative financial instruments is actively managed by Group Treasury.
Relationships are maintained with a number of Tier 1 institutional counterparties, ensuring compliance with Group policy relating to limits on the credit ratings of counterparties between BBB and AAA.
Excessive credit risk concentration is avoided through adhering to authorised limits for all counterparties.

Capital structure The Group seeks to enhance shareholder value both by investing in the business so as to improve the return on investment and by managing the capital structure.
The Group uses a mix of equity, debt and financial instruments and aims to access both debt and equity capital markets with maximum efficiency and flexibility.
The key ratios used to monitor the capital structure of the Group are the debt to assets ratio and the interest cover ratio.
The Group aims not to exceed an underlying debt to asset ratio of more than 40 per cent and to maintain interest cover above 125 per cent.
These are discussed in the financial review on pages 36 to 41.

Fair value estimation The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value by valuation method.
The different levels are defined as follows: Level 1: valuation based on quoted market prices traded in active markets.
Level 2: valuation based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that maximise the use of observable data either directly from market prices or indirectly derived from market prices.
Valuations at this level are more subjective and therefore more closely managed, including sensitivity analysis of inputs to valuation models.
Such testing has not indicated that any material difference would arise due to a change in input variables.
When the degree of subjectivity or nature of the measurement inputs change, consideration is given as to whether a transfer between fair value levels is deemed to have occurred.

The fair values of derivative financial instruments are determined from observable market prices or estimated using appropriate yield curves at 31 December each year by discounting the future contractual cash flows to the net present values.

2 Unrealised losses are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income until realised.
All of the Groups Level 3 financial instruments are unlisted equity investments.
The valuation of the available-for-sale investment is based on expected cash distributions to be received from China Harvest Fund 1 with reference to the market value of the underlying assets held.
31 DEFERRED TAX PROVISION The decreases in corporation tax rate referred to in Note 14 have been substantively enacted for the purposes of IAS 12 Income Taxes and therefore have been reflected in these consolidated financial statements based on the expected timing of the realisation of deferred tax.
Deferred tax on investment and development property is calculated under IAS 12 provisions on a disposals basis by reference to the properties original tax base cost.
Elements factored into the calculation include indexation relief, the Groups holding structure and the application of the REIT provisions to disposals occurring 2 years or more post exit 7 May 2012.
The Groups recognised deferred tax liability on investment and development property as calculated under IAS 12 is 3.1 million as at 31 December 2013 2012: 1.8 million.
The Groups contingent tax liability which is calculated on the same basis as the IAS 12 liability above is nil 2012: nil after allowing for loss relief.
A disposal of the Groups trading property at their market value as per note 18 would result in a corporation tax charge to the Group of 16.1 million 23.3 per cent of 69.2 million.

Full details of the rights and obligations attached to the ordinary shares are contained in the Companys Articles of Association.
These rights include an entitlement to receive the Companys Annual Report & Accounts, to attend and speak at General Meetings of the Company, to appoint proxies and to exercise voting rights.
Holders of ordinary shares may also receive dividends and may receive a share of the Companys residual assets on liquidation.
There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares.
At 25 February 2014, the Company had an unexpired authority to repurchase shares up to a maximum of 76,269,635 shares with a nominal value of 18.8 million, and the Directors had an unexpired authority to allot up to a maximum of 500,165,021 shares with a nominal value of 125.0 million of which 249,277,385 with a nominal value of 62.4 million can only be allotted pursuant to a fully pre-emptive rights issue.

Of the 105.9 million committed, 29.5 million is committed 2014 expenditure.
The Groups share of joint venture commitments included within this amount was 1.9 million 2012: 0.2 million.
In November the Group exercised its option under the CLSA which it entered into with LBHF in January 2013 in relation to LBHFs land interest within the Earls Court Masterplan.
Under the terms of the CLSA, the Group can draw down land in phases but no phase can be transferred unless replacement homes for the residents of the relevant phase have been provided and vacant possession is given of the phase.
The Group has already paid 30 million of the 105 million cash consideration payable under the CLSA.
Independent of the land draw down process, exercising the option commits the Group to the payment of the residual 75 million which is yet to be paid.
This is expected to be settled in five annual instalments of 15 million starting on 31 December 2015.
36 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Under the terms of the CLSA the Group has certain compensation obligations relating to achieving vacant possession, which are subject to an overall cap of 55 million.
Should any payments be made in respect of these obligations, they will be deducted from the total consideration payable to LBHF see note 35 Capital Commitments above.
In March, an agreement with Network Rail was signed to acquire a 999 year leasehold interest in the air rights above the West London Line where it runs within the ECOA.
Within the terms of the agreement, during the next 50 years the Group can exercise options for further 999 year leases over the remainder of the West London Line to allow for development within the Earls Court Masterplan.
Network Rail is entitled to further payments of 5.55 per cent of the residual land value which will be payable at the time of development or disposal of each phase of the Earls Court Masterplan.
In addition, the Group has certain obligations to Network Rail to make contributions to a sinking fund in respect of the maintenance of the existing platform above the West London Line which would be triggered by any future demolition of the Earls Court exhibition halls.
As at 31 December 2012 the Group had no contingent liabilities.

40 DIRECTORS EMOLUMENTS The details of individual Directors remuneration and pension benefits as set out in the tables contained in the Directors remuneration report on pages 62 to 81 form part of these financial statements.
41 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Group operates a number of share-based payment schemes relating to employee benefits and incentives.
All schemes are equity settled, as such the cost recognised relates to the fair value of equity instruments determined at the grant date of the instruments.
The expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on Group estimates of the number of shares that are expected to vest.
Reconciliations of movements in incentive schemes are given in the tables on pages 124 to 126.
Performance Share Plan Market value and nil cost options to subscribe for ordinary shares and conditional awards of free shares may be awarded under the Capital & Counties Properties PLC Performance Share Plan PSP.
Exercise is subject to appropriately challenging performance conditions determined by the Remuneration Committee at the time of grant.
All awards are subject to performance conditions relating to: a the Groups Total Return TR over three consecutive financial years the TR Performance Period relative to the median of the TRs over the equivalent period of the Group, Intu Properties plc, Land Securities Group PLC, British Land Company plc, Hammerson plc, Segro plc, Derwent London plc, Great Portland Estates plc and Shaftesbury plc the Comparator Group : and b the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR over a period of three years the TSR Performance Period relative to the median of the TSRs over the same period of the Comparator Group.
One half of each award will be subject to the TR performance condition and the other half to the TSR performance condition.
TR is the growth in the adjusted, diluted net asset value per ordinary share plus dividends per ordinary share paid during the TR performance period.
In calculating TR for a company which is not a REIT, any provision for contingent capital gains tax will be added back.
TSR is the increase in the price of an ordinary share plus the value of any dividends paid during the TSR performance period re-invested in ordinary shares.
Full details of the performance criteria and vesting outcomes are set out on pages 65, 74 and 75.
In order for any awards to vest, the Committee must satisfy itself that TR and TSR performance figures are a genuine reflection of underlying financial performance and may exercise discretion when determining the proportion of an award that will vest.
com 123 Notes to the accounts continued 41 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED 1.
Performance Share Plan continued During any performance period, the Committee may, at its discretion, remove from the Comparator Group a company which has ceased to be quoted or to exist or the relevance of which as a comparator has, in the opinion of the Committee, significantly diminished.
The Committee may also, at its discretion, add to the Comparator Group whether to replace a removed member or otherwise if it believes that such addition will enhance the relevance of the Comparator Group.
The options have a vesting period of three years and a maximum contractual life of ten years.
In general, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
In 2011 a schedule to the PSP was approved by HMRC as a CSOP scheme: therefore the Company may make a proportion of awards as approved options.
Share options outstanding at 31 December 2013 were exercisable between nil pence and 268.1 pence and have a weighted average remaining contractual life of eight years and are exercisable between 2014 and 2023.
The total expense recognised in the income statement in respect of share options for the year ended 31 December 2013 was 1.7 million 2012: 1.8 million.

42 PENSIONS a Current pension arrangements Earls Court & Olympia group EC&O has a hybrid pension scheme comprising an ongoing money purchase section and a final salary section which closed to new members in 2006, and closed to future benefit accrual on 31 December 2011.
The final salary section is a funded defined benefit scheme the Scheme which is contracted out of State Second Pension.
The Groups current policy is largely to provide future retirement benefits through defined contribution arrangements.
The Scheme exposes the Group to a number of risks: 1.
Investment risk the Scheme holds investments in asset classes, such as equities, which have volatile market values and while these assets are expected to provide positive real returns over the long-term the short-term volatility can cause additional funding to be required if deficit emerges.
Interest rate risk the Schemes liabilities are assessed using market yields on high quality corporate bonds to discount the liabilities.
As the Scheme holds assets such as equities the value of the assets and liabilities may not move in the same way.
Inflation risk a significant proportion of the benefits under the Scheme are linked to inflation.
Although the Schemes assets are expected to provide a good hedge against inflation over the long term, movements over the short-term could lead to deficits emerging.
Mortality risk in the event that members live longer than assumed a deficit will emerge in the Scheme.

The expected return on assets is a weighted average of the assumed long-term returns for the various asset classes.
Equity and property returns are developed based on the selection of an appropriate risk premium above the risk free rate which is measured in accordance with the yield on government bonds.
Bond returns are selected by reference to the yields on government and corporate debt as appropriate to the Schemes holdings of these instruments.
The assets do not include any investment in shares of the Group.

As a result, a discount rate of 4.4 per cent has been applied as at 31 December 2013 2012: 4.1 per cent.
This is higher than the rate used in prior year given the changes to the yields on bonds over the current period.
Mortality assumptions are based on standard tables provided by the Institute of Actuaries using insurance company data updated from time to time to reflect current trends.
The standard table used by the Scheme in both the current and comparative periods is S1 PXA, CMI 150%, and Year of Birth.
The table makes allowance for future improvements in longevity based on the year of birth of each member.
2013 2012 The mortality assumptions used in this valuation were: Life expectancy at age 65 current age 45 : Male 89.9 89.0 Female 92.4 91.2 Life expectancy at age 65 current age 65 : Male 87.7 87.2 Female 90.1 89.3 www.
