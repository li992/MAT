Additional information 170 Alternative performance measures Introduction We assess the performance of the group using a variety of alternative performance measures.
We principally discuss the groups results on an adjusted basis.
The rationale for using adjusted measures is explained below.
Results on an adjusted basis are presented before specic items.
We also explain financial performance using measures that are not dened under IFRS and are therefore termed non-GAAP measures.
The non-GAAP measures we use are trend in underlying revenue excluding transit, and in underlying operating costs excluding transit, reported and adjusted EBITDA, reported and normalised free cash ow and net debt.
A reconciliation from these non-GAAP measures to the nearest measure prepared in accordance with IFRS is presented below.
The alternative performance measures we use may not be directly comparable with similarly titled measures used by other companies.
Specic items The groups income statement and segmental analysis separately identify trading results before specic items.
Specic items are those that in managements judgement need to be separately disclosed by virtue of their size, nature or incidence.
In determining whether an event or transaction is specic, management considers quantitative as well as qualitative factors such as the frequency or predictability of occurrence.
This is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and reported to the Board and the Operating Committee and assists in providing a meaningful analysis of the trading results of the group.
The directors believe that presentation of the groups results in this way is relevant to an understanding of the groups underlying financial performance.
Items which have been considered to be specic items by virtue of their size, nature or incidence include disposals of businesses and investments, regulatory settlements, historic insurance or litigation claims, business restructuring programmes, asset impairment charges, property rationalisation programmes, net interest on pensions and the settlement of multiple tax years in a single payment.
In 2008 09 BT Global Services contract and financial review charges were disclosed as a specic item by virtue of their size and nature.
The impact of subsequent changes to the contract and financial review charges from revisions in estimates and assumptions are included within trading results before specic items, and are separately disclosed if considered significant.
Specic items are disclosed in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.
Trends in underlying revenue and operating costs Underlying revenue and underlying operating costs are measures which seek to reect the underlying performance of the group that will contribute to long-term profitable growth.
As such they exclude the impact of acquisitions or disposals, foreign exchange movements and specic items.
We focus on the trends in underlying revenue and underlying operating costs excluding transit, as transit trafc is low-margin and is signicantly affected by reductions in mobile termination rates.
A reconciliation from the decrease in reported revenue and reported operating costs, the most directly comparable IFRS measures, to the decrease in underlying revenue and underlying operating costs excluding transit, is set out below.

EBITDA is dened as the group profit before depreciation, amortisation, net finance expense and taxation.
Adjusted EBITDA is dened as EBITDA before specic items.
EBITDA is a common measure used by investors and analysts to evaluate the operating financial performance of companies, particularly in the telecommunications sector.
We consider EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to be useful measures of our operating performance because they approximate the underlying operating cash ow by eliminating depreciation and amortisation.
EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not direct measures of our liquidity, which is shown by our cash ow statement, and need to be considered in the context of our financial commitments.
A reconciliation from group operating profit, the most directly comparable IFRS measure, to reported and adjusted group EBITDA, is set out below.
A reconciliation between operating profit and adjusted EBITDA for our lines of business is set out in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
2013 2012 2011 Year ended 31 March m m m Operating profit 2,986 2,919 2,578 Depreciation and amortisation 2,843 2,972 2,979 Reported EBITDA 5,829 5,891 5,557 Specic items 352 173 329 Adjusted EBITDA 6,181 6,064 5,886 Earnings per share We also measure financial performance based on adjusted earnings per share, which excludes specic items.

b Specic items are set out in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.
Free cash ow Normalised free cash ow is one of the groups key performance indicators by which our financial performance is measured.
Normalised free cash ow is dened as the net increase in cash and cash equivalents less: cash ows from nancing activities except net interest paid : the acquisition or disposal of group undertakings: the net sale of short-term investments and excluding: the cash impact of specic items: purchases of telecommunications licences: and the cash tax benefit of pension deficit payments.
For non-tax related items the adjustments are made on a pretax basis.
Normalised free cash ow is primarily a liquidity measure.
However, we also believe it is an important indicator of our overall operational performance as it reects the cash we generate from operations after capital expenditure and nancing costs, both of which are significant ongoing cash outows associated with investing in our infrastructure and nancing our operations.
In addition, normalised free cash ow excludes cash ows that are determined at a corporate level independently of ongoing trading operations such as dividends, share buybacks, acquisitions and disposals and repayment of debt.
Normalised free cash ow is not a measure of the funds that are available for distribution to shareholders.
Adjusted free cash ow was a key performance indicator until last year.
Certain of our historical incentive awards still use this as one of the performance criteria for vesting.
Adjusted free cash ow does not exclude purchases of telecommunications licences and the cash tax benefit of pension deficit payments.
Additional inf Additional information ormation Additional information 172 A reconciliation from net cash inow from operating activities, the most directly comparable IFRS measure, to reported, adjusted and normalised free cash ow, is set out below.
2013 2012 2011 Year ended 31 March m m m Net cash inow from operating activities 5,295 3,558 4,566 Add back pension deficit payment 325 2,000 1,030 Included in cash ows from investing activities Net capital expenditure before purchases of telecommunications licences 2,438 2,560 2,630 Purchases of telecommunications licences 202 Interest received 98 29 Dividends received from associates and joint ventures 3 4 7 Sales purchases of non-current financial assets 1 1 18 Included in cash ows from nancing activities Interest paid 701 693 973 Reported free cash ow 2,292 2,318 2,011 Net cash outow from specic items 366 204 212 Adjusted free cash ow 2,658 2,522 2,223 Add back: Purchases of telecommunications licences 202 Cash tax benefit of pension deficit payments 560 215 147 Normalised free cash ow 2,300 2,307 2,076 Net debt Net debt consists of loans and other borrowings both current and non-current, less current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents.
Loans and other borrowings are measured at the net proceeds raised, adjusted to amortise any discount over the term of the debt.
For the purpose of this measure, current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Currency denominated balances within net debt are translated to Sterling at swap rates where hedged.
This denition of net debt measures balances at the expected value of future undiscounted cash ows due to arise on maturity of financial instruments and removes the balance sheet adjustments made from the re-measurement of hedged risks under fair value hedges and the use of the effective interest method.
Net debt is a measure of the groups net indebtedness that provides an indicator of the overall balance sheet strength.
It is also a single measure that can be used to assess both the groups cash position and indebtedness.
There are material limitations in the use of alternative performance measures and the use of the term net debt does not necessarily mean that the cash included in the net debt calculation is available to settle the liabilities included in this measure.
Net debt is considered to be an alternative performance measure as it is not dened in IFRS.
The most directly comparable IFRS measure is the aggregate of loans and other borrowings current and non-current, current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents.
A reconciliation from this measure to net debt is given below.
2013 2012 At 31 March m m Loans and other borrowings 10,013 10,486 Less: Cash and cash equivalents 924 331 Current asset investments 531 513 8,558 9,642 Adjustments: To retranslate debt balances at swap rates where hedged by currency swaps 417 228 To remove accrued interest applied to reect the effective interest method and fair value adjustments 344 332 Net debt 7,797 9,082
