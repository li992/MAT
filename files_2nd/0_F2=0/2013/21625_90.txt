RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES As an investment trust, the Group invests in equities and other investments for the long term so as to achieve its investment objective as stated on page 7.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Group is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction in the Groups net assets or a reduction in the revenue available for distribution by way of dividends.
These financial risks, market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and market price risk, liquidity and credit risk, and the Directors approach to the management of them, are set out below.
The Investment Manager, in close co-operation with the Board of Directors, coordinates the Groups risk management.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing these risks are set out below and have not changed from the previous accounting period.
i Market risk The fair value or future cash ows of a financial instrument held by the Group may uctuate due to changes in market valuation.
This market risk comprises currency risk see note 18 ii, interest rate risk see note 18 iii and market price risk see note 18 iv.
The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks.
The Investment Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 31 DECEMBER 2013 [55] Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 18.
RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES continued ii Currency risk A proportion of the Groups assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling the Groups functional currency, in which it reports its results.
As a result, movements in exchange rates will affect the sterling value of those items.
At31 December 2013 the value of non-sterling denominated investments amounted to 581,206,000 2012: 876,374,000.
Management of the risk The Investment Manager monitors the Groups exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the Board on a regular basis.
Foreign currency borrowing and forward currency contracts were used to limit the Groups exposure to anticipated future changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments.
No forward currency contracts were open at year end.
Income denominated in foreign currency is converted into sterling on receipt.
The Group does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.
Foreign currency exposure The fair values of the Companys monetary items which have foreign currency exposure at 31 December 2013 are shown below.
Where the Companys equity investments which are not monetary items are denominated in a foreign currency, the principals have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall exposure.

Foreign currency sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the pro t after tax for the year and the equity in regard to the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities and the exchange rates for sterling US dollar, sterling Canadian dollar, sterling Australian dollar and sterling South African rand.
[56] BLACKROCK WORLD MINING TRUST P LC It assumes the following changes in exchange rates: Sterling US dollar -5% 2012: 5% Sterling Canadian dollar -5% 2012: 5% Sterling Australian dollar -10% 2012: 10% Sterling South African rand -20% 2012: Sterling Peru nuevo sol -20% These percentages have been determined based on the average market volatility in exchange rates in the previous 12 months.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Groups foreign currency financial instruments held at each financial reportingdate.
If sterling had weakened against the currencies shown below, this would have had the following effect: 2013 2012 South US Canadian Australian African US Canadian Australian Peru dollar dollar dollar rand dollar dollar dollar nuevo sol 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Projected change 5% 5% 10% 20% 5% 5% 10% 20% Impact on revenue return 1,249 3 51 294 1,067 20 361 245 Impact on capital return 13,540 7,759 4,773 7,208 15,444 9,914 10,590 16,913 Total return after taxation for the year effect on shareholders funds 14,789 7,762 4,824 7,502 16,511 9,934 10,951 17,158 If sterling had strengthened against the currencies shown below, this would have had the following effect: 2013 2012 South US Canadian Australian African US Canadian Australian Peru dollar dollar dollar rand dollar dollar dollar nuevo sol 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Projected change 5% 5% 10% 20% 5% 5% 10% 20% Impact on revenue return 1,130 3 41 196 963 21 295 163 Impact on capital return 12,251 7,020 3,905 4,805 13,974 8,970 8,665 11,275 Total return after taxation for the year effect on shareholders funds 13,381 7,023 3,946 5,001 14,937 8,991 8,960 11,438 iii Interest rate risk Interest rate risk movements may affect the interest payable on the Companys variable rate borrowings, the valuation of the Groups xed interest securities and the level of income receivable on cash deposits.
Management of the risk The possible effects on fair value and cash ows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment decisions and borrowing under the multi-currency loan and overdraft facilities.
The Group, generally, does not hold signi cant cash balances, with short term borrowings being used when required.
The Company nances part of its activities through borrowings at levels approved and monitored by the Board.
Derivative contracts are not used to hedge against the exposure to interest rate risk.
ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 31 DECEMBER 2013 [57] Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 18.
RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES continued iii Interest rate risk continued Interest rate exposure The exposure at 31 December of financial assets and liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to: X oating interest rates when the interest rate is due to be re-set X xed interest rates when the financial instrument is due for repayment 2013 2012 Within More than Within More than one year one year Total one year one year Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Exposure to oating interest rates: Cash balances excluding collateral pledged 15,261 15,261 13,325 13,325 Bank loans 101,915 101,915 100,892 100,892 86,654 86,654 87,567 87,567 The above year end amounts are not representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year, as the level of exposure changes as investments are made in xed interest securities, borrowings are drawn down and repaid, and the mix of borrowings between oating and xed interest rates change.
At 31 December 2013, the Groups xed interest securities amounted to 8.6% 2012: 13.8% of the portfolio.
These xed interest investments are susceptible to changes in market value which would therefore impact their yield.
Interest receivable and finance costs are at the following rates: X Interest received on cash balances or paid on bank overdrafts loans respectively is approximately 0.15% and 1.63% per annum for USD balances and 0.15% and 1.25% for GBP balances 2012: 0.15% and 1.75% per annum for USD balances.
Interest rate sensitivity Should a 0.5% interest rate variance occur, the impact of this on the Company would be approximately 108,000 2012: 110,000 on the revenue return and 324,000 2012: 330,000 on the capital return for the year ended 31 December 2013.
Therefore, on this basis, the Company is not materially exposed to changes in interest rates.
iv Market price risk Market price risk i. e. changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may affect the value of the investments.
The Groups investments are susceptible to market price risk arising from uncertainties about future prices of investments.
The Groups investment in contractual rights is exposed to commodity price risk arising from uncertainties about future prices of iron ore in addition to variables regarding the volume and quality of the iron ore produced.
Management of the risk The Board of Directors manages the risks inherent in the investment portfolio by ensuring full and timely access to relevant information from the Investment Manager.
The Board meets regularly and at each meeting reviews investment performance.
TheBoard monitors the Investment Managers compliance with the Groups objective and is directly responsible for investment strategy and asset allocation.
Use of derivatives When appropriate, the Group manages its exposure to risk by buying selling put or call options on indices and on equity or commodity investments in its portfolio.
Options written by the Group provide the purchaser with the opportunity to purchase from orsell the Group the underlying asset at an agreed-upon value either on or before the expiration of the option.
Options are generallysettled on a net basis.
During the year ended 31 December 2013 and 2012, the Group wrote covered call and put option contracts to generate revenue income for the Company.
As the call and put options are covered by dedicated cash resources andno calland put option contracts were written to manage price risk, there is no impact on the Groups exposure to gearing or leverage as a result of writing covered call and put options.
The notional amount of put call options written that were open at 31December 2013 was4,050,000 2012:13,500,000.
[58] BLACKROCK WORLD MINING TRUST P LC The Groups exposure to other changes in market prices at 31 December 2013 on its quoted and unquoted equity or commodity investments and investment in contractual rights was 820,279,000 2012: 1,068,302,000.
Concentration of exposure to market price risks An analysis of the Groups investment portfolio is shown on pages 18 to 20.
At 31 December 2013, this shows that the portfolio had signi cant levels of investments in Africa, Latin America, Australia and South Africa.
Accordingly, there is a concentration of exposure to those countries, though it is recognised that an investments country of domicile or of listing does not necessarily equate to its exposure to the economic conditions in that country.
Valuation process for Level 3 valuations The Directors engage a mining consultant, an independent valuer with a recognised and relevant professional quali cation, to conduct a periodic valuation of the contractual rights and the fair value of the contractual rights is assessed with reference to relevant factors.
At the reporting date the income streams from contractual rights have been valued on the net present value of the pre-tax cash ows discounted at a rate the external valuer considers re ects the risk associated with the project.
The valuation model uses discounted cash ow analysis which incorporates both observable and non-observable data.
Observable inputs include assumptions regarding current rates of interest and commodity prices.
Unobservable inputs include assumptions regarding production pro les, price realisations, cost of capital anddiscount rates.
In determining the discount rate to be applied, the external valuer considers the country and sovereign risk associated with the project, together with the time horizon to the commencement of production and the success or failure of projects of a similar nature.
To assess the signi cance of a particular input to the entire measurement, the external valuer performs sensitivity analysis.
The external valuer has undertaken an analysis of the impact of using alternative discount rates onthe fair value of contractual rights.
This investment in contractual rights is reviewed regularly to ensure that the initial classi cation remains correct given the assets characteristics and the Groups investment policies.
The contractual rights are initially recognised using the transaction price as the best evidence of fair value at acquisition and are subsequently measured at fair value, taking into consideration the relevant IFRS 13 requirements.
In arriving at their estimates of market values, the valuers have used their market knowledge and professional judgement.
The Group classi es the fair value of this investment as Level 3.
Valuations are the responsibility of the Directors of the Company.
In arriving at a final valuation, the Directors consider the independent valuers report, the signi cant assumptions used in the fair valuation and the review process undertaken by thePricing Committee.
The valuation of unquoted investments is performed on a quarterly basis by the portfolio manager andreviewed by the Pricing Committee of the Investment Manager.
On a quarterly basisthe Portfolio Manager will review the valuation of the contractual rights and inputs for signi cant changes.
A valuation of contractual rights is performed annually byan external valuer, IMC Group Consulting Limited, and reviewed by the Pricing Committee of the Investment Manager.
Thevaluations are also subject to quality assurance procedures performed within the Pricing Committee.
On a semi-annual basis, after the checks above have been performed, the Investment Manager presents the valuation results tothe Directors.
Thisincludes a discussion of the major assumptions used in the valuations.
There were no changes in valuation techniques during the year.
Market price risk sensitivity The following illustrates the sensitivity of the pro t after taxation for the year and the shareholders equity to an increase or decrease of 20% in the fair values of the Groups investments including equity exposure through options.
This level of change isconsidered to be reasonably possible based on observation of market conditions in 2012.
The sensitivity analysis is based on theGroups equities and equity exposure through options at each financial reporting date, with all other variables held constant.
The impact of a 20% increase in the value of investments on the revenue return for the year ended 31 December 2013 is a decrease of 533,000 2012: 651,000 and on the capital return is an increase of 162,456,000 2012: 198,208,000.
The impact of a 20% decrease in the value of investments on the revenue return for the year ended 31 December 2013 is an increase of 533,000 2012: 651,000 and on the capital return is a decrease of 162,456,000 2012: 198,208,000.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Financial assets and financial liabilities are either carried in the Statements of Financial Position at their fair value investment and derivatives or at an amount which is a reasonable approximation of fair value due from brokers, dividends and interest receivable, due to brokers, accruals, cash at bank, bank overdrafts and amounts due under the multi-currency loan facility.

RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES continued iv Market price risk continued Fair value hierarchy disclosures The table below sets out fair value measurements using the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy: Financial assets at fair value through pro t or loss Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total At 31 December 2013 000 000 000 000 Equity 818,271 17,557 835,828 Investment in contractual rights 65,342 65,342 Fixed interest securities 84,952 84,952 Derivative financial instruments written options 276 276 Total 903,223 17,281 65,342 985,846 Financial assets at fair value through pro t or loss Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total At 31 December 2012 000 000 000 000 Equity 1,059,834 8,718 1,068,552 Investment in contractual rights 67,502 67,502 Fixed interest securities 182,306 182,306 Derivative financial instruments written options 250 250 Total 1,242,140 8,468 67,502 1,318,110 Level 2 investments are valued using observable inputs such as quoted prices in an active market and adjustments are made to these valuations when necessary to recognise differences in the instruments terms.
To the extent that the signi cant inputs are observable, the Group categorises these investments as Level 2.
Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is signi cant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset as follows: Level 1 valued using quoted prices in an active market for identical assets: Level 2 valued by reference to valuation techniques using market observable inputs such as quoted prices: Level 3 valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.
During 2012, following the listing of one of its unquoted investments, the Groups investment in that entity totalling 9,826,000 was reclassi ed from Level 3 to Level 2.
This investment is valued after applying an illiquidity discount to quoted prices to re ect the staggered lock-up and liquidity levels in the stock.
Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy, are deemed to have occurred at the beginning of the reporting period.
A reconciliation of fair value measurement in Level 3 is set out below.
Level 3 Financial assets at fair value through pro t or loss 2013 2012 At 31 December 000 000 Opening fair value 67,502 32,017 Purchases at cost 70,090 Disposals 18,270 Transferred to Level 2 9,826 Total gains or losses included in gains on investments in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income: on assets disposed of during the year 390 on assets held at the end of the year 2,160 6,119 Closing fair value 65,342 67,502 Level 3 valuation techniques used by the Company are explained in the accounting policies in note 2 h. [60] BLACKROCK WORLD MINING TRUST P LC Quantitative information of signi cant unobservable inputs Level 3 2013 Description 000 Valuation technique Unobservable input Marampa royalty 65,342 Discounted cash ows Discount rate weighted average cost of capital Average iron ore prices China Spot 62% Fe, CFR The range of the unobservable inputs have not been disclosed as this is considered to be commercially sensitive information.
Sensitivity analysis to signi cant changes in unobservable inputs within Level 3 hierarchy The signi cant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, together with an estimated quantitative sensitivity analysis, as at 31 December 2013 are as shown below: Estimated Impact on fair value Description Input Sensivity used 000 Marampa royalty Discount rate weighted 1% 10m average cost of capital Average iron ore prices China 10% 10m Spot 62% Fe, CFR The sensitivity analysis refers to a percentage amount added or deducted from the input and the effect this has on the fair value The sensitivity impact on fair value is calculated based on the sensitivity estimates set out by the independent valuer in its reporton the valuation of contractual rights.
Signi cant increases decreases in estimated iron ore prices and discount rates in isolation would result in a signi cantly higher lower fair value measurement.
Generally, a change in the assumption made for the estimated value is accompanied by a directionally similar change in the iron ore prices and discount rates.
v Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Group will encounter dif culty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not signi cant as the majority of the Groups assets are investments in quoted equities and other quoted securities that are readily realisable.
The Group has an overdraft facility of 30 million 2012: 30 million and a multi-currency loan facility of 120 million 2012: 120 million.
The Board gives guidance to the Investment Manager as to the maximum amounts of the Groups resources that should be invested in any one company.
The policy is that the Group should remain 75% invested in normal market conditions and that 25% of the Groups assets may be invested in cash or cash equivalents.
Short term borrowings may be used to manage short term cash requirements.
Liquidity risk exposure The remaining contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at 31 December, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required, was as follows: Not more 3 months than More than or less one year one year Total 2013 000 000 000 000 Current liabilities: Bank loans and bank overdrafts 102,262 102,262 Amounts due to brokers, accruals and provisions 22,949 277 23,226 Derivative financial instruments written options 276 276 125,487 277 125,764 ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 31 DECEMBER 2013 [61] Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 18.
RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES continued v Liquidity risk continued Not more 3 months than More than or less one year one year Total 2012 000 000 000 000 Current liabilities: Bank loans and bank overdrafts 101,036 101,036 Amounts due to brokers, accruals and provisions 21,672 991 22,663 Derivative financial instruments written options 250 250 122,958 991 123,949 vi Credit risk The failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Company suffering a loss.
Management of the risk The risk is managed as follows: X where the Investment Manager makes an investment in a bond, corporate or otherwise, the credit rating of the issuer is taken into account so as to determine the risk to the Group of default: X transactions involving derivatives are either exchange traded where the relevant exchange guarantees settlement or on an over-the-counter basis.
Transactions are entered into only with those counterparties approved by the credit department of the Investment Manager.
Counterparties are selected on the basis of a number of risk migration criteria designed to reduce the risk to the Group of default: X investment transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers, whose credit-standard is reviewed periodically by the Investment Manager, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker: X the credit worthiness of financial institutions with whom cash is held is reviewed regularly by the Investment Manager: X the credit worthiness of counterparties to stock lending is assessed by the Investment Manager prior to trading and on a regular ongoing basis.
All transactions are secured with collateral to 105% of the value of the stock on loan.
Credit risk exposure In summary, the maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December was as follows: 2013 2012 Group 000 000 Fixed interest securities 84,952 182,306 Cash and cash equivalents 16,553 14,493 Other receivables amounts due from brokers, dividends and interest receivable 6,293 3,693 107,798 200,492 Includes income from xed interest securities.
None of the Companys financial liabilities are past due or impaired.
vii Capital management policies and procedures The Companys capital management objectives are: X to ensure it will be able to continue as a going concern: and X to achieve a balanced return of dividends and capital growth over the longer term, by investing primarily in securities of companies in the mining and metals sectors.
