Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value of instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the instrument at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts and options is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, being the present value of the quoted forward price.
Hedging Cash Flow Hedges Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges are recognised directly in equity to the extent that the hedge is effective.
To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, changes in fair value are recognised as profit or loss.
If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively.
The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity remains there until the forecast transaction occurs.
When the hedged item is a non-financial asset, the amount recognised in equity is transferred to the carrying amount of the asset when it is recognised.
In other cases, the amount recognised in equity is transferred to profit or loss in the same period that the hedged item affects profit or loss.
