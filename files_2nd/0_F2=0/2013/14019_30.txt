As noted in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 3, the Aerospace Division consists of 19 operations and the Flexonics Division consists of 12 operations.
Each of these operations is considered to be a separate CGU.
Goodwill has been allocated to 19 of these individual CGUs 13 in Aerospace and six in Flexonics.
The table below highlights the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the CGUs that are considered significant incomparison with the total carrying amount of goodwill.
Where the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a CGU is individually not considered significant, it is aggregated in the table below.
The carrying amount of goodwill of the aggregated Aerospace CGUs is considered significant and the recoverable amounts for these units are based principally on the same key assumptions.

The 2013 goodwill impairment review was undertaken as at 31 December 2013, with an additional review performed at Capo Industries as at 30 June 2013 as noted below.
The recoverable amounts of all the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The calculations use cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and forecasts per individual unit, as approved by management for the next three years.
For all the CGUs a detailed budget that covers the next financial year is used and for some CGUs this is supplemented by forecasts of performance for the two yearsafter that.
These forecasts, where appropriate, take account of the current economic environment as set out in the Strategic Report on pages1 to27.
Cash flows thereafter have been extrapolated based on estimated growth rates.
These growth rates do not exceed independently sourced estimated long-term average growth rates for the relevant markets.
The cash flow forecasts for each CGU have also been adjusted to reflect risks specific to each CGU.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for all CGUs is 10.5% 2012 10.8%.
This is based onthe Groups weighted average pre-tax cost of capital and is the measurement used by management in assessing investment appraisals.
78 Senior plc | AnnUAL REPoRT & ACCoUnTS 2013 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 13. gooDwill continued The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations for all Aerospace CGUs are the forecast build rates for aircraft, forecast gross margins and long-term average forecast growth rates.
Forecast build rates for aircraft are in line with market forecasts and guidance available from manufacturers such as Boeing and Airbus.
Forecast gross margins are set individually by each CGU and reflect past experience, notably the most recently achieved margins, but also factor in continuing efficiency improvements to counteract inflationary increases in underlying costs.
Cash flows extrapolated beyond the initial forecast period of three years are based on growth rates of 2.5% per annum which does not exceed the long-term average growth rate forecasts for the aerospace market as included in market outlooks from Boeing and Airbus.
Management believes that any reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions would not cause the carrying amount of AMT, Weston, Jet Products, Connecticut, BWT and Atlas, Bird Bellows, Thermal, and all other aggregated Aerospace CGUs to exceed the recoverable amount of those units and aggregated units, respectively.
As noted in the Groups Interim Report 2013, Capo Industries has been impacted by the subdued business jet market since 2008, and taking into account that the anticipated recovery in this, and the regional jet engine markets, has not yet materialised and expectations for future operating margins are consequently lower, an impairment review for this CGU was performed at 30 June 2013.
The recoverable amount was determined from a value in use calculation.
The calculation used the cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent forecasts at the time, as approved by management for the next five years, and cash flows thereafter were extrapolated based on estimated growth rates that did not exceed independently sourced estimated long-term average growth rates for the aerospace industry.
Different probability weighted scenarios, where the compound annual sales growth over the initial five-year period ranged from managements base case of 18.1% to 3.6% were considered.
Beyond this combined five-year period, cash flows were projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 3.6% from 2019 to 2031, with reference toBoeing and Bombardier 20-year market projections, and 2.5% per annum thereafter.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows was 10.8%.
As at 30 June 2013, before impairment testing, goodwill of 29.9m was allocated to Capo Industries within Aerospace.
As a result of the impairment test noted above, an impairment loss of 12.7m was recognised against Capo Industries goodwill, leaving a balance of 15.3m at31 December 2013 after taking account of foreign exchange movements.
This impairment loss has been included within trading profit in the Consolidated Income Statement.
As at 31 December 2013 a further impairment review has been performed for this CGU with projections for the initial forecast period being expanded a further two years beyond the initial forecast period of three years to reflect the medium-term plan of management to recover from this downturn in the market.
Different scenarios where the compound annual sales growth over the initial five-year period varies from managements base case of 17.5% to 3.7% have been considered.
Beyond this combined five-year period, cash flows are projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 3.7% from 2019 to 2032, in line with Boeing and Bombardier 20-year market projections, and 2.5% per annum thereafter as noted above.
The recoverable amount of Capo Industries at 31 December 2013 is 22.9m.
As noted in the Financial Review on page 26 further cost savings are anticipated following the restructuring of Capo Industries with Ketema, and as such management believes that any reasonable possible change in any of the key assumptions would not cause the carrying amount of Capo Industries to exceed its recoverable amount.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations for Pathway and GA are the forecast orders and forecast gross margins.
Forecast orders are based on the orders secured and quote activity at the time of setting the budget, and also reflect past experience with the build-up of orders and quote success rates.
Forecast gross margins reflect past experience, notably the most recently achieved margins, but also factor in expected efficiency improvements to counteract inflationary increases in underlying costs.
Management believes that any reasonable possible change in the key assumptions would not cause the carrying amount of Pathway or GA to exceed its recoverable amount.
other than as noted for GA, no significant goodwill is associated with CGUs operating in land vehicle markets.
An impairment charge of 12.7m has been recognised in 2013 2012 nil.

com Senior plc | AnnuAl RepoRt & Accounts 2013 85 Notes to the fiNaNcial statemeNt continued 21. financial instRuments capital Risk management The Group manages its capital structure to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern whilst maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the balance between debt and equity.
In considering the appropriate level of net debt the Group pays close attention to its levelas compared to the cash generation potential of the Group, measured by adjusted profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA.
The Group also monitors capital on the basis of a gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital.
net debt is calculated as the total of bank and other loans, obligations under finance leases, forward exchange contract losses less cash and cash equivalents and forward exchange contract gains.
Total capital is the equity shown in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
All of the Groups external borrowing facilities have a requirement for the ratio of net debt to EBITDA to be less than 3.0x.
Internally the Group aims for this ratio to not exceed 2.5x.
At 31 December 2013 net debt was 0.5x the Groups level of EBITDA 31 December 2012 0.6x.
In addition, all borrowing facilities contain the requirement for EBITDA interest cover the number of times net interest is covered by the Groups EBITDA to be inexcess of 3.5x.
At 31 December 2013 EBITDA was 15.4x the level of net interest 31 December 2012 15.7x.
Therefore, the Group currently hasconsiderable funding headroom.
The Groups strategy in respect of gearing is to target a long-term gearing ratio within the range of 60% to 80%.
Ratios outside this range may still be considered to be acceptable, in certain circumstances.
The gearing ratio for the Group at the end of 2013 was 16% 2012 23%.
The decrease in 2013 is attributable mainly to the strong profit and free cash flow generation during the year.
The cash generated by the Group in recent years has led to the gearing ratio being lower than the targeted range.
financial Risk management The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall treasury risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets, and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policiesapproved by the Board, which provide written principles on foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives andnon-derivative financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity.
Compliance with policies and exposures limits is reviewed by theGroups Treasury Committee on a regular basis.
The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
foReign exchange Risk management The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange risk arising on the operations trading activities in foreign currencies.
Where commented on below, the sensitivity analysis of the Groups exposure to foreign currency risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and left unchanged throughout the reporting period, with all other variables held constant such as interest rates.
The sensitivity assumptions are based on analysis reviewed by the Groups Treasury Committee.
Translation risk The Group derived 85% of its revenue from businesses outside the United Kingdom, with 66% relating to operations in north America.
Fluctuations inthe value of the US dollar and other currencies in relation to Pound Sterling have had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on the results of the Groups operations when reported in Pound Sterling.
The Group decided not to hedge this translation risk.
In addition, the majority ofassets are denominated in foreign currency, particularly in US dollars.
In order to provide a hedge against volatility in the value of these assets compared to the Groups earnings, and hence provide a natural hedge against the Groups principal lending covenant the ratio of net debt to EBITDA, the Group aims to borrow in foreign currencies in similar proportions to its generation of foreign currency EBITDA, where practical and economic.
A 10% appreciation or depreciation of all other currencies against Pound Sterling would have increased or decreased 2013 Group operating profit by 9.4m 7.3m of which would have been due to the US dollar movement and would have increased or decreased net equity by 20.5m 15.4m of which would have been due to the US dollar movement.
Transaction risk The Group has a number of transaction-related foreign currency exposures, particularly between the Euro and the South African Rand, and between the US dollar and the Pound Sterling.
The Group seeks to hedge transaction-related exposures on a rolling 15- to 18-month forward basisand applies hedge accounting where the forwards can be designated in a qualifying cash flow hedge relationship.
Based on the net of theannual sales and purchase-related exposures, all transaction-related foreign currency exposures to Group profit after hedging in existence at 31December 2013 are immaterial.
The impact on net equity is determined by the unrecognised portion of open forward contracts at the year-end.
A 10% appreciation or depreciation of the Euro against the Rand and of the US dollar against Pound Sterling would have decreased or increased net equity by 0.6m and 1.7m, respectively.
86 Senior plc | AnnUAL REPoRT & ACCoUnTS 2013 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 21. financial instRuments continued inteRest Rate Risk management The Group has a policy of maintaining approximately 60% of its borrowing costs at fixed interest rates.
The Group generally borrows long term infixed rates but at times may borrow at floating rates and swap into fixed depending on credit market conditions.
occasionally a portion of fixed debtinterest is swapped into floating rates.
The combination of maintaining an acceptable balance of fixed and floating rate debt, and the Groups policy of borrowing in foreign currency in proportion to its generation of foreign currency earnings, provides an effective hedge against the impact of interest rate and foreign currency volatility on total interest costs.
The following sensitivity analysis of the Groups and the Companys exposure to interest rate risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates at the beginning of the financial year, and held constant throughout the reporting period with all other variables held constant such as foreign exchange rates.
Ifvariable interest rates had been 0.5% lower or higher, the Groups and Companys net profit would have increased or decreased by 0.2m.
Anyfixed interest debt is held to maturity and not fair value adjusted through the profit and loss.
Anincrease or decrease of 0.5% in the US dollar market interest rate for the fixed rate debt held up to maturity would have decreased or increased the fair value of the Groups and Companys borrowings by 2.0m.
The Groups and Companys sensitivity to interest rates has decreased during the current period mainly due to the increasedproportion of fixed debt.
cReDit Risk management The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The credit quality of customers is assessed taking into account their financial position, past experience and other factors.
Further details on determining the recoverability of trade receivables is provided in note 19.
The Group is guarantor under the lease of one building inthe UK, which arose on the disposal of a former Group-owned subsidiary in 2001. Credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are financial institutions with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the Financial Statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Groups and Companys maximum exposure to credit risk.
liquiDity Risk management Liquidity risk reflects the risk that the Group will have insufficient resources to meet its financial liabilities as they fall due.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Cash flow forecasts are produced monthly, together with appropriate capacity planning and scenario analysis, to ensure that bank covenant and liquidity targets will be met.
The Directors also regularly assess the balance of capital and debt funding of the Group, as part of a process to satisfy the Groups long-term strategic funding requirements.
As noted in the Financial Review on pages 24 to 26, the Group is currently in a well-funded position, with significant headroom under its committed borrowing facilities and no major renewal of borrowing facilities due until 2014.
It is considered unlikely that the Group will face any significant funding issues in the foreseeable future.

A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 22.0m 2012 47.6m of such losses.
no deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 3.1m 2012 6.3m due to the unpredictability of future taxable profit streams.
Included in unrecognised tax losses are losses of 3.1m 2012 3.4m that will expire within eight years.
other losses may be carried forwardindefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 11.2m 2012 5.8m.
no liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences willnotreverse in the foreseeable future.

The cash consideration, net of cash acquired of 0.1m, was 2.4m and the acquisition was funded from the Groups existing debt facilities.
Goodwill of 1.7m has been recognised on acquisition and represents the premium paid in anticipation of future profitability from assets that are not capable of being separately identified and separately recognised such as the assembled workforce as well as the Groups ability to generate future value from expanding Atlas aerospace activities through utilisation of the Groups existing relationships and experience in the aerospace industry.
Atlas contributed 3.0m of external revenue and made an operating loss of 0.1m from the date of acquisition to 31 December 2013.
If the acquisition had been completed on 1 January 2013, continuing Group revenue for the 12 months ended 31 December 2013 would have been 775.5m and continuing Group operating profit would have remained unchanged at 93.3m.

a 2005 long teRm incentive plan equity-Settled long Term incentive plans on 25 March 2013 1,105,898 shares and on 3 September 2013 215,749 shares were awarded under the 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan.
Awards under this plan have a three-year vesting period, subject to earnings per share EPS and total shareholder return TSR performance conditions being met.
Half the awards have an attaching performance target for EPS growth over the three-year performance period of at least 3% per annum above the RPI.
The other half ofthe awards begin to vest if the Companys TSR falls in the top half of a comparator group at the end of the three-year performance period.
Vesting levels increase with higher performance.
The awards are settled by delivering shares to the participants.
The estimated fair value for the awards granted in the year with EPS conditions are 227.50p and 256.10p per share, respectively which is essentially the share price at the date of grant of 246.80p and 278.10p, respectively, per share less an allowance for dividends foregone over the three-year vesting period.
The estimated fair value for the awards granted in the year with TSR conditions are 116.40p and 131.00p, respectively, per share, reflecting an adjustment of 51% to the fair value of the awards with EPS conditions due to the stringent TSR condition.
These fair values were calculated by applying a binomial option pricing model.
This model incorporates a technique called bootstrapping, which models the impact of the TSR condition.
The model inputs at the date of grant were the share price of 246.80p and 278.10p respectively, a risk-free interest rate of 0.3% per annum, expected volatility of 37.0% per annum, net dividend yield of 1.9% per annum, and the performance conditions as noted above.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price over the previous three years.

RetiRement benefit schemes The Group operates a number of pension plans in the UK, north America and Europe.
These include both defined contribution arrangements and defined benefit arrangements.
The largest defined benefit arrangement for the Group and Company, the Senior plc Pension Plan, is a funded scheme in the UK, providing benefits based on final pensionable emoluments for the employees of the Group and Company.
This plan was closed to new employees from April 2008.
A change to the Rules of the Plan was implemented prior to 31 December 2009 to introduce a cap on future pensionable earnings growth of 2% per annum from 6 April 2010.
The latest full actuarial valuation was carried out as at 5 April 2013 and, for the purposes of accounting under IAS19, this valuation has been rolled forward to 31 December 2013.
In addition, the Group operates two defined benefit plans in the USA, one of which was closed to future accrual from october 2009.
The second plan was closed to future participants from September 2013, and the Executive section was also closed to future accruals from December 2013.
Separate disclosure is made for the funded UK and US defined benefit arrangements.
In both the UK and the USA the assets of funded plans are held in separate trustee administered funds managed by independent financial institutions and have pension costs assessed by consulting actuaries using the Projected Unit Method.
The Trustees are required to act in the best interests of the plans beneficiaries.
The Group also has a small number of unfunded post-retirement plans, including a closed healthcare scheme in the US.
Separate disclosure is provided for these arrangements.
The bulk of the pension obligations relate to the UK Plan and we provide more detail on that arrangement below.
For the Senior plc Pension Plan in the UK, the Trustee is Senior Trustee Limited.
The appointment of the Directors to the Board is determined by the plans Trust documentation.
There is a policy that at least one-third of all Directors should be nominated by members of the plan.
Currently there are two member-nominated Directors and four Directors who have been nominated by the Company, of which the Chairman and one other Director are viewed as independent.
The investment strategy for the plan is decided locally by the Trustees.
The primary investment objective is for the plan to be able to meet benefit payments as they fall due.
This objective is implemented by setting strategic asset allocations using a horizonbased approach.
Under this approach, all benefit cash flows expected to fall in the next 17 years the horizon period are met by investment in low-risk assets such as fixed interest and index-linked bonds.
Cash flows after the horizon period are met by investment in more volatile assets which are expected to deliver a higher return than bonds in the longer term.
Benefits are expected to be paid over the next 60 to 70 years.
The UKPlans average duration is around 17 years.
In setting this strategy, the Trustees consider a wide range of asset classes, the risk and rewards of a number of possible asset allocation options, the sustainability of each asset class within each strategy, and the need for appropriate diversification between different asset classes.
The Trustees continue to review their investment strategy and have also implemented a switching mechanism to secure any outperformances of equities relative to bonds, by selling equities to buy bonds.
The Group is ultimately responsible for making up any shortfall in the UK defined benefit Plan over a period agreed with the trustees.
To the extent that actual experience is different to that assumed the funding position will be better or worse than anticipated.
As such, the contributions required by the Group could vary in the future.
The two key risks faced by pension schemes are longevity i. e. members living longer than expected and investment risk i. e. the schemes assets perform poorly relative to the liabilities.
The Group has agreed with the Trustees of the UK plan to fund the plan deficit over an eight-year period from April 2013 to March 2021.
The estimated amounts of contributions expected to be paid during 2014 to the UK plan is 8.2m 7.6m of which is to fund the past service deficit and 0.6m in respect of administrative expenses and to the US funded plans is nil.
a Defined contribution schemes The Group has a number of different defined contribution and government-sponsored arrangements in place in the countries in which it operates.
none of these are individually material to the Group and the aggregate cost of such schemes for the period was 6.2m 2012 5.4m.

RetiRement benefit schemes continued Benefits under the US funded plans are not linked to inflation.
For the UK Plan, the estimated impact on the plan deficit at 31 December 2013 of changes in key assumptions is as follows: Increase in plan deficit m 0.5% decrease in the discount rate 19.0 one-year increase in life expectancy 7.0 0.5% increase in inflation 12.0 These sensitivities have been calculated to show the movement in the defined benefit obligation in isolation, and assuming no other changes inmarket conditions at the accounting date.
This is unlikely in practice for example, a change in discount rate is unlikely to occur without any movement in the value of the assets held by the Plan.
h other post-retirement liabilities This balance comprises an unfunded German pension plan 3.2m 2012 3.1m, unfunded closed pension and post-retirement healthcare plans inthe USA 0.3m 2012 0.3m and provision for post-retirement payments in France of 2.2m 2012 2.0m.
The closed pension and post-retirement healthcare plans in the US have been valued on a Projected Unit Method with the following assumptions: discount rate 4.8% and annual healthcare cost trend rate of 10.0% until the payment for medical benefits cease in December 2014.
The effect of a 1% increase or decrease in the healthcare cost trend rate is negligible to the Groups results.
The German plan has been subject to formal actuarial valuation on a Projected Unit Method with the following assumptions: discount rate 3.4%, salary growth 2.0% and inflation 2.0%.
In France, the provision arises from a legal obligation to make payments to retirees in the first two years post-retirement.
Hence, it is not subject to discounting tothe same extent as the other longer-term post-retirement liabilities.
