In 2012 the company issued its own shares in order to acquire 100 per cent of the share capital of EnCore.
The share capital and reserves showed the difference between the value of these shares and their nominal value as share premium.
The 2012 disclosure has been restated to reclassify this difference within a merger reserve, as merger relief was applicable.
The change has no effect on net assets, income or cash flows.

The amounts for intangible E&E assets represent costs incurred on active exploration projects.
These amounts are written off to the income statement as exploration expense unless commercial reserves are established or the determination process is not completed and there are no indications of impairment.
The outcome of ongoing exploration, and therefore whether the carrying value of E&E assets will ultimately be recovered, is inherently uncertain.
During the year, the group sold its interest in the Grosbeak field in Norway for a profit of US$9.4 million and its interest in Block 07 03 in Vietnam for a loss of US$5.8 million.

Finance costs that have been capitalised within oil and gas properties during the year total US$25.6 million 2012: US$13.5 million, at a weighted average interest rate of 4.70 per cent 2012: 5.21 per cent.
Other fixed assets include items such as leasehold improvements, motor vehicles and office equipment.
Amortisation and depreciation of oil and gas properties is calculated on a unit-of-production basis, using the ratio of oil and gas production in the period to the estimated quantities of proved and probable reserves on an entitlement basis at the end of the period plus production in the period, on a field-by-field basis.
Proved and probable reserve estimates are based on a number of underlying assumptions including oil and gas prices, future costs, oil and gas in place and reservoir performance, which are inherently uncertain.
Management uses established industry techniques to generate its estimates and regularly references its estimates against those of joint venture partners or external consultants.
However, the amount of reserves that will ultimately be recovered from any field cannot be known with certainty until the end of the field's life.
The impairment charge relates to the UK Balmoral area.
The impairment charge of US$178.7 million was calculated by comparing the future discounted cash flows expected to be derived from production of commercial reserves the value-in-use against the carrying value of the asset.
The future cash flows were estimated using an oil price assumption equal to the Dated Brent forward curve in 2014 and 2015, and US$85 bbl in 'real' terms thereafter and were discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 10 per cent.
Assumptions involved in impairment measurement include estimates of commercial reserves and production volumes, future oil and gas prices and the level and timing of expenditures, all of which are inherently uncertain.
At 30 June, based on a review of the longer-term plans for the life of the fields in the area, it was determined that additional maintenance and operating cost expenditure is likely to be required in order to ensure that additional reserves will be extracted.
At year-end, decommissioning costs were also revised and updated based on latest estimates of drilling costs and time estimates to abandon the fields.

Property, plant and equipment continued Goodwill In January 2012, the group completed the acquisition of the entire issued share capital of EnCore.
This transaction has resulted in recognition of US$240.8 million goodwill which arose principally due to the difference between the fair value of assets and the consideration transferred and the requirement to recognise deferred UK corporation tax liabilities for the difference between the assigned fair values and the tax bases of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.
None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Goodwill has been assigned to the UK business segment and more specifically to the Catcher field, which will be considered the cash-generating unit for the purposes of any impairment testing of this goodwill.
The group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts are determined from value-in use calculations with the same key assumptions as noted for the impairment calculations above.
The discount rate used is 10 per cent 2012: 10 per cent.
The value-in use forecast, which is formally approved by management, takes into consideration cash flows which are expected to arise during the life of the Catcher field as a whole, currently expected to be to around 2027.
This period exceeds five years but is believed to be appropriate as it is underpinned by estimates of commercial reserves provided by our in-house reservoir engineers using industry standard reservoir estimation techniques.

Borrowings continued A maturity analysis showing the ageing profile of the total borrowings is shown in note 17.
During the fourth quarter, the group took advantage of favourable debt market conditions and low interest rates, to raise new debt over US$700 million equivalent.
This included long-term senior notes of US$130.0 million and 20.0 million with five and seven year maturities, long-term bank loans of US$150.0 million and 100.0 million maturing in 2017 and 150.0 million retail bonds which mature in 2020.
At the year-end, the groups principal credit facilities comprised of US$300.0 million term loan, a US$695.0 million revolving credit facility and 316.4 million US$525.2 million letter of credit facilities, all maturing in 2015.
Additionally, a US$350.0 million revolving credit facility, medium-term loan of US$150.0 million and 100.0 million will mature in 2017.
Senior notes of US$576.0 million and 120.0 million will mature starting from 2018 to 2024 and 150.0 million retail bonds will mature in 2020.
The company have financing in US$, and.
The and loans have been swapped into US$ at the transaction dates.
In total, 150.0 million and 120 million have been swapped in US$ using cross currency swap markets at an average exchange rate of US$1.64: and US$1.34: respectively.
However, all liabilities in currencies other than US$ have been translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the year-end.
Convertible bonds In October 2012, the group invited holders of the outstanding US$250 million guaranteed convertible bond old bonds to exchange their existing bonds due 2014 for guaranteed convertible bonds due 2018 new bonds.
The new bonds were issued with an exchange price of 4.34 US$7.00 at fixed exchange rate per share and a coupon of 2.5 per cent.
This compared with the old bonds which had an exchange price of 3.39 US$6.69 per share and a coupon of 2.875 per cent.
Bond holders representing 98.13 per cent of the total aggregate principal amount of the US$250.0 million approximately US$245.3 million elected to exchange their old bonds for the new bonds.
The remainder of the old bonds were settled in cash US$4.6 million or company shares US$0.1 million at par.
The new bonds were issued on 1 November 2012, with a par value of US$245.3 million which are convertible into Ordinary Shares of the company at any time from 11 August 2016 until six days before their maturity date of 27 July 2018.
Under the terms of the new bonds, the exchange price is to be adjusted on the occurrence of certain events, including any payments of dividends by the company.
During the year, the company declared a dividend of 5 pence per Ordinary Share and consequently the exchange price was adjusted to 4.28, US$6.90 per share.
The total number of Ordinary Shares to be issued, if all bonds are converted at this adjusted exchange price, is 35,526,646.
If the bonds have not been previously purchased and cancelled, redeemed or converted, they will be redeemed at par value on 27 July 2018.
Interest of 2.5 per cent per annum will be paid semi-annually in arrears up to that date.
In 2012, the group derecognised the book value of the old bonds as the new bonds have significantly different terms.
The equity component and liability portion of the new bond has been calculated based on the last day market price of the old bonds and effective yield of a similar maturity corporate bond.
The US$8.6 million difference between the equity component of the old bonds and the new bonds was assigned to the equity reserve and a US$1.9 million residual difference charged to income statement in 2012.
Issue costs were apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible bonds based on their relative carrying amounts at the date of issue.
The portion relating to the equity component was charged directly against equity.

Borrowings continued The total interest charged on the new bonds has been calculated by applying an effective annual interest rate of 4.58 per cent to the liability component for the period since the new bonds were issued.
The effective annual interest rate on the old bonds was 6.73 per cent.
The non-cash accrual of interest will increase the liability component as the cash interest is only paid at 2.5 per cent to US$245.3 million at maturity.
Retail bonds In December, the company put in place a 500.0 million Retail eligible Euro Medium Term Notes EMTN program under which it has issued 150.0 million UK retail bonds the bonds.
The bonds have been listed on the Official List of the UK Listings Authority and admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange's regulated market and the electronic Order Book of Retail Bonds ORB.
The bonds have a fixed coupon of 5.0 per cent and maturity of seven years.
Capital management The primary objective of the group's capital management policy is to ensure that it maintains healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and increase shareholder value.
The group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the years ended 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012.
The group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by net assets plus net debt.
The groups policy is to keep the long-term gearing ratio below 50 per cent.
Net debt comprises interest-bearing bank loans, senior loan notes, retail bonds and convertible bonds, less cash and short-term deposits.

These provisions have been created based on Premier's internal estimates and, where available, operators estimates.
Based on the current economic environment, assumptions have been made which are believed to be a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future liability.
These estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions.
However, actual decommissioning costs will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works required, which will reflect market conditions at the relevant time.
Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning is likely to depend on when the fields cease to produce at economically viable rates.
This in turn will depend upon future oil and gas prices, which are inherently uncertain.
New provisions and changes in estimates result from an increase in decommissioning estimates for operated fields in the UK, Indonesia and Vietnam.
Financial instruments Financial risk management objectives and policies The groups principal financial liabilities, other than derivative financial instruments derivatives, comprise accounts payable, bank loans, convertible bonds, retail bonds and senior loan notes.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage short-term cash flow and to raise finance for the groups capital expenditure programme.
The group has various financial assets such as accounts receivable and cash and short-term deposits, which arise directly from its operations.
It is group policy that all transactions involving derivatives must be directly related to the underlying business of the group.
The group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative exposures.
The main risks that could adversely affect the group's financial assets, liabilities or future cash flows are commodity price risk, cash flow interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge these risk exposures.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the group's policies and approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives.
Derivative financial instruments The group uses derivatives to manage its exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations and to changes in interest rates and foreign currency.
Oil and gas hedging is undertaken with collar options, reverse collars, swaps and hedges embedded in long-term crude offtake agreements.
Oil is hedged using Dated Brent oil price options.
Indonesian gas is hedged using HSFO Singapore 180cst which is the variable component of the gas price.
The group's exposure to interest rates is managed by maintaining an appropriate mix of both fixed and floating interest rate borrowings within its debt portfolio.
However, given the very low level of fixed interest rates available relative to historical rates, a substantial portion of the current drawings have been converted to fixed interest rates using the interest rate swap markets.
The group has currency exposure as a result of the financial instruments.
These are managed through cross currency swap arrangements.
As the group reports in US dollars, since that is the currency in which the majority of the groups transactions are denominated, significant exchange rate exposures currently relate only to certain local currency such as Pound Sterling, Norwegian Kroner receipts and expenditures within individual business units.
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts.

Financial instruments continued Fair value hierarchy In line with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement the group uses the following hierarchy for determining the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded value that are not based on observable market data.
As at 31 December 2013, the group held the following financial instruments measured at fair value excluding any primary financial instruments such as cash and bank loans : Assets measured at fair value Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss: At 31 December Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 $ million $ million $ million $ million 2013: Gas forward sale contracts 0.4 0.4 Cross currency swap 2.6 2.6 Forward foreign exchange contracts 12.9 12.9 Total 15.9 15.9 2012: Oil reverse collars 6.1 6.1 Gas forward sale contracts 3.2 3.2 Forward foreign exchange contracts 0.5 0.5 Total 9.8 9.8 Liabilities measured at fair value Financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss: At 31 December Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 $ million $ million $ million $ million 2013: Oil forward sale contracts 25.1 25.1 Interest rate swaps 10.4 10.4 Cross currency swap 2.8 2.8 Total 38.3 38.3 2012: Oil collars 8.8 8.8 Oil forward sale contracts 4.7 4.7 Gas collars 7.2 7.2 Interest rate swaps 16.7 16.7 Cross currency swap 6.4 6.4 Total 43.8 43.8 136 Premier Oil plc 2013 Annual Report and Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued For the year ended 31 December 2013 17.
Financial instruments continued Commodity price risk Oil At 31 December 2013, the group had 4.4 million barrels of Dated Brent oil hedged through forward sales for 2014 at an average floor price of US$103.9 bbl.
The forward sales have been designated as cash flow hedges and were assessed to be effective, with a fair value movement of US$27.2 million charged directly in retained earnings.
A residual fair value movement of US$1.4 million was charged to the income statement.
During the year, forward oil sales contracts for 3.2 million barrels matured generating an income of US$1.3 million 2012: US$34.4 million net cost including embedded oil price collars.
This income is an addition to sales revenue.
Indonesian gas At 31 December 2013, 192,000 mt of HSFO, which drives the groups gas pricing in Singapore, is subject to monthly forward sales contracts for 2014 at an average price of US$611.3 mt.
During the year, Singapore 180 HSFO contracts for 48,000 mt, with a floor of US$250.0 mt and a cap of US$500.0 mt, and 96,000 mt expired generating a cash cost of US$2.2 million 2012: US$26.3 million which was offset against sales revenue.
All contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges and were assessed to be effective.
In the current year, US$0.2 million of the movement in the fair value of these contracts was credited to the income statement 2012: US$3.2 million, as this movement related to the time-value portion of hedges under IAS 39.
The remaining movement, being a credit of US$3.0 million 2012: US$15.4 million, related to the intrinsic value of such instruments and was recognised directly in retained earnings.

The following illustrates the sensitivity of net income and equity to a 10 per cent increase and a 10 per cent decrease in this variable: Oil Gas Total Increase decrease in mark-to-market value $ million $ million $ million Ten per cent increase 41.2 11.7 52.9 Ten per cent decrease 40.9 11.7 52.6 Premier Oil plc 2013 Annual Report and Financial Statements 137 17.
Financial instruments continued Interest rate risk At 31 December 2013, US$300.0 million of the groups long-term bank borrowings have been swapped from floating rate to fixed rate.
Under these interest rate swap contracts, the group has agreed to exchange the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates and the cash flow exposure on the issued variable rate debt held.
These contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges and are assessed as effective.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the forward curves at this date.
The movement in fair values is shown in the table below: Total Asset liability $ million At 1 January 2012 19.3 Cash settlement for swaps 6.9 Charge to income statement for the year recorded within finance costs and other finance expenses 6.9 Credit to retained earnings for the year 2.5 At 31 December 2012 16.8 Cash settlement for swaps 7.1 Charge to income statement for the year recorded within finance costs and other finance expenses 7.1 Credit to retained earnings for the year 6.4 At 31 December 2013 10.4 Interest rate swaps sensitivity analysis The key variable which affects the fair value of the groups hedging instruments is market expectations about future interest rates.
The following illustrates the sensitivity of comprehensive income to an increase of 50 basis points in this variable: Total Increase decrease in mark-to-market value $ million Increase of fifty basis points 2.0 A decrease of 50 basis points in this variable has not been considered appropriate due to the current very low level of floating interest rates.
Foreign currency exchange risk During the year, the group issued 150.0 million retail bonds, 20.0 million long-term senior notes and 100.0 million term loan which have been hedged under cross currency swaps in US dollars at average fixed rates of US$1.64: and US$1.34:.
This is in addition to existing swaps of 25.0 million at a fixed rate of US$1.328: and 75.0 million at a fixed rate of US$1.423:.
The fair value of these cross currency swaps at the reporting date is shown below: Total Asset liability $ million At 1 January 2012 9.6 Credit to income statement for the year 1.2 Credit to retained earnings for the year 2.0 At 31 December 2012 6.4 Credit to income statement for the year 13.4 Charge to retained earnings for the year 7.2 At 31 December 2013 0.2 To cover sterling exposures an amount of 619.2 million was purchased and matured with forward contracts during the year 2012: 497.0 million to cater for its North Sea developments and operations.
The groups activities are largely conducted in US dollars.
The majority of borrowings at year-end were denominated in US dollars to match the currency of the assets.
The impact of any reasonably possible variation in foreign exchange rates on the groups results would be immaterial.

Financial instruments continued Other financial instruments Credit risk The group's credit risk is attributable to its trade receivables and its bank deposits.
The amount of receivables presented in the balance sheet is net of allowances for doubtful receivables, which were immaterial in 2013 and 2012.
The group does not require collateral or other security to support receivables from customers or related parties.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with at least single A credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
An indication of the concentration of credit risk is shown in note 1, whereby the revenue from four customers each exceeded 10 per cent of the group's consolidated revenue in 2013 2012: five.

The UK deferred petroleum revenue tax relates mainly to temporary differences associated with decommissioning provisions.
The overseas deferred tax relates mainly to temporary differences associated with fixed asset balances.
The groups unutilised tax losses and allowances at 31 December 2013 are recognised to the extent that taxable profits are expected to arise in the future against which the tax losses and allowances can be utilised.
In accordance with paragraph 37 of IAS 12 Income Taxes the group re-assessed its unrecognised deferred tax assets at 31 December 2013 with respect to ring fence tax losses and allowances.
The corporate model used to determine the recognition of deferred tax assets was re-run, using an oil price assumption of Dated Brent forward curve in 2014 and 2015, and US$85 bbl in real terms, thereafter.
The results of the corporate model concluded that it was appropriate to recognise the group's UK ring fence deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses and allowances in full.
In addition to the above, there are non-ring fence UK tax losses of approximately US$321.1 million 2012: US$327.6 million and current year non-UK tax losses of approximately US$14.3 million 2012: US$26.9 million for which a deferred tax asset has not been recognised.
None of the UK tax losses ring fence and non-ring fence have a fixed expiry date for tax purposes.
No deferred tax has been provided on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, following a change in UK tax legislation in 2009 which exempted foreign dividends from the scope of UK corporation tax, where certain conditions are satisfied.

Share-based payments and share incentive plans The group currently operates a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP for all employees and a Share Incentive Plan and a Save As You Earn Scheme for UK-based and expatriate employees only.
For the year ended 31 December 2013, the total cost recognised by the group for equity-settled share-based payment transactions is US$24.6 million.
A credit of US$24.6 million has been recorded in retained earnings 2012: US$30.5 million for all equity-settled payments of the group.
Like other elements of remuneration, this charge is processed through the time-writing system which allocates cost, based on time spent by individuals, to various entities within the Premier Oil plc group.
Part of this cost is therefore capitalised as directly attributable to capital projects and part is charged to the income statement as operating costs, pre-licence exploration costs or general and administration costs.
Details of the different share incentive plans currently in operation are set out below: i Long Term Incentive Plan The Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP was introduced in 2009 to provide a long-term all employee scheme which motivates all employees and provides a longer-term perspective to the total remuneration package.
Awards under the LTIP comprise three elements: Equity Pool Awards and Performance Share Awards that vest after the expiry of a threeyear performance period, and a potential Matching Award that vests at the expiry of a further three-year performance period, commencing at the end of the three-year performance period for Equity Pool and Performance Share Awards.
Full details about this plan have been provided in the Remuneration Report.
The company uses a Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate the value of the Equity bonus pool of the plan and of the Performance Share Awards.
The main assumptions used for the calculations are as follows: Volatility: 31.0% to 42.0% Risk free rate of interest: 1.0% to 2.9% Correlation factor with comparator group: 0.32 to 0.35 ii Share Incentive Plan Under the Share Incentive Plan employees are invited to make contributions to buy partnership shares.
If an employee agrees to buy partnership shares the company currently matches the number of partnership shares bought with an award of shares matching shares, on a one-for-one basis.

The Scheme was closed to new members aside from the provision of insured death in service benefits in 1997 and a new scheme, providing benefits on a defined contribution basis, was started.
Both schemes are funded by the payment of contributions to separately administered trust funds.
The disclosures set out below are based on calculations carried out as at 31 December 2013 by a qualified independent actuary.
The figures have been prepared in compliance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
The Schemes assets are held in a separate trustee-administered fund to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and present employees.
The Trustee of the Scheme is required to act in the best interest of the Schemes beneficiaries.
The appointment of members of the Trustee Board is determined by the trust documentation.
The liabilities of the defined benefit Scheme are measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid out of the Scheme using the projected unit credit method.
This amount is reflected in the surplus or the deficit in the balance sheet.
The projected unit credit method is an accrued benefits valuation method in which the Scheme liabilities make allowance for the projected earnings.
The liabilities set out in this note have been calculated using membership data current as at 31 December 2013.
The results of the calculations and the assumptions adopted are shown below.
As at 31 December 2013, contributions are payable to the Scheme by the group at the rates set out in the schedule of contributions dated 24 July 2012.
Under this schedule, the company contributes on a monthly basis at the rate of 30 per cent of the aggregate of members' pensionable salaries.
