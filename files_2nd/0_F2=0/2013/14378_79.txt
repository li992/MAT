The funds, which have a weighted average fixed rate of 3.7% and an average maturity of just over nine years, were drawn down on 21 January 2014 and used to repay existing bank debt.
Subsequent to the balance sheet date, on 3 February 2014 the Group announced the execution of a definitive agreement to acquire 100% of the shares of ArthroCare Corp. for approximately $1.7 billion.
The acquisition is subject to customary conditions, including a vote of ArthroCares shareholders and governmental clearances.
The acquisition is expected to close in mid-2014.
The acquisition will be financed through existing debt facilities and cash balances, including the existing $1 billion revolving credit facility and a new two-year $1.4 billion term loan facility, established in February 2014.

The Group uses derivative financial instruments only to manage the financial risks associated with underlying business activities and their financing.
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is not able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price.
The Groups policy is to ensure that there is sufficient funding and facilities in place to meet foreseeable borrowing requirements.
The Group manages and monitors liquidity risk through regular reporting of current cash and borrowing balances and periodic preparation and review of short and medium-term cash forecasts having regard to the maturities of investments and borrowing facilities.
Bank loans and overdrafts represent drawings under total committed facilities of $1,008m 2012 $1,017m and total uncommitted facilities of $319m 2012 $341m.
The Group has undrawn committed facilities of $672m 2012 $597m.
Of the undrawn committed facilities, $665m expires after one but within two years 2012 $586m expiring after two but within five.
The interest payable on borrowings under committed facilities is at floating rate and is typically based on the LIBOR interest rate relevant to the term and currency concerned.
In December 2010, the Company entered into a five-year $1 billion multi-currency revolving facility with an initial interest rate of 70 basis points over LIBOR.
The commitment fee on the undrawn amount of the revolving facility is 24.5 basis points.
The Company is subject to restrictive covenants under the facility agreement requiring the Groups ratio of net debt to EBITDA to not exceed 3.0 to 1 and the ratio of EBITA to net interest to not be less than 3.0 to 1, with net debt, EBITDA, EBITA and net interest all being calculated as defined in the agreement.
These financial covenants are tested at the end of each half year for the 12 months ending on the last day of the testing period.
As of 31 December 2013, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.
The facility is also subject to customary events of default, none of which are currently anticipated to occur.
