STRATEGIC REPORT STRATEGIC REPORT STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL OTHER INFORMATION OVERVIEW OUR PROGRESS OUR PERFORMANCE STATEMENTS INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC REPORT ON THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Our opinion In our opinion the Group financial statements, dened below: give a true and fair view of the state of the Groups affairs as at 31 December 2013 and of the Groups profit and cash ows for the year then ended: have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union: and have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder of this report.
What we have audited The Group financial statements, which are prepared by Legal & General Group Plc, comprise: the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2013: the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended: the consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated cash ow statement for the year then ended: and the notes to the consolidated financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation comprises applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union.
Certain disclosures required by the financial reporting framework have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report & Accounts, rather than in the notes to the financial statements.
These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are identied as audited.
What an audit of financial statements involves We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing UK and Ireland ISAs UK & Ireland.
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Groups circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed: the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors: and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report & Accounts to identify material inconsistencies with the audited Group financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit.
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Overview of our audit approach Materiality We set certain thresholds for materiality.
These helped us to determine the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, we set materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole at 70m.
We concluded that operating profit before tax was the relevant benchmark because it reects the underlying profit of the business.
Our view on overall materiality was communicated to the Audit Committee.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected misstatements identied during our audit greater than 3.5m, as well as misstatements below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
indd 107 14 03 2014 21:08 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC CONTINUED Overview of the scope of our audit The Group is reported in five reportable segments: Legal & General Assurance Society LGAS, Legal & General Retirement LGR, Legal & General Investment Management LGIM, Legal & General America LGA, and Legal & General Capital LGC.
The Group financial statements are a consolidation of 84 reporting units, comprising the Groups operating businesses and centralised functions.
In establishing the overall approach to the group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed on reporting units by us, as the group engagement team, or component audit teams within PwC UK and from other PwC network rms operating under our instructions.
Where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work at those reporting units to be able to conclude whether sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole.
Accordingly, of the Groups 84 reporting units, we identied 34 that, in our view, required an audit of their complete financial information, either due to their size or their risk characteristics.
Specic audit procedures on specic balances and transactions were performed at a further 11 reporting units.
This, together with additional procedures performed at the Group level, gave us 87% coverage over total assets and 88% coverage over profit after tax.
We concluded that this gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole.
Areas of particular audit focus In preparing the financial statements, the directors made a number of subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.
We primarily focused our work in these areas by assessing the directors judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
In our audit, we tested and examined information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we considered necessary to provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions.
We obtained audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both.
We considered the following areas to be those that required particular focus in the current year.
This is not a complete list of all risks or areas of focus identied by our audit.
Our areas of focus were communicated to the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee Report on page 64 sets out those matters that they consider to be significant issues in relation to the financial statements.

The most significant element is the annuity liabilities, whose valuation is sensitive to: valuation interest rate the discount rate derived from the yield on the assets backing the annuity liability used in calculating the present value of annuity payments.
The discount rate also includes an explicit allowance for future default on the asset portfolio: and longevity how long the policyholders receiving annuity payments are expected to live.
Valuation interest rate We assessed the directors processes for ensuring that the relevant investment The valuation interest rate is particularly sensitive to: data was included in the calculation of the yield on the assets, and tested the investment data used to calculate the yield on the assets completeness and accuracy of that investment data and the calculations.

the methodology used to model the asset cash flows to calculate the internal rate of return.
We assessed the appropriateness of the credit default allowance in light of changing market conditions and other market information available.
We challenged the rationale for and tested changes to the actuarial process and model underlying the calculation of the valuation interest rate.
Longevity assumptions We tested the operating effectiveness of controls over accuracy and completeness The longevity assumptions are calculated using internal of the data used in determining the longevity assumptions.

We tested the assumptions used by assessing the experience analysis performed and managements allowance for specific market indicators.
We compared the annuitant longevity assumptions against independent industry data and challenged differences identified.
Financial investments Financial investments vary in complexity.
Investments which are complex to value and require the use of significant judgement include: over-the-counter OTC derivatives: commercial mortgages: and collateralised debt obligations.
Valuation of complex investments We assessed the investment valuation processes and controls in place over We focused on the valuation of complex investments all investments.

We checked that complex investments, such as derivatives and structured solutions were accounted for and disclosed in accordance with IFRSs.
Business combinations During 2013 Legal & General Group Plc made a number of acquisitions, notably Cofunds Limited and Lucida Limited.
Business combinations We assessed the adequacy of the presentation of the acquisitions during the year.
The acquisitions of Lucida Limited and Cofunds Limited during the year were treated as business combinations which require We tested the fair value of tangible assets and liabilities acquired including the a number of estimates and adjustments to be made including: adjustments to fair value made on initial recognition.

There is an inherent risk that revenue might be materially misstated.
Risk of management override of internal controls We assessed the overall control environment of the Group, including the ISA UK & Ireland 240 requires that we consider this because arrangements for staff to whistle-blow inappropriate actions, and interviewed there is an inherent risk that management might override senior management and the Groups internal audit function.
controls that otherwise appear to be operating effectively.
We tested key reconciliations and manual journal entries.
We examined the significant accounting estimates and judgements relevant to the financial statements for evidence of bias by the directors that may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
We also built in an element of unpredictability into our testing.
Going concern Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors statement, set out on page 264, in relation to going concern.
We have nothing to report having performed our review.
As noted in the directors statement, the directors have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the Groups financial statements using the going concern basis of accounting.
The going concern basis presumes that the Group has adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the directors intend it to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed.
As part of our audit we have concluded that the directors use of the going concern basis is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Groups ability to continue as a going concern.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 In our opinion the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors Report for the financial year for which the Group financial statements are prepared is consistent with the Group financial statements.
Other matters on which we are required to report by exception Adequacy of information and explanations received Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

Except for the provisions of IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements and IFRS 12 Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities which have been endorsed for compulsory application in the EU for financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, the Group financial statements also comply with IFRS and interpretations by the IFRS Interpretations Committee as issued by the IASB.
The Group financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modied by the revaluation of land and buildings, available-for-sale financial assets, and financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value through profit and loss.
The Group has selected accounting policies which state fairly its financial position, financial performance and cash ows for a reporting period.
The accounting policies have been consistently applied to all years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Accounting policies that relate specically to a balance or transaction are presented above the relevant numerical disclosure.
The Group presents its balance sheet in order of liquidity.
This is considered to be more relevant than a before and after 12 months presentation, given the long term nature of the Groups core business.
However, for each asset and liability line item which combines amounts expected to be recovered or settled before and after 12 months from the balance sheet date, disclosure of the split is made by way of a note.
The presentation of the order of the notes to the financial statements has been amended to enable greater understanding of the Groups financial position and performance, details of which are outlined in the contents page to this report.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are disclosed gross in the balance sheet unless a legally enforceable right of offset exists and there is an intention to settle recognised amounts on a net basis.
Income and expenses are not offset in the income statement unless required or permitted by any accounting standard or IFRIC interpretation, as detailed in the applicable accounting policies of the Group.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transactions.
The functional currency of the Groups foreign operations is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates.
The assets and liabilities of all of the Groups foreign operations are translated into sterling, the Groups presentation currency, at the closing rate at the date of the balance sheet.
The income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to a separate component of shareholders equity.
Standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards that are not yet effective Certain standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published which are mandatory for the Groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 or later periods but which the Group has not adopted early.
Details of these are contained within Note 12 Financial investments and investment property at fair value and Note 44 Subsidiaries.
Use of estimates The preparation of the financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions which affect items reported in the consolidated balance sheet and income statement and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current circumstances and future events and actions, actual results may differ from those estimates, possibly signicantly.
This is particularly relevant for the determination of fair values of investment property Note 12 and unquoted and illiquid financial investments Note 12 v : the estimation of deferred acquisition costs Note 11 : tax balances Note 34 : and the estimation of insurance and investment contract liabilities Notes 21 and 22.
The basis of accounting for these areas, and the significant judgements used in determining them, are outlined in the respective notes to the financial statements.

In accordance with the requirements of IFRS 8, Operating segments, the prior period segmental information has been restated to reect these changes.
Consolidation principles Subsidiary undertakings The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets, liabilities, equity, revenues, expenses and cash ows of the Company and of its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31December each year.
All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are those entities including special purpose entities, mutual funds and unit trusts over which the Group directly or indirectly has the power to govern the operating and financial policies in order to gain economic benets Note 44. profits or losses of subsidiary undertakings sold or acquired during the period are included in the consolidated results up to the date of disposal or from the date of gaining control.
The interests of parties, other than the Group, in investment vehicles, such as unit trusts, are classied as liabilities and appear as Net asset value attributable to unit holders Note 12 v in the consolidated balance sheet.
The assets and liabilities of all of the Groups foreign operations are translated into sterling, the Groups presentation currency, at the closing exchange rate at the date of the balance sheet.
Associates and joint ventures The Group has interests in associates and joint ventures Note 45 which form part of an investment portfolio held through private equity partnerships, mutual funds, unit trusts and similar entities.
In accordance with the choices permitted by IAS28, Investments in associates, and IAS31, Interests in joint ventures, these interests have been classied as fair value through profit or loss and measured at fair value within financial investments, with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
Associates which do not form part of an investment portfolio are initially recognised in the balance sheet at cost.
The carrying amount of the associate is increased or decreased to reect the Groups share of the profit or loss after the date of the acquisition.
Product classication The Groups products are classied for accounting purposes as either insurance contracts participating and non-participating or investment contracts participating and non-participating.
The basis of accounting for these products is outlined in Notes 21 and 22 respectively.
Fiduciary activities Assets associated with duciary activities and the income arising from those assets, together with associated commitments to return such assets to customers, are not included in these financial statements.
Where the Group acts in a duciary capacity, for instance as a trustee or agent, it has no contractual rights over the assets concerned.
Foreign exchange and exchange rates Foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in the income statement, except when recognised in equity as qualifying cash ow or net investment hedges.
The year end exchange rates at 31 December 2013 are 1.66 United States Dollar, 1.20 Euro at 31 December 2012: 1.63 United States Dollar, 1.23 Euro.
The average exchange rates for year ended 31 December 2013 are 1.57 United States Dollar, 1.18 Euro year ended 31 December 2012: 1.58 United States Dollar, 1.23 Euro.
indd 120 14 03 2014 21:08 STRATEGIC REPORT STRATEGIC REPORT STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL OTHER INFORMATION OVERVIEW OUR PROGRESS OUR PERFORMANCE STATEMENTS PRIMARY STATEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE CONTINUED Changes to accounting policy IAS 19 Employee Benets During 2013 the Group has changed its accounting policy on the recognition and measurement of dened benefit pension expense and termination benets following the publication by the IASB in June 2011 of an amendment to IAS 19 Employee Benets.
This is compulsory for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
The impact of the amendment is to reduce profit for the year by 4m, following the allocation of the with-profit element to the unallocated divisible surplus, with an equivalent increase in other comprehensive income.
The Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income therefore remains unchanged.
The impact of this change upon the 2012 Consolidated Income Statement, Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, and Consolidated Cash Flow Statement is shown below.
As the impact of the change is shown within investment variances there is no impact upon group operating profit.
2012 m profit for the year as previously reported 801 Investment return IAS 19 Employee Benets amendment 6 Expenses Transfers to unallocated divisible surplus 3 Revised profit for the year after tax 798 Actuarial gain on dened benefit pension schemes 6 Actuarial gain on dened benefit pension schemes transferred to unallocated divisible surplus 3 Other items in other comprehensive income 47 Total comprehensive income for the year 754 The Consolidated Cash Flow Statement has been restated in line with these changes.
Changes to accounting policy IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement On 1 January 2013 the Group adopted IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
This Standard defines fair value, sets out in a single IFRS framework for measuring fair value, and requires disclosure about fair value measurements.
The main impact on the Group for the full year lies in the expansion of the fair value disclosure requirements, reected in Notes 12, 22, 25 and 27.

Investment and other variances have been adjusted to reect the adoption by the Group of amendments to IAS 19, Employee Benets.
The impact is to reduce profit for the year by 3m for 2012, offset by a corresponding change in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Group debt costs exclude interest on non recourse nancing.
Group investment projects and expenses include investment project costs of 25m 2012: 50m that predominantly relate to the Economic Capital programme and other strategic projects.
This supplementary operating profit information one of the Groups key performance indicators provides further analysis of the results reported under IFRS and we believe gives shareholders a better understanding of the underlying performance of the business.
Operating profit measures the pre-tax result reecting longer-term economic assumptions for our insurance businesses and shareholder funds, except for LGA which excludes unrealised investment returns to align with the liability measurement under US GAAP.
Variances between actual and smoothed assumptions are reported below operating profit.
Income and expenses arising outside the normal course of business, such as merger and acquisition and restructuring costs, are excluded from operating profit, as are profits and losses arising on the elimination of own debt holdings.
During the year, the Group has made changes to the organisational structure, effective from 1 July 2013.
The prior period segmental information has been represented to reect these changes.
LGAS represents Protection business retail protection, group protection and general insurance and Savings business platforms, workplace, SIPPs, mature savings and with-profits.
The LGAS segment also includes Legal & General France LGF, Legal & General Netherlands LGN and emerging markets.
LGR represents Annuities both individual and bulk purchase and longevity insurance.
The LGIM segment represents institutional and retail investment management businesses.
LGC represents the long term investment return less investment expenses on Group invested assets, using assumptions applied to the average balance of Group invested assets including interest bearing intra-group balances calculated on a monthly basis.
The LGA segment comprises protection business written in the USA.

Operational cash generation includes dividends remitted from LGF of 2m 2012: 2m, LGN of 14m 2012: 12m and LGA of 44m 2012: 40m.
2. International and other includes the operating profits not remitted as dividends from LGF of 4m 2012: 8m, LGN of 6m 2012: 9m within the Protection line and LGA of 14m 2012: 22m.
Operational cash generation for LGAS and LGR represents the expected surplus generated in the period from the UK in-force non profit Protection, Savings and Annuities businesses using best estimate assumptions.
The LGAS operational cash generation also includes the shareholders share of bonuses on with-profits business, dividends remitted from LGF and LGN and operating profit after tax from remaining Savings businesses.
New business strain for LGAS and LGR represents the cost of acquiring new business and setting up regulatory reserves in respect of the new business for UK non profit Protection, Savings and Annuities, net of tax.
The new business strain and operational cash generation for both LGAS and LGR exclude required solvency margin from the liability calculation.
Net cash generation for LGAS and LGR is dened as operational cash generation less new business strain.
Operational cash generation and net cash for LGIM represents the operating profit net of tax.
Operational cash generation for LGC represents the long term expected investment returns net of tax on Group invested assets.
The operational cash generation for LGA represents the dividends received.

The project and development costs in LGAS primarily relate to expenditure on workplace savings and the Retail Distribution Review.
For LGR, it is primarily related to expenditure on our enhanced annuity platform proposition.
LGR adverse Mortality Morbidity assumption changes primarily relate to the strengthening of the prudence margin for base mortality.
Other valuation assumption changes for LGAS in 2012 primarily relate to a reduction in the best estimate reserves within retail protection for reinsurer default and applying PS06 14 to a retail protection product.
Net cash for LGAS Protection and insured savings recognises tax relief from prior year acquisition expenses, which are spread evenly over seven years under relevant I-E tax legislation in the period the cash ows actually occur.
In contrast, operating profit typically recognises the value of these future cash ows in the same period as the underlying expense as deferred tax amounts.
The reconciling amounts arising from these items are included in the table above.
Following the removal of new retail protection business from the I-E tax regime, and the removal of commission from new insured savings business under the Retail Distribution Review at the end of 2012, no material amount of deferred tax assets arise on new acquisition expenses.
From 2013, as the deferred tax asset on prior period acquisition expenses unwinds, no replacement asset is created resulting in a higher level of Net Cash in 2013, which will then reduce over the following 6 years.
The DAC in LGAS represents the amortisation charges offset by new acquisitions costs deferred in the year.
The decrease in deferred costs reects the removal of commission payable on savings and investment business following the implementation of the requirements of the Retail Distribution Review on 1 January 2013.
The DIL in LGAS reects initial fees on insured savings business which relate to the future provision of services and are deferred and amortised over the anticipated period in which these services are provided.
The significant movement in the year is driven by the implementation of the requirements of the Retail Distribution Review on 1 January 2013.
The 22m in other non-cash items in LGR primarily relates to movement in valuation differences between IFRS and regulatory bases.
Other in LGAS includes the operating profits not remitted back as dividends from LGF 4m 2012: 8m and LGN 6m 2012: 9m.

The calculation of the general insurance combined operating ratio incorporates commission and expenses as a percentage of earned premiums.
The reduced combined operating ratio reects the continued pricing and underwriting discipline, improvements in the claims management processes during 2013 and benign weather experienced in the first 11 months of the year.
Total LGIM operating profit includes 37m 2012: 29m from retail investment management.

Investment variance is positive due to strong equity returns from shareholder funds and a positive impact from the increase in exposure to Direct Investments.
This has been partly offset by the dened pension benefit scheme variance of 30 m 2012: 40m, that reects the actuarial gains and losses and valuation difference arising on annuity assets held by dened benefit pension schemes that have been purchased from Legal & General Assurance Society Limited.
All other actuarial gains and losses on the dened benefit scheme assets and liabilities are presented in the Other Comprehensive Income.
M&A related includes gains, expenses and intangible amortisation relating to acquisitions.
Other includes new business start up costs, restructuring costs, and other non-investment related variance items.

The equity holders effective tax rate for the year is 21.0% 2012: 22.6%.
The Groups effective tax rate remains slightly below the UK corporation tax rate due to differences between the measurement of accounting and taxable profits.
3 OTHER OPERATIONAL INCOME AND EXPENSE Operational income comprises fee income from estate agency operations, agency fee income relating to distribution services, and revenue of 600m 2012: 295m from consolidated private equity investments.
Operational income is accounted for on an accruals basis.

The dividend per share calculation is based on the number of equity shares registered on the ex-dividend date.
The dividend proposed is not included as a liability in the balance sheet.
5 EARNINGS PER SHARE Earnings per share is a measure of the portion of the Groups profit allocated to each outstanding share.
It is calculated by dividing net income attributable to ordinary equity holders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding employee scheme treasury shares.
For this purpose, net income is dened as the profit after tax derived from continuing operations.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue, excluding employee scheme treasury shares, is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, such as share options granted to employees.
Potential or contingent share issuances are treated as dilutive when their conversion to shares would decrease net earnings per share.
A reconciliation of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations is provided below: i Earnings per share profit Earnings profit Earnings 1 1 after tax per share after tax per share 2 2013 2013 2012 2012 m p m p Operating profit 883 15.03 819 14.00 Investment and other variances 13 0.22 2 0.04 Impact of change in UK tax rates 3 0.05 7 0.12 Earnings per share based on protattributable to equity holders 893 15.20 810 13.84 ii Diluted earnings per share profit Number Earnings profit Number Earnings 3 3 after tax of shares per share after tax of shares per share 2 2013 2013 2013 2012 2012 2012 m m p m m p profit attributable to equity holders of the Company 893 5,875 15.20 810 5,851 13.84 Net shares under options allocable for no further consideration 79 0.20 99 0.23 Diluted earnings per share 893 5,954 15.00 810 5,950 13.61 1.

A description of the principal products offered by the Groups segments is outlined below.
The Group seeks to manage its exposure to risk through control techniques which ensure that the residual exposures are within acceptable tolerances agreed by the board.
The Groups risk appetite framework and the methods used to monitor risk exposures can be found on pages 42 to 49.
Details of the risks associated with the Groups principal products and the control techniques used to manage these risks can be found in Notes 8 and 18.
Long term insurance Death claims are accounted for on notication of death.
Surrenders for non-linked policies are accounted for when payment is made.
Critical illness claims are accounted for when admitted.
All other long term claims and surrenders are accounted for when payment is due.
Claims payable include the direct costs of settlement.
The change in the insurance liability reects the reduction in liabilities due to the payment of claims in the year, offset by liabilities arising from new business.
The movement also reects assumption changes relating to variables such as claims expectations, expenses and the unwind of the previous periods expectations.
LGAS LGAS business comprises individual and group protection, general insurance productions, the businesses in France LGF and Netherlands LGN and Savings products.
Protection business retail and group The Group offers protection products which provide mortality or morbidity benets.
They may include health, disability, critical illness and accident benets: these additional benets are commonly provided as supplements to main life policies but can also be sold separately.
The benefit amounts would usually be specified in the policy terms.
Some sickness benets cover the policyholders mortgage repayments and are linked to the prevailing mortgage interest rates.
In addition to these benets, some contracts may guarantee premium rates, provide guaranteed insurability benets and offer policyholders conversion options.
General insurance Claims and related reinsurance recoveries are accounted for in respect of all incidents up to the year end.
Provision is made on the basis of available information for the estimated ultimate cost, including claims settlement expenses, claims reported but not yet settled and claims incurred but not yet reported.
An unexpired risk provision is made for any overall excess of expected claims and deferred acquisition costs over unearned premiums and after taking account of investment return.
The Group offers Household and Accident, Sickness and Unemployment ASU products: Household.
These contracts provide cover in respect of policyholders homes, investment properties, contents, personal belongings and incidental liabilities which they may incur as a property owner, occupier and individual.
Exposure is normally limited to the rebuilding cost of the home, the replacement cost of belongings and a policy limit in respect of liability claims.
Accident, Sickness and Unemployment ASU.
These contracts provide cover in respect of continuing payment liabilities incurred by customers when they are unable to work as a result of accident, sickness or unemployment.
They protect predominantly mortgage payments.
Exposure is limited to the monthly payment level selected by the customer sufficient to cover the payment and associated costs, up to the duration limit specified in the policy, usually 12 months.
In addition, there are portfolios of Motor Insurance and Domestic Mortgage Indemnity Insurance DMI in run off.
Since 1993, the DMI contract has included a maximum period of cover of ten years, and a cap on the maximum claim.
For business accepted prior to 1993, cover is unlimited and lasts until the insured property is remortgaged or redeemed.
During 2012 the Group also commenced the sale of pet insurance products.

In LGF this includes unit linked savings, including shares of open ended investment vehicles SICAVS, risks for which are borne by unit holders of these funds, Euro denominated funds with 100% profit sharing clause and bank based investment accounts.
In LGN this includes unit linked and index linked savings products, bank based investment accounts and corporate pension products.
Certain savings products include an exposure to interest rate and credit risk, managed through an active asset-liability management programme.
Savings Fees charged for investment management services are recognised as revenue as the services are provided.
Initial fees which exceed the level of recurring fees and relate to the future provision of services are deferred and amortised over the anticipated period in which the services will be provided.
The total fees earned from fund management and investment contracts for the year is 1,040m 2012: 875m.
A range of contracts are offered in a variety of different forms to meet customers long term savings objectives.
Policyholders may choose to include a number of protection benets within their savings contracts.
Typically, any guarantees under the contract would only apply on maturity or earlier death.
On certain older contracts there may be provisions guaranteeing surrender benets.
Savings contracts may or may not guarantee policyholders an investment return.
The contracts fall into three main types: Non-participating savings, pensions and endowment contracts: Participating savings business, comprising endowment contracts and with-profits bonds: and Unit linked savings contracts and collective investment savings products.
Non-participating business is written in the non profit part of the Society Long Term Fund LTF.
profits accrue solely to shareholders.
Participating contracts are supported by the with-profits part of the Society LTF.
They offer policyholders the possibility of payment of benets in addition to those guaranteed by the contract.
The amount and timing of the additional benets usually called bonuses are contractually at the discretion of the Group.
For unit linked savings contracts and collective investment savings products, there is a direct link between the investments and the obligations.
The financial risk on these contracts is borne by the policyholders and therefore detailed risk disclosures have not been presented in respect of the associated assets and liabilities.
Unit linked business is written in the Society LTF.
Collective investment business is administered by Legal & General Portfolio Management Services Limited.
Pensions individual and corporate These are long term savings contracts through which policyholders accumulate pension benets.
Some older contracts contain a basic guaranteed benefit expressed as an amount of pension payable or a guaranteed annuity option.
Other options provided by these contracts include an open market option on maturity, early retirement and late retirement.
The Group would generally have discretion over the terms on which the latter types of options are offered.
Endowment policies These contracts provide a lump sum on maturity determined by the addition of annual and final bonuses over the duration of the contract.
In addition, the contracts provide a minimum sum assured death benefit.
With-profits bonds These contracts provide an investment return to the policyholder which is determined by the attribution of regular and final bonuses over the duration of the contract.
In addition, the contracts provide a death benefit, typically of 101% of the value of the units allocated to the policyholder.
indd 131 14 03 2014 21:08 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 7 PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS CONTINUED LGAS continued Participating contracts Discretionary increases to benets on participating contracts are allowed in one or both of annual and final bonus form.
These bonuses are determined in accordance with the principles outlined in the Groups PPFM for the management of the with-profits part of the Society LTF.
The principles include: The with-profits part of the Society LTF will be managed with the objective of ensuring that its assets are sufficient to meet its liabilities without the need for additional capital: With-profits policies have no expectation of any distribution from the with-profits part of the Society LTFs inherited estate.
The inherited estate is the excess of assets held within the Society LTF over and above the amount required to meet liabilities, including those which arise from the regulatory duty to treat customers fairly in settling discretionary benets: Bonus rates will be smoothed so that some of the short term uctuations in the value of the investments of the with-profits part of the Society LTF and the business results achieved in the with-profits part of the UK LTF are not immediately reected in payments under with-profits policies: and Some older participating contracts include a guaranteed minimum rate of roll up of the policyholders fund up to the date of retirement or maturity.
At 30 June 2005 an assessment was made of the expected cost of guarantees and options to be paid in the future, and funds with the same value to meet these costs were allocated from the capital in the with-profits sub-fund.
The value of the funds is regularly assessed and is reduced by the cost of guarantees and options paid since 1 July 2005.
At each assessment point, if the value of the funds is lower than the expected cost of guarantees and options, it is possible to make deductions from or refunds to asset shares to cover the difference.
It is intended to limit deductions to no more than 0.75% each year, up to a maximum of 5% per policy.
In 2013 the timing of the deduction refund was changed to be based on period ending 30 September to ensure that in future the deduction refund could be included in the forthcoming bonus declarations rather than delaying for a year.
Following the movement in the expected cost of guarantees and options and the value of the associated funds up to 30 September 2013, and in accordance with the Societys PPFM, neither a refund nor deduction from asset shares was deemed to be needed.
This followed a refund of 0.75% made in respect of the year to 31 December 2012.
The distribution of surplus to shareholders depends upon the bonuses declared for the period.
Typically, bonus rates are set having regard to investment returns, although the Group has some discretion setting rates and would normally smooth bonuses over time.
The volatility of investment returns could impact the funds capital position and its ability to pay bonuses.
If future investment conditions were less favourable than anticipated, the lower bonus levels resulting would also reduce future distributions to shareholders.
Business which is written in the with-profits part of the Society LTF is managed to be self-supporting.
The unallocated divisible surplus in the fund would normally be expected to absorb the impact of these investment risks.
Only in extreme scenarios, where shareholders were required to provide support to the with-profits part of the Society LTF to meet its liabilities, would these risks affect equity.
As part of the 2007 Society LTF restructure, the 1996 Sub-fund 321m was merged into the Shareholder Retained Capital SRC.
As a result, Societys Board of Directors undertook to initially maintain 500m of assets within Society to support the with-profits business.
The amount of the commitment reduced to 200m at the end of 2013 and will then gradually reduce to zero at the end of 2017.
The Groups approach to setting bonus rates is designed to treat customers fairly.
The approach is set out in the Societys PPFM for the with-profits part of the Society LTF.
In addition, bonus declarations are also affected by PRA regulations relating to Treating Customers Fairly TCF, which limit the discretion available when setting bonus rates.
LGR Annuity products provide guaranteed income for a specified time, usually the life of the policyholder, in exchange for a lump sum capital payment.
No surrender value is available under any of these products.
Immediate and deferred annuity contracts are offered.
Immediate annuities provide a regular income stream to the policyholder, purchased with a lump sum investment, where the income stream starts immediately after the purchase.
The income stream from a deferred annuity is delayed until a specified future date.
Bulk annuities are also offered, where the Group accepts the assets and liabilities of a company pension scheme or a life fund.
A small portfolio of immediate annuities has been written as participating business.
Some non-participating deferred annuities sold by the Group contain guaranteed cash options, predominantly minimum factors for commuting part of the annuity income into cash at the date of vesting.
The value of such guaranteed options are currently immaterial.
There is a block of immediate and deferred annuities within the UK non profit business with benets linked to changes in the RPI or for a minority the CPI, but with contractual maximum or minimum increases.
In particular, most of these annuities have a provision that the annuity will not reduce if RPI, or for a minority CPI, becomes negative.
The total of such annuities in payment at 31 December 2013 was 311m 2012: 301m.

Negative ination sustained over a longer period would give rise to signicantly greater guarantee costs.
Some of these guarantee costs have been partially matched through the purchase of negative ination hedges and limited price indexation swaps.
Deferred annuity contracts The Group has written some deferred annuity contracts with guaranteed minimum pensions.
These options expose the Group to interest rate and longevity risk as the cost would be expected to increase with decreasing interest rates and improved longevity.
The market consistent value of these guarantees carried in the balance sheet is 140m 2012: 175m.
Longevity insurance contracts The Group also provides longevity insurance products for company pension schemes, under which regular payments are made to the scheme reecting their actual longevity experience, while the scheme makes an agreed set of regular payments in return.
Some policies contain a guaranteed surrender value which is currently immaterial.
LGIM Fees charged for investment management services are recognised as revenue as the services are provided.
LGIM offers both active and passive management on either a pooled or segregated basis.

LGC Investment Strategy and Implementation Shareholder assets, which are managed by L&G Capital, include portfolios of equity, property, bond and other direct investments, not directly required to meet contractual obligations to policyholders.
The value of, and income from, these assets is sensitive to conditions within investment markets and the broader economy.
Potential volatility in returns are managed using a range of techniques, including performance benchmarks and limits on concentrations of exposures by asset type and geographic region.
Direct Investments and Structuring Direct investments are becoming an increasingly important part of our growth strategy.
We define Direct Investments as one off investments made with another counterparty, for example, a direct loan to another UK plc, such as a Housing Association.
Direct Investments offer better risk adjusted returns and diversity than traded market instruments, allowing us to offer better policyholder rates and shareholder returns.
Our investments will focus on Infrastructure, Commercial Lending, Property commercial and residential and asset finance.

LGA Protection business Protection consists of individual term assurance, which provides death benets over the medium to long term.
The contracts have level premiums for an initial period with premiums set annually thereafter.
During the initial period, there is generally an option to convert the contract to a universal life contract.
After the initial period, the premium rates are not guaranteed, but cannot exceed the age-related guaranteed premium.
Reinsurance is used within the protection businesses to manage exposure to large claims.
These practices lead to the establishment of reinsurance assets on the Groups balance sheet.
Within LGA, reinsurance and securitisation is also used to provide regulatory solvency relief including relief from regulation governing term insurance reserves and regulation governing universal life reserves.
Universal life Universal life contracts written by LGA provide savings and death benets over the medium to long term.
The savings element has a guaranteed minimum growth rate.
LGA has exposure to loss in the event that interest rates decrease and it is unable to earn enough on the underlying assets to cover the guaranteed rate.
LGA is also exposed to loss should interest rates increase, as the underlying market value of assets will generally fall without a change in the surrender value.
The reserves for universal life totalled $666m 402m at 31 December 2013 $679m 417m at 31 December 2012.
The guaranteed interest rates associated with those reserves ranged from 1.5% to 6%, with the majority of the policies having guaranteed rates ranging from 3% to 4% 2012: 3% to 4%.
Annuities Immediate annuities have similar characteristics as products sold by LGR.
Deferred annuity contracts written by LGA contain a provision that, at maturity, a policyholder may move the account value into an immediate annuity, at rates which are either those currently in effect, or rates guaranteed in the contract.
The reserves for immediate annuities and deferred annuities totalled $11m 7m and $193m 117m, respectively, at 31 December 2013 $12m 7m and $195m 120m at 31 December 2012, respectively.

Market risk Exposure to loss as a direct or indirect result of uctuations in the value of, or income from, specic assets.
Credit risk Exposure to loss if another party fails to perform its financial obligations to the Group.
Liquidity risk The risk that the Group, though solvent, either does not have sufficient financial resources available to enable it to meet its obligations as they fall due, or can secure them only at excessive cost.
The Group seeks to manage its exposures to risk through control techniques which ensure that the residual risk exposures are within acceptable tolerances agreed by the Board.

9 Assets AnALysIs The Group has categorised its assets and liabilities in the following disclosure in accordance with the level of shareholder exposure to market and credit risks.
The four categorisations presented are: Unit linked For unit linked contracts, there is a direct link between the investments and the obligations.
Unit linked business is written in both the Society Long term fund LTF and in the LTF of Legal & General Assurance Pensions Management Limited.
The financial risk on these contracts is borne by the policyholders.
The Group is, therefore, not directly exposed to any market risk, currency risk or credit risk for these contracts.
As a result, risk disclosures have not been presented for unit linked assets and liabilities.
With-profits Policyholders and shareholders share in the risks and returns of the with-profits part of the Society LTF.
The return to shareholders on virtually all participating products is in the form of a transfer to shareholders equity, which is analogous to a dividend from the Society LTF and is dependent upon the bonuses credited or declared on policies in that year.
The bonuses are broadly based on historic and current rates of return on equity, property and fixed income securities, as well as expectations of future investment returns.
With-profits also includes participating business in the LGF operation which shares similar characteristics.
The with-profits classification excludes unit linked contracts.
Non profit non-unit linked Shareholders are exposed to the risk and rewards of ownership of assets backing non profit non-unit linked business held within UK LTFs, which comprise of Annuities, Protection and Non profit savings products in UK business.
Shareholder All other assets are classified as shareholder assets.
Shareholders of the Group are directly exposed to market and credit risk on these assets.
This includes the assets and liabilities of our overseas insurance operations and general insurance.

12 FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS AND INVESTMENT PROPERTY The Group holds financial investments and investment property to back insurance contracts on behalf of policyholders and as Group capital.
The Group classies its financial investments on initial recognition as held for trading HFT, designated at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL, available-for-sale AFS or loans and receivables.
Initial recognition of financial investments is on the trade date.
The Groups policy is to measure investments at FVTPL except for certain overseas assets where the related liability is valued on a passive basis not using current information, in which case investments are classied as AFS.
All derivatives other than those designated as hedges are classied as HFT.
Certain financial investments held by the Group are designated as FVTPL as their performance is evaluated on a total return basis, consistent with asset performance reporting to the Group Investment and Market Risk Committee and the Groups investment strategy.

For participating contracts the assets are managed on a fair value basis to maximise the total return to policyholders over the contract life.
The Groups non-participating investment contract liabilities outside of the US are measured on the basis of current information and are designated as FVTPL to avoid an accounting mismatch in the income statement.
The fair values of quoted financial investments are based on bid prices, which management believe to be representative of fair value.
If the market for a financial investment is not active, the Group establishes fair value by using valuation techniques such as recent arms length transactions, consensus market pricing, reference to similar listed investments, discounted cash ow models or option pricing models.
Private equity investments are valued in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines, which represent current best practice, developed by the Association Franais des Investisseurs en Capital, the British Venture Capital Association and the European Private Equity and Venture Capital Association.
The techniques used for determining fair value include earnings multiples, the price of a recent investment or a net asset basis.
Financial investments classied as HFT and FVTPL are measured at fair value with gains and losses reected in the income statement.
Transaction costs are expensed as incurred.
Financial investments classied as AFS are measured at fair value with unrealised gains and losses recognised in a separate reserve within equity.
Realised gains and losses, impairment losses, dividends, interest and foreign exchange movements on non-equity instruments are reected in the income statement.
Directly attributable transaction costs are included in the initial measurement of the investment.
Loans and receivables are initially measured at fair value plus acquisition costs, and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Investment property comprises land and buildings which are held for long term rental yields and capital growth.
It is carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement within investment return.
Investment property in the UK is valued bi-annually by external chartered surveyors at open market values in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Manual of The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors or using internal valuations and estimates during the intervening period.
Outside the UK, valuations are produced in conjunction with external qualied professional valuers in the countries concerned.
In the event of a material change in market conditions between the valuation date and balance sheet date, an internal valuation is performed and adjustments made to reect any material changes in fair value.
The Group provides seed capital to newly established funds which may result in such funds becoming newly acquired subsidiaries of the Group.
Where the Group is actively seeking to reduce its investment in a subsidiary and it is considered highly probable that the Group will relinquish control of the subsidiary within 12 months of classication, the subsidiary is classied as held for sale.
On 1 January 2013 the Group adopted IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
This Standard defines fair value, sets out in a single IFRS a framework for measuring fair value, and requires disclosure about fair value measurements.
The main impact on the Group for the full year lies in the expansion of the fair value disclosure requirements.
Future developments IFRS 9, Financial Instruments issued in November 2009 now effective for annual periods commencing no earlier than 1 January 2018 is the first part of a new standard on classication and measurement of financial assets that will replace IAS 39.
IFRS 9 has two measurement categories: amortised cost and fair value.
All equity instruments are measured at fair value.
A debt instrument is at amortised cost only if the entity is holding it to collect contractual cash ows and the cash ows represent principal and interest, otherwise it must be measured at fair value through profit or loss.
The Standard retains most of the IAS 39 requirements for liabilities, including amortised cost accounting for most financial liabilities, with bifurcation of embedded derivatives.
The main change is that, in cases where the fair value option is taken for financial liabilities, the part of a fair value change due to an entitys own credit risk is recorded in other comprehensive income rather than the income statement, unless this creates an accounting mismatch.
The Group does not intend to early adopt this Standard.

These holdings include 983m 2012: 948m relating to four CDOs that were constructed in 2007 and 2008 in accordance with terms specified by Legal & General as part of a strategic review of the assets backing the annuity portfolio.
The Group selected at outset and manages the reference portfolios underlying the CDOs to give exposure to globally diversied portfolios of investment grade corporate bonds.
The Group is able to substitute the constituents of the original reference portfolios with new reference assets, allowing the management of the underlying credit risk and there have been no substitutions in 2012 or 2013.
A breakdown of the underlying CDO reference portfolio by sector is provided below: 2013 2012 Sector % % Banks 14 14 Utilities 10 10 Consumer Services & Goods 25 25 Financial Services 6 6 Technology & Telecoms 9 9 Insurance 6 6 Industrials 20 20 Oil & Gas 6 6 Health Care 4 4 100 100 The CDOs are termed as super senior since default losses on the reference portfolio have to exceed 27.5%, on average across the four CDOs, before the CDOs incur any default losses.
Assuming an average recovery rate of 30%, then over 39% of the reference names would have to default before the CDOs incur any default losses.
Beyond 27.5% of default losses on the reference portfolio, losses to the CDO would occur at a rate that is a multiple of the loss rate on the reference portfolio.
For illustration a 200m loss could be incurred if default losses to the reference portfolios exceeded 30.4% or if 43.5% of the names in the reference portfolio defaulted, with an average 30% recovery rate.
All gures are averages across the four CDOs.
The underlying reference portfolio has had no reference entity defaults in 2012 or 2013.
Losses are limited under the terms of the CDOs to assets and collateral invested.
These CDOs also incorporate features under which, in certain circumstances, the Group can choose either to post additional cash collateral or to allow wind up of the structures.
These features are dependent on the portfolios weighted average spreads, default experience to date and time to maturity.
No additional collateral was posted to any of the CDOs during 2013 2012: nil.
During 2013, the Group received nil 2012: nil of previously posted collateral.
The amount of the cash equivalent collateral attached to CDOs during the year is outlined in Note 14.
These CDOs are valued using an external valuation based on observable market inputs, which include CDX and iTraxx index tranches and CDS spreads on underlying reference entities.
This is then validated against the internal valuation.
The remaining balance of CDO holdings is 115m 2012: 149m.
A decrease is due to a disposal of an equity tranche of a bespoke CDO.

Were these loans to be held at fair value they would fall within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
iv Fair value hierarchy Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Fair value measurements are based on observable and unobservable inputs.
Observable inputs reect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reects the Groups view of market assumptions in the absence of observable market information.
The Group utilises techniques that maximise the use of observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs.
The levels of fair value measurement bases are dened as follows: Level 1: fair values measured using quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: fair values measured using valuation techniques for all inputs significant to the measurement other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3: fair values measured using valuation techniques for any input for the asset or liability significant to the measurement that is not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All of the Groups level 2 assets have been valued using standard market pricing sources, such as iBoxx, IDC and Bloomberg, which use mathematical modelling and multiple source validation in order to determine consensus prices, except for bespoke CDO and swaps holdings see below.
In normal market conditions, we would consider these market prices to be observable market prices.
Following consultation with our pricing providers and a number of their contributing brokers, we have considered that these prices are not from a suitably active market and have classied them as level 2.
These CDOs are valued using an external valuation based on observable market inputs, which include CDX and iTRaxx index tranches and CDS spreads on underlying reference entities.
Accordingly, these assets have also been classied in level 2.
There have been no significant transfers between level 1 and level 2 in 2013 2012: nil.

In many situations, inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or liability may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
In these situations, the Group determines the level in which the fair value falls based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the determination of the fair value.
As a result, both observable and unobservable inputs may be used in the determination of fair values that the Group has classied within level 3.
The Group determines the fair values of certain financial assets and liabilities based on quoted market prices, where available.
The Group also determines fair value based on estimated future cash ows discounted at the appropriate current market rate.
As appropriate, fair values reect adjustments for counterparty credit quality, the Groups credit standing, liquidity and risk margins on unobservable inputs.
Where quoted market prices are not available, fair value estimates are made at a point in time, based on relevant market data, as well as the best information about the individual financial instrument.
Illiquid market conditions have resulted in inactive markets for certain of the Groups financial instruments.
As a result, there is generally no or limited observable market data for these assets and liabilities.
Fair value estimates for financial instruments deemed to be in an illiquid market are based on judgments regarding current economic conditions, liquidity discounts, currency, credit and interest rate risks, loss experience and other factors.
These fair values are estimates and involve considerable uncertainty and variability as a result of the inputs selected and may differ signicantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed, and the differences could be material.
As a result, such calculated fair value estimates may not be realisable in an immediate sale or settlement of the instrument.
In addition, changes in the underlying assumptions used in the fair value measurement technique could signicantly affect these fair value estimates.
Fair values are subject to a control framework designed to ensure that input variables and outputs are assessed independent of the risk taker.
These inputs and outputs are reviewed and approved by a valuation committee.

Reasonably possible alternative valuations have been determined using alternative price earnings multiples.
Unquoted investments in property vehicles and direct holdings in investment property are valued by independent valuers on the basis of open market value as dened in the appraisal and valuation manual of the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors.
Valuation techniques may include discounted cash ow calculations using net current rent, and estimated rental and terminal values: they may also include yield methodology calculations using market rental values capitalised with a market capitalisation rate.
Both of these are then further validated against actual market transactions to produce a final valuation.

The Group uses derivatives such as foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures.
The Group uses hedge accounting, provided the prescribed criteria in IAS 39 are met, to recognise the offsetting effects of changes in the fair value or cash ow of the derivative instrument and the hedged item.
The Groups principal uses of hedge accounting are to: i recognise in shareholders equity the changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation.
Any cumulative gains and or losses are recognised in the income statement on disposal of the foreign operation: ii defer in equity the changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as the hedge of a future cash ow attributable to a recognised asset or liability, a highly probable forecast transaction, or a rm commitment until the period in which the future transaction affects profit or loss or is no longer expected to occur: and iii hedge the fair value movements in loans due to interest rate and exchange rate uctuations.
Any gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item and recognised in the income statement.
The relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, together with the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction, are documented at the inception of the transaction.
The effectiveness of the hedge is documented and monitored on an ongoing basis.
Hedge accounting is only applied for highly effective hedges between 80% and 125% effectiveness with any ineffective portion of the gain or loss recognised in the income statement, within other expenses, in the current period.
Certain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments which do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Where the risks and characteristics of derivatives embedded in other contracts are not closely related to those of the host contract and the whole contract is not carried at fair value, the derivative is separated from that host contract and measured at fair value, with fair value movements reected within investment return, unless the embedded derivative itself meets the denition of an insurance contract.

Expense Risk In pricing long term insurance business, Annuities In determining pricing assumptions, account is taken of changes in price indices assumptions are made as to the future cost and the costs of employment, with stress testing used to evaluate the effect of of product servicing.
Product servicing costs are monitored relative to the costs divergence in actual expenses experience assumed with the product pricing basis.
The principal risks and associated controls relevant to our LGA business are consistent with those identied for our LGAS and LGR businesses and therefore have not been repeated here.
Accumulation of risks There is limited potential for single incidents to give rise to a large number of claims across the different contract types written by the Group.
In particular, there is little significant overlap between the long term and short term insurance business written by the Group.
However, there are potentially material correlations of insurance risk with other types of risk exposure.
These correlations are difficult to estimate though they would tend to be more acute as the underlying risk scenarios became more extreme.
An example of the accumulation of risk is the correlation between reinsurer credit risk and mortality and morbidity exposures.
indd 166 14 03 2014 21:12 STRATEGIC REPORT STRATEGIC REPORT STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL OTHER INFORMATION OVERVIEW OUR PROGRESS OUR PERFORMANCE STATEMENTS BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 19 LONG TERM INSURANCE VALUATION ASSUMPTIONS The Groups insurance assumptions, described below, relate exclusively to the UK insurance business.
The non-UK businesses do not constitute a material component of the Groups operations and consideration of geographically determined assumptions is therefore not included.
i Non-participating business For its non-participating business the Group seeks to make prudent assumptions about its future experience based on current market conditions and recent experience.
The approach used to set non-participating assumptions is generally similar to that used to determine the assumptions used for PRA statutory Peak 1, although the actual assumptions may sometimes differ from those used for regulatory reporting purposes.
These assumptions incorporate prudent margins in excess of our best estimate assumptions to reduce the possibility of actual experience being less favourable than assumed.
Valuation rates of interest and discount rates The valuation interest rate for each contract type is based on the yield on the assets backing the contract adjusted for the risk that asset proceeds are not received by the Group.
For some business, this yield is the gross redemption yield on xed interest securities and the running yield on variable interest securities.
For other business it is the Internal Rate of Return on the portfolio of backing assets.
In 2013, the Group continued to hold an additional reserve to protect against the risk of an uplift in defaults in the current economic environment and also maintained the level of the long term default allowance at 40bps per annum 2012: 40bps for unapproved securities backing non profit business and 35bps per annum 2012: 35bps for unapproved securities backing non-participating with-profits business.
For approved securities and swaps backing the non profit business, the allowance increased to 9bps per annum 2012: 5bps.
For approved securities and swaps backing non-participating with-profits business the allowance increased to 5bps per annum 2012: 3bps.
For unapproved securities backing non profit annuity business, the credit default allowances equate to 56bps per annum 2012: 58bps when experienced over the duration of the assets held, leading to an overall total default provision of 1.8bn 2012: 1.7bn.
A similar methodology has been used for assets backing non-participating with-profits business.
The Group believes the total default allowance is prudent to cover all reasonably foreseeable circumstances.
For equity investments, the yield is based on the current dividend yield, adjusted for prudence.
For property holdings, yields are based on the rental income payable, adjusted for the cost of default.
Default rates used in the calculations vary by tenant category.
Mortality and morbidity Mortality and morbidity assumptions are set with reference to standard tables drawn up by the Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau CMIB of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, with an appropriate allowance for prudence.
These tables are based on industry-wide experience.
The majority of internal statistical investigations are carried out at least annually to determine the extent to which the Groups experience differs from that of the industry and suggest appropriate adjustments which need to be made to the valuation assumptions.
indd 167 14 03 2014 21:12 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 19 LONG TERM INSURANCE VALUATION ASSUMPTIONS CONTINUED Persistency The Group monitors its persistency experience and carries out detailed investigations annually.
Persistency can be volatile and past experience may not be an appropriate future indicator.
The Group tries to balance past experience and future conditions by making prudent assumptions about the future expected long term average persistency levels.
For non-participating contracts where explicit persistency assumptions are not made, prudence is also incorporated into the liabilities by ensuring that they are sufficient to cover the more onerous of the two scenarios where the policies either remain in-force until maturity or where they discontinue at the valuation date.
Expenses The Group monitors its expense experience and carries out detailed investigations regularly to determine the expenses incurred in writing and administering the different products and classes of business.
Adjustments may be made for known future changes in the administration processes, in line with the Groups business plan.
An allowance for expense ination in the future is also made, taking account of both salary and price information.
The expense assumptions also include an appropriate allowance for prudence.
Premiums For those contracts where the policyholder does not have the right to vary the amount of the premium paid, full credit is taken for the premiums contractually due at the valuation date.
For contracts where the policyholder has the option to vary the rate of premium, the provision is taken as being the higher of the amount calculated as if the policyholder continues to make premium payments or, alternatively, ceases to pay premiums altogether.
ii Participating business For its participating business, the Group seeks to establish its liabilities at their realistic value in line with the requirements set out in FRS 27.
Non-economic assumptions Non-economic assumptions are set to represent the Groups best estimates of future experience.
indd 168 14 03 2014 21:12 STRATEGIC REPORT STRATEGIC REPORT STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL OTHER INFORMATION OVERVIEW OUR PROGRESS OUR PERFORMANCE STATEMENTS BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Economic assumptions The PRAs realistic reporting regime requires a market consistent economic model.
The model is calibrated using market data from a variety of market sources.
This enables assumptions to be determined for the term structure of risk free interest rates, and for property and equity volatility.
Risk free interest rates are determined with reference to the gilt yield curve on the valuation date increased by ten basis points.
Property volatility is set with reference to historic variations in property prices.
Equity volatility is set so that the model reproduces observed market prices of traded equity derivatives.
Correlations between asset classes are based on historic data.
Each investment scenario contains a consistent set of assumptions for investment returns and ination.
Future bonuses Future reversionary and terminal bonuses are consistent with the bonus policies set out in Societys Principles and Practices of Financial Management PPFM.
Guaranteed annuity options The guarantees are valued on a market consistent basis.
The valuation methodology allows for the correlation between interest rates and the proportion of the policyholders who take up the option.
Guaranteed cash options The liability is determined assuming that policyholders choose the most valuable alternative between the annuity and cash available at retirement.
Value of in-force non-participating contracts The Group makes a deduction from the liabilities for the expected value of future profits arising on non-participating contracts written in the with-profits part of the Society Long Term Fund.
The economic assumptions used to calculate the value of these profits are consistent with those used to calculate liabilities for with-profits business, with the addition of a liquidity premium in respect of assets backing non-participating annuity business.
Non-economic assumptions represent best estimates of expected future experience on this business.
An explicit allowance is made for non-market risk.

indd 170 14 03 2014 21:12 STRATEGIC REPORT STRATEGIC REPORT STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL OTHER INFORMATION OVERVIEW OUR PROGRESS OUR PERFORMANCE STATEMENTS BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Persistency assumptions Lapse rates assumptions are used in the PRA statutory Peak 1 valuation of certain classes of long term business.
Where this is the case, the valuation persistency basis is set by applying a prudential margin over the best estimate assumptions.
The tables below show the major products where lapse rates have been used.
For term assurance business, the margin acts to increase the best estimate lapse rate in the early part of a policys lifetime when it is treated as an asset but to reduce the best estimate lapse rate later in the policys lifetime when it is treated as a liability.
The crossover point at which the margin changes direction is assessed for broad product groups but applied at a policy by policy level.
Any liability to reinsurers on discontinuance within the first four years from inception is allowed for explicitly in the cash ows, using the valuation lapse basis, together with a prudent allowance for clawback of commission from agents upon lapse.
For unitised business, the margin acts to either increase or decrease the best estimate lapse rates, depending upon which approach results in the higher liability.
The direction of the margin is assessed for unit life business and unit pensions business separately.
A summary of the lapse basis for major classes of business participating and non-participating, as dened by the requirements of the annual returns to the PRA, is shown below.

The participating funds have been excluded in the above sensitivity analysis as the impact of the sensitivities on IFRS profit and equity is offset by the movement in the unallocated divisible surplus UDS.
The shareholders share of with-profit bonus declared in the year is relatively insensitive to market movements due to the smoothing policies applied.
The above sensitivity analyses do not reect management actions which could be taken to reduce the impacts.
The Group seeks to actively manage its asset and liability position.
A change in market conditions may lead to changes in the asset allocation or charging structure which may have a more, or less, significant impact on the value of the liabilities.
The analyses also ignore any second order effects of the assumption change, including the potential impact on the Group asset and liability position and any second order tax effects.
In calculating the alternative values, all other assumptions are left unchanged, though in practice, items of the Groups experience may be correlated.
The sensitivity of the profit and equity to changes in assumptions may not be linear.
These results should not be extrapolated to changes of a much larger order.
The interest rate sensitivity assumes a 100 basis point change in the gross redemption yield on xed interest securities together with a 100 basis point change in the real yields on variable securities.
For the UK long-term funds, valuation interest rates are assumed to move in line with market yields adjusted to allow for the impact of PRA regulations.
The interest rate sensitivities reect the impact of the regulatory restrictions on the reinvestment rate used to value the liabilities of the long-term business.
In the sensitivity for credit spreads, corporate bond yields have increased by 100bps, gilt and approved security yields are unchanged, and there has been no adjustment to the default assumptions.
The ination stress adopted is a 1% pa increase in ination resulting in a 1% pa reduction in real yield and no change to the nominal yield.
In addition the expense ination rate is increased by 1% pa.
The equity stress is a 10% fall in listed equity market values.
The property stress adopted is a 10% fall in property market value.
Rental income is assumed to be unchanged: however the vacant possession value is stressed down by 10% in line with the market value stress.
Where property is being used to back liabilities, the valuation interest rate used to place a value on the liabilities moves with the implied change in property yields.
The annuitant mortality stress is a 1% reduction in the mortality rates for immediate and deferred annuitants with no change to the mortality improvement rates.
The credit default stress assumes a -10bps stress to the current credit default assumption for unapproved corporate bonds which will have an impact on the valuation interest rates used to discount liabilities.
The credit default assumption is set based on the credit rating of the individual bonds in the asset portfolio and their outstanding term using Moodys global credit default rates.
For the sensitivity to the default of the Groups largest reinsurer, the reinsurer stress shown is equal to the technical provisions ceded to the reinsurer and represents the impact of the default of largest reinsurer at an entity level.
Details of IGD sensitivity analysis can be found in Table 2 of Note 29.
The Group also uses embedded value financial statements information to manage risk.
The effect of alternative assumptions on the long-term embedded value, prepared in accordance with the guidance issued by the European Insurance CFO Forum in October 2005 are contained in Note 8 of the European Embedded Value section.

A number of insurance and investment contracts contain discretionary participating features DPF which entitle the policyholders to receive guaranteed benets as well as additional benets: the amount or timing of which is contractually at the discretion of the Group: and which are contractually based on: the performance of a specified pool of contracts or a specified type of contract: realised and or unrealised investment returns on a specified pool of assets held by the issuer: or the profit or loss of the Company, fund or other entity which issues the contract.
Contracts with DPF are referred to as participating contracts.
With-profits contracts in the UK and most Garantie Long Terme contracts in France are classied as participating.
Long term insurance Under current IFRS requirements, insurance contract liabilities are measured using local Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP, as permitted by IFRS 4, Insurance contracts.
UK In the UK, insurance contract liabilities are determined following an annual investigation of the long term funds LTFs in accordance with regulatory requirements.
For non-participating insurance contracts, the liabilities are calculated on the basis of current information using the gross premium valuation method.
This brings into account the full premiums receivable under contracts written, having prudent regard to expected lapses and surrenders, estimated renewal and maintenance costs and contractually guaranteed benets.
For unit linked insurance contract liabilities the provision is based on the fund value together with an allowance for any excess of future expenses over charges where appropriate.
For participating contracts, the liabilities to policyholders are determined on a realistic basis in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard FRS 27, Life assurance.
This includes an assessment of the cost of any future options and guarantees granted to policyholders valued on a market consistent basis.
The calculation also takes account of bonus decisions which are consistent with Legal & General Assurance Society Limiteds Societys Principles and Practices of Financial Management PPFM.
The shareholders share of the future cost of bonuses is excluded from the assessment of the realistic liability.
In determining the realistic value of liabilities for participating contracts, the value of future profits on non-participating business written in the with-profits part of the fund is accounted for as part of the calculation.
The present value of future profits VIF for this business is separately determined and its value is deducted from the sum of the liabilities for participating contracts and the unallocated divisible surplus.
Unitised liabilities are recognised when premiums are received and non-unitised liabilities are recognised when premiums are due.
Overseas The long term insurance contract liabilities for business transacted by overseas subsidiaries are determined on the basis of recognised actuarial methods which reect local supervisory principles or, in the case of the US, on the basis of US GAAP.
General insurance Liabilities, together with related reinsurance recoveries, are established on the basis of current information.
Such liabilities can never be denitive as to their timing or the amount of claims and are therefore subject to subsequent reassessment on a regular basis.
Claims and related reinsurance recoveries are accounted for in respect of all incidents up to the year end.
indd 175 14 03 2014 21:15 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 21 INSURANCE CONTRACT LIABILITIES CONTINUED Liability adequacy tests The Group performs liability adequacy testing on its insurance liabilities to ensure that the carrying amount of liabilities less related deferred acquisition costs is sufficient to cover current estimates of future cash ows.
When performing the liability adequacy test, the Group discounts all contractual cash ows and compares this amount with the carrying value of the liability.
Any deficiency is immediately charged to the income statement, initially reducing deferred acquisition costs and then by establishing a provision for losses.
Reinsurance The Groups insurance subsidiaries cede insurance premiums and risk in the normal course of business in order to limit the potential for losses and to provide nancing.
Outwards reinsurance premiums are accounted for in the same accounting period as the related premiums for the direct or inwards reinsurance business being reinsured.
Reinsurance assets include balances due from reinsurers for paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, ceded unearned premiums and ceded future life policy benets.
Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claim liability associated with the reinsured policy.
Reinsurance is recorded as an asset in the consolidated balance sheet unless a right of offset exists, in which case the associated liabilities are reduced commensurately.

Amounts under unit linked contracts are generally repayable on demand and the Group is responsible for ensuring there is sufficient liquidity within the asset portfolio to enable liabilities to unit linked policyholders to be met as they fall due.
However, the terms of funds investing in less liquid assets permit the deferral of redemptions for predened periods in circumstances where there are not sufficient liquid assets within the fund to meet the level of requested redemptions.
Accordingly, unit linked liabilities have been excluded from the table.

In the UK, participating investment contract liabilities are determined in accordance with FRS 27, including a value for guarantees, in the same way as participating insurance contracts.
Non-participating investment contracts are unit linked contracts.
Unit linked liabilities are measured at fair value by reference to the value of the underlying net asset values of the Groups unitised investment funds at the balance sheet date.
Claims are not included in the income statement but are deducted from investment contract liabilities.
The movement in investment contract liabilities consists of claims incurred in the period less the corresponding elimination of the policyholder liability originally recognised in the balance sheet and the investment return credited to policyholders.

Borrowings classied as liabilities are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
The difference between the net proceeds and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the borrowing period using the effective interest method.
Borrowings comprise core borrowings such as tier 1 and tier 2 bond issues, short and long term unsecured senior debt such as long dated bond issues.
Operational borrowings also includes borrowings secured on commercial paper issuance and bank borrowings under both committed and uncommitted debt facilities including bank overdrafts.
Borrowings secured on specic assets cash ows such as Triple X securitisations and private equity fund linked partnership assets are included as non recourse borrowings.
Mortgage loans raised by SIPP clients secured on those properties invested in their portfolio of linked SIPP investments which we manage on their behalf are treated as unit linked borrowings.

The assets of all UK dened benefit schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds which are subject to regular actuarial valuation every three years, updated by formal reviews at reporting dates.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of dened benefit pension schemes is the present value of the dened benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, provided any surplus in the fund is not restricted.
Plan assets exclude any insurance contracts issued by the Group.
The dened benefit obligation is calculated actuarially each year using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the dened benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outows.
The discount rate is based on market yields of high quality corporate bonds which are denominated in the currency in which the benets will be paid, and that have terms to maturity which approximate to those of the related pension liability.
Where the unallocated divisible surplus or equity holders funds are affected as a result of actuarial gains and losses on the dened benefit pension scheme, the charge or credit is not recognised in the income statement but through the statement of comprehensive income.

On 1 December 2008, the conditions of the Fund and Scheme were amended to cap future pensionable salary increases at a maximum of 2.5% each year with effect from 1 January 2009: benets accrued before that date have an underpin of the early leaver benets.

The total amount of actuarial losses net of tax recognised in the statement of comprehensive income for the year was 145 m: cumulative 647 m 2012: 101 m: cumulative 502 m. Actuarial losses net of tax relating to with-profits policyholders of 49 m 2012: 38 m have been allocated to the unallocated divisible surplus.
In 2013, a curtailment is recognised in the UK schemes due to the assignment of annuities to members with small pensions following the purchase of additional annuities in respect of future increments for them.
In line with the requirements of IFRS, the surplus in the Legal & General Nederland Stichting Pensioenfonds of 3m 2012: 3m has not been reected in the net dened benefit deficit.
In 2012, a curtailment was recognised with regard to employees in the Legal & General Nederland Stichting Pensioenfonds scheme, where future indexation accrued to existing pension rights had become conditional.
The mortality base assumptions are aligned with those used by the schemes trustees at the last valuation, but a more up to date improvement rate is used.
The effect of assuming reasonable alternative assumptions in isolation to the gross dened benefit pension deficit are shown below.

For relevant non-participating investment contracts, a liability for the present value of this future commission cost is recognised in the balance sheet on inception of the contract.
The present value of future commission costs is deferred as an asset and amortised over the period during which the related revenue will be recognised.
At each subsequent reporting date the liability is remeasured to fair value because this financial liability is part of a portfolio of unit linked assets and liabilities whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis.
Any increase in the liability is recognised as an additional deferred cost.
Any change in lapse assumptions or revisions to the underlying assumptions for future cash ows will be reected in the fair value movement for a period.
If the future commission liability decreases, a corresponding adjustment is made to the amortisation of the asset.

This liability has been determined using the net present value of the future commission which will be payable on fund values.
This valuation technique uses assumptions which are consistent with the Groups effective rate of interest, investment return assumptions and persistency assumptions used in other valuations, but it is not determined by reference to published price quotations.
The undiscounted value which is expected to be paid at maturity in respect of such commission is 247m 2012: 248m.
Payables and other financial liabilities settled after 12 months are expected to be settled within five years with the exception of derivative liabilities, as disclosed in Note 13.

indd 193 14 03 2014 21:15 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 28 OPERATIONAL RISK Operational risk is dened as exposure to loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems, or from external events.
Potential for exposure to operational risk extends to all the Groups businesses.
All business managers are required to confirm regularly the adequacy of controls to mitigate those operational risks relevant to their responsibilities.
significant control issues are escalated to senior and executive management through the Groups risk management framework.
The framework is supported by Risk Oversight teams which facilitate the identication, assessment, monitoring and control of risks across the Groups businesses.
There are a number of categories under which operational risk and its management across the Group can be considered, and these are outlined in the following paragraphs.
Internal process failure The Group is potentially exposed to the risk of loss from failure of the internal processes with which it transacts its business.
Each business division is responsible for ensuring the adequacy of the controls over its processes.
Regular reviews are undertaken of their appropriateness and effectiveness.
People The Group is potentially exposed to the risk of loss from inappropriate actions by its staff.
Recruitment is managed centrally by HR functions, and all new recruits undergo a formal induction programme.
All employees have job descriptions setting out their accountabilities and reporting lines, and are appraised annually in accordance with agreed performance management frameworks.
Employees in regulated subsidiaries are provided with appropriate training to enable them to meet the relevant regulatory requirements.
Risks relating to health and safety and other legislation are managed through the provision of relevant training to all staff.
Outsourcing The Group is potentially exposed to the actions or failure of suppliers contracted to provide services on an outsourced basis.
The Group has dened minimum standards of control to be applied for all outsourced arrangements within a formal outsourcing and critical supplier policy.
Legal Legal risk is the risk of loss from unclear or deficient product documentation: inadequate documentation in support of material contracts such as reassurance treaties: the incorrect interpretation of changes in legislation: employment related disputes and claims: and commercial disputes with suppliers.
The risks are managed through the Group Legal Risk framework, which defines minimum standards of control to be applied to minimise the risk of loss.
Compliance Compliance risk within the Group relates to the risk of non-adherence to legislative requirements, regulations and internal policies and procedures.
Responsibility for ensuring adherence to relevant legal and regulatory requirements is vested in individual business managers.
The Regulatory Risk and Compliance functions have oversight of the Groups compliance with conduct of business requirements and standards, providing policy advice and guidance and oversight of compliance arrangements and responsibilities.
Event Event risk relates to the potential for loss arising from significant external events such as terrorism, financial crisis, major changes in scal systems or disaster.
Typically, such events have a low likelihood of occurrence, a material impact and can be difficult to prevent.
The Groups risk mitigation focuses on minimising the business disruption and potential financial loss which may ensue from such an event.
This includes maintaining a framework for the management of major incidents, the maintenance and regular testing of detailed business, technical and location recovery plans and the provision of insurance cover for the loss of buildings, contents and information technology systems and for the increased cost of working in the event of business disruption.
indd 194 14 03 2014 21:15 STRATEGIC REPORT STRATEGIC REPORT STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL OTHER INFORMATION OVERVIEW OUR PROGRESS OUR PERFORMANCE STATEMENTS BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Fraud The Group is potentially exposed to the risk of internal fraud, claims-related fraud, and external action by third parties.
The risk of internal fraud is managed through a number of processes including the screening of staff at recruitment, segregation of duties and management oversight.
The activities of Internal Audit also act to counter the risk.
Claims-related fraud is managed by ensuring business processes are designed to fully validate claims and ensure that only bona fide claims are settled.
Anti-fraud techniques are regularly updated to mitigate risks and emerging threats.
The Groups approach to mitigating fraud and other dishonest acts is supported by promoting an open and honest culture in all dealings between employees, managers and those parties with which the Group has contact.
A formal code of ethics sets out the Groups expectations in this respect.
Effective and honest communication is essential if malpractice is to be effectively dealt with.
The Group has dened whistle blowing procedures to enable all employees and those who work with Legal & General to raise matters of concern relating to Legal & General in confidence.
Technology The Group places a high degree of reliance on IT in its business activities.
The failure of IT systems could potentially expose the Group to significant business disruption and loss.
To mitigate this risk, standards and methodologies for developing, testing and operating IT systems are maintained.
Disaster recovery facilities enable IT operations to be conducted at remote locations in the event of the loss of computer facilities.
Contagion The potential for contagion risk arises as a consequence of the use of a common brand across the majority of the Group and the provision of intra-group loans and indemnities.
The Group has dened policies and procedures for managing matters that may have reputational implications, to ensure that Legal & Generals position is correctly understood.
The Group also has dened policies for the provision of guarantees, indemnities and letters of comfort.
indd 195 14 03 2014 21:15 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 29 MANAGEMENT OF CAPITAL RESOURCES Capital structure From a regulatory perspective the Group is required to measure and monitor its capital resources on an ongoing basis and to comply with the minimum capital requirements of regulators in each territory in which we operate.
At 31 December 2013, Legal & Generals unaudited Insurance Group Directive IGD capital resources were 4.0bn 2012: 4.1bn in excess of capital requirements of 3.3bn 2012: 3.1bn, representing a solvency coverage ratio of 222% 2012: 234%.
This surplus capital is after accruing for a 2013 final dividend of 408m 2012: 337m.
The Group writes a range of long term insurance and investment business in the long term fund LTF of its main operating insurance subsidiary, Legal & General Assurance Society Limited Society.
This fund is segregated from the Groups other assets.
The fund includes participating with-profits business where policyholders and shareholders share in the risks and rewards, and non-participating non profit business, where the shareholders receive profits or incur losses.
Capital in excess of the amount required to cover the liabilities is currently held within Society.
This capital provides support for new and existing non profit business within our UK non profit LGAS and Retirement businesses.
The non-linked, non profit pensions and annuity business of Society is ceded, on arms length terms, to a wholly owned Insurance Special Purpose Vehicle ISPV, Legal & General Pensions Limited LGPL.
Whilst an ISPV is not required to segregate policyholder assets within a LTF, LGPL continues to manage policyholder and shareholder assets separately for internal purposes.
Managed pension fund business is written through Legal & General Assurance Pensions Management Limited PMC, which is a life company writing predominantly non-participating group pension business effected by trustees of occupational schemes in the UK or their equivalent overseas.
The assets are held in a LTF and are separate from other assets within the Group.
In addition, the Group operates three UK long term insurance businesses acquired in 2013 Lucida Limited and in 2008 Nationwide Life Limited and Suffolk Life Annuities Limited.
General insurance business is written in the UK by Legal & General Insurance Limited, and long term insurance business is also written by LGA, LGN and LGF.
Capital management policies and objectives The Group aims to manage its capital resources to maintain financial strength, policyholder security and relative external ratings advantage.
The Group also seeks to maximise its financial exibility by maintaining strong liquidity and by utilising a range of alternative sources of capital including equity, senior debt, subordinated debt and reinsurance.
Capital measures The Group measures its capital on a number of different bases, including those which comply with the regulatory frameworks within which the Group operates and those which the directors consider most appropriate for managing the business.
The measures used by the Group include: Accounting bases Management use the primary financial statements prepared on an IFRS basis to manage capital and cash ow usage and to determine dividend paying capacity.
In addition, the supplementary accounts prepared using EEV principles provide further insight into the value of the business to shareholders.
Accordingly the Groups net asset value and total capital employed are also analysed and measured on this basis.
Regulatory bases The financial strength of the Groups insurance subsidiaries is measured under various local regulatory requirements see below.
One of these regulatory measures, Individual Capital Assessment ICA, measures capital using risk based stochastic techniques, and provides a measure of the level of economic capital required to run the Groups business.
Basis of regulatory capital and corresponding regulatory capital requirements In each country in which the Group operates, the local insurance regulator species rules and guidance for the minimum amount and type of capital which must be held by long term insurance subsidiaries in excess of their insurance liabilities.
The minimum required capital must be maintained at all times throughout the year.
This helps to ensure that payments to policyholders can be made as they fall due.
indd 196 14 03 2014 21:15 STRATEGIC REPORT STRATEGIC REPORT STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL OTHER INFORMATION OVERVIEW OUR PROGRESS OUR PERFORMANCE STATEMENTS BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED The required capital is calculated by either assessing the additional assets which would be required to meet the insurance companys liabilities in specified, stressed financial conditions, or by applying xed percentages to the insurance companys liabilities and risk exposures.
The requirements in the different jurisdictions in which the Group operates are detailed below: UK regulatory basis Required capital for the life business is based on PRA rules.
Society must hold assets in excess of the higher of two amounts: the first being calculated using the PRA rules specified by the Regulator pillar 1, the second being an economic capital assessment by the Company which is reviewed by the PRA pillar 2, otherwise known as ICA.
The public pillar 1 capital calculation is calculated by applying xed percentages to liabilities and sums assured at risk or setting aside a proportion of expenses Peak 1.
There are further stress tests for participating business, as measured in the Realistic Balance Sheet Peak 2, which may increase the required capital under Peak 1 calculations.
The private pillar 2 capital calculation is an assessment of the economic capital required to ensure that the Company can meet its liabilities, with a high likelihood, as they fall due.
This is achieved by application of stochastic modelling and scenario testing.
The result is reviewed and may be modied by the PRA.
Regulatory capital for the general insurance business is also calculated using PRA pillar 1 and pillar 2 requirements.
The pillar 1 calculation applies xed percentages to premiums and claims.
Pillar 2 creates a higher capital requirement and is therefore applied in this business.
Internally, the Group have developed economic capital models to meet the future Solvency II requirements.
The Group has sufficient capital to meet its economic capital requirements with respect to risks inherent in long-term insurance operations.
This risk based measure is considered by management in the internal decision making process.
US regulatory basis Required capital is determined to be the Company Action Level Risk Based Capital RBC based on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners RBC model.
RBC is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations, taking into account its size and risk prole.
The calculation is based on applying factors to various asset, premium, claim, expense and reserve items, with higher factors used for those items with greater underlying risk and lower factors for less risky items.
French and Dutch regulatory bases The minimum required capital is dened by the French Ministry of Finances Code des Assurances and the fide Nederlandsche Bank N. V. Dutch Supervisory Body respectively.
The basis of the calculation is a percentage of the liabilities plus a percentage of the sum assured at risk and, for some contracts, the premium.
The percentages depend on the guarantees given and the amount of reinsurance cover.
Group regulatory basis In addition to the regulatory capital calculations for the individual rms, the Group is required to comply with the requirements of the Insurance Groups Directive IGD.
Available regulatory capital resources Capital resources available to meet regulatory UK capital requirements are determined using PRA valuation rules.
The asset valuation rules are based on applicable GAAP, adjusted for admissibility, counterparty exposure limits and specic valuation differences.
The Groups regulatory capital position statement in Table 1 sets out the different sources of capital held within the Group.
The Groups total available capital resources, under FRS 27 requirements, are 6.6bn 2012: 6.6bn of which 4.5bn 2012: 4.2bn is held by the life businesses.
The use of capital held by the UK and overseas life businesses is generally constrained by local regulatory requirements, and may not be available to provide funding for other businesses.
The total available capital resources of the Groups with-profits business with-profits estate is determined in accordance with the Realistic Balance Sheet rules prescribed by the PRA.
At 31 December 2013, the excess of realistic assets over realistic liabilities was 0.8bn 2012: 0.7bn.
The capital resources reect the surplus in that part of the fund which is in excess of any constructive obligation to policyholders.
The liabilities within the Consolidated Balance Sheet do not include the amount representing the shareholders share of future bonuses.

Capital resources are also sensitive to assumptions and experience relating to mortality and morbidity and, to a lesser extent, expenses and persistency.
The most significant sensitivities arise from the following four risks: market risk in relation to UK participating business which would crystallise if adverse changes in the value of the assets supporting this business could not be fully reected in payments to policyholders because of the effect of guarantees and options.
The capital position of this business would also deteriorate if increases to the market cost of derivatives resulted in an increase in the liability for guarantees and options in the realistic balance sheet.
market risk in relation to the UK annuity business, which would crystallise if the return from the xed interest investments supporting this business were lower than that assumed for reserving.
mortality risk in relation to the UK annuity business, which would crystallise if the mortality of annuitants improved more rapidly than the assumptions used for reserving.
mortality risk in relation to the UK and US term assurance businesses, which would crystallise if mortality of the lives insured was higher than that assumed, possibly because of an epidemic.
A range of management actions is available to mitigate any adverse impact from changing market conditions and experience, including changes to with-profits bonus rates, changes to discretionary surrender terms and charging for guarantees.
To the extent that management actions are expected only to offset partially adverse experience, then liabilities would be increased to anticipate the future impact of the adverse experience and total capital resources would be reduced.

The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the awards, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments which are expected to become exercisable.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, and a corresponding adjustment is made to equity.
On vesting or exercise, the difference between the expense charged to the income statement and the actual cost to the Group is transferred to retained earnings.
Where new shares are issued, the proceeds received are credited to share capital and share premium.
i Description of schemes The Group provides a number of equity settled share-based long term incentive plans for directors and eligible employees.
Options are normally forfeited if the employee leaves the Group.

The grant price is equal to 80% of the quoted market price of the Group shares on the invitation date.
Fair value is calculated using the Black-Scholes model.
Conditional shares can be granted to top managers under the Performance share plan PSP, based upon individual and Company performance.
Under the PSP, the number of performance shares transferred to the individual at the end of the three year vesting period is dependent on the Groups relative Total shareholder return TSR.
The Company share option scheme CSOP, approved by HMRC, and unapproved Executive share option scheme ESOS are designed to provide a long term incentive to directors and managers of the Group.
The number of options granted is based on the managers grade, salary and performance.
In order for the options to be exercisable, Legal & Generals TSR must exceed the median TSR of the FTSE 100 for a period of at least three years commencing on the date of the grant.
Fair value is calculated using a binomial model, reecting the historic exercise patterns.

Recipients of restricted shares are entitled to both vote and receive dividends.
Fair value is calculated as the market value on the grant date, adjusted to reect the eligibility for dividend payments.
Under the Employee share plan ESP, approved by HMRC, permanent UK employees may elect to purchase Group shares from the market at the prevailing market price on a monthly basis.
The Group supplements the number of shares purchased by giving employees one free matching share for every one partnership share purchased up to the first 20 of the employees contributions and one free matching share for every two partnership shares purchased with contributions between 20 and 125.
From time to time, the Group may make a grant of free shares.
Both the free and matching shares must be held in trust for three years before they may vest to the employee.
The fair value of granted shares is equal to the market value at grant date.
The fair values of the share grants made during the year have been calculated using the following assumptions: SAYE SAYE PSP Award date 1-Oct-13 10-Apr-13 17-Apr-13 Weighted average share price 197p 171p 167p Weighted average exercise price 160p 136p n a Expected volatility 35%-41% 37%-42% n a Expected life 3-5 years 3-5 years 3 years Risk free investment rate 0.85%-1.55% 0.37%-0.75% n a Dividend yield 4.3% pa 4.8% pa n a ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 217 80038 L&G p204-227.

It follows that a financial instrument is treated as equity if: there is no contractual obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or liabilities on unfavourable terms: and the instrument is either a non-derivative which contains no contractual obligation to deliver a variable number of own equity instruments, or is a derivative which will be settled only by the Group exchanging a xed amount of cash, or other financial assets, for a xed number of its own equity instruments.
Where any Group entity purchases the Companys equity share capital, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes, is deducted from equity attributable to shareholders.
Where such shares are subsequently sold, reissued or otherwise disposed of, any consideration received is included in equity attributable to shareholders, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects.
Shares held on behalf of employee share schemes are disclosed as such on the balance sheet.

indd 221 14 03 2014 21:20 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION CONTINUED 42 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES, GUARANTEES AND INDEMNITIES Provision for the liabilities arising under contracts with policyholders is based on certain assumptions.
The variance between actual experience from that assumed may result in those liabilities differing from the provisions made for them.
Liabilities may also arise in respect of claims relating to the interpretation of policyholder contracts, or the circumstances in which policyholders have entered into them.
The extent of these liabilities is inuenced by a number of factors including the actions and requirements of the PRA, ombudsman rulings, industry compensation schemes and court judgments.
Various Group companies receive claims and become involved in actual or threatened litigation and regulatory issues from time to time.
The relevant members of the Group ensure that they make prudent provision as and when circumstances calling for such provision become clear, and that each has adequate capital and reserves to meet reasonably foreseeable eventualities.
The provisions made are regularly reviewed.
It is not possible to predict, with certainty, the extent and the timing of the financial impact of these claims, litigation or issues.
In 1975, Legal & General Assurance Society Limited the Society was required by the Institute of London Underwriters ILU to execute the ILU form of guarantee in respect of policies issued through the ILUs Policy Signing Ofce on behalf of NRG Victory Reinsurance Company Ltd Victory, a company which was then a subsidiary of the Society.
In 1990, Nederlandse Reassurantie Groep Holding NV the assets and liabilities of which have since been assumed by Nederlandse Reassurantie Groep NV under a statutory merger in the Netherlands acquired Victory and provided an indemnity to the Society against any liability the Society may have as a result of the ILUs requirement, and the ILU agreed that its requirement of the Society would not apply to policies written or renewed after the acquisition.
Nederlandse Reassurantie Groep NV is now owned by Columbia Insurance Company, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
Whether the Society has any liability as a result of the ILUs requirement and, if so, the amount of its potential liability is uncertain.
The Society has made no payment or provision in respect of this matter.
Group companies have given indemnities and guarantees as a normal part of their business and operating activities or in relation to capital market transactions.
Legal & General Group Plc has provided indemnities and guarantees in respect of the liabilities of Group companies in support of their business activities, including Pension Protection Fund compliant guarantees in respect of certain Group companies liabilities under the Group pension fund and scheme.

profits or losses of subsidiary undertakings sold or acquired during the period are included in the consolidated results up to the date of disposal or from the date of gaining control.
The interests of parties, other than the Group, in investment vehicles, such as unit trusts, are classied as liabilities and appear as Net asset value attributable to unit holders in the consolidated balance sheet.
The basis by which subsidiaries are consolidated in the Group financial statements is outlined in the basis of preparation Note 1.
Future Developments IFRS 10, Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 11, Joint Arrangements and IFRS 12, Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities, together with amendments to IAS 28, Associates and joint ventures effective in the EU for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
This suite of standards: Provides enhanced guidance when determining whether an entity is controlled and is therefore included within the consolidated financial statements.
Provides a more realistic reection of joint arrangements by focusing on the rights and obligations of the arrangement, rather than its legal form.
Enhances the disclosure requirements around interests in other entities.
As a result of the implementation of these new standards the Group is likely to consolidate some investment vehicles that were previously not consolidated, while also increasing the level of disclosures required in respect of the Groups interest in other entities.
We estimate the impact of the change on the 2013 Consolidated Balance Sheet to be to increase the reported gross assets by 1.6bn with a commensurate increase in liabilities of 1.4bn and minority interests of 0.2bn.
The impact on profit attributable to equity holders is nil.
