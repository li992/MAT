Trade and other payables excludes deferred income, payments received in excess of amounts recoverable on contracts, tax and social security and other nonfinancial liabilities.
The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are determined as follows: The fair values of non-current available for sale financial assets represent the value of their discounted cash ows, which have been calculated using market assumptions of the likely period to redemption and movements in UK house prices.
The fair value of current available for sale financial assets are calculated using the unadjusted quoted price of units in the property fund obtained from independent brokers.
Derivative financial instruments are measured at the present value of future cash ows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates.
The fair values of other non-derivative financial assets and liabilities are determined based on discounted cash ow analysis using current market rates for similar instruments.
Trade and other payables include land payables, which may bear interest on a contract speci c basis, and items secured by legal charge as disclosed in note 20.
The following table provides an analysis of financial liabilities that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
