Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2013 1.
GENERAL INFORMATION John Laing Infrastructure Fund Limited the Company, or JLIF is a company domiciled and incorporated in Guernsey, Channel Islands, whose shares are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange under a Premium Listing.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company as at and for the year ended 31 December 2013 comprise the Company and its recourse subsidiaries together referred to as the Consolidated Group.
The Consolidated Group invests in PPP infrastructure projects in the UK, Continental Europe and North America.
During the year, the Group has early adopted Investment Entities Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27.
These amendments, endorsed by the European Union EU on 20 November 2013, are effective from 1 January 2014.
As a result of adopting the amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27, the Company no longer consolidates its investments in PPP assets that are subsidiaries on a line-by-line basis, but recognises them as Investments at fair value through profit or loss.
The Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2012 included in this annual report have been restated to reflect the adoption of Investment Entities Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27.
Restated financial results at 31 December 2012 and 1 January 2012 approximate to the results presented as the Investment Group as at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011 respectively within the statutory accounts for the years ended 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011.
These Financial Statements are presented in Sterling which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.
In accordance with section 244 5 of the Company Guernsey Law, 2008, as the Directors have prepared consolidated accounts for the year, they have not prepared individual accounts for the Company in accordance with section 243 for the year.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES a Basis of accounting The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Guernsey Law 2008 and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the EU and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU International Accounting Standards IAS Regulation.
The adoption of the following new and revised interpretations and amendments has not led to any changes in the Groups accounting policies or had any material impact on these financial statements: IAS 1 June 2011 : Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income IAS 12 December 2010 : Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets IAS 19: Employee Benets IFRS 1: Government Loans IFRS 7:  Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities IFRIC 20: Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine Changes in accounting policy In the current period, the Group has adopted the following accounting standards: Improvements to IFRSs 2009-2011 May 2012 : Improvements to IFRS 1, IAS 1, IAS 16, IAS 32 and IAS 34 IFRS 10 May 2011 : Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS 11 May 2011 : Joint Arrangements IFRS 12 May 2011 : Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities IAS 27 May 2011 : Separate Financial Statements IAS 28 May 2011 : Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures Amendments to IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities and IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements IFRS 13 May 2011 : Fair Value Measurement 50.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2013 2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED a Basis of accounting continued Investment Entities Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 The Investment Entities standard introduced an exception to the principle that all subsidiaries shall be consolidated.
The amendments define an investment entity and require a parent entity that is an investment entity to measure its subsidiaries at fair value through profit or loss, in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement instead of consolidating those subsidiaries.
The Directors determined that the Company meets the denition of an investment entity and decided to adopt early the amendments to IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities and IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements which are effective for period commencing on or after 1 January 2014.
In order to reach this conclusion, the Directors gave consideration to and agreed that the Company meets the following key characteristics of an investment entity: a The Company invests solely for the purpose of capital appreciation, investment income, or both: b The Company does not plan to hold its investments indefinitely: it holds them for a limited period, i. e. there is an exit strategy: c The Company measures and evaluates the performance of substantially all its investments on a fair value basis: and d The Recourse Group i. e. the group holding companies should be consolidated on a line by line basis as these entities provide services that relate to the investment Entitys investment activities.
The Directors believe that the treatment of consolidation adopted in these accounts is the most appropriate to the groups circumstances as the transactions of both the Company and the Group are relevant to investors.
Following the adoption of the amendments and determination that the Company is an investment entity, the Company no longer consolidates on a line by line basis its subsidiary interests in PPP assets, but recognises them as investments at fair value through profit or loss.
The Recourse Group comprises the Company and its two wholly owned Luxembourg subsidiaries JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. and JLIF Luxco 2 S.. r. l., the English Limited Partnership JLIF Limited Partnership and 21 wholly owned subsidiaries of the English Limited Partnership, each of which perform investment activities and or investment related services.
The Investment Entities standard states that if an investment entity has a subsidiary that provides investment-related services or activities, either directly or through a subsidiary, it shall consolidate that subsidiary.
The Directors note that following its meeting on 29 and 30 January 2014, the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Council IFRIC has proposed that the IASB should clarify the position on accounting for investment entity subsidiaries engaged in investment related activities, such as JLIF.
If consequent IASB amendments to IFRS 10 require subsidiaries such as those denoted in the Consolidated Group see Note 25 to be held at fair value rather than consolidated, the net assets of the Consolidated Group companies, which at 31 December 2013 principally comprise working capital balances, would be required to be included in the carrying value of investments.
This change would not materially affect Group net assets.
At present it is uncertain as to whether the accounting standard will be amended.
Following the adoption of the Investment Entities Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27, the results presented as the Consolidated Group are a line by line consolidation of the results of the Recourse Group.
The amendments, which are effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2014, are permitted to be adopted early.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED a Basis of accounting continued The following table summarises the key adjustments made to the Consolidated Balance Sheet on implementation of the new accounting policy.
Restated Results in the Impact of results Restated year ended change in 31 December results 31 December accounting 2012 before Impact of 31 December Consolidated income statement 2012 policy reclassication reclassication 2012 Services revenue 47,811 47,811 Other turnover 382 382 382 Investment income 29,310 12,476 41,786 41,786 Operating income 42,168 42,168 Cost of sales 49,622 49,622 Administrative expenses 8,362 45 8,317 8,317 Other gains losses 24,288 23,629 659 659 Operating expenses 7,658 7,658 Finance costs 42,697 41,532 1,165 141 1,024 Profit before tax 1,110 32,376 33,486 33,486 Profit after tax 7,206 25,290 32,496 32,496 The impact of adopting Investment Entities Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 is the non-consolidation of assets, liabilities, income and expenses of the subsidiary PPP assets which were previously consolidated on a line by line basis.
The above table also shows the effect of reclassication of investment income to operating income.
Net assets The restated Net Assets at 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2012 reect the fair value of bank debt within investments at fair value through profit or loss, including movements in bank margins and prospective movements in interest rates.
At 1 January the fair value of bank debt was a higher liability than its carrying value at amortised cost consolidated within net assets prior to the adoption of the Investment Entities standard, principally due to an expectation from the market that the interest would increase, as demonstrated by the interest rate forecast curve.
At 31 December 2012, bank debt was a lower liability than its carrying value at amortised cost, principally due to the rising cost of debt for PPP projects in the UK market, despite decreases to the risk free rate.
The restated net assets at 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2012 also reect the fair value of intangible assets, which at 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2012 were higher than their amortised cost carrying value included in net assets prior to adoption of the Investment Entities standard, principally due to improved forecast operational performance and ination.
These factors, together with the associated deferred tax, largely explain the impact on net assets of adopting the Investment Entities standard.
In these statements the net impact on the overall net asset movement is not material.
profit after tax Prior to adoption of the Investment Entities standard, fair value gains on the intangible assets and the bank debt, which were recorded at fair value on acquisition and subsequently accounted for at amortised cost, were not recognised.
The restated profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2012 reects the change in fair value of the entire PPP asset Portfolio, including the fair value gains on intangible assets and bank debt in 2012 described above.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED a Basis of accounting continued Cash ow statement The restated Cash Flow Statement at 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2012 reects the adoption of the Investment Entities standard and corresponds to the Investment Group disclosed in the annual statements for the year ended 31 December 2012.
The net cash inow from operations have been included in the income received from investments interest and dividends as opposed to within Investment activities in the annual statements at 31 December 2012.
IFRS 13 May 2011 : Fair Value Measurement IFRS 13 has introduced new disclosures, as set out in note 15.
The adoption of IFRS 13 has not had a material impact on the fair value of any assets or liabilities.
b Basis of consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements incorporate the Financial Statements of the Company and its two wholly owned Luxembourg subsidiaries JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. and JLIF Luxco 2 S.. r. l., the English Limited Partnership JLIF Limited Partnership and 21 wholly owned subsidiaries of the English Limited Partnership, each of which perform investment activities and or investment related services on behalf of the parent and manager which are incidental to the management of the investment Portfolio.
Following the early adoption of the Investment Entities Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27, the Company recognises its investments at fair value through profit or loss.
c Going concern The Directors, in their consideration of going concern have reviewed comprehensive cash ow forecasts prepared by management, which are based on prudent market data and past experience and believe, based on those forecasts and an assessment of the Groups committed banking facilities, that it is appropriate to prepare the Financial Statements of the Group on the going concern basis.
In arriving at their conclusion that the Group has adequate financial resources, the Directors were mindful that the Group had unrestricted cash of 24.3 million and a three year banking facility available for investment in new or existing projects and working capital of 150 million, which expires in February 2016.
As at 31 December 2013, there was no amount drawn under the facility.
In addition, all key financial covenants are forecast to continue to be complied with.
The Company completed the following capital raisings in the year: in May 2013, additional equity of 2.1 million was raised through Offer of a Scrip Dividend alternative to the dividend for the period 1 July 2012 to 31 December 2012: in July 2013, additional equity of 35.0 million was raised following a tap issue of 30.6 million shares: in October 2013, the Company raised 242.3 million of equity through an Open Offer of 218.3 million shares: and in October 2013, additional equity of 2.6 million was raised through Offer of a Scrip Dividend alternative to the proposed dividend for the period 1 January 2013 to 30 June 2013.
The Group has investments in 52 operational non-recourse PPP project companies which yield annual interest, dividends and loan repayments.
The cash ow yields from the projects comfortably covers the Groups expected cash ow requirements for overheads and targeted dividend distribution policy.
The Group has sufficient financial resources together with public sector long term contracts across a range of infrastructure projects.
As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
Certain risks and uncertainties, as detailed in the note 21 have been considered by the Board.
The Board has concluded that these do not represent a significant threat to the Group as its income is generated from a Portfolio of PPP concessions which are supported by government backed cash ows and are forecast to cover the Groups committed costs.
The Directors, at the time of approving the Financial Statements, are satisfied that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, a period of not less than 12 months from the date of this report.
Thus, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing these annual Financial Statements.
01 Overview 02 Strategic Report 03 Corporate Governance 04 Financial Statements 05 Additional Information Annual Report 2013 53.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED d Business combinations The issue of Investment Entities Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 removed from the scope of IFRS 3 Business Combinations the acquisition by an investment entity, as dened in IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, of an investment in a subsidiary required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses, which are consolidated under IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements on the basis that they provide investment-related services or activities, fall within the scope of IFRS 3 Business Combinations and are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The policy relating to the acquisition of subsidiaries and businesses within the scope of IFRS 3 Business Combinations is set out below: Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the Groups previously-held interests in the acquired entity are remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date i. e. the date the Group attains control and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in profit or loss.
Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassied to profit or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest were disposed of.
The acquirees identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 2008 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that: deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benets respectively: assets or disposal groups that are classied as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that Standard.
e Revenue recognition i Interest income Interest income is recognised when it is probable that the economic benets will ow to the Group and the amount of income can be measured reliably.
Interest income is accrued on a time-apportioned basis, using the effective interest rate of the instrument concerned as calculated at the acquisition or origination date.
Interest income is recognised gross of withholding tax, if any.
With regards to the Canadian PPP investments, the Canadian entities carry out the responsibility to pay the relevant withholding tax to the Canadian authorities and JLIF receives the interest net of withholding tax.
ii Dividend income Dividend income is recognised when the Groups right to receive the payment has been established provided that it is probable that the economic benets will ow to the Group and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
Dividend income is recognised gross of withholding tax.
iii Gains on investments at fair value through profit or loss Gains or losses that arise from the movement in the fair value of investments are presented separately from interest income and dividend income above.
iv Other turnover Other turnover, which includes fees receivable in respect of management services agreements with PPP project companies, is recognised evenly over the period of the agreement.
Revenue excludes the value of intra-group transactions and VAT.
f Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, deposits held on call with banks and other short term highly liquid deposits with original maturities of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the consolidated cash ow statement.
Deposits held with original maturities of greater than three months are included in other financial assets.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED g Foreign currencies The individual Financial Statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
For the purpose of the Consolidated Financial Statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the Consolidated Financial Statements.
In preparing the Financial Statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency foreign currencies are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each Balance Sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising in the ordinary course of trading are reected in the Income Statement.
For the purpose of presenting Consolidated Financial Statements, the assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign investments are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the Balance Sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates uctuate signicantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used.
The Groups current assets includes two forward exchange contracts in Canadian Dollar recognised at fair value through profit or loss translated at the rate prevailing at 31 December 2013 1 GBP 1.7585 CAD.
h Borrowing costs All other borrowing costs are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Arrangement fees are amortised on a straight line basis over the term of the corporate borrowing facility.
i Taxation Under the current system of taxation in Guernsey, the Company itself is exempt from paying taxes on income, profits or capital gains.
Dividend income and interest income received by the Consolidated Group may be subject to withholding tax imposed in the country of origin of such income.
The underlying project companies in which the Group invests provide for and pay taxation at the appropriate rates in the countries in which they operate.
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Consolidated Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date and prevailing in the relevant jurisdiction.
Deferred tax: Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments and interests are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilise the benets of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
The investments in the Portfolio Valuation are valued net of withholding tax and therefore no deferred tax liability is recognised in respect of the withholding tax.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income.
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
01 Overview 02 Strategic Report 03 Corporate Governance 04 Financial Statements 05 Additional Information Annual Report 2013 55.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED j Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Consolidated Groups Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash ows from the instrument expire or the asset is transferred and the transfer qualies for derecognition in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and IFRS13 Fair Value Measurement.
i Financial assets The Group classies its financial assets in the following categories: fair value through profit or loss and loans and receivables.
The classication depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired.
Management determines the classication of its financial assets at initial recognition.
a Investments at fair value through profit or loss Investments at fair value through profit or loss are designated upon initial recognition as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
The Groups policy is to fair value both the equity and subordinated debt investments in PPP assets together.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the investments are measured on a combined basis at fair value with changes recognised within operating income in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Investments in subsidiaries The Company is required under Investment Entities Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 to measure its investments in subsidiaries at fair value through profit or loss, except where the subsidiary provides investment-related services or activities on behalf of the parent and manager which are incidental to the management of the investment portfolio.
The Company measures its investments in PPP assets in accordance with IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement, with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss in the period of the change.
Where a subsidiary provides investment-related services or activities, the subsidiary is consolidated on a line by line basis in accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements.
Investments in joint ventures and associates The Company meets the denition in IAS 28 May 2011 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures of a venture capital organisation or similar entity and upon initial recognition has designated its investment in joint ventures and associates at fair value through profit or loss.
The Company therefore measures its interests in joint ventures and associates at fair value in accordance with IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement, with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss in the period of the change.
b Loans and receivables Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that are non-derivative financial assets and that have xed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classied as loans and other receivables.
Loans and other receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
They are included in current assets, except where maturities are in greater than 12 months after the Balance Sheet date which are classied as Non-Current Assets.
The Groups loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED j Financial instruments continued ii Financial liabilities and equity Debt and equity instruments are classied as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.
a Equity instruments share capital and share premium Ordinary shares are classied as equity.
Costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or associated with the establishment of the Company that would otherwise have been avoided are written off against the balance of the Share Premium Account.
b Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are classied as other financial liabilities, comprising of: Loans and borrowings are recognised initially at fair value of the consideration received, less transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, loan and borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Other non-derivative financial instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any impairment losses.
iii Derivatives financial instruments Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into or the date of acquisition by the Group and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each balance sheet date.
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately.
The Consolidated Group does not apply hedge accounting.
The Group operates a recourse treasury function.
There is a Board approved policy for borrowing, investing surplus funds and hedging foreign exchange and interest rate risks.
iv Effective interest method The effective interest rate is that rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the relevant assets carrying amount.
v Fair value estimation The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in active markets is derived in one of three ways: a Investments at fair value through profit or loss Fair value is calculated by discounting future cash ows, from investments in both equity dividends and equity redemptions and subordinated loans interest and repayments, to the Group at an appropriate discount rate.
The basis of discount rates are long run average government bond rates adjusted for an appropriate premium to reect PPP specic risk.
Risk premia are then added to this adjusted base gilt rate depending on the phase of the project.
The discount rates that have been applied to the investments at 31 December 2013 were in the range 7.50% to 8.85% 31 December 2012 7.95% to 8.86% which are relevant and in the range of those applied in the market for similar PPP investments.
Refer to note 11 for details of the areas of estimation in the calculation of the fair value.
b Derivatives The fair values of derivatives as at the Balance Sheet date are obtained from the banks or financial institutions with which the derivatives have been transacted.
c Loans and receivables, borrowings and payables Loans and borrowings are held at amortised cost.
The carrying value less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED k Segmental reporting Information reported to the Groups Board of Directors for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance is focused on the geographical risk associated within the Group.
This information is centred on the risk free rates and the maturity of the PPP industry together with foreign exchange and political risk within each country.
Currently the projects that the Group has investments in are in the UK, Continental Europe and North America and therefore these form the Groups reportable segments under IFRS 8. l Statement of compliance Pursuant to the Protection of Investors Bailiwick of Guernsey Law, 1987 the Company is an Authorised Closed-Ended Investment Scheme.
As an authorised scheme, the Company is subject to certain ongoing obligations.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS In the application of the Groups accounting policies, which are described in note 2, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the fair value of assets and liabilities that affect reported amounts.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Investments at fair value through profit or loss Fair values for those investments for which a market quote is not available are determined using the income approach which discounts the expected cash ows at the appropriate rate.
In determining the discount rate, regard is had to risk free rates, specic risks and the evidence of recent transactions.
The Directors have satisfied themselves that the PPP investments share the same investment characteristics and as such constitute a single asset class for IFRS 7 disclosure purposes.
OPERATING SEGMENTS Information reported to the Groups Board of Directors for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance is focused on the geographical risk associated within the Group.
Currently the projects that the Group has investments in are in the following geographical areas and therefore these form the Groups reportable segments under IFRS 8: UK Continental Europe North America For the purposes of any amounts derived directly from the Company in Guernsey that are included in the amounts analysed below, Guernsey is included in the UK segment.

The Investment Adviser has carried out fair market valuations of the Investments as at 31 December 2013.
The Directors have satisfied themselves as to the methodology used, and the discount rates applied for the Portfolio Valuation.
The Directors have also obtained an independent opinion from a third party, with considerable expertise in valuing these type of investments, supporting the reasonableness of the Portfolio Value.
Investments are all investments in PPP projects and are valued using a discounted cash ow methodology.
The valuation techniques and methodologies have been applied consistently with the methodology used to value the Portfolio since launch in 2010.
Discount rates applied range from 7.50% to 8.85% weighted average 8.18% 2012 7.95% to 8.86% weighted average 8.29%.
The following economic assumptions were used in the discounted cash ow valuations: 2013 2012 Ination rates UK 2.75% 2.75% Canada 2.10% 2.10% Netherlands 1.90% 1.90% Finland 3% MAKU and 2.5% ELSPOT 3% MAKU and 2.5% ELSPOT Deposit interest rates UK 1% for 2014 and 2015 rising to 3.5% from 2018 1% for 2013, 4% thereafter The prevailing Sterling exchange rate at 31 December was: 2013 2012 Canadian dollar 1.7585 1.6099 Euro 1.1991 1.2220 All comparative information, including relevant notes, has been restated to reect implementation of Investment Entities Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27.
INVESTMENTS AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS CONTINUED Whilst the UK corporation tax rate reduction to 20% from April 2015 was substantively enacted on 2 July 2013, the long term UK corporation tax rate assumed in the Portfolio Valuation is 21%.
If a UK corporation tax rate of 20% was assumed this would increase the Portfolio Value by circa 4m.
The fair value of the Canadian and European investments include assumed tax payments at the appropriate local rates.
The changes to the main rate of corporation tax for UK companies announced in the March 2013 Budget were substantively enacted by the UK Government on 2 July 2013.
The main corporation tax rate will reduce by 2% to 21% from 1 April 2014 with a further reduction to 20% from 1 April 2015.
The reduction to 21% is reected in the fair value of the UK investments and as such within the financial statements.
The further reduction to 20% from 1 April 2015 is not reected in the fair value of the investments.
The fair value of the PPP investments would be an estimated 70.8 million higher or 61.2 million lower 2012 estimated 45.6 million higher or 39.7 million lower if the discount rate used in the discounted cash ow analysis were to differ by 1% from that used in the fair value calculation.
The weighted average discount rate for the PPP portfolio as at 31 December 2013 was 8.18% 2012 8.29%.
The fair value of the PPP investments would be an estimated 34.0 million higher 2012 21.3 million higher if the ination rate used in the discounted cash ow analysis was an absolute 1% higher than that used in the fair value calculation, and 30.5 million lower 2012 17.3 million lower if the ination rate was an absolute 1% lower.
The ination rate assumed for all future periods from 31 December 2013 was 2.75% 2012 2.75% for all UK projects, 2.1% 2012 2.1% for Canadian projects, for the Finnish project a rate of 3.0% 2012 3.0% was assumed for the MAKU index Finnish construction price index and a rate of 2.5% 2012 2.5% was assumed for the Elspot index Finnish utilities price index and for the Dutch project a CPI index of 1.9% 2012 1.9% was assumed.
The fair value of the PPP investments would be an estimated 6.3 million higher or 5.7 million lower 2012 estimated 5.7 million higher or 5.2 million lower if the exchange rates used in the discounted cash ow analysis were to differ by 5% from that used in the fair value calculation.
The fair value of the PPP investments would be an estimated 16.7 million higher or 16.2 million lower 2012 estimated 9.3 million higher or 9.4 million lower if the deposit rates used in the discounted cash ow analysis were to differ by 1% from that used in the fair value calculation.
The deposit rates assumed for all future periods from 31 December 2013 were 1% for 2013 and 2014, gradually rising to 3.5% from 2018 for all projects except for the Canadian projects where the deposit rates assumed were 2% in 2014, rising to 3% from 2016 and the Finnish and Dutch projects where the deposit rates assumed were 0.5% in 2014, gradually rising to 2.5% from 2017.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Capital Risk Management Capital management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balances.
The capital structure of the Group consists of non-recourse debt within its investments and the Groups corporate facility and includes loans and borrowings as detailed in note 15 offset by cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to Owners of the Company comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as detailed in notes 17 to 19.
The Group aims to deliver its objective by investing available cash and using leverage whilst maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet ongoing expenses and dividend payments.
The Groups Investment Policy is set on pages 16 and 17 of the Annual Report.
Gearing ratio The Groups Investment Adviser reviews the capital structure on a semi-annual basis.
JLIF intends to make prudent use of leverage leverage in the context of JLIF excluding senior debt in place at the investment entities level for nancing acquisitions of investments and working capital purposes.
Under the companys articles, and in accordance with JLIFs Investment Policy, JLIFs outstanding borrowings, excluding intra-group borrowings and the debts of underlying Assets but including any financial guarantees to support subscription obligations, will be limited to 25% of JLIFs Total Assets.
JLIF may borrow in currencies other than Sterling as part of its currency hedging strategy.
As at the date of this Annual Report, the Group had no outstanding debt.
Financial Risk Management The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including foreign currency exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and ination risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, and capital risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group and its investment entities use derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
For JLIF and its recourse group, financial risks are managed by the fund managers who operate within the Board approved policies.
For the non-recourse investments, due to the nature of the investments, financial risks are hedged at the inception of a project.
The various types of financial risk are managed as follows: Market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk As at 31 December 2013 the Group has invested in five 2012 four overseas investments.
The Groups foreign currency exchange rate risk policy is not to automatically hedge on an individual project basis but to determine the total Group exposure to individual currencies.
At 31 December 2013 the Groups current assets includes the fair value of two foreign exchange forward contracts in Canadian Dollar currency.
The Group is mainly exposed to uctuations in the Euro and Canadian dollar exchange rates.
The amount of the Groups fair value foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities at the reporting date was as follows: Assets Liabilities Restated 2013 2012 2013 2012 000s 000s 000s 000s Canadian Dollar 83,581 76,723 Euro 36,893 35,290 120,474 112,013 70.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 5% increase or decrease in Sterling against relevant foreign currencies.
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and reects a 5% change in foreign currency exchange rates.
A negative number below indicates a decrease in profit from operations where the relevant currency weakens by 5% against Sterling.
For a 5% strengthening of the relevant currency against Sterling, there would be an equal and opposite impact on profit from operations, and the negative balances below would be positive.

Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to variability of interest payment cash ows.
Each PPP investment hedges its interest rate risk at the inception of a project.
This will either be done by issuing a xed rate bond or, if the project is bank nanced, with xed rate bank debt or variable rate debt which will be swapped into xed rate by the use of interest rate swaps.
The uctuations in interest rates impact the return from oating rate deposits and hence the income from investments at fair value through profit or loss.
A 1% increase or decrease represents managements assessment of the reasonable possible change in interest rates.
The recourse group was in a net cash position and had not outstanding debt at the Balance Sheet date.
The interest rate sensitivity of the recourse groups assets and liabilities had nil impact.

There were no transfers between Level 1 and 2 during the year 2012 none.
In the table above, financial instruments are held at carrying value as an approximation to fair value unless stated otherwise.
Level 2 fair value measurement of financial assets and liabilities include two foreign exchange forward contracts in Canadian Dollar currency value at the exchange rate prevailing on 31 December 2013.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED a Financial instruments by category continued Reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurement of financial assets and liabilities An analysis of the movement between opening to closing balances of the investments at fair value through profit or loss is given in note 11.
The investments at fair value through profit or loss, whose fair values include the use of Level 3 inputs, are valued by discounting future cash ows from investments in both equity dividends and equity redemptions and subordinated loans interest and repayments to the Group at an appropriate discount rate.
The basis of each discount rate, which is a weighted average cost of capital, is a long run average government bond rates adjusted by an appropriate premium to reect PPP specic risk, phase of the PPP project and counterparty credit risk.
The weighted average discount rate applied was 8.18% year ended 31 December 2012 8.29%.
The discount rate is considered the most significant unobservable input through which an increase or decrease would have a material impact on the fair value of the investments at fair value through profit or loss.
An increase in 1% in the discount rate would cause a decrease in fair value of the investments of 61.2 million year ended 31 December 2012 39.7 million.
For a sensitivity analysis of Financial Assets at fair value through profit or loss, refer to note 11.
Market risk ination risk Each investment will typically have part of its revenue and some of its costs linked to a specic ination index at inception of the project.
In most cases this creates a natural hedge, meaning a derivative does not need to be entered into in order to mitigate ination risk.
However, in a minority of cases where the investment has index-linked cash ows that fall outside of this natural hedge, the ination risk is hedged using RPI ination swaps.
For a sensitivity analysis of investments at fair value through profit or loss, refer to note 11. Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a Group basis.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers.
The Group mitigates its risk on cash investments and derivative transactions by only transacting with banking counterparties with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies a minimum of Standard and Poors A-1.
The Groups investments receive regular, long term, index linked revenue from government departments, public sector or local authority clients or directly from the public via real tolls.
The Directors believe that the Group is not signicantly exposed to the risk that the customers of its investments do not pay their unitary payments because of the Groups policy to invest in jurisdiction with satisfactory credit rating.
Given the above factors, the Board does not consider it appropriate to present a detailed analysis of credit risk.
Liquidity risk The Group adopts a prudent approach to liquidity management by maintaining sufficient cash and available committed facilities to meet its obligations.
Due to the nature of its Investments PPP projects the timing of cash outows is reasonably predictable and, therefore, is not a major risk to the Group.
The Groups liquidity management policy involves projecting cash ows in major currencies and assuming the level of liquid assets necessary to meet these.
Capital risk The Group has implemented an efficient nancing structure that enables it to manage its capital effectively.
The Groups capital structure comprises its equity only refer to the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
As at 31 December 2013 the Group had no recourse debt 2012 nil.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2013 24.
DISCLOSURE SERVICE CONCESSION ARRANGEMENTS The Group holds investments in 52 service concession arrangements in the Accommodation, Transport, and Utilities sectors.
The concessions vary on the obligations required but typically require the construction and operation of an asset during the concession period.
The concession may require the acquisition or replacement of an existing asset or the construction of a new asset.
The operation of the asset may include the provision of facilities management services like cleaning, catering, caretaking and major maintenance.
At the end of the concession period on the majority of the concessions the assets are returned to the concession provider.
As at 31 December 2013 all of the service concessions were fully operational 31 December 2012 All.
The rights of both the concession provider and concession operator are stated within the specic project agreement.
The standard rights of the provider to terminate the project include poor performance and in the event of force majeure.
The operators rights to terminate include the failure of the provider to make payment under the agreement, a material breach of contract and relevant changes of law which would render it impossible for the service company to full its requirements.
