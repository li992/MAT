Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and accounts 2013 SECTION 4 OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES continued 52 weeks ended 28 December 2013 4.5 Provisions Accounting policy Provisions are recognised when the Group has legal or constructive obligations as a result of past events and it is probable that expenditure will be required to settle those obligations.
They are measured at the Directors best estimates, after taking account of information available and different possible outcomes.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
