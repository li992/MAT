Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of 93.8m 2012: 77.0m of these losses or other temporary differences, as their recoverability is uncertain.
The UK corporation tax rate will decrease from 23% to 21% from 1 April 2014 and from 21% to 20% from 1 April 2015.
The deferred tax balance has been adjusted in the current year to reflect this change.
11 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
