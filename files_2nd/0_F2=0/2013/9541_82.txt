01 Strategic Report 02 Governance 03 Financial Statements 04 A Deeper Look 05 Shareholder Information Lonmin Plc 121 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial Statements Notes to the Accounts 2 Segmental analysis The Group distinguishes between three reportable operating segments being the Platinum Group Metals PGM Operations segment, the Evaluation segment and the Exploration segment.
The PGM Operations segment comprises the activities involved in the mining and processing of PGMs, together with associated base metals, which are carried out entirely in South Africa.
These operations are integrated and designed to support the process for extracting and refining PGMs from underground.
PGMs move through each stage of the process and undergo successive levels of refinement which result in fully refined metals.
The Chief Executive Officer, who performs the role of Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM, views the PGM Operations segment as a single whole for the purposes of financial performance monitoring and assessment and does not make resource allocations based on margin, costs or cash flows incurred at each separate stage of the process.
In addition, the CODM makes his decisions for running the business on a day to day basis using the physical operating statistics generated by the business as these summarise the operating performance of the entire segment.
The Evaluation segment covers the evaluation through pre-feasibility of the economic viability of newly discovered PGM deposits.
Currently all of the evaluation projects are based in South Africa.
The Exploration segment covers the activities involved in the discovery or identification of new PGM deposits.
This activity occurs on a worldwide basis.
No operating segments have been aggregated.
Operating segments have consistently adopted the consolidated basis of accounting and there are no differences in measurement applied.
Other covers mainly the results and investment activities of the corporate Head Office.
The only intersegment transactions involve the provision of funding between segments and any associated interest.
