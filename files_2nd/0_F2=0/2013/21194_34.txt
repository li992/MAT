The Matching Share Plan Under the all employee share ownership plan AESOP, eligible employees can invest up to statutory limits, currently 125 per month out of their gross salary in the Companys shares.
A matching element was introduced in April 2013 through which the Company matches every purchased share with two matching shares for the first 40 of a participants monthly contribution.
Matching shares are subject to forfeiture if purchased shares are withdrawn from the AESOP within three years of purchase, as long as the employee remains employed by the Company.
From May 2013 participants were also eligible to receive dividend shares through the AESOP.

From 2012, only 3 and 5 year contracts have been offered.
