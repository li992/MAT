Notes to the financial statements In preparing the 2013 financial statements, Bovis Homes Group PLC has made a number of changes in structure, layout and wording in order to make the financial statements less complex and more relevant for shareholders and other users.
The notes have been grouped into sections under five key categories: 1.
Land bank and other operating assets and liabilities 4. Financing 5.
Other disclosures The key accounting policies have been incorporated throughout the notes to the financial statements adjacent to the disclosure to which they relate.
All accounting policies are included within an outlined box.
Where possible, wording has been simplified to provide clearer commentary on the financial performance of the Group.
1.0 Basis of preparation 1.1 General information Bovis Homes Group PLC the Company is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2013 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and the Groups interest in associates and joint ventures.
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 21 February 2014.
1.2 Basis of accounting The consolidated financial statements of the Company and the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU adopted IFRS and its interpretations as adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
On publishing the Company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, the Company is taking advantage of the exemption in s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and related notes that form a part of these approved financial statements.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all relevant periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently to the Company and the Group where relevant.
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments and available for sale financial assets.
1.3 Going concern The Directors are satisfied that the Group has sufficient resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future.
The Directors reviewed detailed financial and covenant compliance forecasts covering the period to December 2014 and summary financial forecasts for the following two years.
As at 31 December 2013 the Group held cash and cash equivalents of 12.0 million and had total borrowings of 30.1 million.
On 29 January 2013 the Group entered into a 125 million committed revolving credit facility expiring in March 2017 and a three year term loan of 25 million expiring in January 2016.
This financing arrangement replaced the Groups previous 150 million committed revolving credit facility.
During August 2013, the committed revolving credit facility was increased by an additional 50 million, expiring on 31 December 2015.
As at 31 December 2013, the full 175 million was available for drawdown.
For these reasons, the Directors consider it appropriate to prepare the financial statements of the Group on a going concern basis.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries made up to 31 December.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the total recognised gains and losses of associates on an equity accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
Joint ventures are those entities in which the Group has joint control over the financial and operating policies.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the total recognised gains and losses of joint ventures on an equity accounted basis, from the date that joint control commenced until joint control ceases.
1.5 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty The preparation of financial statements in conformity with adopted IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Bovis Homes Group PLC | 79 Notes to the financial statements continued The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Judgements made by management in the application of adopted IFRSs that have significant effect on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed below.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty Land held for development and housing work in progress The Group holds inventories which are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
To assess the net realisable value of land held for development and housing work in progress, the Group completes a financial appraisal of the likely revenue which will be generated when these inventories are combined as residential properties for sale and sold.
Where the financial appraisal demonstrates that the revenue will exceed the costs of the inventories and other associated costs of constructing the residential properties, the inventories are stated at cost.
Where the assessed revenue is lower, the extent to which there is a shortfall is written off through the income statement leaving the inventories stated at a realisable value.
To the extent that the revenues which can be generated change, or the final cost to complete for the site varies from estimates, the net realisable value of the inventories may be different.
A review taking into account estimated achievable net revenues, actual inventory and costs to complete as at 21 February 2014 has been carried out, which has identified no material net movement in the carrying value of the provision.
These estimates were made by local management having regard to actual sales prices, together with competitor and marketplace evidence, and were further reviewed by Group management.
Should there be a future significant decline in UK house pricing, then further write-downs of land and work in progress may be necessary.
Further details on the carrying value of inventories is laid out in note 3.1.
Available for sale financial assets The estimation of the fair value of available for sale financial assets requires judgement and estimation as to the quantum, timing and value of repayment of the Groups receivable, as well as to the choice of instrument-specific market-assessed interest rate used to determine a discount rate.
Note 4.6 contains a sensitivity analysis showing the impact of a change in the major judgement factors applied in the valuation of these instruments.
1.6 Segment reporting As the Groups main operation is that of a housebuilder and it operates entirely within the United Kingdom, there are no separate segments, either business or geographic, to disclose, having taken into account the aggregation criteria provisions of IFRS8.
1.7 Exceptional items Items that are both material in size and unusual or infrequent in nature are presented as exceptional items in the income statement.
The Directors are of the opinion that the separate recording of exceptional items provides helpful information about the Groups underlying business performance.
Examples of events that, inter alia, may give rise to the classification of items as exceptional are the restructuring of existing and newly-acquired businesses, gains or losses on the disposal of businesses or individual assets and asset impairments, including currently developable land, work in progress and goodwill.
1.8 Impact of standards and interpretations effective for the first time The Group has adopted the following new standards and amendments to standards, including any consequential amendments to other standards, with a date of initial application of 1 January 2013: IFRS13 establishes a single framework for measuring fair value and making disclosures about fair value measurements, when such measurements are required or permitted by other IFRSs.
In particular, it unifies the definition of fair value as the price at which an orderly transaction to sell an asset or to transfer a liability would take place between market participants at the measurement date.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS13, the Group has applied the new fair value measurement guidance prospectively, and has not provided any comparative information for new disclosures.
IAS19 Revised 2011 Employee Benefits outlines the accounting requirements for employee benefits.
The Standard establishes the principle that the cost of providing employee benefits should be recognised in the period in which the benefit is earned by the employee, rather than when it is paid or payable, and outlines how each category of employee benefits are measured, providing detailed guidance in particular about post-employment benefits.
This impacts the measurement of various components representing movements in the defined benefit pension obligation and associated disclosures, but not the Groups total obligation.
The application of IAS19 Revised 2011 has resulted in the interest cost and expected return on assets being replaced by a net interest charge credit on the net defined benefit pension liability surplus.
Certain costs previously recorded as part of finance costs or other comprehensive income have now been presented within administrative expenses.
The comparative period has been restated with profit being 0.7 million lower and other comprehensive income 0.7 million higher including the tax impact of the changes.
The impact on both basic and diluted earnings per share was a reduction of 0.5 pence.
The Group records actuarial adjustments immediately so there has been no effect on the prior year pension deficit.
The other standards and interpretations that are applicable for the first time in the Groups financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013, have no effect on these financial statements.
80 | Annual report and accounts | Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 1.9 Impact of standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended 31 December 2013, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements.
Comments on specific new standards or amendments are as follows: IFRS10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, IFRS 12 Disclosure of interest in Other Entities, IAS27 Revised Separate Financial Statements and IAS28 Revised Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures all cover various aspects of Group Financial Statements but are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group.
Amendment to IAS32 will apply to the Group from 1 January 2014.
This amendment provides guidance on the application of offsetting in financial statements.
The Group is currently assessing the impact of the standard on the Groups results and financial position.
IFRS9 Financial Instruments was reissued in October 2010 as the second step in the IASB project to replace IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
IFRS9 2010 now includes new requirements for classifying and measuring financial assets and financial liabilities and the derecognition of financial instruments.
The IASB is continuing the process of expanding IFRS9 to add new requirements for impairment and hedge accounting.
In November 2013 the IASB officially removed the previous mandatory effective date i. e. 1 January 2015 and decided that it would be no earlier than 1 January 2015.
The Group is currently assessing the impact of the standard on the Groups results and financial position and will continue to assess the impact as the standard is revised by the IASB.
The Group has not early adopted any standard, amendment or interpretation.
Of the above, IFRS9 Financial Instruments has not yet been endorsed by the EU.
2.0 Result for the year Revenue Revenue comprises the fair value of consideration received or receivable, net of value-assed tax, rebated and discounts.
Revenue does not include the value of the onward legal completion of properties accepted in part exchange against a new property.
The net gain or loss arising from the legal completion of these part exchange properties is recognised in cost of sales.
Revenue is recognised once the value of the transaction can be reliably measured and the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.
Revenue is recognised on house sales at legal completion.
Revenue is recognised on land sales and commercial property sales from the point of unconditional exchange of contracts.
For affordable housing sales in bulk, revenue is recognised upon practical completion.
Where land is sold with material development obligations, the recognition of revenue and profit is deferred until the work is complete.
Rental income is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives granted are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income.

The average number of shares is increased by reference to the average number of potential ordinary shares held under option during the period.
This reflects the number of ordinary shares which would be purchased using the aggregate difference in value between the market value of shares and the share option exercise price.
The market value of shares has been calculated using the average ordinary share price during the period.
Only share options which have met their cumulative performance criteria have been included in the dilution calculation.

Liabilities relating to the Groups financing activities are addressed in section 4.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are shown in section 5.
3.1 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads, not including any general administrative overheads, that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value represents the estimated net selling price less estimated total costs of completion of the finished goods.
Land held for development, including land in the course of development until legal completion of the sale of the asset, is initially recorded at cost along with any expected overage.
Where, through deferred purchase credit terms, cost differs from the nominal amount which will actually be paid in settling the deferred purchase terms liability, an adjustment is made to the cost of the land, the difference being charged as a finance cost.
Options purchased in respect of land are capitalised initially at cost.
Regular reviews are completed for impairment in the value of these options, and provisions made accordingly to reflect loss of value.
The impairment reviews consider the period elapsed since the date of purchase of the option given that the option contract has not been exercised at the review date.
Further, the impairment reviews consider the remaining life of the option, taking account of any concerns over whether the remaining time available will allow successful exercise of the option.
The carrying cost of the option at the date of exercise is included within the cost of land purchased as a result of the option exercise.
Investments in land without the benefit of planning consent, either through purchase of freehold land or non refundable deposits paid on land purchase contracts subject to residential planning consent, are capitalised initially at cost.
Regular reviews are completed for impairment in the value of these investments, and provision made to reflect any irrecoverable element.
The impairment reviews consider the existing use value of the land and assesses the likelihood of achieving residential planning consent and the value thereof.
Ground rents are held at an estimate of cost based on a multiple of ground rent income, with a corresponding credit created against cost of sales, in the year in which the ground rent first becomes payable by the leasehold purchaser.

The carrying value of amounts due from subsidiary undertakings represents the Companys maximum credit risk.
The directors consider these amounts to be fully receivable at year end.
Receivables which are past due but not impaired are not material.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade receivables approximates to their fair value.
3.3 Trade and other payables Trade payables Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Trade payables on extended terms, particularly in respect of land, are recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition of the asset to which they relate.
The discount to nominal value which will be paid in settling the deferred purchase terms liability is recognised over the period of the credit term and charged to finance costs using the effective interest rate method.
Government grants Government grants are recognised in the income statement so as to match with the related costs that they are intended to compensate.
Government grants are included within deferred income.

An ageing of land creditor repayments is provided in note 4.7.
The Groups other financial liabilities represent the fair value of a liability, based on the performance of the Lloyds Bank House Price Index from October 2010 to March 2014.
Note 4.6 highlights the sensitivity of this value to changes in the index.
Deferred income includes 0.7 million of Government grants.
This will be released to the income statement as the Group legally completes units on the related sites.
4.0 Financing This section outlines how the Group manages its capital and related financing activities.
4.1 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Group Company 2013 2012 2013 2012 000 000 000 000 Bank balances 356 442 344 344 Call deposits 11,669 23,954 - - Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet and cash flows 12,025 24,396 344 344 4.2 Available for sale assets Available for sale financial assets - shared equity Receivables on extended terms granted as part of a sales transaction are secured by way of a legal charge on the relevant property, categorised as an available for sale financial asset, and are stated at fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity in retained earnings, with the exceptions of impairment losses, the impact of changes in future cash flows and interest calculated using the effective interest rate method, which are recognised directly in the income statement.
Where the investment is disposed of, or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the income statement for the period.
Given its materiality, this item is being disclosed separately on the face of the balance sheet.
Available for sale financial assets relate to legal completions where the Group has retained an interest through agreement to defer recovery of a percentage of the market value of the property, together with a legal charge to protect the Groups position.
The Group participates in three schemes.
Jumpstart schemes are receivable 10 years after recognition with 3% interest charged between years 6 to 10.
The HomeBuy Direct and FirstBuy schemes are operated together with the Government.
Receivables are due 25 years after recognition with interest charged from year 6 onwards at a base value of 1.75% plus annual RPI increments.
These assets are held at fair value being the present value of expected future cash flows taking into account the estimated market value of the property at the estimated date of recovery.

The impairments relate to changes in expected cash flows as a result of movement in future house price expectations.
Available for sale financial assets - quoted investment During the prior year the Group received units in the TM Hearthstone UK Residential Property Fund valued at 7.2 million in exchange for a number of the Groups showhome properties.
In 2013 the units were fully redeemed for cash.
4.3 Bank and other loans Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at fair value, net of direct issue costs, and subsequently at amortised cost.
Finance charges are accounted for on an accrual basis to the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Government grants The benefit on loans with an interest rate below market is calculated as the difference between interest at a market rate and the below market interest.
The benefit is treated as a Government grant.

The amount available depends on the underlying investment undertaken with repayments of this facility reflecting expectations of cash inflow generation from sales at that site, the maximum facility available is 6 million.
The nominal amount at 31 December 2013 was 5,000,000.
This has been fair valued using an effective interest rate of LIBOR plus 158bps, creating an inputed interest charge which is accounted for as a government grant see note 3.3, which decreases the loan position.
Interest will effectively be charged on this fair valued position over the life of the facility so at relevant repayment dates the value in the accounts for the loan is reflective of the cash amounts to be repaid.
The imputed interest charged in the period was 121,369, which increases the loan value.
The long stop repayment date for this facility is 5 January 2016.
Details of facilities On 29 January 2013 the Group has entered into a 125 million committed revolving credit facility expiring in March 2017 and a three-year term loan of 25 million expiring in January 2016.
The facility syndicate comprises four existing relationship group banks, one of which is providing the term loan, and one new bank.
During August 2013 the committed revolving credit facility was increased by an additional 50 million, expiring on 31 December 2015.
The facility and the term loan include a covenant package, featuring three covenants tested semi-annually as per the previous facility agreement.
The overall financing cost of the new arrangement is in line with the existing facility.
4.4 Net financing costs Finance costs are included in the measurement of borrowings at their amortised cost to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
The Group is required to capitalise borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction and production of a qualifying asset, as part of the costs of that asset.
Inventories which are produced in large quantities on a repetitive basis over a short period of time are not qualifying assets.
The Group does not generally produce qualifying assets.

Own shares held by ESOP trust Transactions of the Group-sponsored ESOP trust are included in the Group financial statements.
In particular, the trusts purchases of shares in the Company are debited directly to equity through an own shares held reserve.

Reserve for own shares held The cost of the Companys shares held in the ESOP trust by the Group is recorded as a reserve in equity.
During the year ended 31 December 2013, there were no share purchases.
156,969 shares awarded under the Groups long term incentive plan vested during 2013 and accordingly the balance of the own shares held reserve reduced by 581,000.
The Group has suspended all rights on shares held by the Group in the Company.
4.6 Financial risk management Group The Group seeks to manage its capital in such a manner that the Group safeguards its ability to continue as a going concern and to fund its future development.
In continuing as a going concern, it seeks to provide returns for shareholders over the housing market cycle as well as enabling repayment of its liabilities as a trading business.
The Groups capital comprises its shareholders equity, added together with its net borrowings stated before issue costs.
A five year record of its capital employed is displayed on page 101 together with a return on capital employed, which indicates that the Group has delivered strong growth in capital and return on capital employed over the past 5 years, subsequent to the housing market downturn.
The sharp market movements in 2008, saw a fall in the Groups capital employed, as inventory provisions reduced the asset base of the Group, leading to a reduction in retained earnings and thus shareholders equity.
This was partially reversed in 2009 following a successful equity placing.
Whilst the blended cost of capital is a factor in the Groups decision making in assessing the right blend of shareholders equity and debt financing, the Group has typically preferred to operate within a framework that features relatively low gearing or cash in hand.
This is because the Group recognises that housebuilding can be cyclical, and higher levels of gearing can create profound liquidity risks.
The Group would seek to manage its capital base through control over expenditure, maintenance of adequate banking facilities, control over dividend payments and in the longer term through adjustments to its capital structure.
An important part of capital management for the Group is its financial instruments, which comprise cash, bank and other loans and overdrafts.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group also utilises financial assets and liabilities such as trade payables or receivables that arise directly from operations.
The use of these carries risk: interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Given that the Group trades exclusively in the UK, there is no material currency risk.
The valuation of the Groups available for sale financial assets and a financial liability are also impacted by housing market price fluctuations, giving rise to market price risk.
Interest rate risk Exposure to interest rate risk arises in the normal course of the Groups business and interest rate swaps are used where appropriate to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.
The Group has no exposure to currency risk as all its financial assets and liabilities are denominated in sterling.
Throughout the year, the Groups policy has been that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
88 | Annual report and accounts | Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued Hedging Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value.
The Group mitigates its exposure to changes in interest rates on a core level of borrowings where appropriate through procuring interest rate swaps, denominated in sterling.
The decision whether to enter into a swap, and the timing of procurement of swaps depends on a number of key variables, on which management form judgements.
These matters include managements view of likely cash flows and indebtedness, interest rate movements and other macro-economic factors looking ahead.
These assumptions are reviewed with the Group Finance Director on a periodic basis prior to any decision being made.
Decisions made by management in this area are discussed with the Board to ensure transparency of decision making.
At 31 December 2013, the Group had a 18.6 million interest rate swap relating to debt held within a joint venture.
The Group pays a fixed interest rate of 1.505% and receives one month LIBOR.
All costs are being taken directly through income, because the arrangement is not considered a cash flow hedge under IAS39.
The fair value measurement of the Groups derivative financial instruments include inputs which are based on observable market data.
In July 2013 the Group entered into a 25.0 million cash flow hedge to protect against movements in interest rates.
This hedge expires on 29 January 2016.
Interest rate derivative financial instruments 2013 2012 000 000 Opening fair value 416 407 Change in fair value 208 9 Closing fair value 208 416 Effective interest rates and repricing analysis The interest rate profile of the Groups interest bearing financial instrument is set out in note 4.3.
Sensitivity analysis In managing interest rates, the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations in the Groups earnings, given that Group borrowings are variable in terms of interest rate.
Over the longer-term, however, permanent changes in interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings.
For the year ended 31 December 2013, it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates applying for the full year would not have a material impact on the financial statements.
Credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk is limited by the fact that the Group generally receives cash at the point of legal completion of its sales.
There are certain categories of revenue where this is not the case: for instance, housing association revenues or land sales.
The largest single amount outstanding at the year end was 2.6 million 2012: 5.9 million.
The amount is secured against consented land.
The Group retains these outstanding balances as trade and other receivables.
The Group also carries credit risk with regard to available for sale financial assets which it classifies as other receivables.
Whilst material in total, the individual risk is low given the high number of counterparties.
Average exposure per transaction is 21,000 2012: 20,000, and a second charge is retained to protect the Groups interests.
The carrying value of trade and other receivables equates to the Groups exposure to credit risk.
The Groups trade and other receivables are secured against the following: 2013 2012 000 000 Consented land 7,338 22,933 Second charge against property 46,404 45,553 Unsecured 34,375 49,276 88,117 117,762 In managing risk the Group assesses the credit risk of its counter parties before entering into a transaction.
This assessment is based upon management knowledge and experience.
In the event that land is disposed of the Group seeks to mitigate any credit risk by retaining a charge over the asset disposed of, so that in the event of default, the Group is able to seek to recover its outstanding asset.
Company The companys exposure to credit risk is limited as a result of all outstanding balances relating to companies within the Group.
c. Liquidity risk The Groups banking arrangements outlined in note 4.3 are considered to be adequate in terms of flexibility and liquidity for its medium term cash flow needs, thus mitigating its liquidity risk.
The Groups approach to assessment of liquidity risk is outlined in the section on the report on corporate governance relating to Going Concern which can be found on page 39.
Bovis Homes Group PLC | 89 Notes to the financial statements continued d. Housing market price risk The performance of the UK housing market affects the valuation of certain of the Groups non-financial assets and liabilities and the critical judgements applied by management in these financial statements, including the valuation of land and work in progress.
The Groups financial assets and liabilities are summarised below: Linked to UK Not linked to UK housing market housing market Total 31 December 2013 000 000 000 Non-derivative financial assets Restricted cash - 1,823 1,823 Trade and other receivables - 43,273 43,273 Available for sale financial assets 44,844 - 44,844 Cash and cash equivalents - 12,025 12,025 Non-derivative financial liabilities Bank and other loans - 29,856 29,856 Trade and other payables - 242,557 242,557 Derivative financial liabilities Other financial liabilities 784 - 784 Derivative - 208 208 44,060 215,500 171,440 Linked to UK Not linked to UK housing market housing market Total 31 December 2012 000 000 000 Non-derivative financial assets Restricted cash - 1,152 1,152 Trade and other receivables - 66,774 66,774 Available for sale financial assets 50,988 - 50,988 Cash and cash equivalents - 24,396 24,396 Non-derivative financial liabilities Bank and other loans - 5,190 5,190 Trade and other payables - 249,301 249,301 Derivative financial liabilities Other financial liabilities 706 - 706 Derivative - 416 416 50,282 162,585 112,303 The fair value measurement of the Groups available for sale financial assets include management assumptions of future house price inflation, and therefore the fair value measurement includes inputs which are necessarily not based on observable market data.

Estimation of fair values The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments: Land purchased on extended payment terms When land is purchased on extended payment terms, the Group initially records it at its fair value with a land creditor recorded for any outstanding monies based on this fair value assessment.
Fair value is determined as the outstanding element of the price paid for the land discounted to present day.
The difference between the nominal value and the initial fair value is amortised over the period of the extended credit term and charged to finance costs using the effective interest rate method, increasing the value of the land creditor such that at the date of maturity the land creditor equals the payment required.

The liability is based on a future discounted cash flow for a nominal value tracking the index until March 2014.
Available for sale financial assets The Group determines the fair value of its available for sale financial assets through estimation of the present value of expected future cash flows.
Cash flows are assessed taking into account expectations of the timing of redemption, future house price movement and the risks of default.
An instrument-specific market-assessed interest rate is used to determine present value via discounted cash flow modelling.
Fair value of quoted investments is based on the available price of those quoted investments at the balance sheet date.
Bank and other loans Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest flows.
Interest free loans are fair valued using an effective interest rate method.
See note 4.3 for further details.
Interest rate swaps At each period end, an external valuation of the fair value of each interest rate swap is obtained from the relevant swap providers.
Trade and other receivables payables Other than land creditors, other financial liabilities and available for sale financial assets, the nominal value of trade receivables and payables is deemed to reflect the fair value.
This is due to the fact that transactions which give rise to these trade receivables and payables arise in the normal course of trade with industry standard payment terms.
Interest rates used for determining fair value The Group uses an instrument-specific market-assessed interest rate to determine the fair value of financial instruments.
The following table provides an analysis of financial assets and liabilities that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1: fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets: Level 2: fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3: fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.

5.0 Other disclosures This section includes all disclosures which are required by IFRS or the Companies Act which have not been included elsewhere in the financial statements.
In our view, these disclosures are less important and or material to the core operations of Bovis Homes Group PLC and as such they have been grouped together in section 5.
5.1 Income tax Income tax comprises the sum of the tax currently payable or receivable and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.

Taxable profit or loss differs from net profit or loss as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability or asset for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from non-tax deductible goodwill, from the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit, and from differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to reserves, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in reserves.
Current tax assets and liabilities The current liability of 9,154,000 2012: 5,719,000 represents the remaining balance of income taxes payable in respect of current and prior periods.
Recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities Deferred tax assets and liabilities are attributable to the following: Assets Liabilities Net 2013 2012 2013 2012 2013 2012 Group 000 000 000 000 000 000 Property, plant and equipment - - 177 13 177 13 Non-current trade payables 2,039 2,397 - - 2,039 2,397 Available for sale financial assets 123 - - 400 123 400 Employee benefits - pensions - 513 863 - 863 513 Employee benefits - share-based payments 456 466 - - 456 466 Provisions 130 143 - - 130 143 Interest rate derivative 42 117 - - 42 117 Inventories - - 537 618 537 618 Adjustment on sale to Joint Venture 238 276 - - 238 276 Tax assets liabilities 3,028 3,912 1,577 1,031 1,451 2,881 Bovis Homes Group PLC | 93 Notes to the financial statements continued Movement in temporary differences during the year Balance Recognised Recognised Balance 1 Jan 2013 in income in equity 31 Dec 2013 Group 000 000 000 000 Property, plant and equipment 13 164 - 177 Trade payables 2,397 358 - 2,039 Available for sale financial assets 400 523 - 123 Employee benefits - pensions 513 628 748 863 Employee benefits - share-based payments 466 13 23 456 Provisions 143 13 - 130 Interest rate derivative 117 75 - 42 Inventories 618 81 - 537 Adjustment on sale to Joint Venture 276 38 - 238 Movement in temporary differences 2,881 659 771 1,451 Balance Recognised Recognised Balance 1 Jan 2012 in income in equity 31 Dec 2012 Group 000 000 000 000 Property, plant and equipment 97 110 - 13 Non-current trade payables 2,821 424 - 2,397 Available for sale financial assets 223 177 - 400 Employee benefits - pensions 616 900 797 513 Employee benefits - share-based payments 304 129 33 466 Provisions 131 12 - 143 Interest rate derivative 125 8 - 117 Inventories 672 54 - 618 Adjustment on sale to Joint Venture 299 23 - 276 Movement in temporary differences 3,498 1,447 830 2,881 Factors affecting future tax charge The 2013 Budget on 20 March 2013 announced a fall in the UK Corporation tax rate from 24% to 21% from 6 April 2014.
In 2015 this will fall again to 20%.
It has not yet been possible to quantify the full anticipated effect of the announced further rate reduction, although this will reduce the companys future current tax charge accordingly and reduce the companys deferred tax asset which has been calculated based on the rate of 20% substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Non-current trade payables The Group recognises differences between the fair value and nominal value of long term creditors relating to purchases of land for development and charges these differences as finance costs using the effective interest method.
The Group does not receive a tax deduction for this difference between fair value and nominal value when it is charged to the income statement, a tax deduction being obtained at a later date when the associated land cost is charged on legal completion of the house sale.
As at 31 December 2013, 10,194,000 2012: 10,423,000 of finance costs had not received a tax deduction.
The Group anticipates obtaining a current tax deduction in respect of this in the future and has therefore created a deferred tax asset to reflect this future tax deduction.
Employee benefits The Group recognises the deficit or surplus on its defined benefits pension scheme under the requirements of IAS19 Revised : Employee benefits.
This has generated a surplus of 3.2 million 2012: deficit of 3.2 million.
As at 31 December 2013 a deferred tax liability of 863,000 2012 deferred tax asset: 513,000 was recognised.

The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees in the form of share options over shares in the Parent Company.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant calculated using an independent option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The fair value is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest, with a corresponding credit to equity except when the share-based payment is cancelled where the charge will be accelerated.

Fees charged in the period, inclusive of VAT, were 147,000 2012: 144,000.
Loans totalling 1,575,355 were provided in prior years at an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.4%.
No other loans or sales of inventory have taken place.
Interest charges made in respect of the loans were 46,000 2012: 49,000.
5.6 Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Provisions include onerous contracts of 1.4 million 2012: 2.1 million and other amounts of 2.1 million 2012: 1.6 million.
5.7 Employee benefits The Group accounts for pensions and similar benefits under IAS 19 Revised : Employee benefits.
In respect of defined benefit schemes, the net obligation is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, such benefits measured at discounted present value, less the fair value of the scheme assets.
The discount rate used to discount the benefits accrued is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The operating and financing costs of such plans are recognised separately in the income statement: service costs are spread systematically over the lives of employees and financing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise.
All actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Pension cost note The Company operates a UK registered trust based pension scheme that provides defined benefits.
Pension benefits are linked to the members final pensionable salaries and service at their retirement or date of leaving if earlier.
The Trustees are responsible for running the Scheme in accordance with the Schemes Trust Deed and Rules, which sets out their powers.
The Trustees of the Scheme are required to act in the best interest of the beneficiaries of the Scheme.
There is a requirement that one-third of the Trustees are nominated by the members of the Scheme.
There are three categories of pension scheme members: Active members: currently employed by the Company Deferred members: former employees of the Company Pensioner members: in receipt of pension.
The defined benefit obligation is valued by projecting the best estimate of future benefit outgoings allowing for future salary increases for active members, revaluation to retirement for deferred members and annual pension increases for all members and then discounting to the balance sheet date.
The majority of benefits receive increases linked to inflation subject to various caps.
The valuation method is known as the Projected Unit Method.
The approximate overall duration of the Schemes defined benefit obligation as at 31 December 2013 was 17 years.
Bovis Homes Group PLC | 97 Notes to the financial statements continued Risks Through the Scheme, the Company is exposed to a number of risks: Asset volatility: the Schemes defined benefit obligation is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields, however the Scheme invests significantly in equities and other growth assets.
These assets are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, but provide volatility and risk in the short term.
Inflation risk: a significant proportion of the Schemes defined benefit obligation is linked to inflation, therefore higher inflation will result in a higher defined benefit obligation subject to the appropriate caps in place.
The majority of the Schemes assets are either unaffected by inflation, or only loosely correlated with inflation, therefore an increase in inflation would also increase the deficit.
However, the caps in place limit the potential impact of higher inflation.
The Trustees and Company manage risks in the Scheme through the following strategies: Diversification: investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.
Investment strategy: the Trustees are required to review their investment strategy on a regular basis.
Pensionable Salary cap: Pensionable Salary increases are capped at 2.5% pa.
Therefore, the impact on the Scheme of the Company granting salary increases above 2.5% is limited.

Each assumption change is considered in isolation, which in practice is unlikely to occur, as changes in some of the assumptions are correlated.
Pensionable Salary increases are capped at 2.5% pa, as currently assumed, therefore changing the underlying assumption for future salary increases by - 0.5% has no impact on the liabilities Expense recognised in the income statement 2012 2013 restated note 1.8 000 000 Current service cost 754 690 Administration expenses 168 240 Interest cost 138 50 Expense recognised in the income statement 1,060 980 Assumptions Principal actuarial assumptions at the balance sheet date expressed as weighted averages : 2013 2012 2011 Group % % % Discount rate at 31 December 4.4 4.4 4.9 Future salary increases 2.5 2.5 2.5 Inflation - RPI 3.5 3.1 3.2 - CPI 2.5 2.5 2.2 Future pension increases 2.7 2.6 2.6 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 000 000 000 000 000 Present value of defined benefit obligations 91,456 88,400 79,140 76,390 76,510 Fair value of scheme assets 94,693 85,229 76,696 73,520 67,600 Surplus deficit in the scheme 3,237 3,171 2,444 2,870 8,910 Bovis Homes Group PLC | 99 Notes to the financial statements continued The most recent formal actuarial valuation was carried out as at 30 June 2013.
The results have been updated to 31 December 2013 by a qualified independent actuary.
As part of this valuation exercise, the mortality assumptions for the scheme are now based on the CMI 2013 model with an uplift for future improvements in mortality in line with the medium cohort with a minimum improvement of 1.5%.
These tables imply the following remaining life expectancy at age 65.
Current Current Remaining years of life at 65 age at 45 age at 65 Men 24.5 22.3 Women 26.9 24.6 As at 30 June 2013, an actuarial valuation was undertaken on behalf of the pension scheme trustee, which showed a deficit of 12.8 million at that date.
The difference to the IAS19R basis results from more conservative assumptions on discount rate and mortality, as well as the additional special cash contribution of 2.8 million made during December 2013.
A new schedule of contributions is in the process of being agreed between the Group and the pension scheme trustee.
