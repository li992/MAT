For these reasons, and consistent with EPRAs guidance, we have classified the Exchange adjustment 0.2 0.2 valuations of our property portfolio as Level 3 as defined by IFRS 13.
Inputs to the valuations, some of which are unobservable as defined by IFRS Additions 1.1 1.1 13, include nominal equivalent yield and rental income.
These inputs to the valuations are analysed by segment in the valuation and rental data Disposals 1.1 1.1 tables on pages 53 and 54.
All other factors remaining constant, an increase in rental income would increase valuations, whilst increases in nominal equivalent yield and discount rate would result in a fall in values and vice versa.
However, there are interrelationships between unobservable Revaluation 3.2 3.2 inputs as they are determined by market conditions.
The existence of an increase of more than one unobservable input would augment the Balance at 31 December 2013 33.2 14.9 48.1 impact on valuation.
The impact on the valuation would be mitigated by the interrelationship between unobservable inputs moving in opposite directions.
For example, an increase in rents may be offset by an increase in yield, resulting in no net impact on the valuation.

At 31 December 2012 and 2013 no borrowings due after five years were repayable by instalments.
B: Analysis 21: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT 2013 2012 Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risks arises in the normal course of the Groups business.
Derivative financial instruments are used to m m manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, but are not employed for speculative purposes.
Further Unsecured discussion of these issues is set out in Principle Risks and Uncertainties on page 58.
200 million 7.25% sterling bonds due 2028 197.9 197.9 The Groups risk management policies and practices with regard to financial instruments are as follows: 300 million 6% sterling bonds due 2026 297.2 297.1 A: Debt management 250 million 6.875% sterling bonds due 2020 248.2 247.9 The Group generally borrows on an unsecured basis on the strength of its covenant in order to maintain operational flexibility.
Borrowings are 500 million 2.75% euro bonds due 2019 412.2 401.2 arranged to ensure an appropriate maturity profile and to maintain short-term liquidity.
Acquisitions may be financed initially using short-term 272 million 2012: 300 million 5.25% sterling bonds due 2016 271.1 298.7 funds before being refinanced for the longer term when market conditions are appropriate.
Short-term funding is raised principally through 480 million 4.875% euro bonds due 2015 399.1 388.9 syndicated revolving credit facilities from a range of banks and financial institutions with whom Hammerson maintains strong working relationships.
Long-term debt mainly comprises the Groups fixed rate unsecured bonds.
Bank loans and overdrafts 415.7 151.6 2,241.4 1,983.3 B: Interest rate management Interest rate swaps are used to alter the interest rate basis of the Groups debt, allowing changes from fixed to variable rates or vice versa.
Fair value of currency swaps 22.6 11.1 Clear guidelines exist for the Groups ratio of fixed to variable rate debt and management regularly reviews the interest rate profile against 2,264.0 1,994.4 these guidelines.
Secured At 31 December 2013, the Group had interest rate swaps of 41.0 million 2012: 40.0 million, maturing in 2016.
Under this swap the Group Euro variable rate mortgage due 2016 45.0 43.7 pays interest at a fixed rate of 3.075% and receives interest linked to EURIBOR.
In addition, the Group had interest rate swaps of 250.0 million Sterling variable rate mortgage due 2015 64.6 2012: 250.0 million maturing in 2020 under which the Group pays interest linked to LIBOR and receives interest at 6.875%.
At 31 December 2012, 2,309.0 2,102.7 the Group also had an interest rate swap of 60.7 million maturing in 2015 which was associated with assets previously held for sale.
Under this swap the Group paid interest at a fixed rate and received interest linked to LIBOR.
Associated with assets previously held for sale.
At 31 December 2013, the fair value of interest rate swaps was a liability of 0.8 million 2012: 11.6 million asset.
The Group does not hedge Security for secured euro borrowings as at 31 December 2013 is provided by a first legal charge on one property, for which the Groups share account for its interest rate swaps and states them at fair value with changes in fair value included in the income statement.
of the carrying value was 103.7 million.
C: Foreign currency management The impact of foreign exchange movements is managed by financing the cost of acquiring euro denominated assets with euro borrowings.
The Group borrows in euros and uses currency swaps to match foreign currency assets with foreign currency liabilities.
The Group also hedges the impact of foreign exchange movements in debt raised in foreign currencies through the use of derivatives to swap the cash flows back to either sterling or euros.
To manage the foreign currency exposure on its net investments in subsidiaries in Continental Europe, the Group has designated all euro borrowings, including euro denominated bonds and currency swaps, as hedges.
The carrying amount of the bonds at 31 December 2013 was 811.3 million 2012: 790.1 million and their fair value was 845.7 million 2012: 841.4 million.
