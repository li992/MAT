Historically, the major schemes have been of the defined benefit type with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
The largest defined benefit schemes are in the UK, the US and the Netherlands.
The UK scheme is a final salary scheme and is closed to new hires.
Members accrue a portion of their final pensionable earnings based on the number of years of service.
The US scheme is a cash balance scheme and is closed to new hires.
Members earn pay credits dependent on age and years of service which are added to an account balance that accrues interest at a minimum rate of 4% per annum.
The Netherlands scheme is a career average salary scheme and remains open to new hires.
Members accrue a portion of their current salary at a rate calculated to enable them to reach a pension level based on their average salary.
Each of the major defined benefit schemes is administered by a separate fund that is legally separated from Reed Elsevier.
The trustees of the pension funds in the UK and the Netherlands and plan fiduciaries of the US scheme are required by law to act in the interest of the funds beneficiaries.
In the UK and in the Netherlands the trustees of the pension fund are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund.
The boards of trustees consist of an equal number of Reed Elsevier appointed and member nominated directors.
In the US, the fiduciary duties for the scheme are allocated between committees which are staffed by senior employees of Reed Elsevier: the investment committee has the primary responsibility for the investment and management of plan assets.
The funding of Reed Elseviers major schemes reflects the different rules within each jurisdiction.
In the UK the level of funding is determined by statutory triennial actuarial valuations in accordance with pensions legislation.
Where the scheme falls below 100% funded status, Reed Elsevier and the scheme trustees must agree on how the deficit is to be remedied.
The UK Pensions Regulator has significant powers and sets out in codes and guidance the parameters for scheme funding.
The US scheme has an annual statutory valuation which forms the basis for establishing the employer contribution each year subject to ERISA and IRS minimums.
Should the statutory funded status fall to below 100%, the US Pensions Protection Act requires the deficit to be rectified with additional contributions over a 7 year period.
In the Netherlands, the scheme funding level is determined by an annual actuarial valuation as prescribed by the Dutch Pension Act.
Ifthe funding level falls below the statutory minimum a short term recovery plan is negotiated between the plan trustees and filed with the Dutch Central Bank DCB.
An evaluation of the recovery plan is required to be filed at the DCB annually.
Total regular employer contributions to defined benefit pension schemes in respect of 2014 are expected to be approximately 46m.

Service cost, including settlements, past service credits and curtailments is presented within operating expenses.
Settlements and past service credits in 2013 principally relate to plan design changes and the transfer out of certain deferred members in the US scheme and a reduction in accrued benefits in respect of the scheme in the Netherlands.
Settlements and curtailments recognised in 2012 were a result of changes to plan design and staff reductions.
The significant valuation assumptions, determined for each major scheme in conjunction with the respective independent actuaries are presented below.
The net defined benefit pension expense for each year is based on the assumptions and scheme valuations set at 31December of the prior year.
Mortality assumptions make allowance for future improvements in longevity and have been determined by reference to applicable mortality statistics.
The average life expectancy assumptions are set out below: 2013 2012 Male average life expectancy at 31 December UK US NL UK US NL Member currently aged 60 years 90 84 86 90 84 86 Member currently aged 45 years 92 83 87 92 83 87 2013 2012 Female average life expectancy at 31 December UK US NL UK US NL Member currently aged 60 years 89 86 89 89 86 89 Member currently aged 45 years 91 85 89 91 85 89 29275 SAS p097-137.

Assets and obligations associated with the schemes are sensitive to changes in the market values of assets and the market related assumptions used to value scheme liabilities.
In particular, adverse changes to asset values, discount rates or inflation could increase future pension costs and funding requirements.
Typically Reed Elseviers schemes are exposed to: investment risks, whereby actual returns on plan assets may be below those rates used to determine the defined benefit obligations and interest rate risks whereby scheme deficits may increase if bond yields in the UK, US and the Netherlands decline and are not offset by returns in government and corporate bond portfolios.
The schemes are also exposed to other risks such as unanticipated future increases in: member mortality patterns: inflation: and future salaries, all potentially leading to an increase in scheme liabilities particularly in the Netherlands which is the only major scheme which remains open to new members.
Investment policies of each scheme are intended to ensure continuous payment of defined benefit pensions in the short term and long term.
Efforts are made to limit risks on marketable securities by adopting investment policies that diversify assets across geographies and among equities, government and corporate bonds and cash.
Asset allocations are dependent on a variety of factors including the duration of scheme liabilities and the statutory funded status of the plan.
All equities and government and corporate bonds have quoted prices in active markets.
The majority of other assets are investments in property funds which have quoted prices in active markets.
Sensitivity analysis The valuation of Reed Elseviers pension scheme liabilities involves significant actuarial assumptions, being the life expectancy of the members, inflation and the rate at which the future pension payments are discounted.
Differences arising from actual experience or future changes in assumptions may materially affect future pension charges.
In particular, changes in assumptions for discount rates, inflation and life expectancies that are reasonably possible would have the following approximate effects on the defined benefit pension obligations: m Increase decrease of 0.25% in discount rate: 191 Increase decrease of 0.25% in the expected inflation rate: 113 Increase decrease of one year in assumed life expectancy: 108 The above analysis has been calculated on the same basis used to determine the defined benefit obligation recognised in the statement of financial position.
There has been no change in the methods used to prepare the analysis compared with prior years.
This sensitivity analysis may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in the above assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
