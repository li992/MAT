Financial Services Compensation Scheme The Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS has provided compensation to consumers following the collapse of a number of deposit takers.
The compensation paid out to consumers is currently funded through loans from the Bank of England and HM Treasury which at 31 December 2013 stood at approximately 17 billion US$28.1bn.
In order to repay the loan principal which is not expected to be recovered, the FSCS confirmed in February 2013 that it would levy approximately 363m US$587m in Scheme Year 2013 2014 and in the following two Scheme Years on participating financial institutions.
In January 2014, the FSCS announced that the expected levy on participating financial institutions for Scheme Year 2014 2015 would be 399m US$660m.
HSBC could be liable to pay a further proportion of the outstanding borrowings that the FSCS has borrowed from HM Treasury.
The ultimate FSCS levy to the industry as a result of the collapses cannot currently be estimated reliably as it is dependent on various uncertain factors including the potential recoveries of assets by the FSCS and changes in the level of protected deposits and the population of FSCS members at the time.
Capital commitments In addition to the commitments disclosed on page 548, at 31 December 2013 HSBC had US$401m 2012: US$607m of capital commitments contracted but not provided for and US$112m 2012: US$197m of capital commitments authorised but not contracted for.
Associates HSBCs share of associates contingent liabilities amounted to US$46,574m at 31 December 2013 2012: US$46,148m.
No matters arose where HSBC was severally liable.
