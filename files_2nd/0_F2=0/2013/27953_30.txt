The figure reported in 2012 related to the Groups investment in Outward reinsurance premiums increased due to a significant Pension Annuity Limited, a website company, which ceased trading reinsurance treaty being restructured from a longevity swap treaty to in 2012 and which was dissolved on 29 January 2013. a quota-share treaty during 2012 and also due to an increase in gross premiums written for re-insured business.

Claims paid and movement in policyholder liabilities Gross claims paid continue to increase as the number of policyholders and annuities in payment increase.
The amount of net claims paid in 2013 is higher than 2012 due to higher reinsurance recoveries in 2012 when a significant reinsurance treaty was captured.
Acquisition costs The Groups main acquisition expenses are commissions and adviser fees.
A small number of other indirect costs mainly related to sales and marketing activities are also included.
Acquisition costs have decreased by 62.3% from 2012 largely due to the introduction of the Retail Distribution Review in December 2012 which has prompted an increase in adviser fees paid directly by policyholders to their financial advisers and a reduction in commission expenses paid by the Group.

Partnership Assurance Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 84 Financial review of consolidated cash flow statement The consolidated cash flow statement shows the cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities in the year Details of significant movements in the year are set out below: Net cash from operating activities There was net cash outflow from operating activities 2013 2012: net inflow.
The movement mainly arises due to the allocation of surplus assets out of cash and into higher yielding assets.
Corporation tax paid Corporation tax is paid quarterly in arrears on the relevant profits of the Group.
The amount of tax paid in 2013 has remained largely consistent with 2012 as the effect of growth in profit before tax has been tempered by the fall in the corporation tax rate.
Net cash used in investing activities Cash used in investment activities has increased year on year reflecting a significant investment in property, plant and equipment in 2013 relating, in large part, to the fit out of the Groups head office.
Net cash used in financing activities In June 2013, the Company issued new ordinary shares pursuant to the Global offer which realised net proceeds of 121.7m.
Of these proceeds, 70.0m were used to repay the external bank loan facility in August 2013 and 7.7m were used to repay the Vendor loan notes together with unpaid interest.
The loan notes issued in 2012 were exchanged in 2013 for ordinary shares in the Company and hence there is no repayment recorded in the 2013 cash flow statement.
The interest payment on external borrowings in 2013 is lower than 2012 following the conversion of debt into equity in June 2013 as part of the IPO.
Dividend The dividend proposed see note 36 in respect of 2013 will be recognised in the 2014 cash flow statement.

Interest on borrowings New business operating profit Interest on borrowings is 9.1m lower than the amount for 2012 as during 2013 the loan notes were converted into equity as part of the New business operating profit has decreased 8.7% from 93.9m in IPO and related Group restructuring and the 70m bank loan drawn 2012 to 85.7m in 2013.
This decrease is primarily as a result of the down in 2012 was repaid on 21 August 2013 using proceeds from increased cost base following investment in the Groups personnel and the IPO.

This investment in the business is necessary IFRS profit before tax to prepare the Group for future growth.
New business operating profit was also impacted by the reduction in overall sales compared to 2012.
IFRS profit before tax amounted to 82.7m compared to 67.5m for Offsetting this, gross margins increased in the year as we maintained 2012.
The increase is due to higher operating profits, an investment our pricing discipline in a competitive market.
The combination of these profit for the year and lower interest expense following repayment of factors resulted in a decline in the new business operating margin to debt in the year.
In-force operating profit In-force operating profit amounted to 34.3m for the year ended 31 December 2013 compared to 14.3m for 2012.
The result in 2013 included a 21m benefit from assumption and other changes, primarily driven by economies of scale achieved during the year producing an expense assumption profit.
In addition, we benefited in the second half of the year from an assumption change due to lower investment fees.
This level of assumption change is not expected to reoccur.
Underlying profits emerging from the in-force book were in line with our expectations and reflect the growth of the in-force book as a whole.
During the year, a full review of the mortality basis for annuity business was undertaken.
The overall impact of the resulting change in basis on the IFRS liabilities was not material.
